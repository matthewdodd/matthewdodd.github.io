                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, and live at Plumstead. On the 8th of July I was at work at a house in Beresford-street, Woolwich—I left work about twelve o'clock, leaving some of my tools in a cupboard, and some about the room—I returned about one o'clock, and saw the prisoner in custody at the back yard gate with the best of my tools in a basket by his side—here are three saws and the other articles stated—they are all mine.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wheelwright—I live in Beresford-street, opposite the house at which Hawk was at work. At a quarter-past twelve o'clock that day I was at dinner—I saw the prisoner try the doors and windows of the house, and the last window that he tried he went in at—I informed the policeman, and he was taken.</p>

Q.</hi> Did you not say I was not the man? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I said I was not certain of you—I said the man had corderoy trowsers, and something under his arm, but I turned the prisoner's coat back, and saw his blue sleeves, which I had noticed at first—he had not his coat on when he went in he had it under his right arm, and I saw his blue sleeves.</p>

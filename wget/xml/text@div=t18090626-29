My brother went down the yard, he took his dinner with him, he said to the carpenter, when will this fence be done; the carpenter said it would be done at four o'clock, he believed; my brother said, sir, I shall be glad when it is done, we shall be able to have a bit of a garden then.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner within hearing then - A. Oh yes, he was on the other side of the fence; my brother said he should leave off work tomorrow very soon, please God, he should have a bit of garden; Ayres said, you have a bit of garden, I shall come over when I like and nothing shall hinder me; my brother said what makes you say so, he said it does not matter why I say so, if you set any thing in the garden, I will tear it up by the roots; the carpenter said to Ayres, you are saying that which you cannot stand by, what makes you so saucy and impertinent; my brother said if you come over, fists and bricks shall go to work; Ayres jumped over the pales directly, pulled off his coal, and said to my brother, come on you b - y b - r, I am your man at any time; Ayres called him a thieving b - r; told him he was a coward, he would not fight; my brother said did you ever know me a thief, I know you are a thief, I can prove it; my brother said he did not want to fight nor nothing of the kind, he had got his work to do; then Ayres said he was a cowardly b - r, after he had challenged him he wanted to go to work; Ayres then went home.

             called my brother and challenged him then, when he would fight, and called him a great many names; I was not with him, the young man is here that was with him.</p>
               <p>Q. You tell us what you saw - A. He was at the Gibralter then. Ayres's mother died at three o'clock on Saturday morning; my brother heard that Ayres was at the Gibralter playing at skittles; my brother went to him, and said, I suppose you will not fight at all as your poor mother lies dead, I suppose you do not to fight; Ayres said to him, what you want to off as you have all along, we will have it out to morrow morning, to know who is the master; my brother said if you are determined we will have it out to morrow morning. About half after three on Sunday morning Ayres came with all his mob, about thirty of them; he called my brother a cowardly b - r, and a great many names; why did not he come and fight; and at half after five they came again, with a great many more with them; they throwed up mud and stones at the windows a great many times, while me and my brother were in bed; my brother jumped out of bed to see who they were; he saw Ayres, then my brother dressed himself, and went down to my mother, and told her that he could not stand it, go he would and face them; he went and left word with my mother not for me to come, but my mother would make me go; I went into the yard to wash myself, and when I came up my brother was gone; I put on my coat and went after him directly; I overtook my brother going to the field. When we came there there was Ayres and Robinson and all their companions, upwards of an hundred of them; they were all three before we were; Ayres as soon as he saw my brother, went into the field and chucked off his coat and hat; my brother went into the field too, they both shook hands together before they began to fight. When they had four rounds my brother wanted to leave off, he said he would not fight any more. A brick maker that was at work in the field, snatched a bottle away from a little boy, went and got some water and washed my brother's face, and said my brother should fight; he drove my brother in the ring, he fought ten rounds; after that the brick maker said he should fight, for he was just getting the better of the battle; he washed my brother's face and the other's too. The last round that they had, my brother missed his blow, Ayres struck him at the back part of his ear, they both fell together; they were both picked up; Ayres put on his coat and went away; my brother went to pull off his waistcoat that he fought in, he fell with the waistcoat in his hand; he said oh, his head, he never felt such a pain in all his life; he fell backwards with the waistcoat in his hand; he began to alter very much, and stretched himself out. We went and fetched the surgeon as soon as we could; I and another lad fetched the surgeon, the surgeon came and bled him in three places; he said he could do no good for him, he was a dead person. He did not live five minutes from the time he was struck, till he was dead.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. I understood you to have said that your brother said if he did come over, fists and bricks should go to work - A. Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>Q. So then afterwards when they met to fight the fist fight, they shook hands and to it they went - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. They both fought the best they could - A. I dare say they did.</p>
               <p>Q. Your brother said he would not fight any more, but the brick maker made him; they were both of them willing to leave off - A. No. Ayres would fight, he did not want to leave of.</p>
               <p>Q. It was fair fighting altogether - A. Yes.</p>

             and me persuaded him to leave off, but the brick maker said no; he urged him on, gave him water, and washed his face to refresh him; then afterwards he fought several rounds, he struck him under the right ear; they fell, he was picked up; he put his hand to the back part of his head, he said oh, how bad my head is; I said make haste, put your clothes on for fear of catching cold; he had recovered a bit, then he slipped down and fell.</p>
               <p>Q. During this time what was Robinson doing - A. He picked up the prisoner several times.</p>

               <p>Q. Did any thing pass between the deceased and the prisoner at the close of the battle - A. They shook hands after they fought; the prisoner Ayres went away and Robinson with him.</p>

               <p>MR. BRADEWELL. Q. You are a surgeon, are you - A. Yes, I was present upon this occasion; he was apparently dead when I saw him; I opened his jugular vein, and did every thing I thought needful.</p>
               <p>Q. You examined the body after his death - A. Yes; he died of an injury that had been offered to the head from some blow, the effect of that blow was a quantity of extraversated blood upon the membrane of the brain.</p>

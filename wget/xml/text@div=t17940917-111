            , No. 128, in the Minories; I was standing in Mrs. Macqueen's shop the other side of the counter about eight days before Christmas, the prisoner came into the shop; his brother stood with him; he came in and says, Mrs. Macqueen I want some money; says she, Bothrow, I have done no business this lottery, and I a cannot give you any, as I told you before; he said he knowed that she had done business in that lottery, and that I was clerk to her, and that it lay in his power to take me away, or something to that purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. When did this happen? - About eight days before Christmas last. With that Mrs. Macqueen says,

            , give him a crown. I put my hand into my right hand waistcoat pocket, and he made answer and said, Ma'am, I never had less than a guinea of you; she said, it is not in my power to give him a guinea now, so give him a crown; and before I gave it into his hand he said cannot you let me have half a guinea; says I, Bothrow, I have got no more about me; I told him I had not got half a guinea; he took the crown and he went about his business.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you give him the crown for? - Out of fear; because he said I had done business that lottery.</p>
               <p>Q. That he might not take you up as a vagrant? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you bring forward this prosecution? - From the day before Fast day, after the English lottery.</p>
               <p>Q. When did it end? - In April.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you let all that time pass without commencing any prosecution? - The 27th of January, the day before fast day, he faced me at the bottom of the Minories, and he touched me on the shoulder; his brother was present with him; he says to me, I want to speak with you; he said he had particular orders from the Lord Mayor to take me wherever he met me; with that I asked him for what? and he said it was on the lottery business, that his daughter had done some numbers with me; so I says, Bothrow, recollect I gave you a crown just before Christmas; he says d-n that crown, it is nothing, if you have got ever a friend to send for I will take you into a public house. He would not take me any where about the neighbourhood, he took me to the City Arms, and I sent a person for a friend; the friend did not come, and he said he would take me over to the Compter: he took me over to the Compter and gave charge of me, and I remained there from Thursday evening about five o'clock till Saturday about one, and he told me before that that he would let me go only so many people see him take me out of the Compter about one, and he says, Miller, it is, stasb, I am satisfied, and I shall tell you what to say when you come before the Lord Mayor; he tells me to say, that a woman gave charge of me to him on account of insuring; then, says he, you will be acquitted: and he had money for that, but I cannot bring the people forward on the business. I was acquitted before the Lord Mayor.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after this did you bring forward the prosecution? - Directly after<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170249"></xptr>this; because I was afraid of being stopped again.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the day you brought forward the prosecution? - I believe it was in the month of April, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You have told my Lord and gentlemen of the Jury, that you first of all was a watch finisher, and then you became clerk to Mr. Lucy, and now you are not in his employ? - Because he has no employ for me.</p>
               <p>Q. But you have been employed by Mrs. Macqueen as her clerk in the lottery business, at an unlicensed lottery-office? - I suppose it to be such.</p>
               <p>Court. Has your mistress ever paid you that money again? - No, never; it has been deducted out of my book by a gentleman that was at Mrs. Macqueen's office, that acted as master there.</p>
               <p>Q. Then by your master or mistress you have been allowed the money? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it was no extortion on you?</p>

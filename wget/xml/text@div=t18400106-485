                  </hi>I live in Turnmill-street, Clerkenwell. I was in the service of George Cains Coombs, of Cow-cross—on the 6th of January, between eleven and twelve o'clock in the morning, I was in his shop—the prisoner came in, in company with another boy—the prisoner asked Mrs.</p>

               <p>Coombs for half-a-quartern of butter, and two pennyworth of bacon—she went to the end of the counter to get some paper to put the bacon in, and the prisoner, while she was gone, took up 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of silver off the counter, where it stood in a pile, and put it into his pocket—there were fourteen piles of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each—he went towards the door—I went and told my master, who caught hold of him—his companion ran away—I saw my master take 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from him, five pence halfpenny, and a knife—he said he had the silver out of Long-lane—he had an opportunity of shifting the money to the other boy before he ran away, as he was close to him.</p>

The prisoner has been in my shop two or three times—last Monday morn<lb></lb>ing he was at my house—there was a young man with him—I had sold him a coat the previous morning, when two young men were with him, and on Monday morning he came back, and said, if I gave him 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the coat, it was too long in the sleeve, I might have it, and I gave him two half<lb></lb>crowns and two shillings—it was a short frock-coat—his friends came to me on Monday afternoon, and asked me to sign a <hi rend="italic">specification</hi>of the fact to the Magistrate, and I did write it on one of my printed cards.</p>

            , my husband.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you lose them. - A. On the 4th of October, the prisoner walked in my shop, about half after eleven o'clock (I keep a clothes shop), I did not see her come in, but I saw her go out, she dropped the aprons in the shop and trod upon them, I saw it and I took the rest from her myself, I pursued her and took her about two hundred yards off; I produce the table cloth and the aprons, it is marked I. G. that is my first husband's name, I Gibbs; the apron is my own wear; I can be upon oath they are all mine.</p>
               <p>CHARLES TREADWAY sworn. I am an officer. On the 1st of October I took the prisoner, when she was running away from the prosecutrix, and within two minutes the prosecutrix came up with the property in her hand; then I took her to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had a gown, I took it off my back on Sunday to sell it, I went into two or three shops to offer it to sale, they said it was not worth a sale; I went into this shop, I throwed my gown in it, I saw no one in the shop, I took it up and went away, but I did not know that I had taken any thing out with it.</p>

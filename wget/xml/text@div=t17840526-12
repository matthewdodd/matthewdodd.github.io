               <p>Court. How did you know that to be your father's stove? - I had taken it in and out several times, the prisoner was carrying the stove before him, I took hold of the prisoner's collar, and told him to bring it back again, he said he found it as he came along; when he came to the Justices, he said a man chucked it down, and swore he would carry it no further, any person might have it that would.</p>

               <p>Jury. What weight was the stove? - About half a hundred weight.</p>

I have never seen the watch since, the chain will be produced. He took four shillings and sixpence in money from me. There was another man in company with him, but he never came up to me: I saw them both together before I was attacked.</p>

               <p>At what distance was the comrade when the prisoner left him to attack you? - They might be about ten yards distance. I never saw any thing of the second man afterwards.</p>

               <p>Do you know who the second man was? No; he was a tallish man. After I had been robbed, I went back to my fellow-servant at Ranelagh, and came home behind a carriage; our coachman was gone.</p>

               <p>I was going to work; I picked up this chain; I never saw any watch to it; it was about half past five in the morning. I have had a watch in pledge at several pawnbrokers, since I have been in the regiment; but it has never been in this man's shop.</p>

               <p>HUGGINS's DEFENCE.</p>

               <p>I was in the barracks, cleaning my things. Brassey called me over. He said he had found a watch-chain: he asked me if I knew any body wanted to buy one. I said, Serjeant Karnes perhaps might, as I knew he had a watch. I carried the chain to him; and when I gave it into his hand, he kept it.</p>

               <p>To Karnes. Did he bring the chain to you voluntarily, or did you enquire for it first? - He gave it me voluntarily, I think: I do not recollect that I enquired for it. I had heard of it before.</p>

               <p>Did you make any enquiries about it? - Yes; I had made enquiries before that about both the watch and the chain.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in the service of Mr. Bland, at Woolwich. The prisoner was maid-of-all-work in his service for five months—Mr. Bland is married—there was an inquiry about the loss of a shawl when we were both in the same service—I saw the shawl when I first went there, on the 10th of June—the prisoner looked, or affected to look, for the shawl many times—she left my master's service last week, I think—I had seen the shawl that was missed—this now produced is it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am independent, and live at Woolwich. This shawl was missed some considerable time ago—the prisoner was in my service, and, from circumstances that took place, we were led to believe she had the shawl—Kessen was sent to her lodging, and it was found on her person—she had then left my service about a week—this is the shawl—it cost 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—here is a particular mark on it, which Kessen knows—my wife was cutting some bread soon after she had the shawl! and the knife cut through the shawl into her clothes.</p>

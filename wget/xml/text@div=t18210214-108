Furzeman applied to me to assist in detecting the prisoner, and on Saturday morning, the 21st of January, I went to deal with her - one Williams introduced me to her, at No. 39, Charles'-street, Drury-lane, on the first floor. Ellis had given me a half-crown. I saw two bad shillings on the mantle-piece - Williams said,</p>
               <p>"This is a friend of mine; you may trust him, the same as me." She said, if he was agreeable, it should be so, and put a new shilling from her pocket into my hand, and asked if they were not a very good die; I said they were; and asked the price - she said, they ought to be 4 1/2 d. each; but as I was a friend of Williams's, I should have them for 4 d. I agreed to take four, which she gave me, and I paid her for them. When she shewed them to me, they were not coloured; she took the poker out of the fire and coloured them; wrapped each in a peice of brown paper, and gave them to me. I left, and in the evening met Furzeman and Ellis, by appointment, at a house in Short's-gardens; I gave them the shillings - they marked them, and gave me three good marked shillings, and two sixpences to purchase more. I went to her at seven o'clock that night, alone - two children were in the room; they fetched her, and I asked if she could let me have more; she said,</p>
               <p>"Yes - how many?" I said twelve. She said she could only let me have six. She took them out of a paper which she had in her lap, and put them on the poker, and then gave me six. I gave her 1 s. and two sixpences for them. She said, she had had good success, and had passed seven that day. I sent the little boy for something to drink; and as he went out, the officers came in, and found six bad and two good marked shillings on me, and asked, who I bought the bad ones of; I said, of the prisoner. She was in great confusion, and put the paper under her person, as she sat on the chair.</p>

            . Furzeman and I gave directions to the last witness in consequence of information which we had. I gave him a good half-crown, not marked, and met him at five o'clock, he produced four counterfeit shillings, which we marked - I produce them. After searching him, I gave him three good shillings and two good sixpences all marked, and six penny-pieces to send the children out for gin, as a signal to us. At seven o'clock we went into the Coach and Horses, opposite the prisoner's house, and sent him over to purchase more. I saw a child come out, and went up into the room. I took Heath, and found on him six counterfeit shillings, wrapped in brown paper, and two of the good shillings, which I had given him; he said he had the bad shillings from her; she denied it, and made a howling noise. I saw Furzeman take from her pocket one shilling and two sixpences marked, and which I had given Heath. She drew her chair to the fire, and threw something under the grate; Furzeman picked it up - it was twelve bad sixpences and five bad shillings.</p>

I saw Ellis give Heath half-a-crown, and at five o'clock he gave us four counterfeit shillings, which I marked and gave to Ellis; we gave him 3 s. and two sixpences marked, watched him into the house, and waited till a boy came out; we then went up, and found him and the prisoner in the room with a bag. I seized the prisoner; Heath said he had the money from her, and she screamed out. I put my hand into her pocket, and found 1 s. and two sixpences, which we had given Heath. I asked her where she got them; she said she took them in change. I went close to the bed, and heard 1 s. fall against the fender. I found under the grate twelve sixpences and five shillings all counterfeit. I asked her what she threw them away for; she said she did not throw them there.</p>

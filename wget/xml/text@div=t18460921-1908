                  </hi>. I am a coffee-house keeper, and live in George-street.

(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"Three days after the ship <hi rend="italic">British Queen</hi> has sailed, pay to the order of John Seymons the sum of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., being part of his wages, provided he has sailed in the above-men<lb></lb>tioned ship this present voyage.

               <p>commander—(To Mr. Unger No. 7, Fenchurch-street")—I can find no such person as Mr. Richardson, commander of the <hi rend="italic">British Queen</hi>—there is such a ship—the prisoner said he was to go as steward and cook—I gave him board and lodging for ten days, but part of that was for the first note—I gave him the balance in money at different times—I went to Mr. Unger—he would not pay the note—the prisoner had written his name on the back of it.</p>

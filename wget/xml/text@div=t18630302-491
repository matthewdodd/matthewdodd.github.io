                  </hi>. I live at 8, Queen-street-place—between 12 and 1 on Friday morning, 30th January, I was in the Silver Lion public-house, Poplar—I came out with George and John Mann, and bade them good<lb></lb>night at the corner of Mary-street—five or six foreign sailors came past; Blanco and Paraleo are two of them—a piece of bread was thrown at me which hit a young man in the face, who said, "What is the meaning of that" and threatened to lock them up—the man halloed out to me, "Look out, Charley, they have got their knives"—the man then ran away, and they all ran after him—I tried to run, but had not the chance, for Blanco stabbed me on the arm—I saw a knife in his hand by the light in a coffee-shop window, which was open—Paraleo then came and stabbed me on the back part of the thigh, as I was making my way into the coffee-shop—I fell against some shutters—I saw Paraleo about an hour afterwards at the nation-house, but did not see Blanco till the following Friday week.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Blanco.</hi> All that the witness says is false, I have not touched a knife for the last five months, not since I have been ashore; I threw mine over<lb></lb>board. He asked me whether I was a Spaniard or an Englishman; I replied, "I am a <hi rend="italic">Cherino.</hi>" Another man, Francisco, who was a little intoxicated, said, "I am a Spaniard." He was cutting a piece of bread. The witness spoke to him, and Francisco said, "What a fine mark I have!" and threw the bread at him, to show how well he could hit him, and walked with me down the street. The witness followed Francisco and hit him on the head with something, I cannot say what; and caught him by the shoulder and began to stab him. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>, That is not true; you are the man that stabbed me, not Francisco.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Bajadera.</hi> I was in the street with my shipmates, and the police ran after us and took us to the station; they searched us, but found no knives or daggers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Marcham.</hi> I came out of the Spanish boarding-house with Martinez, Blanco, and Francisco; there were three others behind them, about twenty yards apart; Francisco was a little intoxicated, and was making a noise. We heard some person shouting "Police 1 and Blanco came running after us; the policeman laid his hand on me, and I have had a month and six days' imprisonment, and do not know what it is for. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>, Some were not ahead of the others; they were all together.</p>

               <p>the charge was, that I might tell the commander of the frigate where they were; but they looked me up.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Paraleo.</hi> After 12 o'clock I was by myself, going to the dock-gate. The second commander knocked at the gate, the policeman opened the wicket, and we both went in together and went on board. After I was asleep Francisco Leman came alongside my bunk and said, "I have my head all split; I have had a frightful row on shore." In the morning he had got the hair off his head, and had shaved his whiskers, leaving his moustache on; he hid himself in the hold, and no officer knew that he was on board. He had a pair of easy boots on, and a blue sailor's shirt. He took them off and put on a dress-coat, black-cloth trousers, and light boots, and went ashore, and I have never seen him since. Seven days after the police came on board, and I went and asked the commander whether I went on board with him or not. He said that I did. They asked the prosecutor whether he knew me or not, and he said, "I do not know, I think so." <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I noticed as he walked up and down that he was knock-kneed—I was not uncertain; I saw his face before he ran away—he owned that he had shaved—(<hi rend="italic">The gaoler examined the prisoner, and stated that he had never been shaved on the checks and had never had whiskers</hi>)—the second man who stabbed me had whiskers on his chin—he did not wear a moustache on his upper lip, only on his chin—when I saw him at the station he had been fresh shaved—anything be<lb></lb>sides a moustache I call whiskers.</p>

I am a labourer, of 6, Barnes-street, High-street, Poplar—on 30th January I had been to the play with my brother and McCarthy, who lives two or three streets from me; as I shook hands with him and bade him good-night, something came past my ear and struck my brother—I turned round and saw five or six men—I called out, "Holloa, what is that for?"—my brother's head went against the wall, and he called out, "You vagabond! if there was a policeman, I would have you locked up"—the three middle prisoners followed us, and I said, "Look out, Charley, they have got knives"—Bajadera and Marcham had knives, and I was running Marcham made a stab at me; but it went over my shoulder, and went in to the shutter, I think—I called out "Police!" and heard McCarthy call out "Oh, George, they have stabbed me!"—I went to him; he was lying on his side wounded.</p>

I keep a coffee-shop at 223, High-street, Poplar—on 30th January I was closing my door, and heard a cry of "Murder!"—some<lb></lb>body said, "Stop, they have stabbed a man"—I saw Blanco and, I believe, Paraleo running—I jumped and caught Blanco; he had a pair of boots—Paraleo ran away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Blanco.</hi> I did not attempt to run. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> You were running—the other prisoners came up, five altogether—then Maroham had his jacket across his shoulder—Martinez had his off and across his shoulder—he did not want any taking, he followed us—he can talk English almost as well as I can, I believe—I noticed that Paraleo had a small bit of an imperial, very small—they offered no violence, because the constable put cuffs on directly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Bajadera. Q.</hi> Can you say you saw me? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—you were not run<lb></lb>ning very fast, it was a sort of a jog; it struck me that you had been running.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Martinez. Q.</hi> Did you see me before them, or was I walking behind them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You were the last one that came up—you did not run; you came up very quietly.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Paraleo. Q.</hi> Did you see me? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; and I went on board the ship on the following Friday—all hands were brought up one after another, and when you were brought up, I said, "That is the man"—I did not say at the police-court that I thought it was you; I said that I firmly believed it was you—all the men were shown to me except you, and then I asked the lieutenant to show me the man that the man of the gate showed him; and I said, "That is the man, but ho has shaved his little beard off"—the com<lb></lb>mander would not hare shown you to me if I had not put the question.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman</hi>, 385 <hi rend="italic">K</hi>). On 30th January, about a quarter or twenty minutes past 1, I heard cries of "Police!" and "Murder!"—I pro<lb></lb>ceeded to the spot, and saw all the prisoners—there were seven men altogether; five were close together, and were running; the other two were behind, and were walking sharp—I stopped Blanco and Marcham—Bajaders was stopped by a civilian—I received this knife (produced) from the female witness, and I got this other knife at the station—none of the prisoners had knives when they were taken—I went on board the <hi rend="italic">Aricka</hi> next morning; it is a Peruvian Government transport—when I took Paraleo, I asked him to go and put his coat on—he did so, and was immediately apprehended by Holford—I told him it was for stabbing a man in High-street, Poplar.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Paraleo. Q.</hi> When you went on board the second commander asked the interpreter whether you were going to take me prisoner, and the interpreter said, "No." <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> The question asked me was whether, when I had taken you to the station, I should let you come back again—every difficulty was thrown in the way by the commanding officer—all hands were pretended to be brought up, but you were not brought up.</p>

                  </hi>, M. R C. S. I live at 3, Eascott-place, East India-road—I was sent for to the police-station, and found the prosecutor suffering from two wounds on the right arm, and one on the right thigh; they were not dangerous—either of these knives would inflict them—the deepest was about half an inch deep, and an inch and a half long—they were not given with very great violence—there was no bone to stop them from going deeper; they were quite in the flesh—it is not a sharp instrument, but it went through the clothes—I think it was done by a quiet <hi rend="italic">job</hi>—if there had been a great deal of violence used, it might have gone through the flesh—the wounds in the arm were about the same, but they were not in dangerous parts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner's statements before the Magistrate were here read at follosubpœnaed</hi>—"<hi rend="italic">Blanco says</hi>; In the morning of this occurrence, I was coming down the road, and some one came and said, 'Are you Chilian or Spaniard? I said, 'I am a Chilian.' After me was coming Francisco, who is on board the <hi rend="italic">Aricka.</hi> Some of the men made a faint noise with their mouths at me and then the men began to cry out 'Police!' but I did nothing at all. Francisco was coming along, eating bread, and was wild that they made such a noise at him, and threw the bread. It was very dark, and some one cried out, 'Oh my God!' Some of them came and gave Francisco a blow on the head, and knocked him on the ground, and I was surprised. I had no knife, and I have witnesses to prove that I walked about without a knife and that I had only a pair of slippers in my hand on that occasion. Fran<lb></lb>cisco</p>

               <p>had a knife, eating bread, when he was knocked down; and when on the ground, he pricked the man that attacked him with the knife. I saw him stab him. I am sure it was Francisco. I have been only aboard a day and a half, and do not know his other name. <hi rend="italic">Bajadera says</hi>: I was walking with my comrades, and talking in our language. Twenty paces behind us somebody was running, and we heard voices cry 'Police!' and did not take notice, and they began following us up, and we were taken in custody. We gave our<lb></lb>selves up. <hi rend="italic">Marcham says</hi>: I left my lodging-house, in the Highway, with two of my companions, Bajadera and Martinez, and behind us was Francisco, who was very sick, drunk-sick, and Francisco was making a noise. As I wanted to get aboard, I was in front, no great distance off, and heard cries of 'Police!' and Blanco came up and joined us; and the police came up and caught hold of me and Blanco, and we went with them; I had no knife." <hi rend="italic">Martinez says</hi>: I know no more of it than what Marcham has said. <hi rend="italic">Paraleo says</hi>: I left the dock to visit the public-houses, and came up to the dock-gate, and after me the second commander. I had nothing to do with the affair. I went with my commander aboard. There is a man named Fran<lb></lb>cisco aboard; and while I was lying on my bunk on the Friday morning, with his head broken, and his clothes covered with blood."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Blanco's Defence.</hi> I have not carried a knife for the last fire months; the last I had I threw overboard. I know nothing about it; it was not me; it was Francisco. One of the sailors told me at the police-court that Francisco said he stabbed the man three times. On the night this occurred Francisco went ashore, and slept at the house of an Italian in the Highway.</p>

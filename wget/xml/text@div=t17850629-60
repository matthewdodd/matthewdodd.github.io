               <p>Are you sure now that Morris is one of the men? - I am positive of it.</p>
               <p>What became of the soldier? - On Sunday morning the 19th a little before seven o'clock, I met him, I had Morris in the watch-house before eleven the same night, he told the serjeant he had been with his girl to Piccadilly, and he had got the dirt in the kennel, the officer said it was impossible; when the gloves were found on him, I said them are my gloves, and he immediately said good God, they are my gloves! The Sunday after I was going out of my own house, and this soldier was going up Duke-street, St. James's, and I was going along Bury-street, I thought he was the man that robbed me, I hastened up to him, he crossed opposite the church, and pretended to look at the clock, I thought if he went up the church yard, I would go up the court just by, and I followed him into Piccadilly, and I collared him, he said, he was innocent, I called for a watchman, and took him to a constable in Jermyne-street , this was about seven on Sunday morning; he was not searched then; on the Monday morning at Litchfield-street, the Magistrate asked me if I could swear to him, I told him I was clear he was the man, but I was conscientious in swearing to him, unless there was property found on him; the Magistrate ordered his quarters to be searched, I desired the constable to take notice of an old white handkerchief, and I went with them, and the very first thing that was found was the handkerchief, and a pistol was found under his bed, it was where he was quartered.</p>
               <p>How do you know that? - A man pointed it out.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner himself asked where his lodgings were? - Yes, I believe he told where.</p>

               <p>Blacketer. This man said, he was in the same company with Guthrie; I met the serjeant, and asked him if he had three men in his company, one named Diamond, and another Guthrie, he said, yes, I went to this Diamond's quarters, and searched his lodgings.</p>

            's lodgings, and saw the watch, which was then to the best of my knowledge with both the hands broken off, and there was an old woollen cloth; this Diamond is the man that sold the watch, and received the money, and likewise was the man that received the pistol, with the words, you clean that sometime this week.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Guthrie to Diamond. Did not you tell the watch? - I never saw the watch, I have had no watch but my own for these two years and a half, and that I brought out of my country, I never had a pistol in my possession in my life, I never had anything but a fuzee of the serjeant's and colonel's to clean.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Guthrie. Whether this man who is now witness, in either respect I think he stands, only let him say whether or not, he did not go on the Friday and take this watch to sell it to a Jew in Westminster.</p>
               <p>Diamond. I never saw such a thing, nor never had such a thing in my life.</p>
               <p>Court to Marshall. Did you know Diamond? - I never saw him before, my Lord, he asked the man that swore me here in Court, whether I was the prosecutor or not.</p>
               <p>Where had you been that evening? - I had been at Kensington-gardens , I went from home a little before eight, I was coming home.</p>
               <p>What time did you go to Kensington-gardens ? - A little before eight.</p>
               <p>How long did you stay there? - I only just went within the gate and returned again, and was coming home across the park.</p>
               <p>Was you in St. James's-park that evening? - No, nor that day.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Morris. So help me God, them men were in the grove, and went from thence to Hyde-park.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Guthrie. This same witness, and the prosecutor were together, and making free with one another as if they had been man and woman; he passed through the grove, and we stood as if we were looking<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178506290071"></xptr> through the rails, we struck through the park, and got to the gate that leads to Piccadilly; these two men were in a very indecent and unaccountable manner, for me or any other person to express.</p>

             swear.</p>
               <p>I have know the prisoner Morris upwards of twelve years, he always behaved very well, and very honest, I never knew anything bad of him before.</p>
               <p>What is he? - A porter about the town, carrying coals, and going of errands, and working, I never heard anything bad of him before.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Morris called another witness who gave him a goo d character.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Guthrie. Mr. Hart will give me a character.</p>
               <p>Hart. I have known him four months, I have known no harm of him in the least, always a man that wished to earn a shilling if he could, I believe there are gentlemen in the inn that will speak to his character.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I came to speak for the soldier, he has lodged in the gallery at the White Bear for six years, I never knew him offer to meddle with anything; as to the room, there is all manner of people lays there, three or four in a room, I drive a hackney coach, and I go in there for lights at two or three o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Is there anybody here that was with you that evening, or that knows you? - Nobody was with me, but I could bring persons enough to my character, but I did not know it was necessary.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Morris. He bears a very bad character by all report.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I believe I can have a character from the gentleman whom I had the honour to serve, and a very good one; I left him because I have been to learn to dress ladies and gentlemen's hair, and he did not want a servant.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, to this crime there is a very serious defence set up, and as gross and as scandalous a reflection on the prosecutor as men could throw out; if the prosecutor appeared to be a man addicted to such abominable practices as they attribute to him, it would go to affect his credit; however, they charge him directly with being in a most indecent situation with another man, and that he gave them these things to make his peace; but then they have proved that by a witness, with respect to whom it is not necessary there should be anything further to blast his character and credit than his own testimony, for he tells you out of his own mouth, that his conduct was so scandalous, that the night before he took five shillings from some man as a consideration for such abominable practices, so that he has proved himself to be a worthless, profligate fellow, and deserves no credit; if you credit the prosecutor, the defence of the prisoners makes their case much worse, and if they extorted money from him under the idea of such a crime as this, it does not excuse them.</p>

               <p>Court to Prisoners. I am thoroughly satisfied as well as the Jury, that the whole story that you have told, is absolutely false, and destitute of the smallest foundation: I said to the Jury in the course of summing up the evidence, that I thought your defence a great aggravation to your crimes; and I think it proper to tell you now, before you are taken from the bar, that if I am called upon to give any account of this trial, I shall certainly say it is proper that the judgment of the law should take its full course upon you.</p>

                  </hi>. About August or September I became ac<lb></lb>quainted with the prisoner—I have a daughter named Clara Mary—the prisoner paid his addresses to her—I was present at their marriage on 15th December, 1860—he said he was traveller for gentleman named Salisbury with a salary of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—I have compared the certificate of the marriage with the original entry in the parish book; it is correct—the prisoner and my daughter lived together about two or three years after the marriage—I saw her yesterday alive.</p>

Q.</hi> Where did you see her yesterday? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Am I bound to say where?—at Richmond; I don't wish to give her address—I have reasons for not giving it—I saw her at a private house, and also at the railway station; she came down to see me, and went away by rail to London—she is not here to-day—I gave the prisoner into custody; I did not consult my daughter about it; I had not an opportunity—she was not in a lunatic asylum at that time—she has been at Bethlehem for a considerable time—the prisoner put her there I think in 1863, and his father brought her to my place of business—I think she was at Bethlehem about six months—I went there to see her—she was not confined before her marriage—the first symptoms of insanity she showed were when we were at Margate in 1858, I believe, on a hot summer's day she had a sun<lb></lb>stroke, and was delirious—they sent to me in London, and I went down</p>

               <p>and stayed the night with her, next morning nature relieved her, and she was quite well—she had another attack about two years after, or it might be a twelvemonth; that was not a sun-stroke—it was some months before her marriage; it lasted one or two days it might have been—she was staying with some friends, and I was sent for—she was quite well after that till her marriage—she genenilly lived with me—I am not a widower—I married again, about two years since, after the prisoner was married; I was a widower at that time—I have other daughters living with me—I think the prisoner was accepted as a suitor in August or the beginning of September and the marriage was in December—I did not tell him that my daughter had shown symptoms of insanity—I said there had been irregularities in her condition, arising from certain causes—I did not tell him that her mind had been affected; I did not consider it had been—I did not consult a doctor on the two occasions—one doctor was consulted, but I found her well before he arrived—no doctor attended her on the second occasion—I do not know or believe that after her marriage she stated that she had been living an improper life—I had no reason to believe so—about twelve months after she came to me from Bethlehem she went back; she found herself getting ill, and she went and placed herself under the same physician—she remained there about twelve months; she then came back to me—she did not go back after that—she has not shown any symptoms of insanity since—she never showed symptoms of dangerous insanity while at Bethlehem—it was mental insanity; that was what they termed it.</p>

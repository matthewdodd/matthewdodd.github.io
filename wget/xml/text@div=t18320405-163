            . I am a watchman of St. Sepulchre's. On the 26th of March, about twenty minutes past five o'clock in the morning, I stopped the prisoner in King-street; Snew-hill, about two hundred yards from Mr. Burchfield's, with this machine, coming along at a very quick rate - I said, "Where did you bring that from?" he said, "Where do you think I brought it from besides from the shop?" I told him to stop; he would not - I followed him, and he said he brought it from Spitalfields; I secured him, and took him to the watch-house.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

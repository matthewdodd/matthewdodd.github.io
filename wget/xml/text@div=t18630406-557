                  </hi>. I am a widow, living at No. 3, Cooper's row, Mint-street, Borough, and I keep an orange-stall in Crutched-friars—on Wednesday, 11th March, the prisoner came to my stall, asked for two penny oranges, and gave me a half-crown in payment—I gave her two shillings and a fourpenny-piece change, and put the half-crown in my pocket—I had no other half-crown—I went next morning at 8 o'clock to buy some more oranges for the day, and found the half-crown was a bad one—the man nearly broke it in two, and I threw it away—I thought the prisoner was a servant; she had a milk pot in her hand, or I should have looked at her more—about half-past 1 on Friday, the 13th, she came again, and asked for two penny oranges—I remembered her as she came along, but said nothing till I saw what she gave me—she then gave me a half-crown, which I kept in my hand, and said to her, "How did you like the two oranges you had on Wednesday night?" and she said she had never seen me before—I went into a public-house to see if this one was a bad one, and the man told me it was and to give her in charge—I did so, and gave the officer the half-crown—the prisoner had a jug in her hand, the same as before.</p>

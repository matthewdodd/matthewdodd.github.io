On the 14th of August, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I was in a brick-field, with a box, selling rhubarb; I had a little box, containing four sovereigns, some half-crowns, shillings, and sixpences. The prisoner came out of the field, and cheapened a piece of rhubarb - he told me to wait while he went into the field; I waited on the opposite side of the field, and there was a brook - the prisoner called me, and he laid down some bricks for me to get over, but I went to another place, a little higher, which I could step over; the prisoner then came again, and he pulled the box, which I had across my shoulder - the strap broke, and when the box was on the ground he put his hand in, and took the money out; he ran away: I made a terrible noise, till some persons came to my assistance; I left my box on the ground, and when I came back it was safe, but I have never got my money; I did not see him again till the officer took me to a public-house, where I saw him with many others, and distinguished him - I swear he is the man.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 14th of August, at a quarter before four o'clock, I met the prosecutor in Lower-road, Islington - he appeared much agitated, and put his hand to his pockets; a gentleman said he had been robbed by the brick-makers; I went to the field, and saw the stool where the prisoner had worked was wet, and a boy there called out, "Whahaak," which is a signal for a person who has done wrong to keep away; I then went to the Green Man public-house with the prosecutor, who put his hand on the prisoner's shoulder, and pointed him out as the man.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. What servants have you - A. An elderly lady, who keeps two servants; her grand-daughter and her governess were in the house at the time. I was not alarmed at all that night.</p>

            . I am sergeant of the early watch. On the 21st of November, between eight and nine o'clock at night, I came into Manchester-street, and saw a man going into No. 28, very quietly - he entered the house, but I did not see him open the door. I crossed over -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182312030025"></xptr>found it was not shut - I pressed it, and found a resistance from within, and saw the reflection of a light over the door, which soon disappeared. I said, "I beg pardon, it is the watchman," and the door was immediately closed. I stepped a few paces back, and in two minutes the prisoner Rodham came out, followed by Nignag, who I tried to seize, but he ran away - I sprang my rattle and pursued - I lost sight of Rodham, but never recollect losing sight of Nignag till he was taken by a watchman in East-street. Rodham was taken before - they both ran in the same direction. I am positive of them both from their dress, but not from their features - they had the same coloured clothes on as now, but Nignag's coat was buttoned.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Can you tell at that time of night whether a man had a brown or black coat on - A. They wore dark clothes.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was in East-street - heard a rattle sprung, and met Rodham running as hard as he could towards me from Manchester-street; Nignag was close behind him - I seized Rodham - saw him put his right hand into his breeches pocket and throw something away which sounded like iron - this was opposite to No. 7, as near as I can state. I sung out "This man has thrown something away - I hope if any one finds it, they will give it to me;" and a boy afterwards brought me a skeleton key.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were there not a great many people running - A. Yes. The boy gave me the key, between nine and ten o'clock. I took him two streets from the prosecutor's house - there are two turnings into East-street; what he threw away, fell on the foot-path, as near No. 7, as I could tell - several people were pursuing, but they were foremost.</p>
               <p>Q. If the boy had not found the key, could you have said where it dropped - A. Yes. I am sure it was between Nos. 7 and 13.</p>

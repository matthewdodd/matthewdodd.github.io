On the 10th of April I paid the prisoner 7s. and a farthing on account of Mr. Twyneham; I am sure there was one half-crown and one shilling among it - I generally pay every Saturday; the prisoner brought the bill on Saturday; I offered him a sovereign; he had no change I gave him what silver I had - on Monday he brought the bill again, and the balance was not down - he said he would call on Tuesday morning, which he did about ten o'clock, and I paid him the 7s.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a hosier and tailor in King William-street—on Saturday evening, 17th March, I heard the click of these brass plates coming away from the board—it was a peculiar sound of brass—on one of the plates is the word "Shirt" on the other "Maker"—the plates have two nuts which go into grooves, and the plate is then shifted to keep it tight—they are put outside to show my business—on hearing the click I went out of the shop and found the prisoner leaning over this basket and carefully wrapping these brasses over with an old wrapper—I asked him what he had there—he replied, "Did any of it belong to you?"—I told him I thought some of it did—on which he started off and ran to the opposite side of the way—I followed him and secured him there—he promised that he would walk quietly back with me—but when we got to the centre of the road he endeavoured to force me under the wheels of the vehicles which were passing, and he used considerable force to extricate himself from my hold—a policeman came to my assistance in the road, and we took the prisoner back to the shop—on returning I found the basket that I had seen the prisoner leaning over, with my two plates in it, and also two other plates—the value of my plates is 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I don't remember when I had seen these plates safe, but at any rate I should think within half an hour.</p>

About half past 7 o'clock on the evening of 17th March I was called to the prosecutor's shop, and he gave the prisoner iu custody—another officer was holding the prisoner—when I got in the shop, I saw this basket, and I asked the prosecutor to allow a person to bring the basket and these plates to the statiou where I took the prisoner—these are the prosecutor's two plates and these are two other plates—I found nothing on the prisoner but a brass tobacco-box—I asked him his address, he hesitated a long time and he said two or three times that he had no settled abode, but after being asked re<lb></lb>peatedly he said he lived in Browns buildings, Stanhope-street, Clare-market—I went there and was told he did not live there, but he was known there, and that he was in the habit of carrying a basket similar to this one.</p>

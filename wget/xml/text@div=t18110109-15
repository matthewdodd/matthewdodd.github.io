On Friday evening, the 7th of December, I was in the shop, a man came in the shop to look at some handkerchiefs, another man then came in and took a parcel of ginghams that laid on the counter without saying any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him take them - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. How were they wrapped up - A. They were laying in a pile on the top of the others, near the door; when he had taken them up he put them on his shoulder and walked out of the shop with them, without saying any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe that man to see who he was - A. I did not see his face; I judge by the size that the prisoner is the same person.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after that did you see any man brought back to the shop - A. I did not see him any more till the next morning. When I saw the man go out of the shop with the ginghams; I immediately gave the alarm to my father, who was in the next shop; my father immediately pursued him.</p>
               <p>RICHARD LEVETT BROOKS. Q. You are the father of the last witness - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You keep these two shops and occupy both the houses - A. Yes; the shops are the lower part of the houses.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect being in one of the shops, and being called to by your daughter - A. On Monday evening my daughter called father, and said a man has taken a bundle of ginghams from the other shop, and the moment it was mentioned, I went out at the door, I saw a man about fifteen paces from the door, he had the ginghams which we have here, he had shifted them from his shoulder to his front, he was going as fast as he conveniently could, with the bundle to the corner of Union-street, I caught him and clasped him as far as I could with the goods in my arms, I seized him and the bundle at the same time, I saw him drop the bundle, he gave me a twist and I fell, I got up again, and instantly pursued him, and at a door in Union-street, about thirty paces I caught him again; I did not lose sight of him all the time, it was a bright moonlight night.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the man that you caught again at the distance of thirty paces was the man that you first laid hold of - A. Yes, I noticed his voice and person; when I first caught him he said some man has put them in my arms; I knew him to be the same man, there was no person in the street at the time, not even of the other side of the way; I got hold of him a second time, and by a twist again, or some how or other I fell in the dirt again; I lost my hold, but I never lost sight of him; he was off immediately, I was after him in a moment, I was not three paces behind him, he passed Little Union-street into Piccadilly, and rushed up against the dead wall of St. James's church, and in my attempting to lay hold of his collar I slipped down again and caught hold of the tail of his coat, a gentleman then came up, and we carried him to St. James's watchhouse, and from there to Marlborough-street office.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear positively that the man that you carried to St. James's watchhouse was the man that you saw fifteen paces from your door with the ginghams - A. I took notice of his person and voice, I am most assuredly certain he is the person; I never lost sight of him, it was a very moonlight night.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the ginghams - A. One of my young people followed me and picked the ginghams from off the ground. I can swear to the ginghams. I pursued the man; I saw the young person take up part<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181101090014"></xptr>of the ginghams.</p>
               <p>Q. Where she took them you do not know - A. They were taken to my house.</p>
               <p>Q. How came she not to be here - A. I did not think her evidence to be necessary. I saw the ginghams as plain in his arms as I see your lordship.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw them in his arms could you take sufficient notice to know they were your ginghams - A. No, only from the alarm; I could not distinguish they were mine, or any one else's. St. James's is very well lighted, I could see they were ginghams; I could not see any mark upon them then.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that young person before the magistrate - A. No. I believe they informed me that it was not necessary; I asked the question.</p>
               <p>Q. When he was taken to the watchhouse did anything pass there - A. No; I was so short of breath, and hurt by the fall, I could not speak.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you observed the place where these ginghams were before the alarm - A. Yes, they were about a yard upon the counter, all upon one pile, and when I returned a great part of the pile were gone. When I came back I found some of my ginghams in the shop all over mud, and they were part of that pile which I had been before.</p>
               <p>- BURTON. I am an officer of Marlborough-street. The ginghams I produce were brought into the office by Mr. Brooks, and the daughter, and an officer belonging to the parish; they were put into my custody, I have had them ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. to Miss Brooks. You say you saw nothing more of the man that took the things until the next morning you saw him at the office - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not taken sufficient notice to know the man again - A. I did not see his face, by his size it was the prisoner to the best of my belief; I thought so the next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you stay in the shop after you had given the alarm, and your father went in the pursuit - A. I staid in the shop the whole of the time.</p>
               <p>Q. While you were in the shop did you see any thing done with respect to them ginghams, or any body bring them in - A. The young person that took them up that belonged to the shop, she brought them in; she followed my father out.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after she had gone out did she bring in any thing - A. She brought them in in about eight or nine minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw her go out after your father, did you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course you did not see her pick up any thing - A. No. She brought in a parcel of ginghams all over mud, they were the same ginghams that had been upon the pile.</p>
               <p>Q. Are these the ginghams that lay there - A. They are; I have looked at them before, I am certain they are my father's property, there is two hundred and ninety yards and there is a mark upon them; they are of the value of eleven pounds eighteen shillings and sixpence: we put them down eleven pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Brooks. Have you looked at these ginghams - A. I have looked at them, and put my seal upon them; they have my private mark, I am sure they are mine; I have put them down at a low value, at three parts of the price.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming along Glasshouse-street, at the end of Glasshouse-street I saw a mob, Mr. Brooks was in the middle of the mob; he said he is gone, and then he saw me, he said, that is him, I will swear to him.</p>

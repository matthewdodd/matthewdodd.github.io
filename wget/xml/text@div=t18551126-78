                  </hi>. I am a sawyer, in the Royal Arsenal, at Woolwich. On Saturday night, 20th Oct., I was in the Bugle Horn, at Charlton—there was a crowd in front of the bar, and in passing through the crowd I felt something at my waistcoat pocket—I turned, and saw the prisoner jerk my watch from my waistcoat pocket—I saw it in his hand—I could not get hold of that hand that had the watch—he jerked it over the crowd, and said, "Over, over," and I saw him pass the watch into some man's hand, but who it was I could not say—Mr. Donnelly was with me at the time, and with his assistance I took the prisoner outside—Donnelly told him, if he would give up the watch, he would let him go—the prisoner said he wished his friend was there—the officer came up and took him.</p>

               <p>had given the watch away—Donnolly assisted me in laying hold of him—he saw the watch passed over, and assisted me in holding the prisoner—I did not, before the watch passed away, lay hold of the prisoner's hand—I could not—I had hold of his coat, his left shoulder—I did not take his hand, and say there was something hard in it—I charged him with stealing my watch—he denied that he was the person who had taken it—before he was taken out of the crowd he said that he did not take it—I was examined twice before the Magistrate—I have never said that I did not see the face of the person who took it—I have been paying a visit to the relatives of the prisoner, by their request—the policeman introduced them to me outside the door of the police court, and said, "This is the sister and mother"—it was in Green End, near the Elephant and Castle—I was just coming out of the police court, and met the policeman there—I did not tell the sister that if she would give me the value of the watch I would not prosecute him—I said, "All that I want is my watch"—the sister wished me not to appear against him, not to prosecute him—I said, "It will do me no good whether I prosecute him or transport him; all I want is my watch or the value of my watch "—she would not accede to it—she said she believed her brother was innocent—I went afterwards to the brother's house, not to the sister's—I had a note from the sister, requesting me to go—I did not, on that occasion, offer to take 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or three guineas, and forego the prosecution—they offered me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and a written note if I would not do it—I said I could not do it—I went there to answer the request of the note.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a porter in the Royal Arsenal. I went with the last witness that evening to the Bugle Horn, at Charlton—I saw what passed when he was endeavouring to get through the crowd—I saw the watch in the prisoner's hand—he passed it to some other person—when he had it in his hand, he said, "Over, over," and the word was passed all round by eight or nine different voices—we got him out, and I told him if he would give up the watch we would let him go—he said he wished his friend was there.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When you saw the watch in his hand, you laid hold of his arm? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I do not know that I laid hold of his hand—to the best of my belief, I did not—I did not open his hand, and find that he had only a heavy ring—I do not know whether he had a ring or not—I had been with the prosecutor all the evening, for the last two hours perhaps—I believe the prisoner, on being taken, said that he was innocent, and that we were mistaken, and he was not the man—there was a crowd, but I believe amongst their own party.</p>

               <p>I am one of the gate-keepers at Battle-bridge turnpike; on Monday, about twelve at noon, the prisoner came up to the gate, riding a horse without a bridle or saddle; I asked him what he was going to do with him; he said, he was going to sell it; we agreed, and I gave him fifteen shillings and a pot of beer for it; I put him to the side of the road, to the grass; he eat there I suppose for two hours; after he had been there that time, he could not move; and when I found he could not do any business, I sent to Mincher, a horse-boiler, and sold it to him for a guinea and six-pence.</p>
               <p>How came you to buy the horse of this man? - He said, he was going to sell him; and asked a pound for it.</p>
               <p>Was not the horse worth more money? - No; not to my judgment.</p>

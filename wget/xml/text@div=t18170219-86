            . I am a linen-draper, in Bishopsgate-street. On the 23rd of January, the prisoner came to my shop about four o'clock in the afternoon, and asked for some handkerchiefs - I asked him 2s. for one; he offered me 1s. 6d. for it - I refused to take it. He desired me to cut one off. I asked him for the money - He put a 3s. token in my hand; a person came in, and told me to detain him and the token-(looking at one)-this is the token he offered me. The officer took him - He struck the officer, and tried to escape.</p>

            . I am a constable. I went into Pratt's shop; the prosecutor gave the prisoner into my charge - He struck me and hurt me very much.</p>
               <p>THOMAS SAPWELL. I am a beadle. I went into Pratt's shop and took the prisoner. I searched him, and found 3s. 8d. in loose copper in his pockets, and a 5s. paper of halfpence, and seven 1s. 6d. tokens, all good, and a counterfeit shilling (looking at one)-that is it. He behaved very violent.</p>
               <p>VALENTINE TOONE. I am a hosier, and live in Bishopsgate-street, about twenty doors from Mr. Pratt. On the 29th of January, the prisoner came into my shop, about four o'clock in the afternoon - He asked the price of some stockings, and gave me a 3s. token - I told him it was bad; he took it up and went out with it, and brought me another. I watched him into Twell's, and told Sapwell of it.</p>
               <p>GRIFFITH EDWARDS. I am shopman to Mr. Twell, in Bishopsgate-street. On the 29th of January, about four o'clock, the prisoner came into our shop and looked at a handkerchief, which came to 2s.; he tendered me a 3s. token. I told him it was bad, and asked him if he had got another - He said, No, and went away.</p>

            . I live in Red Lion-street, Spitalfields. On the 29th of January, I was at a public-house, and saw the prisoner there; he had some beer, and tendered a 3s. piece; the man said it was bad, and I saw it was bad; he said he had no more money, except two-pence-halfpenny, and the man took it for the beer, which was one farthing short. I afterwards watched him into several shops.</p>
               <p>MR. JAMES THURGOOD. The token resembles those issued by the Bank-it is counterfeit-the shilling also is counterfeit-it is only washed; they have never been in circulation.</p>

               <p>ANN FEAR. I am a maried woman, and know the prisoners. I have known Weller since the 11th of July; on that day I saw him at the Cooper's Arms, Atfield-street, Golden-lane. I went there to purchase a forged 1l. note - I had received instructions for that purpose from the Solicitor of the Bank. I saw a boy there and inquired for Weller, he came to the bar to me-nobody else was present. I told him I had a watch to sell, and asked 18s. for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you introduced yourself to him by any name - A. I said my name was Fear; he said he recollected the name. I then said, I understood he could let me have some queer notes (meaning forged) - He said he could. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181809090021"></xptr>asked him if he would let me have two for the watch? he said he would, and told me to sit down, and he would go and fetch them and bring them to me. He went backwards, and was absent nearly half an hour. I sent the boy belonging to the house for him; he came, and I asked him if he had not forgot me? He said No; but the woman was out, and he could not get them directly, but she would not be long. He went away, and I went out to my friend,

            , who was in the street (he married my husband's sister). I found him at the top of Atfield-street, which leads into Goswell-street; he had come as far as that with me, and I had left him waiting there while I went to the Cooper's Arms. I then returned to the Cooper's Arms, leaving Guy at the top of the street. In about five minutes, I saw Weller; he gave me two 1l. notes, and I gave him the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with him besides - A. I asked him what was his usual price for the notes? he said 8s. each. I asked him if I could be supplied at any time? he said Yes; I should find him there, and if not, the landlord would send for him. We parted, and I found Guy where I had left him. We went to the Bank together, and gave Mr. Christmas the two notes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you next see Weller - A. On the 14th of July; Guy went with me. I left him at the top of the street - we could see each other from the door of the house. I went to the Cooper's Arms, saw Weller, and asked him if he would let me have two more? he said he would in about half an hour, and asked me if I would wait? I said I had further to go, and would call again. I left him, found Guy where I had left him, and returned in about half an hour, leaving Guy as before. I looked into the skittle-ground, which is at the back of the house, and saw Weller there - I went into the back-parlour with him; there was a man asleep on the bench. I asked him who he was? he told me not to mind, it was all right. He then put two 1l. notes on the table, which he took out of his breeches-pocket; I gave him 16s. in silver for them, folded them up, and put them into my pocket. He asked me when I thought I should want some more? I said I thought I should be able to take half a score on the Saturday following, and asked him if he would let me have them for less? he said he would let me have them for 7s. 6d. each. I appointed to be there at ten o'clock for them. I then went to the Bank, but not finding Mr. Christmas, I kept them in my pocket till the next morning, when I gave them to Mr. Christmas, at a public-house in the Old Bailey. I had been to the Bank for him, but could not find him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to Weller on the Saturday following - A. Yes, at ten o'clock, as nearly as possible; Guy went with me, and I left him as before. I saw Weller in the skittle-ground - He came to me in the passage. I asked him if he had got them ready? he made no answer, but went into the skittle-ground; he returned into the passage in about two minutes, followed by the prisoner, Cashman; we all three went into the back-parlour, and sat down - They rang the bell, and called for sixpennyworth of shrub and water. Cashman then asked me how many I wanted? Weller was present - I told him half a score. He then asked for the money; I told him I had got it all right, and when he brought the notes I would give it to him; he said I must give him the money first, as it was a rule among them to have the money first, in case it should be marked, that they might put it away before they fetched the notes. I said they were both strangers to me, that it was all the money I had, and did not like to give them the money till I had the notes. Cashman said I need not be afraid, for it was Weller I was dealing with, and he would wait in the room while Weller went for the notes. I said I did not like to deliver the money till I had the notes. He said, if I was afraid I should have them, as they were then in the room. He put his hand into his breeches-pocket, and pulled something out, which I thought were the notes; it looked like paper. I then put two 1l. notes, and 1l. 15s. in silver on the table; Cashman took it up, looked at it, put it into his pocket, and said I must wait while he fetched them, and that he should not be gone above five minutes. Weller was present the whole of the time. Cashman went out, leaving me with Weller - He was gone nearly half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. While he was gone, had you any conversation with Weller - A. Yes; he asked me if I wanted any 5l. notes! I said I knew a man who had asked about some. He said he would let me have some at 30s. each, and I might charge 50s. I said I should see him on Sunday-nothing more passed. I told him it was a long way to come, and asked if he could bring them nearer? he said he could not bring them any where but there, as a young man, whom he had served nearly seven months, asked him to bring three to a certain house, and when he came there two officers were ready for him; that he was detected, and tried last Sessions, and since that he had been more careful, and would not deliver them any where else. I do not know that any thing else passed till Cashman returned.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed then - A. He came in, took off his hat, and took the notes out of it - They were, done up carelessly in a piece of brown paper. He threw the paper on the ground, and gave Weller the notes, Weller then gave them to me. They both said, if I came on Sunday I could see them there - I appointed Monday morning, at ten o'clock. I left them, and found Guy where I had left him. We went to the Bank, and gave Mr. Christmas the notes. I saw him open them, count and mark them.</p>
               <p>Q. On Monday morning did you go according to appointment - A. Yes; I went alone, and saw the prisoners together at the Cooper's Arms, public-house, and told them I had seen the man who wanted the notes, and asked them if they would see him and deal with him themselves, for I had told him where to come to them, and asked if they would charge him 2l. each for the 5l. notes, as he would not give more, and they must give me 2s. out of it. They both heard this, and asked me if the man would trust me with the money? I said it was probable that he would, but I had much rather they would deal with him themselves. They both told me to bring the man to any house in Goswell-street, and they would see him. I left them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a man named Sellers - A. Yes, I believe he is an officer. I met him at the Cart and Horse, public-house, at the corner of Sutton-street, Goswell-street, next morning; the Bank Solicitor introduced him to me; he was dressed in a brown coat and top-boots. I left him there, and went to the Cooper's Arms, which is about two minutes walk. I saw Weller first, told him I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181809090022"></xptr>had left the man in Goswell-street, and asked him if he would go with me to see him? Cashman then came in, and asked me how many I wanted? I told him Weller was going to see the man himself. Cashman asked me how many I thought he wanted? I said, I believed he wanted six 5l. notes, but Weller was going to him. Cashman asked Weller if he was going? he said, Yes. Cashman said, "Make haste. and I will get them ready." I took Weller to the Cart and Horse, public-house, and introduced him to Sellers. I said to Sellers, "Here is the young man, will you speak to him? Sellers said, "I suppose you know what I want?" Weller said Yes. Sellers asked him how much the 5l. notes were a piece? he said 2l. Sellers said it was a long price, as he had never given more than 35s., but he did not mind, if they were good ones. He looked towards me, to know what sort they were. I said I could say nothing of the 5l. notes, as I had never seen any of then, but the 1l. notes he had seen. Sellers than said, if they were as good as the 1l. he did not care. He then asked him what he should give him for half a score of 1l. notes? he said 9s. each, which was agreed to.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing said about the money being paid - A.Sellers agreed to take four 5l. notes at 2l. each, and ten 1l. notes at 9s. each. Weller said he must have the money first. Sellers said, he thought it was time enough when he brought the notes-Wellers said he must have the money first, and that he would not bring them there, but I must fetch them as usual. Sellers gave Weller twelve 1l. notes. He looked at them, and asked Sellers if he should know any of them again if they were not all right? He said he should not, but that he would change any he disliked. Weller said he always had my money first, and that Sellers need not he afraid - I then said it was so. Weller took the notes from Sellers, doubled them up, and gave them to me, telling me to come with him - He told Sellers he should not be gone long, and that he should have the notes within half an hour. I went with him to near the top of Atfield-street, he then asked me if I knew the way to the Cooper's Arms? I said Yes. He left me and went to the left, which would lead to the back of the Cooper's Arms. When I got there, I met Cashman in the passage - He asked me how many the man wanted? I told him four 5l. and ten 1l. notes. He asked me for the money, I gave it to him. He asked me if I had taken my difference out of it? I said I had not had time to reckon it. Weller came in at that moment from the back of the house. Cashman asked him how many the man wanted, he told him. He asked Weller where I was going to wait for them? he said there. Cashman said I had better not, as the house was so full. Weller told me to go back to Sellers, and when he had got them he would come and tell me. I asked him for my difference. Weller said he would reckon it, and bring it with the other notes. I returned to Sellers, and remained with him nearly an hour, but Weller did not come. I returned to the Cooper's Arms, and saw him in company with another man, whom I did not know. I asked him how much longer we were to wait? he said Cashman would not be at the Cooper's Arms for a quarter of an hour, but as soon as he came he(Weller) would come, and let me know. I returned and waited nearly another hour - He did not come. I went again to the Cooper's Arms, and saw Cashman; he asked me if I had seen Weller? I said I had not. He said he did not know what he meant to do, for he had got the money, and, he believed, was looking after me. I then saw Weller in the skittle-ground, and told Cashman he was there, he went to him. Weller came to me, and asked me if I would take them? I said, "As you like." He then went to Cashman, in the skittle-ground - They both stood talking to another man for three or four minutes. Weller then came to me, and told me to tell the man to come for them himself, as he should not deliver them unless he did. I said I did not think he would come, but I would tell him. I went and informed Sellers - He sent me back. I told Weller to give me either the money or the notes, for the man would not come there for them, and would look to me for his money. Weller said he might for what he cared, for he did not take the money of me, I had given it to Cashman - He said he should not have either unless he came for them himself, and he must not come there to catch flats, and that I myself ought to have known better. He told me to ask Sellers if he did not know one Flecknoe. I returned, and informed Sellers.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. You are a married woman - A. Yes; my husband was transported for passing had notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Has nothing been said to induce you to belive that he would be pardoned if you convicted the prisoners - A. Nothing of the kind ever passed. I do it to detest those who would lead others into it.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, is Guy married to your sister-in-law - A. I cannot say - I have heard him say his wife lives at Wandsworth, and keeps a butcher's-shop; he and my sister-in-law pass as man and wife, and have done so for four years or more. He lives in Prince's-row, Lambeth - I live in Oakley-street, Westminster-road, and go out ironing.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not expect to be paid for this - A. I expect to he paid for my loss of time, nothing else.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you get the money to buy the notes - A. From Mr. Christmas. Guy gave me the notes to buy the ten 1l. notes; Sellers furnished the 12l.</p>
               <p>Q. The notes, at the price you mention, would come to 12l. 10s. - A. We afterwards found we had reckoned it short.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not examined in private - A. I gave my deposition at the Bank, it was afterwards read over to the prisoner at the office.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. REYNOLDS. Q. Was it your money or Sellers's - A. Sellers's. I was afterwards examined before the magistrate, the prisoners were not present, but their attorneys and counsel were. What I said at the Bank was read over to the prisoners.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH GUY. I was formerly a butcher at Chelsea, and after that I was an occasional constable of Queen-square; I am now living with a woman at Princes-row, Kenington-cross. On the 11th of July, I was sent with Fear to Atfield-street, she went into the Cooper's Arms, and returned to me in a few minutes - She went back again there. She came out, we then went to the Bank, where she produced the two 1l. notes and gave them to Mr. Christmas. On the 14th we went there again, I re<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181809090023"></xptr>mained outside; she then came out and we walked about for near half an hour - She then went in again, came out and went to the Bank with me. On the 16th we went to the Bank and enquired for Mr. Christmas, we found him in the Old Bailey; she gave him two 1l. notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go with her to the Cooper's Arms again - A. No; I went into the other house on the 18th, remained there about an hour when she came in; I knew the prisoners, I did not see her with them there - I believe she went into the parlour, I heard her voice there. I saw Cashman go to the bar-door and tell the landlord if he should be wanted he should return in half an hour, which he did, and went down the passage leading to the parlour. I remained and saw her go out, and joined her in about ten minutes - We went to the Bank, she gave Mr. Christmas ten 1l. notes. I went on the 21st with her to the Cart and Horse; Sellers was there first, dressed in a brown coat, top-boots and spurs, and had a horse. I remained in the house exactly opposite so as to see the entrance. I saw Fear go out towards Atfield-street, and return with Weller he stopped and looked at the horse and then went in; they came out together in about a quarter of an hour, and went towards Atfield-street; I saw Fear go in again.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Was not your business at Queen-square Office as an informer against hawkers and pedlers - A. No; I was constable there.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you ever in custody - A. I was put in Tothillfields one night and came out next morning. Fear is no relative of mine, her sister lives with me; my wife is at Wandsworth-Fear might know that, I think she did.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see your wife last - A. About four years ago. I told the Bank solicitors what I had found out; they said if I could bring such things to bear as what I told them, to bring the persons.</p>
               <p>Q. Is money an object to you - A. Sometimes - I am not short now. The father of the woman I live with has supplied me.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not received money from the agents of the Bank - A. I have not, nor the promise of any.</p>

            . I am constable of Mary-le-bone - I live in Bell-street. In July last, I was employed by the Bank; I went to the Cart and Horse, Goswell-street, in consequence of an arrangeement between me and Mrs. Fear. I went there on horse-back, and had on boots and a great coat, dressed like a horse dealer. She came to me in five minutes; after that the prisoner Weller came in - I asked him to drink, and then asked Fear if that was the young man? she said, Yes. I said to Weller, "I suppose you know what I want?" he said, Yes. I asked him if he had got any with him? he said, No, he always had the money first. I asked what I was to give him a piece for the 5l. notes? he said 40s., and 9s. for the 1l. notes. I said it was a great price, for I had never given above 35s. He said he would not take less, and he always had the money first. I looked at Mrs. Fear and said, I did not mind the price if they were good. She said she never saw the 5l. notes, but I had seen the 1l. notes. I said if they were as good as the ones, I did not mind the price. I looked at Weller, and said, I hoped all was right? He said,"It was all right, for he always had Mrs. Fear's money first." He then asked me how many I wanted of each sort? I told him four 5l. and ten 1l. notes; I gave him twelve 1l. bank notes. He said, "I suppose you will know these notes again?" I said I should not, but if he disputed any, I would change them, and give him silver.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to give him 12l. - A. They came to 12l. 10s. He took up the 12l. and did not ask for the 10s.; he gave Fear the money, and said, "Come with me and fetch them, as you have done before." He looked at me as he went out of the room, and said, "You will have them in half an hour." Fear went with him; I saw her again in a quarter of an hour. She went again to Weller, returned and staid near an hour with me. She went out again, and came back and staid about a quarter of an hour. I saw nothing more of the prisoners till they were taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Flecknoe - A. I bought some notes of him by direction of the Bank solicitor; and should have been witnees against him, but he pleaded guilty.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. I know nothing of the notes in the indictment.</p>
               <p>CHARLES CHRISTMAS. I am inspector to the Bank. I first knew Fear in the early part of July, she came to me on the 11th and gave me two 1l. forged notes, (looking at them) these are them - They are forged in every respect, and both off one plate, On the 15th, she gave me two more (these are them,) they are forged in every respect, and both off one plate, but of a different plate to the first two. She gave them to me at a public-house in the Old Bailey; I had given her 1l. twice to buy them. On the 11th, 13th, and 18th, she gave me ten 1l. notes (these are them), they are forged in every respect, and all from the same plate as the two last.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time she brought them to you, in what state were they - A. Quite new.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. I am certain they are the notes. I did not mark the notes I gave her - I thought it unnecessary.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH PEARSON. I am signing clerk to the Bank,(looking at the note charged in the indictment) the signature is not my hand writing, there is no other clerk of my name; here is another note with my name to it, but is not my writing.</p>
               <p>(The note was then put in and read.)</p>
               <p>WELLER'S Defence. I leave it to my Counsel.</p>
               <p>CASHMAN'S Defence. I never saw Fear except at the office; when she came out, she said, "My husband was transported by a Jew last Sessions, and I will hang every Jew I can."</p>

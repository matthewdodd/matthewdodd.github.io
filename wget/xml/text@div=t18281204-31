            . I bought the duplicate of the watch of the prisoner on the 22d of September; he came first, and I told him to come in half an hour - I went, saw the watch, and told the prisoner, when he came again, that 2s. was the most I would give for it - 30s. had been lent on it; I sold the watch to a dealer - I do not know who was the maker; it was silver.</p>

            . I am a clothes-salesman. I gave this seal to the officer; the prisoner, to the best of my belief, came and bought a coat of me for 15s. - he had not money enough, and gave me 10s. and this seal; I took it and thought no more of it - the officer came and brought the prisoner, who I believe was the person, though he appeared altered.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Had not I two or three half-crowns more in my pocket, and did not I toss with you for a pot of beer? A. No, you are wrong, you gave me four half-crowns - I did not toss at all; I believe there were some persons in the shop.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I certainly acknowledge that the crime is of a very aggravated nature, but having been out of employ four months. and having no friends, I implore your mercy.</p>

               <p>JOHN TUCKER. On the 2nd of December, about half-past eight o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner at <placeName id="t18301209-120-crimeloc691">Uxbridge</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Have you seen that person? A. No - I had drank a pint or two of beer; I was sober I believe - I had not been drunk, and dancing in the public-house; I had been dancing, and no one else - there was some music; my clothes were on - I did not see the prisoner in the house; I did not give her gin there - I swear that I did not lift up her petticoats, nor touch her at all; she ran against me in front of the house.</p>

            . The prosecutor gave this girl in charge, and said he had been robbed of his watch; next morning a man named Tuckwell brought this watch to me, and said he had found it under the window of the Sun public-house the night before.</p>

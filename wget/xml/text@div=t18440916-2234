                  </hi>. I live at Barnard's-inn, Holborn, and am clerk in my uncle's counting-house, Harvey, Vere, and Co., Whitefriars. My chambers are at the top of the house in Barnard's-inn. On Wednesday, the 4th of Sept., I went out about past nine in the morning—I returned about half-past two—I found a large bundle of things on the stair-case, which I imagined. might have been my foul linen—on going to my bed-room I found the whole contents of my wardrobe gone—the door was closed, but some instrument had been bored through, and the bolt pushed back by a piece of iron—I had left the door locked, and found it locked—it is a spring lock—any one inside would have forced it—I found my wardrobe open, and everything taken out</p>

               <p>of it—the articles stated were among them—the prisoner George was my servant for about two months until a fortnight before the time—he gave me warning himself—I went to his house with a policeman, that day or the next in Rose-buildings, Fetter-lane—he lives with his mother—he has no father—I had missed things on the Sunday before—at his mother's house I found a waistcoat which was in my wardrobe when I went out on the Wednesday morning, to the best of my belief, but I am not sure, not having counted over my waistcoats—on my dressing-table I found this piece of iron—on com<lb></lb>paring it with the chambers below, it was evidently the bell-pull of the cham<lb></lb>bers of Messrs. Strangeway's and Walter's—an attempt had been made to force my dressing-case, and in doing so a pair of scissors of mine were broken—they were with my razors—the lock was not forced—I was obliged to force it my<lb></lb>self, afterwards, and found the pieces of scissors in the dressing-case—I went a second time to the mother's house in Rose's-buildings, and watched the prisoner George in—I said to him that his brother was in custody, and that I wished to clear his character, and I thought he would have no objection to allow me to examine his chest, or rather to confront him with a witness I had, who saw him in the Inn, carrying out my washing-box, in which the articles were taken—that person was Mary Graham, one of my neighbour's servants—after taking him to her, we took him to his master, Mr. Nettleshed's chambers, No. 15, Clifford's-inn—he had a desk there—I asked Mr. Nettleshed's per<lb></lb>mission to examine it—Mr. Nettleshed himself went to his desk in his pre<lb></lb>sence—we examined it, and in it found a bundle tied up in a pocket-handker<lb></lb>chief, in which were some towels and a table-cloth—I think that table-cloth was not marked, but we found that some one had marked it in the name of "S. Axtell"—we examined the desk more minutely, and concealed between some steel pens, in a box, we found a pearl pin, which I can identify—I had that pin on my person the morning before—I had a deal-box in my chambers which I send every fortnight to Richmond with my linen to be washed—it was in the chambers when I left on Wednesday morning—that was gone, to<lb></lb>gether with the key, which was hanging up in the corner—I can identify this pin by its being loose.</p>

                  </hi>. I assist my father in the law, at No. 10, Clifford's Inn; I know the prisoner John, by now and then meeting him in Inn—I have seen George with him. On the 4th of Sept. George came to me, about half-past twelve o'clock, and said his brother asked me whether I would mind a box—I asked him how large it was—he showed me the size—I said, "Very well, I will"—about five minutes afterwards John came up to me, and asked me the same question—I consented to mind it—he said he would give me 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—George brought the box about half-past two, with a young man, who I supposed to be a porter, and he gave the man some halfpence, but I do not recollect how much—the box was left with me—I saw no more of John till seven in the evening, when he was outside the window—I went out to him, and asked if he was ready to take the box—he said, "No," he would rather I should keep it till the morning, but he would give me the 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I said, "No, I will have it in the morning"—he said, "You had better take it now," he threw down a shilling, and asked me to get change—he asked me to let him look over the box—he did so, and gave me a shirt, some collars, drawers, a nightcap, and a coloured cotton handkerchief—I thought, he being kind enough to give me these things, I would not take the sixpence, so I gave him the shilling back—he put it into his pocket again—he put a few things into a bundle, and took them away (I saw no more of him till Tuesday, when he was at Guildhall)—I said, "Who gave you those things"—he said he had a cousin at sea, and his aunt made him a present of some of them, and some</p>

               <p>were his own dirty things—the policeman came to me on Friday morning about it, and took the box away with him—I gave him all I had—in the hurry of the moment I omitted to give him four collars and a nightcap, which I gave to Mr. Harvey the same day.</p>

On the 4th of Sept., between one and two o'clock in the day I saw the two prisoners pass my window with Mr. Harvey's box—I have three windows in the kitchen—they went through Barnard's Inn, going to Holborn—I am quite sure they are the two boys—John was afterwards brought to me, and I said that was the boy that had hold of the box.</p>

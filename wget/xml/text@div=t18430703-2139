               <p>live in Bryanstone-square. I went to the French Catholic chapel, in Little George-street, Portman-square, on the 25th of June—a few yards from there, in coming out, I took my pocket-handkerchief from my pocket—before I went to chapel I had put a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, into a piece of paper, and put it in my handkerchief—I am sure I did not take ray handkerchief out till I came out of the chapel—I forgot my notes at the time—they were all gone—the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note was No. 70,860. and the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. No. 70,508—I printed bills—I believe these to be two of the notes.</p>

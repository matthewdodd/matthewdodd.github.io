                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-Sergeant Y</hi>). On Saturday night, 21st October, I was on duty with Kew in the Holloway Road, near the Derby Arms; we were both in uniform—12 o'clock is the closing hour, and a number of people turned out—about 12.5 a woman spoke to me, in consequence of which I went to a crowd of from thirty to fifty people, outside the Derby Arms, which was mostly composed of men; they were quarrelling and swearing as if they were going to commence a fight—I said "Now, my lads, clear away, it is Sunday morning"—one of the men in the crowd said "You cannot take two"—I said "I don't want to take any, clear away, it is Sunday morning," and the prisoner Conway, who was in the centre of the crowd, struck me a violent blow on my left cheek with his clenched fist, saying "You b——take that"—he had his soldier's grey coat on, and a Scotch cap on his head—he was in the act of striking me again when I seized hold of him, and Kew caught hold of him at the same time—he kicked, and turning to the crowd, said "Let the s—'s have it," and I was struck three violent blows on the helmet with something heavy, which broke my helmet, and I fell with Conway while still holding him—I saw Kew struck, and I believe it was by Cogan and Ken<lb></lb>drick—we had a very severe struggle on the ground, and Kew was wrested away from us—I got up and was thrown a number of times by Conway, and when I got up the last time I saw Kew in the act of falling on his back in the road—soon afterwards and before I got up I saw Cogan coming towards me with Kew's truncheon in his hand—I had previously heard Kew holloa out "For God's sake have mercy, don't kick me"—Kew shouted out "Look out, they have got my stick"—I drew my truncheon, and Cogan came towards me—I said to him "You scamp" or scoundrel "give me that," and he threw it at his head; it caught against the front of the public-house and rebounded into the road, and as I stooped to pick it up, Conway wrestled himself from my grasp—I picked it up and followed him, he was crossing the road, and as I rushed to get hold of him two men tried to prevent me; I pushed them away and caught hold of him again; he caught hold of Kew's broken truncheon and took it out of my hand, struck me two violent blows on the head with it, felled me to</p>

               <p>the ground, and cut my helmet in two—this is my helmet, and this is the the truncheon (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) it was split like this when I was struck with it, which made it sharp—my helmet was very tight on my head, but it fell off—it was afterwards brought to the station—while I was on the ground Conway kicked me twice on my mouth, saying "Kick the b——s—;" I could tell it was him by his long coat; and I was kicked all. over my body and on my face—three of my teeth were broken off, and my lip was cut in two places and was bleeding—others kicked me—Conway stood in front of me and the others around me—I received a kick on my cheek from Conway which cut it open slightly, but I had put my arms round my head after being kicked on the mouth, which prevented the violence of the blows—I was assisted from the ground by somebody in the crowd; I drew my truncheon and struck Conway on the centre of the head as hard as I could and he fell—I had not used my truncheon before that—Cook stepped up immediately and struck me two violent blows under the left ear with his clenched fist, saying "You b——, take that," and I rushed at him and pushed him over—a man came up on the right and struck me—the crowd formed round me and several men caught hold of me and held me—some one shouted out "Run, soldier, run"—I got away from the men who were holding me and went after Conway, who had run down St. George's Road, which leads out of the Holloway Road, nearly opposite the Derby Arms—I saw Bailey, 448 <hi rend="italic">Y</hi>, and said "I have lost my prisoner, a soldier"—he and Heasnan joined me and we followed them down St. George's Road and found Conway standing in an iron gateway with a woman—I caught hold of him and Heasman or Bailey said "You will 'have to go the station with us, you had better come quietly"—he said "No, you s——s, I will kill you first"—a very large crowd of violent roughs came up, headed by Cogan and Ken<lb></lb>drick; they seemed to be led by them—they surrounded us, and Cogan said "Don't let them take him away"—I said "No, he will go with us, you had better go quietly"—Cogan used a number of threats and said that we should never take him—a number of bricks and stones were thrown at us by the crowd, some of them surrounded us and kicked and struck us where<lb></lb>ever they could—we all had our truncheons out—I saw Kendrick throw half a brick—Cogan, who was close to me, said "Knife the b——s," and I received a blow in the back, I do not know from whom, but my coat seemed to be pulled off my back by the blow, it pulled me downwards, but not on to the ground—we were all holding Conway—Cogan went up to Bailey and said "Leave go, I will strangle you," and caught him round the neck—the crowd came rushing in and kicked and struck us wherever they could—constables in plain clothes and uniform came up and I saw Sergeant Gould and Escott—this is my coat (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), it appears to have a cut behind—we carried Conway face downwards to the Caledonian Road "station; he was very violent all the way—two working men said "You look done up, governor, we will assist you"—they did so, and when I got to the station I fell down in a sort of fainting fit and was attended to by the doctor, and sent home in a cab—I saw Cosgrove in the crowd; I did not remember him at the police-court, I remembered him when I had given my evidence, and before the charge was over; I remembered when it was called to my mind by one of the witnesses, my being kicked, and I turned round and said "You had better not kick me again;" I remember his face as being the one who was behind me when I turned round after being kicked; he was the nearest to me, he seemed to be in the act of kicking me again, and I threatened him,</p>

               <p>with my truncheon—when I recovered at 1.30 I saw Conway and Kendrick at the station; I don't know how Kendrick came there—I have been attended by a surgeon ever since—I was in bed nineteen days and have been suffer<lb></lb>ing ever since from severe pain down the centre of my back and from injury inside; I am unable to do my duty and was unable to attend one of the examinations—I did not know Conway or Cogan before; I knew Kendrick by name and by sight—I had known Cook a long time by sight previously and I think I had seen Cosgrove, but I will not be sure—I have heard that Conway and Cogan are brothers—on 11th November Cook was brought to my house by Lewis, a detective, who said "Look at this man"—I said "Yes, that is right, he is the man who struck me twice in the Holloway Road"—Cook put his hands together and said "For God's sake, don't say that, governor, I was at Blackwall"—Lewis said "Do you feel sure?"—I said "I am quite sure, I have no doubt about it," and he took him away.</p>

The crowd was not outside the public-house which had just closed, but at a beer-shop 20 or 30 yards off; they were quarrelling and swearing—I think it was Cogan who said "You can't take two," but I will not swear it—I have not been asked that before, and I did not say so when Cogan was before the Magistrate—Conway struck me a violent blow in the face without any provocation whatever; that was the commencement of it—he had not been struck then—I saw Cogan before his brother was on the ground—I first saw Cogan when Conway appealed to the crowd, and said "Give it to the s——s; let the s——s have it"—that was after I had caught hold of Conway—I did not hear Cogan say "Let my brother go away," but later on, in St. George's Road, he said "Let me take my brother away"—I did not say "Stand back;" that was not said at ail—Kew did not use his staff at all in my sight, but I used mine; we all used our staves to keep the crowd off—I saw staves used, and felt them—three of us drew our staves in St. George's Road; myself, Eveland, mi Bailey—this coat was produced before the Magistrate with the cut in it—I did not see the face of the person who kicked me in the mouth, but I saw his legs, and the red stripe down his trousers, and his great coat—I know that Conway belongs to the 77th Regiment—the man who said "You cannot take two," had a white billycock on, and that is my reason for thinking it was Cogan—when I saw him afterwards he was stripped and had turned up his shirt sleeves; he had no hat, coat, or waistcoat on then—I never saw Cogan with anything on his head after the commencement of the affair.</p>

I saw Kendrick in the crowd directly I got up, and before Conway was in custody, but he did not do any<lb></lb>thing till I had got hold of Conway—I am not able to say that Kendrick struck me—I saw him in the crowd of thirty or forty people, and afterwards in St. George's Road—I was knocked down by Conway, and could not get up; I was kicked immediately I fell, and did not retain my hold of Conway; the blow seemed to take all power from me—somebody, I cannot say who, assisted me up; I then recaptured Conway, and after that, from fifty to 100 roughs came up, led by Cogan and Kendrick—they followed me <hi rend="italic">down</hi> St. George's Road immediately—Cogan and Kendrick seemed to be inviting them to come on—some one in the crowd said "He is by himself; we will give it him now"—I think it was half a brick which was thrown in St. George's Road, it looked like it; I saw it come from Kendrick's hand; he was 5, 7, or 10 yards from me, and I saw his face close under a lamp—I was struck on the head by a number of stones or bricks, that was when we had caught hold of the soldier, and a number of threats had been used.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman Y</hi> 196). On Saturday night, 21st October, I was with Lambert in the Holloway Road, in uniform—a woman spoke to us, and from what she said I went to the Derby Arms—the Pied Bull is on the left of the Holloway Road coming from the Archway, and is nearer London—St. George's Road is on the opposite side of the road, opposite the Derby Arms—it was then about 12 o'clock, and the Pied Bull was shut up—about forty or fifty people seemed to be arguing together, and swearing, and causing a disturbance, and Lambert said "Now, my lads, see about clearing away here"—some one in the crowd said "You can't take two, you b——"—Lambert said "We don't want to take any of you; we want you to clear away home"—Conway then struck Lambert in the face with his fist, saying "Take that, you b——"—we then made an attempt to take him into cus<lb></lb>tody, and be struck me a violent blow with his fist under the right cheek<lb></lb>bone, which made it swell, and it was very painful—I then received a kick on the bottom part of my body from Cogan; I saw him do it, and he kicked me from the footway into the road—I kept hold of Conway; I pulled him and Lambert with me into the road by the force of the kick—I then received a very heavy kick from Kendrick on the left hip bone, which caused great pain, and caused me to walk lame for over a week afterwards—I was then kicked by Cogan in the middle of my stomach, and cried out "For God's sake don't kick me again; let me get up"—Conway, Lambert, and I, were then on the ground; we were kicked there—I got on my knees, and tried to pull Conway off of Sergeant Lambert, but Cogan took hold of me, with one hand in my belt and the other in my throat, and with several other men I was dragged on to the tram road; they threw me down, and I received a kick in the middle of my stomach from Kendrick, who then ran away with Cogan to where Lambert was, 10 or 15 yards off—I got up, and two more men came at me—I threw them down into the road as fast as they came at me, and Cogan and several other men then came at me, and we had a desperate struggle for my truncheon—I had not drawn it; it was still in the case—Cogan at last got it out, and one of the leathers of my belt was broken in the struggle—I received three stabs, and on looking at my belt there are three cuts in it—I was then thrown down into the tram road, and Cogan came at me with my truncheon in his hand, and gave me a running kick in the pit of my stomach, which kicked the breath very nearly out of my body, and I had to struggle to get my breath again—he said "Kill the b——; kill the s——s"—I got up as well as I could, and saw him going across to where Lambert was, and said "Look out, for God's sake; he has got the stick," meaning the truncheon, and pulled my rattle out and went towards him—Cogan then came to me with the truncheon in his hade and made a blow at me; I placed the rattle up, and he knocked it out of my hand, breaking the tongue of it and bending the pin—I picked it up and went at him again with it, and he came at me again with the truncheon and gave me a tremendous blow on the head, breaking the truncheon in two and splitting a piece off it, as it appears now—my head was cut open, the blood. spurted out, and I became insensible—I was not wearing my helmet the n; I hardly know where it was; I saw it afterwards at the station—I came to my recollection in the Pied Bull, where the divisional surgeon attended 'me after my head was sewn up I was taken to the station, where I saw Conway</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Officer Y</hi>). On Sunday morning, 22nd October, I went to 27, Broad Street, Essex Road—I saw a light in the parlour, and the shadow of a man—I knocked at the door several times, and asked for admission, and called out "Police;" we then forced the door and found nothing in the room but a light; we then went into another room and found Cogan in bed, with his head bandaged up—I said "I want a person named Cogan;" he said "Yes, I am Cogan"—I asked him what was the matter with his head; he said that he had been to Holloway and had got into a row, and had been struck with a staff by the sergeant—I told him to dress himself and I should take him in custody for stabbing a policeman—after he had dressed himself I said "There is no doubt you will be charged with attempted murder"—he said "Oh, if that is it, good-bye all"—on the way to the station he said "I never used a knife, for I never had a knife in my pocket"—I took him to the station, and from there to St. Bartholomew's Hospital, where Escott was lying in bed, and before I got within a dozen yards of him Escott said "That is the man."</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Officer Y</hi>). On 11th November, I took Cook at 27, Queensland Road, Holloway, which is a common lodging-house—he is a cattle drover; I knew him before—I told him I should take him in custody on a warrant for assault, and asked him to come outside—when we were outside, I told him he would be charged with being concerned with Conway and others in assaulting Sergeant Lambert in Holloway Road, he said "I know nothing about it"—I took him to the station, and from there to Sergeant Lambert's house—I said "Sergeant Lambert, look up and see if there is any one here you know"—he said "Yes, that man there; he struck me on the head with his fist"—I said "Have you any doubt about it?"—he said "No, none whatever"—Cook put his hands together like this, and said "You have made a mistake, I was not there; I was at Blackwall Rail<lb></lb>way Station"—I took him to the Caledonian Road station, where the charge was read over to him, and he said he was not there; that was at 9.45—I took Cosgrove previous to that on the same night, at the Coach and Horses, Holloway Road—I knew him before by the name of Burke—I went into</p>

                  </hi>, B.M. I am surgeon to the Y division, and live at 408, Liverpool Road—on Sunday morning, 22nd October, about 12.30 or 1 a.m., I went to the Caledonian Road police-station and saw Sergeant Lambert—he was in a very faint condition, covered with a cold, clammy sweat, and gasping for breath—he was only able to speak in a whisper—his face was grazed on the cheek bone; the skin was broken; his eyes were blackened and three or four of his front teeth knocked out; I thought he would have died at the station from the concussion to his spine and head; his life was certainly in danger—he said "Let me go home," and he was Sent home at once—I visited him at his home two hours afterwards, he was still very ill, but he had recovered—I attended him about three weeks, but he' is on the sofa still, and unable to do duty; he is not out of danger yet, he has symptoms of paralysis in his leg and in his bladder—a violent blow on the head would account for the injuries I saw; he was hacked all over his body; he was sore all over, there was hardly an inch clear—he had great tenderness and bruises all over, more particularly at the bottom of his spine—his condition arises from shock from the violent ill-usage he received—I also saw Kew that morning, who was ruptured, and he also had a scalp wound—I saw Sergeant Gould at the station, who also had a scalp wound at the back of his head—I also saw Escott who was suffering from a stab in the stomach.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Wilkinson, of 27, Queens<lb></lb>land Road, Hornsey Road—Cook has lodged at our house nine or ten months—I first heard of this assault on the Sunday morning, and Cook came home on the Saturday night at little after 6 o'clock; he asked me to sew some buttons on his trousers—he had his tea and went up to bed about 8 o'clock, and put his trousers outside the door; I fetched them about ten minutes afterwards and put them in my front parlour—he sleeps on the first floor—I then locked my parlour door, put the key in any pocket, and went out marketing—I returned about 10.45, and his trousers were where I had left them—I did something else first and then sewed the buttons on them and put them on a chair in the front parlour, and went to bed; I slept in that room and they were still there when I got up at a little after 5 o'clock; but I was up all night nearly because my baby was very ill—the prisoner has never had more than one pair of trousers since I knew him at about 5.5 I saw my husband take Cook's trousers up to him, and about 5.15 or 5.20 I heard Cook come down stairs; I did not see him, I only heard him, but I spoke to him as he was going out and told him to shut the doer quietly because my baby had just gone to sleep—Cook lodged at our house up to the time of his arrest, but he never sleeps at home on Sunday nights—I saw him next at a little after 5 o'clock on Monday afternoon, when he came home from work and had his tea as usual—he sometimes goes away on Tuesday and sometimes on Friday—I do not know what he does—some times when he does not go to work he is in bed all day.</p>

He was with us up to the time he was apprehended—I was present when he was apprehended—I had heard of this affair on the Sunday morning—I saw the constable at our house-Cook did not speak to me before he went away with Lewis, nor to anyone in the house—Rose Cook, his sister, also lodges with us, and I believe he asked her to find his hat before he went away—he was not told the charge in our house; he asked Lewis what he was being charged for, and they would not tell him; they said that he was to be apprehended on a warrant for having a quarrel with Mrs. Biggs, a person who lives in our neighbour hood, and with that I told him to go quietly—he did not say anything, he put on his hat and off he went, saying "All right, I'll go"—I told him to go quietly, because I thought he would not like to go, and because I thought it would be the best for him—nothing was said in my hearing about any assault on the police, and I was present the whole time—Lewis did not tell Cook in my presence that he held a warrant against him for assaulting Lambert; on my oath he did not; nor did Cook say in my hearing "I know nothing about it," or any words of that kind, and I was there all the time—he did not mention Holloway Road in my hearing—I did not know that he was taken away on a charge of assaulting the police; I had not the smallest idea that it had anything to do with the Sunday morning at the time when Lewis took him away—I believed he was taken on a charge of assaulting Mrs. Biggs; I had heard that they had had a quarrel, but no more; he did not tell me that, his daughter told me—the quarrel was on the Wednesday as he was locked up on Saturday night—the assault on the police took place on 21st October, and I heard of it on Sunday morning, the 22nd; I heard the neighbours talking about it; I</p>

               <p>cannot give you their names; it was nobody who lodges in our house—I heard of it when I was taking my dinner to the bake-house—Cook's sister has lodged with us three years, and she was in the house on the night when this affair of the trowsers was going on; she minds the house when I go out; she is my servant and I give her wages—she is not here—she was out that evening; she was in and out—she sleeps in the back parlour; she slept there that night—she goes in and out of my parlour where I and my baby were—I know Kendrick by seeing him in the neighbourhood; I have known him by sight two years I should say—I do not know what he is—I never saw him with Cook—five other men slept in the same room with Cook; there are six altogether; they were all six at home that night—one mail is named Clark, he went to bed about 11.40—I remember that because I know the time he came in—I noticed the time he went to bed; I always do so to see what time he shuts the house up—he is not my husband—my husband shuts the house up—I remember the time Clark went to bed because my husband asked me the time two or three minutes before—all the other five men who slept in that room have not come here; Arthur Clark and Alfred Cyrett have—Alfred Clark is the one I have spoken of—Cyrett went to bed after Clark, but I cannot say what time—nobody else is here but my husband—Alfred Cole was also there, and William Buck<lb></lb>land; I do not know at what time they went to bed—Clark has been living with us about ten weeks; I believe he has got two pairs of trowsers—Cyrett has only one pair, I believe; I never saw him with more than one pair—I am sometimes engaged in putting buttons on their trowsers; I mend and wash for them all—Cook went to bed on this Saturday night at a little after 8 o'clock, and about the same time on the Saturday night before; that was about his regular bed hour on Saturday nights, but not for the the others—I cannot tell at what time Clark went to bed on the previous Saturday, but he never went in much before 12 o'clock.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> My baby was awake, and I was up almost all night—I also remember that on that night, about 6.30 or 7 o'clock, Cook asked me to buy him a new shirt, and because I was a long time gone my husband got quarrelsome with me and told me to let the lodgers buy their own shirts.</p>

Being a drover he does not go to work on Saturday nights—he generally came home about that time, but sometimes a little later—he went to work on Sundays at a little after 5 o'clock—I think I have sewn buttons on this pair of trowsers three or four different times and I have washed them twice; he was in bed while I washed them; he sometimes gets wet and then he lies in bed while I dry them; there is not another pair for him to put on, he has only got what be stands up in; he has not a pair of trowsers to put on on Sunday, I never saw him with another pair.</p>

Cook hallooed out at his bed-room door "Here are my trowsers," and my mistress went up and he gave her the trowsers; she brought them down stairs and put them in the parlour and locked the door, put on her bonnet and shawl and went marketing, and I went with her—the whole house belongs to me—we did not lock the street door, only the parlour—we came back at 11 o'clock, or a little after, and had a bit of supper, and I reminded my wife about putting the buttons on; I said "You had better put the buttons on the <hi rend="italic">chap's</hi> trowsers"; she would have forgotten all about them if I had not told her—she went out, of the parlour and took the lamp and fetched the trowsers; I think she put them in the back parlour; she put the trowsers back on the chair in the parlour, and there they remained till next morning—I was indoors all night and was up almost all night with the baby; my wife undressed the baby and put it to bed, but she had to get up again, because it was ill—Cook had told me to call him if I was awake, and I took his trowsers up to him at; 5.30 next morning and said "Here are your trowsers"—he asked me the time and I told him it was 5.30 and then I came downstairs again, and Cook got up and put his trowsers on and went to work, and he never returned till the Mon<lb></lb>day at 3 o'clock—from the time I went out marketing with my wife Cook was in bed; I saw him in bed at 12.15 when I—went up to see that my lodgers were all right, and I spoke to him—he and Clark and Cyrett had three beds together, and he laid in the middle bed of the three; they were talking and I took my lamp up in my hand and said "Now, if you chaps are going to get up in the morning you had better go to sleep," and I blew the light out, and went down and bolted the front door, that is what I call closing my house—I did not go to bed for five or ten minutes, and then I had to get up again; I got up in about an hour and a half afterwards, because the baby was so bad, and was up nearly all night—there is no key to the front door; it bolts—I am able to say on my oath that Cook was in the house all that time, from 8 o'clock to 5.30—he never had another pair of trowsers in my house—I do not know how long he has had that pair, they seem pretty good, I should think he had had them five or six months—he has been in my house nine months, ten months now—he had a pair of cord trowsers when he came, and he gave them to his sister to make a pair for her little boy; when he bought these, four or five months back, he gave them to his sister, Rose Cook, but she took them to her married sister—Rose is the single one—I do not know whether Rose did so, but I never saw the old trowsers again, only when they were on the boy, and they were not in the same shape then—the other trowsers were <hi rend="italic">bran</hi> new when they were bought—Cook is a cattle drover, he works at Blackwall every Saturday and returns home about 6 o'clock—he takes cattle on board ships, but I never was there—his trowsers are generally in a muddy state when he comes home; they have pretty good trowsers in that trade, they are made strong, and they pay 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. extra for them—he goes away on Sunday mornings—if he comes home with his trowsers wet and dirty he takes them upstairs with him—I do not know whether the buttons often come off; I am not aware that my wife has sewn</p>

He generally came home on Saturday nights at the same time, to the best of my knowledge, and he went to bed about the same time, or a little later; he was never much after 9 or 10 o'clock at the latest—it was 10 o'clock the night they took him—I was present when he was apprehended, in my front parlour—Lewis appre<lb></lb>hended him, and I heard him ask him his name—I was not in the same room; I was in the front room; not in the same room—I could not hear where I was what passed between Lewis and him, but I came out and saw Lewis taking him out, and I asked Cook what he was being taken for—I do not know what he said; they went off—I don't think Lewis told him what he was taken for till he got outside, but he asked him his name, and he said "Cook"—Lewis said "Come on; we don't want to fill everybody's mouth; come outside," and I followed them out, but I. did not go any farther than the door—my wife was present; we were all there; we all came out of the parlour, but she never heard Lewis say that—she heard me ask him what he was being taken for, and she heard Cook say "I do not know;" but she is very hard of hearing for the last six months; I have spoken to her myself, and she has not heard me—when I spoke to Cook I dare say she was as far off as I am from that gentleman (<hi rend="italic">pointing</hi>)—she might have heard, but I don't know whether she did or not—I did not hear Lewis say anything to my wife at any part of the time—I was in the front parlour and I came out into the passage—Lewis did not go right into the back room, Cook came out to him into the back passage—if Lewis had spoken to my wife I could have heard him—I don't believe he did speak to her—well, I believe he did—I don't think he did, and yet I do think he did; there were so many of us in the passage—I do not know what he said to her; I only remember what he said outside—I will swear before these gentlemen that this man had only one pair of trowsers at that time—the only other pair I remember was the pair he gave away—I will swear that he only had one pair—the other men have one pair each, <hi rend="italic">bar</hi> Clark, who has two pair, and bis Sunday trowsers are put fin my room downstairs in a box—I have not been in trouble—I was in trouble ten years ago, or it may be more—I had four months—it was for felony; stealing from inside a shop—I do not know what year it was in—it was at Clerkenwell police-court—it might be in 1868; it is a long while ago; I was a lad at the time—I am now twenty-five—I was charged again at Clerkenwell Police-court in 1869—I have only had four months—the felony at the shop was at Queensland Road—I was never charged with committing felony in Wickham Terrace; I was taken up because my hat was <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> into a shop; me and some lads were larking and my hat was <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> in, and I went in and got it, and the man thought I was after stealing his herrings, and said he would have me locked up—I was taken before a Magistrate, and discharged—I do not know how long that was after Queensland Road—I do not remember being up again at Clerkenwell police-court in 1871, on a charge of assault; it was about 1874, I think; it is two or three years ago—that was not a charge of assaulting Mrs. Elizabeth Rose, in the Holloway Road—it was an insult upon Mr. Hobbs and his wife—that was in the Holloway Road—I was bound over to keep the peace for three months—I mean to say that I know nothing of the charge of assaulting Mrs. Elizabeth Rose, nor was I fined 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or fourteen days for it—I know Mr. and Mrs. Rose, she keeps a poulterer's</p>

               <p>shop, but that never happened—it was my brother Henry who was fine 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or fourteen days, and I can bring him up to prove it—I have known all the prisoners all my life—I know the Derby Arms beer-house—I have been there—I never saw any of the prisoners there; yes, I have seen Kendrick there, but none of the others—I have seen Cogan, Kendrick, and Cosgrove together, but not often, and I never saw Cook with them—I have not seen Cogan for some time—when I have seen them together they were having a glass at different public-houses in the Holloway Road.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COLE</hi>. They all live about that neighbourhood—I never saw Cook in their company—he is not a companion of theirs; I swear positively that I had nothing to do with the assault in 1871; it was my brother Henry—the only imprisonment was when I was a boy, and had four months—in the assault in which I was bound over; I had two or three words with a man and his wife—I went to fetch my wife away and they gave me a smack in the face, and we had a fight and the wife summonsed me, and I was bound over to keep the peace towards them—they were not bound over to keep the peace towards me; I did not summons them—when Lewis came to arrest Cook, four or five other lodgers were present; Davey and Lovett, and Rose Cook, and I think Cole was there—this was on the ground floor—the constable was only there five or ten minutes, and those people were there during that time—no conversation went on while the constable was there.</p>

I reside about half a mile from the cattle market—I never saw Cook driving cattle, but that is his trade—I do not think he is known to the police, or whether they would have an opportunity of observing him driving cattle—when my wife repairs trowsers for the lodgers we do not generally lock them up in our room all night, but we did not care about doing them just then, because we were going out marketing—if Cook was taken ill in the night he would have had to go downstairs in his shirt—we do not generally keep trowsers all night, this was an exceptional case—I get up on Sunday mornings, about 7 or 8 o'clock; I do not care about turning out so soon on Sunday, but the baby kept me up on this night—there is do knocker on my front door, and there is no key—there are two bolts—they have no latch keys, they have to knock before they come in, and they cannot go in and out—the door is open all day long up to the time I bolt it.</p>

                  </hi>. I sell fish and poultry with a cart, and lodge in Wilkin<lb></lb>son's house—I heard of this assault on the next day Sunday, between 1 and 2 o'clock at the Queen's Arms public-house—I came home on the night in question at 12.20 and went to the room where Cook was, where I sleep—Cook was then in bed—this may be the door, my bed is here, Cook's is the next, and here is the next, there are three on one side and three on the other—Cook has a pair of cord trowsers; I never saw more than one pair—I was talking to Cook till very nearly 1 o'clock in the morning, because I had sold my pony on that day—I then went to sleep and awoke again when the landlord came in next morning with a pair of trowsers on his arm—that was a little after 5 o'clock, about half-past.</p>

I went in—they were all in when the landlord came up at 12.30, but they were not all awake—I don't know which were asleep—they were all there when the landlord blew the candle out—they were not all interested in the story of the pony, because one was in the corner asleep—the one who took an interest in the story of the pony was a <hi rend="italic">chap</hi> they call <hi rend="italic">Natty</hi>—he has not a wooden leg—he is there still.</p>

I sell fish—Clark brings it to us; he finds the money to buy it—I lodge in this house—I first heard of this assault on the Sunday between 2 and 3 o'clock at a beershop—I come home on the Saturday night at 11.45; my business keeps me out as late as that; I stand at a stall—I went straight to bed, and saw the mistress going into her parlour, I don't know what for—when I got into the room Clark and Cook were there—Cook was in bed, and Clark was sitting on the bed—I undressed and got. into bed, but remained awake about an hour—me and Clark and Cook were talking about selling his pony—nothing else happened before I got up in the morning at 6.30—I went to sleep close upon 1 o'clock, and did not wake up before 5.30, when Mr. Wilkinson came up and brought a pair of trowsers up for Cook—I was asleep at that time, and he awoke me.</p>

I took Cook in custody, and then I heard it from Cook's sister at that time, after I had told him the charge—I did not charge him with that at all; there is no pretence for saying that I was going to take him for that—I did not read the warrant to him—Wil<lb></lb>kinson and his wife were in the front room; it would be impossible for them to hear what was said, for there were six constables in the passage—Wilkinson did not ask Cook in my presence what he was being taken for, for did Cook say "I don't know"—he never spoke.</p>

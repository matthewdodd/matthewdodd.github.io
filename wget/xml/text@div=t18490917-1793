                  </hi>. I am the son of Mary Ann Forwood; she keeps a house in Burr-street, in the parish of St. Botolph, Aldgate—it is her dwelling-house. On Friday, 7th Sept, a portmanteau was brought to our house, about half-past one o'clock—I noticed it so as to know it again—it was of rather an unusual appearance, with pieces of wood nailed at the bottom—it was put in our parlour, and opened by the owner of it, Mr. Cooper—I saw him lock it afterwards, and he left the straps rather loose about it—I noticed a dressing-case in it, and clothes, and two odd slippers—after he had locked it up, he left it in the passage, about two o'clock, and I missed it about half-past three or four, and gave information at the station—I should think the portmanteau alone was worth 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., it was nearly new, and was a kind of whitish brown—it bad a patent lock on one side, and a padlock on the other, and a variety of straps—one compartment of it was full of clothes, and there was linen in it—the prosecutor gave a list of the things to the police—our door had been open several times in the afternoon.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Rosemary-lane. On Friday afternoon, 7th Sept., I was standing outside the door of the Crown and Seven Stars, which is about eight minutes' walk from Mrs. Forwood's—about five minutes after four o'clock, Jones walked by with a portmanteau on his head—he called to me and said, "Can you tell me where I can get this broken open?"—he said he should never be able to get it home without a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—he sent me to Riches and another person, who were on the opposite side of the way, and Riches told me to <hi rend="italic">stow</hi> my b—y <hi rend="italic">mug</hi> away—I went to the station and told the officers, and they came and looked at the back of the 'Change, and by the railway arches, but could not see any signs of them—on the Saturday night I was going down Whitechapel-road, and I saw Riches—I had seen that there were three pieces of board at the bottom of the portmanteau, and the straps were loose—it was a double portmanteau; the top would lift off, and then it would be like two—I was a witness before the Magistrate—I heard Mr. For<lb></lb>wood give an account of the portmanteau; he described it the same as the one I saw, but he did not say anything about the three boards at the bottom.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Jones.</hi> The prosecutor said there were two pieces of board, and now he says three; I had no portmanteau; if he saw me with it, why did not he bring the policeman and take me? he knew where I lived; he is a bad character; I used to be a bad character, but I have reformed. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> After we had been to the back of the 'Change, I went to Flower-and-Dean-street—I said, "That is the door where he lives;"—the officers went back—I went up and saw two women; they said there was the cholera in the room—he was taken in that house on Sunday night—he made a kick at me, and said, "I wish I had kicked you in the privates"—I am not a bad character; I work very hard with my father, and the officers know it—Jones took my brother out, and my brother has got three months—I have been to his house for my brother, and he said he would kick me out.</p>

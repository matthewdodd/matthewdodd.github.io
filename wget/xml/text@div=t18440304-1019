                  </hi>. I am a law-writer, and live in Pearl-row, Southwark. I was returning home from Kennington on Friday morning, the 9th of Feb.—it might have been twelve when I came to the Crown public-house, which was within five minutes' walk of my own house—I might have remained previous to entering the house about ten minutes or quarter of an hour—there are two entrances to the house, one is opposite the Blind School—I tried to get in there—there was a little disturbances, and I could not get into the bar—I was pushed out of the house—I was not in the house above three minutes altoge<lb></lb>ther—I had nothing to drink there—I had been drinking in the course of the afternoon at a public-house in Kennington—I was not perfectly sober, but I perfectly recollect every thing that transpired—I do not know what the dis<lb></lb>turbance was about—I left the house, I was not going home, I was going to another place first—I had just crossed the road in my way to another house, and received a violent blow on the back of my head behind, which knocked me down—(I had heard some person behind me, but did not take any notice)—I was insensible for a second or two—in endeavouring to get up I heard some person, "Give it him again," and I received a blow under the chin from the prisoner—I had never seen him before, but am sure he is the person—I described him to the policeman—the blow was given with something in the hand I am sure—it knocked me down, and a quantity of blood came from my mouth—the policeman came up, and the parties went away—I endeavoured to walk, but fell again—a female was passing who knew me, and led me home—I was so weak with loss of blood that the policeman conveyed me to the hospital—I was confined to my bed five days, and at present the top of my head is very irritable, and throbs a great deal at times.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in the neighbourhood of the Crown public-house on the 9th of Feb. between twelve and one o'clock—I saw the prosecutor coming out of the Crown, and saw him struck by a man on the head—I was nearly close to him—I think the person who struck him was before him—whether he struck him before or behind I cannot say—it cut his head and he fell down, and as he was going to get up another person struck him—I think the prisoner is the man who struck the first blow—I never saw him before, and could not positively swear to him—I lived in the house which Seymour used to frequent—he did not live in the house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant surgeon at Guy's Hospital—the prosecutor was brought there on the morning of the 9th of March, about one o'clock—he had a wound under the chin, and one on the top of the head; the one on the head was an irregular lacerated wound—I do not think a fist would do it, it seemed more like a wound from a stone, or some irregular surface; the wound under the chin was of a lacerated character, and straight; it appeared to have been done by some blunt instrument; it could not have been done by a fist—they were not dangerous wounds—they were bad wounds certainly—the one under the chin was the worst; it was two inches long and about half an inch deep—he must have lost some blood, but not a very considerable quantity—he seemed faint, pale, and somewhat tre<lb></lb>mulous—he left the hospital that evening, and came again frequently to see me—he has got quite well—I cannot say how soon after the accident, I saw him—he may have been confined to his bed without my knowing it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Might the wound have been inflicted by a fall against a stone? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The one at the back of the head, I think, might, but he must have fallen against some projection.</p>

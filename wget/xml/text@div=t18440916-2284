                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Sarah Lambert, a coffee-roaster, in George-yard, Aldgate. On Saturday night, the 2nd of Sept., I put 14lbs. of coffee in the warehouse before I left—I put it into a paper bag, and put it on a bench in the corner—I came to the warehouse about six o'clock on the Monday morning, and found the coffee was gone and the bag left—I have ex<lb></lb>amined some coffee produced by the policeman—I believe it is the same, it had been roasted, but not ground—it is my aunt, Sarah Lambert's, coffee.</p>

               <p>away from the prosecutrix's warehouse—immediately he saw me he returned back again in another direction, down the yard—I followed him, and when I turned the corner of some stables, he was on the dunghill, stooping down apparently covering something over—I asked him what he wanted there—he said, "Nothing," but he was looking for bones—I stooped on the dunghill and saw some coffee—he ran off down the Minories, and up a court, where I followed, and apprehended him—I brought him back to George-yard, and then I looked at the bag which he had, and nothing was in it—the coffee was on the dunghill—he shook it out—it is here—I took the bag from him, gathered the coffee in it, and took it to the station.</p>

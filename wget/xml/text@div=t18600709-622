                  </hi>. I live at 120, Old-street, and am a tailor—the house is my dwelling house—on the morning of 15th June, about 4 o'clock, I was awoke by a crash—I went down stairs—the previous evening, between 10 and 11 o'clock, I fastened the back-room window and bolted it, and the door also—there is an outside shutter to the back-parlour window that was properly secured; when I came down I found the shutter broken and the window open—I had a chest of drawers in the parlour—I left them in the usual order the night before—amongst other things I left a pair of trousers there, they were laid across the drawers outside; they were not taken away—I found a chisel on the table—the glass of the parlour-door, which leads to the shop, was broken—that I believe awoke me—the house is in the parish of St. Luke—I missed nothing except the kitchen door key; we have not found that yet.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, G</hi> 13). I know Murphy well by sight; I knew him about six weeks before he was apprehended—on the morning of 15th June, about 4 o'clock, I saw him running in Ironmonger-row in the centre of the road, with his shoes under his arm—he had on a black cap and the coat he has on now—he did not run past me; he turned out of Little Mitchell-street—I was going in the direction of Old-street, with my back to him—he turned round and laughed at me—I am sure it was him—this was about seventy yards from Mr. Metcalfe's house.</p>

               <p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Wright's Defence.</hi> I was going along home to 5, Sawyer's-place, Lamb's-passage. I had my boots off, and I stated that I was going my way home. He never saw me go down the court, and he first said it was about 4, and then he said it was a quarter or ten minutes to 4. I was never seen near the place; I know nothing of it. The witness says he never heard any alarm, and the constable says he heard it two hundred yards away, and the people in the next house did not hear anything. I told the policeman I was going home.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Murphy's Defence.</hi> I wish to draw your attention, gentlemen, to the statements of the constables, Smith and Martin. Smith, at the police-court simply says that he saw a man running up a street opposite the Bedford Head; why did not he run after him? he saw no one running after the man, and yet he says there was a cry of "Stop thief;" he did not state that because he did not know the statement Martin was about to make; since then they have put their heads together, and have said, "You must swear that the prisoner Murphy had his boots off and I will say so too; I must say he had his boots off to make my evidence correspond with your's. "Then Martin says there is horse-dung upon the stockings, and Boobyer says there is no horse-dung, but they are only dirty. I can easily account for the dirt; I had bluchers on and they let water. I know nothing about the case; I was not with the other prisoner; I never saw him that night.</p>

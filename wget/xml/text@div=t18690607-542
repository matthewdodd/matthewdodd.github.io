I am a shoemaker, and live at 249, Cambridge Street, St George's-in-the-East—at 4.30, on 17th May, I saw the prisoner driving a horse and cart in the Mile End Road—I heard him call out two or three times to an old lady, the deceased, but she took no notice—she was crossing at the right-hand side, and was knocked down by the horse and cart, which went over her—he did not call till such time as the old lady was run over—I assisted in conveying her to an hospital—she spoke, and gave her name—the reins of the horse were rather loosely held by the prisoner—the old lady was about three or four yards from the horse when he called out—he tried to stop the horse, but I believe it was coming at too quick a pace to enable him to do so in so short a distance—it was trotting, but I cannot say how many miles an hour.</p>

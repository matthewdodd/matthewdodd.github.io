                  </hi>. I live at Rothsay, in Argyllshire, and command the ship Alpine, which is lying in the Commercial Docks—on 4th January I was with my wife in Gracechurch Street walking up and down waiting for a Rotherhithe omnibus—I had a gold watch and chain, value 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—when the omnibus came up the prisoner forced himself between me and my wife and then moved away—I found my watch chain hanging down but not broken.</p>

               <p>and saw them pass a second and a third time, and then three of the men followed them down the street and the prisoner and another man fell back against a refreshment place, 56, Gracechurch Street—I went into a door<lb></lb>way, the other three men went into the road, the Rotherhithe omnibus turned round on to the stand, and Smith and his wife came up—the prisoner said to another one "Come on, now then," and made towards the omnibus—Smith and his wife were at the door of it, and as they were about to get in, the other three men forced the people this way, and the prisoner got between Smith and his wife, as if he was going to get into the omnibus, but he turned round and faced Smith, and I saw his hand against Smith's waistcoat; another man with a coat on his arm was covering him—those two left together, they did not get in—I followed them and put the prisoner on his back and afterwards took him to the station, but found nothing on him—the other one got away.</p>

            , You lived a servant with the Duke of Bolton, you may get something out of my Lord Duke's. Said I, I don't know but I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174502270015"></xptr> may. Between ten and eleven at night, we went there with an intent to rob the house, not the stable. We all put our hands to the bottom of the stable door, and broke the bar, so as to get in, and got into a room where a helper or postilion lay, and took two pair of stockings and a work'd linen waistcoat. We intended to break open the house, but there was a servant in the laundry. We went into the stable, got a pitch-fork, and endeavoured to break open the door where the coachman lay, but did not. Says I, Let us go about our business, with what we have got. Said the Prisoner at the bar, Don't let us go. D - n my eyes, we will tie the people in the house, before we will do that. Said I, Don't do that, because I shall be known; and I shall be taken one time or other. Accordingly we came about our business: the bar not being quite broke through, we brought it together, as a red hot poker would come, and shut the door after us. Then we came to the Prisoner's lodging, and agreed how to dispose of what we had. We sold the waistcoat for half a crown to an old clothes man (I think) in Thrift-street, Soho, and spent the money; and the stockings we tossed up for, under an arch in Peter's street, where the Prisoner lived, and I won them.</p>

            . I have known the Prisoner fourteen or fifteen years. I never knew any thing but that he was a civil man. He always behaved civilly to me. I have heard other people talk; but I am not to swear to that, you know.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know his general character?</p>
               <p>Raven. I know what people have said, but I am not to condemn him myself. - It is about two years and an half since he came from Portsmouth and then he came with a stab in his side - He lodged in Oxford Road. I believe, in about a a week or a fortnight after he came to town, he fell ill of an ague and fever; and was ill, I believe, five or six months.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he consined and uncapable of working?</p>
               <p>Raven. He was not able to go to work. He was as people in that distemper are.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he so all the six months?</p>
               <p>Raven. I can't say I saw him all the six months. I saw him in May and June. <rs id="t17450227-19-verdict99" type="verdictDescription">

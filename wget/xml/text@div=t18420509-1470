                  </hi>. I work at Mr. Ruddy's brick-fields, at Hillingdon. Last Sunday morning, the 8th of May, I went to the Packet-boat public-house, at Cowley, about nine o'clock—the prisoner, a man named Charles Brown, and another, were there—we had three or four pints of gin be<lb></lb>tween us to drink—we were there about an hour and a half—we were all the worse for liquor—I came out of the Packet-boat about ten o'clock, and laid down, going along, on some grass by the road side—the prisoner was with me at the time—the other men were behind—they were of the party—I had two or three half-crowns in my left-hand pocket—I missed them when I awoke, between four and five o'clock—I am sure I had them when I came out of the Packet-boat—I afterwards went to the prisoner, and asked if he had any of my money—he said he had not.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a brickmaker. On this Sunday morning I was called by Dell and Chisnell, and saw the prosecutor lying on his back near Crowley-bridge, on the road-side, asleep—he was not sober—I saw the prisoner, who was kneeling on him, take two half-crowns and some small silver out of his left-hand trowsers pocket,' and turn the pocket inside out—I asked him what he was doing to the prosecutor—he said, "Nothing"—I said to the prosecutor, "You have been robbed"—he made some blunder, and I told a boy who was with him, if he would come down to me I would tell him who had got his money—the prosecutor said he had lost some money—I told the pri<lb></lb>soner he was robbing him—I saw his hand in the prosecutor's pocket, and saw the money come out—I did not say that before the Magistrate—I do not exactly recollect whether I said it or not, I was flurried—I am quite confident I saw it—I went on to Uxbridge, and came back in about an hour and a half—I saw the prosecutor lying in the same position as I had left him—the prisoner was gone.</p>

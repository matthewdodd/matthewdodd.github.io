             . Last Monday I saw a cart with two horses turn the corner of <placeName id="t17451016-24-crimeloc132">New Street by Bedfordbury</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17451016-24-crimeloc132" type="placeName" value="New Street by Bedfordbury"></interp>

               <p>Q. Did the boy tumble down?</p>
               <p>Hewbank . When I saw the cart coming along I called out to the boy, and told him, there was a cart coming, the boy endeavoured to get out of the way, but the cart brushed against his shoulder, threw him down, and went over him.</p>


               <p>Q. Was this in the publick cart way?</p>
               <p>Hewbank . There are no posts there, the boy stood up by a cobler's stall; I took the boy up, but he could not stand; he was carried to a surgeon, and blooded.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the horses going fast?</p>
               <p>Hewbank . They were going a foot pace.</p>

            . I saw the horses going along, and I said , carman, stop, or you will kill the boy: the boy was standing just within the leaf of the stall, and the cart pulled part of the stall down, and run over the boy.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the carman give you any answer?</p>
               <p>Blackman. No; the wheel run over the boy.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the carman say any thing to it?</p>
               <p>Blackman . He went on and never troubled his head about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he hold of the reins of his horses ?</p>
               <p>Blackman. He went by his horses.</p>

               <p>Sipp. I don't know him - As soon as the cart was gone, I went and looked at the boy, and his eyes were ready to start out of his head.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he alter his course upon that?</p>
               <p>Deverall . Not at all; the cart took the slaps off my stall, broke the hinges, threw the boy down, and run over him.</p>
               <p>Q. How far distant was, the boy from the wheel?</p>
               <p>Deverall. I cannot say but he might have saved him if he would.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There was an old woman coming along, and the wheel had like to have taken her by the shoulder, so endeavouring to save her, I went over the boy. <rs id="t17451016-24-verdict133" type="verdictDescription">

                  </hi>. My husband keeps the Rose, in Snowis-fields, Ber-mondsey. On 18th Nov. the prisoner came for a pint of half and half—he gave me what appeared to be a shilling—I gave him change—I placed the shilling in the till with some sixpences—there was no other shilling there—it was about 11 o'clock or a quarter past—before the prisoner had left, I sus<lb></lb>pected the shilling was bad—it was not in the till more than five minutes before I looked at it, and put it into my pocket, where there was no other money—on the following morning I examined the shilling, and found it was bad—the prisoner came again, about 8 o'clock in the evening—I did not serve him, but after he was gone a policeman was sent for—I gave him the shilling I had taken of the prisoner on the previous night—I did not say anything to him on the 18th, I thought he was a working man, and he might have taken it in mistake, and as I was alone, I did not like to say anything to him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am barman at the Rose. On Wednesday evening, 19th Nov., the prisoner came for a pint of porter, a screw of tobacco, and a short pipe—I served him, and he put down a shilling—I took it up, tried it in the detector, and found it was bad—I gave it him back—he took the pint of porter, and hesitated, and said, "I suppose I can't have it?"—I said, "No, certainly not"—he walked out with the shilling in his pocket—in consequence of what my mistress said, I went out and gave him into custody—I walked a little way behind him—I saw him draw his hand out of his pocket, and drop this shilling in the gutter—I took it up, and took it to the station, and gave it to the inspector.</p>

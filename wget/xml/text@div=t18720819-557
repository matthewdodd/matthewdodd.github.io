                  </hi>. I am a corn dealer at 259, Roman Road—on 1st May the prisoner came into my shop for a pound of flour—she gave me a shilling, and I gave her 9 3/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—I found afterwards the shilling was bad—on 20th May she came in again for a half-quartern of flour, which was 3 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she gave me a shilling—I kept it in my hand as I took it off the counter, and I did not notice it till after she was gone, when I found it was bad—I gave it to the detective.</p>

I live at 492, Mile End Road, and keep a ginger-beer shop—on 4th July the prisoner and another woman came—I should know the other woman if I saw her—that is the woman (<hi rend="italic">Chapman—See next case</hi>)—they came in together, and Peck asked for two bottles of ginger-beer—I can't say which of them put the shilling down; it was lying on the counter at the time I opened the beer—I gave 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change, all in copper—Peck</p>

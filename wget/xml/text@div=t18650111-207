                  </hi>.

               <p>was his duty to write out a requisition in the request-book for such articles as were required; he would then get those goods from the general stores department, and see them forwarded and directed—there is a counterfoil to the request-book which Fuller keeps—if I was not there he would write out a request on the counterfoil as well, but if I was there I should do it; he merely wrote it in my absence—I wrote both the entry, the request, and the counterfoil if I was there—I occasionally left a request signed in blank, if I had to go down the line; that would be filled up by the prisoner and checked by me on my return—I have seen an account of the stores which were found at Cudham; they were such a class of stores as were found in the locomotive department, and which would be delivered on requests.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman of the coach makers employed in the works of the London and South Western Railway, at Nine Elms—I have seen the cart referred to by the last two witnesses, and identify the wheels and the lower part of the body, and part of the tail board as my make—I did not know that there was a truck missing from the stores, until the apprehen<lb></lb>sion of Fiddler—Fiddler had a truck under his care—I identified it at the police-court, the axle and boxes which had belonged to the truck, when it existed as a truck—I have the moulds which they were cast from—I also speak to two pairs of springs which were taken off a small phaeton some months ago—there were also some iron knees of exactly the same description as these.</p>

               <p>kept, we could tell where a truck was if it ran on the line, but not if it ran on the road—this was used to run on the road to take goods—there were no shafts for a horse, it was used by hand—one person could take it empty—it was not like an ordinary truck on the line—it was about seven feet long, and two feet wide—it was kept in the charge of the stores department—I bad seen it since it was made, but I took no note of it—if it had been brought in for repairs I should—two or three of these trucks are in use, but this was only one made for Mr. Beattie's stores.</p>

                  </hi>.

I am a carpenter in the service of the South Western Rail way Company—I know Fuller—I recollect a truck having been made for Fuller more than twelve months ago—it is my duty to brand all the trucks for the Company's use—I was about to brand this truck about 5th October, twelvemonth, to put the Company's initials on it—I was branding some work to go to a station down the line, and Fuller passed me—I went down to him and said, "Shall I brand this truck!"—he said, "No, you have nothing to do with this truck, it is making for the me of the stores, you mind your own business"—I did not brand it—I have seen the cart that is here—to the best of my belief it has some of the materials of that truck about it—the tail board is hung by a pair of back flaps that was made to keep it from falling—I don't know anything about the axle or boxes or wheel!—I did not make the truck.</p>

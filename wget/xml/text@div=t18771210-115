I am the prisoner's father, and live at 5, Hamilton Street, Manchester Square—I was called at the police-court—I remember Sep<lb></lb>tember 22nd, it was a Saturday, I believe—my son came in that night about 10.45 and went to bed—he slept in the same bed with me—I went to bed between ten and a quarter past, but I was quite awake when, he came—he did not leave the house after that, and he was in bed when I got up on the Sunday morning-about 7 o'clock—the bedstead is against the wall, and he slept on the inside—he could not have got out of bed without my knowing it, because I am a very light sleeper—about a fortnight afterwards Detective Murphy met me in Baker Street and made inquiries about my son.</p>

On the morning of 9th Qctober, I was watching the prosecutor's premises—I saw Newton go to the ware house about 7 o'clock, unlock the door, and go in—in about four minutes, Hickley went into the warehouse to him—in about four minutes he came out again, crossed the road, and fetched a costermonger's barrow to the door—he and Newton then brought out six large sash weights, weighing 24 lbs. each, and put them on the truck; this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is one of them—they then brought out nine iron water heads, six elbows, and three large pans—Hickley then drew the truck down Thames Street as far as Queen</p>

I am clerk in the prosecutor's employ—there was one other clerk—it was my duty to unlock the premises in the morning on 9th October—Garland had the key of the padlock—I had given it to him some months previously—I was not aware that Newton had it—I got to the premises a few minutes to 9 o'clock on this morning—Newton was there, preparing a load for the van, his ordinary duty—he did not com municate to me the sale of these articles, or say anything about it—he did not hand over any money, or say that he had any to hand over.</p>

On Tuesday afternoon, 26th October, about half-past 3 o'clock, I was on duty in Powis-street—the prisoner came up and asked me if I could direct him to any place where he could get work—I told him that I could not—he said that he was very hungry and could get nothing to eat—he passed on down Powis-street, and I followed him—as soon as he turned the corner, he went up to Mr. Reed's shop door, and took this packet of woollen plaid (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from the top of eight or ten packages at the door, and ran off with it—I pursued him, and he was stopped by Edmunds—I asked him why he did it—he said that he was hungry and could get nothing to eat, and the thing he ran off with would put four or five shillings in his pocket.</p>

               <p>Q. What is the value of the plate?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It was worth twelve or fourteen pounds: there were three prisoners then before Sir John, in irons; there was the prisoner Keeley; it was Keeley that came to my house to let me know my plate was found: at first he said, D - n his eyes, I did not deserve to have my plate again; and if he got loose again, he would rob me again. I gave him a shilling, as he seem'd distress'd; after which he said, D - n his eyes if he would rob me.</p>
               <p>Q. from Keeley. Did you not say I had a right to the reward?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No, I did not; I did not know who was intitled to that: I was told he had been discharged out of custody but the Thursday before.</p>

            . I have known Keeley ever since Christmas last. On the day before last sessions ended, he came to me about four in the morning, and call'd me out of bed; it was on a Friday; he lodged in the same house where I did; he desired me to go out with him to rob, or get any thing we could. I went out with him; he went into a gentleman's house in Bedford Row, where the door stood a jar, and brought out two glass cruets, with silver tops; this was between seven and eight o'clock; he gave them to me; then he went back again to a corner house, and brought out a knife case, with twelve table spoons, six forks and six knives, and a marrow spoon.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he get into that house?</p>
               <p>E. Morgan. He said the door was a jar; it was in the same street; he gave them to me; we brought them home, and went into an empty house, and looked at them, and found them to be all silver.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Where is your house?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. My house is at the corner ofLittle James-street, by the chapel, Bedford Row.</p>

The boy had six forks and the marrow spoon. Boyd had six spoons and three knives, and I had the same. I was afraid to go to sell them, so they both went: they came home again, and said they could not meet with the Jew, but that they had sold the two silver tops of the cruets: he went out again and committed another robbery: this was on the Friday, and on the Saturday he was taken up: there was nothing found in the house where I live, but the two glass cruets; the other things were found with

Gahagan said he had found six forks and a marrow spoon between Boyd's shoulders, under her gown: I saw them, but did not see them taken from her. I said, Where is she? they said she was run up another pair of stairs: I went up two pair of stairs, and ask'd Barker if a woman was not come into his room; he said No, at first; but when I said she was a thief, he said, Then take her away.

            . Gahagan came to me one morning about six o'clock, about the time of the last Old Bailey sessions: he said, Wright, I believe I can help you to something; there are some knives, forks, and spoons, that Farrell and Boyd have got in the coach yard, St. Giles's, in a shagreen case; and he knew where the gentleman they belonged to lived, and mentioned some Row; but what Row I cannot be particular in. We went in search of the people; presently came Keeley; we went together, and took two men, who were Farrell, and Boyd's husband. We met Hyde in the coal-yard; I told him of it; he went with us: we went two one way, and two another, in order to meet in the fields: the evidence Morgan was sitting by the side of a pond; I brought her along with me: we went to their lodgings, and search'd, but found only two glass cruets, which Boyd and Morgan afterwards acknowledged they had sold the silver tops belonging to them.</p>
               <p>Q. from Keeley. Did I not do all I could to take the persons?</p>
               <p>Wright. The boy took a great deal of pains that morning in order to find out the things and thieves; he was the means of all being taken up: we were to follow his steps: he said, Go along with me, and I'll be bound to have all concern'd in the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say how he came to know of the things being stolen?</p>
               <p>Wright. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask Gahagan. or the boy Keeley, how they came to know how the things came to be stolen?</p>
               <p>Wright. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Keeley by when Gahagan said he believed he knew the gentleman that they belong to?</p>

               <p>On the Friday night Morgan and her husband, and another man and a woman, were eating beef and potatoes at their lodgings in St. Giles's: Morgan's husband, nam'd Farrell, was very ragged: I said, What have you been doing all this while? O, said he, I will not be so ragged tomorrow, for we have got a very good booty this week. Said I, Will you let me look at it? No, said he, I cannot do that. He brought it in about half an hour to let me see it: she was with him: there were table-spoons, knives, and forks. Said they,

Said I, I know a person since I was in New Prison that would buy of any body in the world: they all consented to go into the fields the next morning, and I was to bring the man to buy them: I went and told Mr. Wright of this, for him to get somebody to buy them, and by that means we should get them all. I said, The man must pretend to be a buyer of old cloaths, and call himself a Jew: so he got Mr. Hyde to go with me on that account. When Mr. Hyde came up to Morgan, he took out six or eight guineas, and said, Where is the plate? then she said, This woman (pointing to Boyd) had it. After that, Morgan cleared her own husband, and said I stole the plate. She had no way to come off but by swearing falsely against somebody or other. I am between thirteen and fourteen years of age.</p>

               <p>I know nothing of this plate. Gahagan, and Farrell and his wife, had words with me, and he came at one o'clock with a drawn knife to take me out of bed: I ran to hide myself from these men: the people ask'd me what was the matter; I said it was a thief going to have me taken with a parcel of constables: he bid me come in and hide myself here: I went in, and got under his bed: the men came, and said, She is a thief: they took me out, and search'd the room, and Gahagan searched with them; and when I was before the Justices, Gahagan was very uneasy: he went back to search the room, and came again with the little boy: they brought in the things, and said they got them in the room.</p>

               <p>Q. What is the name of the court where your master lives?</p>
               <p>J. Melon. It is called Bragdell Court.</p>

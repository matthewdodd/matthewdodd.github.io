               <p>"Don't shove me" - she kept me there about a minute, and then said,</p>
               <p>"Now you may run after her;" I ran down into the street, and saw Frazer turning the corner into the next street - I followed, but when I got to the corner, I could see no more of her. I immediately went to Lambeth-street, and told Combes, the officer, and in the evening we went to look for them, and met them walking together in Whitechapel, going towards Aldgate church. Combes took them, and just before he got to the office, Frazer said to me,</p>
               <p>"Young man, I'll give you the three half crowns back, if you don't swear to us" - I told Combes, and he told me not to take it. I am certain they are the women. I was sober when I went to the house. I live at Chingford, and did not know this neighbourhood before.</p>

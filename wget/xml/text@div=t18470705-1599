                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant G</hi> 20.) On Saturday, the 5th of June, I received information which led me to a house in Radnor-street, St. Luke's—I went to a back room on the second floor—I found the two prisoners there, and two women, and another man came in afterwards—I knew the prisoners before—I told Watson I was a police-officer, and had come to take him into custody for uttering counterfeit coin—(I was not in uniform)—he</p>

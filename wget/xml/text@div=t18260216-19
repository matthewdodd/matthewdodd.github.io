On Saturday, the 14th of January, about half-past eight, or twenty minutes to nine o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came into the shop and asked the price of a silver shaving-box in the window - it was five guineas; he said it was too expensive - I took out a dressing case with silver boxes, and handed him the soap-box out of it, that came to 3l. 10s.; he said that was too much, and asked the price of a plated one, which we had not got; he said he was recommended by a customer of ours, and wished to see one about six guineas; I shewed him two or three - I got a dressing case which was fitted up at 16l., saying I could put glass boxes instead of silver, which would reduce it to nine guineas - all the fittings up were then safe; I shewed him another, he then said he would have the one at nine guineas, but wished to see the plated articles in it; I said it would take an hour or two to fit it up - he pressed very much to have them in - I went to the back of the shop to get them, and was there some time - when I brought them they would not fit the box; he said, "You can fit them up and send them to me at twelve o'clock;" and while he was giving his address, one of our workmen came in - he immediately left the shop, leaving his address, "Mr. Johnson, 13, Norfolk-street, Strand;" the instant he went out, in consequence of what the workman said to me, I looked and missed the articles stated in the indictment, which are worth 11l. 10s.; they were all safe two minutes before he left; he was about a quarter of an hour in the shop; I am positive he is the man - I have found none of the property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. LAW. Q. He went out immediately as the young man came in? A. Yes, in a minute or two, as soon as he gave his address - he was writing it when the workman came in - I am confident he is the man - when he was first taken, I saw him by a different light, and said if he had been in the same dress I should know him better, but I had a shade of doubt about him.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath did you not say you did not believe him to be the man? A. I did not; I said, if he was in the same dress I should know him better - but at that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182602160022"></xptr>>time he was in a disguised state - he had a loose handkerchief tied round his neck, it came over his chin, and he was quite florid in the face, which was not the case when he was in the shop, but I understood he was taken in a public-house; I pointed him out instantly from two other men who came into my shop with him - I discovered afterwards that they were officers, but did not then know it; Mr. Herring came in, told them to pull off their hats, and said, "Now, which of these three is the man?" and I pointed him out - I was confident of him - I did not express a doubt - I had a shade of doubt that night on account of his florid appearance.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that several depredations had been committed with goods of this sort? A. Yes; he was remanded, and one shopkeeper I know came forward, and could not identify him; I am confident he is the man - I had seen him at the shop window before he came in.</p>

            . I am a journeyman pocket-book maker. On the 14th of January, nearly at nine o'clock in the morning, I came into Mr. Lambe's shop, and saw the prisoner there for a minute or two - I saw nobody there but Lambe and the prisoner - he was a stranger, but I am positive he is the man; I went in pursuit of him within a minute or two of his leaving the shop, but could not find him; I saw him at Bow-street on the Tuesday morning after, and pointed him out in the office; I have no doubt whatever of him - when I went into the shop he was giving his address - I made an observation to Lambe when he went out - I heard him tell Lambe to send the things home.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He was a perfect stranger to you? A. Yes; the office was full of people - the officer touched me on the shoulder - I turned round and said, "That is the man;" he was among a dozen people - I did not see him come in - I was attending to another case, and the moment I saw him I recognised him - I was wiping my shoes on the mat when he was in the shop.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you go to No. 13, Norfolk-street? A. Yes; there was no such person as Johnson ever lived there.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Saturday, the 14th of January, at eleven o'clock in the morning, I was coming along Pall-mall, and met Lambe's servant - I went to the shop, Gonge and Lambe informed me of the robbery, and described the person to me; I met the prisoner the moment I came out of the shop - he answered their description - he was crossing from Northumberland-house to Messrs. Drummond's bank - I said, "Tom, I want to speak to you;" he said, "I am going sliding, master;" I said, "Tell your woman I won't keep you a minute;" (his girl was with him); he turned about two yards from me to speak to her, and off he ran as hard as he could - I was not two hundred yards from Lambe's - a great number of people were passing in the street; I went back to Lambe's and told them to attend at the office; I spoke to two or three officers, and on Monday night, the 16th, I found him in custody, and took him to Lambe's shop - the witness Lambe was in the shop - I told him I had got Rhodes, and to be very particular whether he was the man or not, and if he had any doubt to let him have it; when the prisoner was produced, he certainly expressed a little doubt, but at that time his dress was altered, his hair was combed straight over his forehead, different to what it generally is, and he kept spitting as if he was half and half - he had two handkerchiefs on his neck, different to the way he was dressed on Saturday morning; he was taken to Bow-street next morning, and the two witnesses swore positively to him; I was in the office - Gouge called me, and said,"There is the man;" and said he had no doubt whatever of him; there were about twenty persons in the office, prisoners and strangers, when he pointed him out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was he not at the bar? A. No, he was in custody, but a person coming into the office could not know that; he was on the platform.</p>
               <p>Q. When you met him, do you know that he ran away, except that you lost sight of him? A. I am sure he ran, but I could not tell which way - I did not see him run, but he was gone in a moment; when he was in the shop, I told all three to take off their hats - two officers were with him - it was a cold night; it is not uncommon to wear an extra handkerchief.</p>

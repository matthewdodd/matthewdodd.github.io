            . My master had been at work, and was gone to dinner; the prisoner came into the shop as my master had left his tools about; I put them up together; the prisoner took up one of them from the vice bench, and played with it, and presently said, Good bye, I am going. He had the tool under his coat. I said, do not go, Where is the tool you was playing with just now? He said, I have none. Then I took it out from under his apron. He pointed up to a knife, and said, What is the price of that? I said, one shilling. Said he, I have been at Birmingham, and can buy as good a one for sixpence. I said, you don't want any thing, you had better go about your business. I want to go, he put his hand behind him, and from under his apron took up this razor-case, with the things in it. I missed it directly. I goes to him, and said, you have got something else now. He said, no, I have not. He had his hands behind him, first he shewed me one, and then put that behind him, and shewed me the other. I went to feel behind him, and he ran away directly, and I after him, calling out, Stop him, and he was taken.</p>

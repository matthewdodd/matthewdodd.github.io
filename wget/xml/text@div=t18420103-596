                  </hi>. I am an architect, and live at No. 74, Old Broad-street. A little after one o'clock, on the morning of the 1st of January, I took a four-wheeled <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> on Ludgate-hill—it drove to Church<lb></lb>row, Newington—I was with two gentlemen—we did not all three come back—we left one gentleman at Church-row, and I was taking the other home—I rode to Church-row outside—the gentleman who went with the other, went inside—as we came back from Church-row, I was inside with my friend Mr. Cutler—I told the cab-man if he would stop at the first public-house that was open, I would give him something to drink for his civility and attention—he stopped at the Princess of Wales, at the corner of Princess-street, London-road—Mr. Cutler and me both got out of the cab, and went into the house—it was a gin-shop—there were, I should say, twenty people standing in front of the bar—I called for two glasses of stout, and a glass of rum for the cab-man—after paying for the articles, as I did not wish to take any change,—I asked for some tobacco—I gave 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the stout and rum, and then was asked for 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. more—I then gave 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the glasses of stout, I expect, were 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each, and the glass of rum made 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., but having asked for the tobacco, I paid it extra—I asked for it to avoid getting change from my inside pocket—I miscalculated the amount of the whole order, and to avoid taking change</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184201030160"></xptr>
               <p>out of my pocket I asked for some tobacco, with the hopes of relieving the affair altogether, because I did not wish to pay any more but the coppen I had in my pocket—I thought 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. would cover the whole—I did not wish to take any change—I believe I asked for a screw of tobacco: that is enough to fill a pipe with—I had not been smoking—I was going to smoke—I paid 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the screw—I paid my money at the bar—I asked whether it was correct—the boy behind the bar said it was—I then turned round to go out, and was immediately seized by one man who pot his arm across my face, and I was hustled by the mob—my coat was lifted up—one of them made a snatch at my pin—I caught him, and gave him a turn, and held him for some time—I saw a man at the door with an apron on, and a leather strap, and I sung out to him, "For G—sake shut the door, this man has stolen my pin"—I was hustled here and there—the door was open, and they were gone—I was not pushed out—the person did not shut the door as I desired—he let the men go instead of stopping them—the door was on the swing when we went in—the prisoner Hardy was there—he was the man that took my pin, and the one that I caught—the prisoner Gibbs was the man that put his hand or arm before my face, and I saw Bennett in the place—I certainly did not regard him is the scuffle more than seeing him at the very moment it took place, whether he took part in it I cannot say—I believe two sovereigns to be the value of my pin—I seized Hardy, and he was rescued by the mob.</p>

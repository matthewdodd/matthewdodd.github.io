                  </hi>. I live at 58, Middleton-street, Clerkenwell, and am a furrier. On Tuesday, 16th Feb., the prisoner came into my employment, as errand-boy—he stopped two days and a half, and then left without giving me notice—the day before he left I sent him into my back-room for a pair of boots, and he stayed there longer than was necessary—on the Thursday he went again, for my watch—in the afternoon he went to his dinner, and did not come back—on the Saturday he came for his wages—I asked him why he had stopped away—he said he had gone back to his old master, but he would come back to me—I objected at first, but afterwards said I would take him—I afterwards learned that he did not go back to his old master—while he was there on the Saturday evening I saw my watch safe over the mantelpiece, and the other thing was in a drawer in the back-room, but I do not know when I had seen it safe—I went out of the room, to go into the back room, and had to go down-stairs—he was about two steps down-stairs when I went into the back room—I came back in five minutes, and the watch was gone—he was to have come into my employment again on the Monday, and did not come—I did not see him again till he was in custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in Mr. Dansee's employ while the prisoner was there. I met him on 17th April, in Percival-street, as I was going to my dinner—I asked him why he did not come back—he said, because he <hi rend="italic">liked</hi>—I asked whether he had been to work—he said he had not—I walked with him down Percival-street, to see if I could see a policeman—I could not, and he ran away from me—that was at half-past one o'clock—as I returned, at a quarter-past two, I saw him again—he ran down Allen-street, Goswell-street—he was stopped, and given into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Charles Mott, a confectioner. In July last I was placed in charge of No. 5, Goldhawk Cottages, Shepherd's-bush—on 22nd Aug., about half-past three o'clock, I heard a knocking at the door, went to the window, and saw four or five men getting over the front railings—I heard others breaking the kitchen-window—I was very much alarmed, and locked the street-door, and locked myself and child in the dining-room—I opened the window and called "Police!" five or six times——the men got in; I heard them breaking the doors open, and the staircase-mndow—they hammered at the door where I was—I begged them not to break it—I opened it; they took the keys from behind the door, and said they had got them and would keep them—Tearle seemed to have the com<lb></lb>mand—he told the others I was to go out directly—one of them took hold of my arm, and said he must very politely hand me into the street—I went out.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a gardener, of Kensington. On 22nd Aug. Tearle came to the Black Lion—he spoke to several cabmen there, and said he was going to break into a house—eight men and bis lawyer, who had come in an omnibus, followed him—I went behind—they stopped at the Mail Coach, and then went on to the house—Tearle got over the gate, broke the kitchen-window with his stick, and got in—they all followed him—one of them had a chisel or crowbar—I told Mr. Wells.</p>

I am the freeholder of this house—it was to let in June and Tearle proposed to take it—the rent was 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I agreed to take 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he brought this paper, ready written—I signed it on the 7th July—the fixtures were to be scheduled and attached to it—I considered it was not finally settled until I had inquired of the references—Mr. Tozer told me something, and I abandoned all notion of taking Tearle as a tenant—on 24th July I was on the premises, bottling some wine—Tearle came, went up stairs, threw down a handkerchief on the carpet, left it there, locked the door, and said, "I have taken possession"—there was 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of furniture there—I said I was not satisfied, and wanted further references—I said I had fond that he was a swindler and everything that was bad—he said that had nothing to do with it, he had got possession, and I had signed the agreement—he went out, and returned in half an hour, with a man named Chopping and consulted with him—they left, and 1 went to my agent's—as I refund, Tearle was at a public-house near—I went to the house—Tearle came with Chopping and Williams—I would not let Williams in—they were very tipsy—they asked for some wine, I gave them some—I left the house in Mrs. Mott's charge—I afterwards went, and found the kitchen window broken, a caiman was sitting on the balcony railing, and others lying on the drawing-room floor—I did not go in, but went to my solicitor—I afterwards found the locks broken, the keys gone, a quantity of stones and a hammer lying in the drawing-room, and some stakes from the trees in the garden—5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. damage was done, and my tenants on each side were in a state of alarm.</p>

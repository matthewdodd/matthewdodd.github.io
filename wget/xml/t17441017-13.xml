            . The 22d of last month I lost two coats, and several other things, which I cannot remember; the Prisoner lived in the same house. I have an apartment up two pair of stairs, and she had an apartment below - The house is let out in tenements. My wife sent me word she was robbed, and when I came home the house was quite<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174410170018"></xptr> turned upside down, and all the things lost which are in the inventory.</p>

            . I went out just at six o'clock in the morning, and left no body in the house but the Prisoner, and some sailors, one was called Davy; and when I came home she was reading a news paper; said I, I am robbed; says she, How can you be robbed? I sent for my husband, and when he came, I said, John, I am robbed, I am robbed of all I have in the world; all my husband's wigs and hats were gone, of which my husband had four; she gave me this wig of my husband's. She would have gone out of the house, and said, who dare touch her. She said, it was impossible I should be robbed for no body else had been there, and she had not been out all day long. She said afterawards she had given these things to Davy; for he lay with her ever since she had been in the house, which was about a month.</p>

            . When Mrs. Flowers came home, she complained of being robbed, (my wife had seen two sea-faring men come out of the house) Lord, Sir, says the Prisoner, How could she be robbed without my knowledge, for I have not been out of the house all day. When I heard her say that, I advised Mrs. Flowers to secure her, for she must have been privy to the going out of the things. And then she said she had been out about three o'clock in the afternoon, but she could not tell where she had been.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the daughter of Richard Soar, of 67, Kingsland-road. On 19th June, I saw the prisoner in the shop—he took the glass from where it stood and went out—I went after him, stopped him, took the glass from him, and said, "You have stolen that glass from that shop"—he said he had not—he was brought back by a policeman.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did you see me when I first came into the shop? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; not until you had the glass in your hand—you made no noise, but I hap<lb></lb>pened to turn my head—you did not ask the price of the glass—you did not give it up to me before you left the shop.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I went into the shop to ask the price of the glass as I had an order for one of that kind; I took it up and looked at it, and seeing no one in the shop I knocked: the witness came forward and took it from me; I asked the price; she would not tell me, and I walked away; I should not have been so foolish as to take it in broad daylight.</p>

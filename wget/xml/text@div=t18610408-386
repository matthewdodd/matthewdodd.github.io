                  </hi>. I am a grocer in Church-street, Woolwich—on 28th February last, about 9 o'clock, the prisoner came in at the doorway of my shop, took a piece of bacon weighing 10 lbs., and ran away with it—it was on a bacon-stand, inside the shop, near the door—I saw his face dis<lb></lb>tinctly—I was closer to him than I am to you, and where he took the bacon from was close to a strong gas-light—he was not one minute about this—he came up to the door, looked me in the face, and then ran away—I followed him as far as I could, but did not overtake him—I gave a description of him to Newell, the officer, and he brought him to me on the Monday afterwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did not you say before the Magistrate that I dropped the bacon when I was first in custody? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—the description I gave to the police of you was, a young man, slightly built, pale, and a little flushed in the face.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, R</hi> 59). I took the prisoner into custody on Monday evening, 4th March, from the description given to me by Mr. West on Saturday, 2d March—I told him I. wanted him to go to Mr. West's shop, where there had been some bacon stolen—it was close by—he said, "You have made a mistake this time"—I then took him into Mr. West's, and asked him if he knew anything of this young man, and he said, "Yes, that is him that took the bacon."</p>

            . Sitting in my Shop on Tuesday Night, the 16th of November last, I saw a Man's Hand lift up the Sash, and take the Silk out of the Window; I ran out, and cry'd, Stop Thief. The Prisoner ran into an Alehouse Entry, and dropp'd the Goods.</p>

            . About a Quarter past Six, I heard my Mistress cry, Stop Thief. I follow'd the Prisoner into an Entry, and took him in a Corner, as he was shuffling the Silk from him; and while I secur'd him, a Gentleman came in and took up the Silk.</p>

               <p>Justice Du Veil.

I would have had him to have been an Evidence then, but was inform'd a Bill was found against him, so that it prov'd too late.

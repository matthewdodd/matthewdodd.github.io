I was at the Spotted Dog, West Ham, on 26th July, on business—I heard a snap, put my hand to my pocket, looked down, and saw a man's hand go from my pocket—I collared him, and said that he had got my watch; he sold he had not—he was as close to me as he could stand—there was another man on my right, who was taken into custody and discharged—the watch has not been found—I am quite mire I saw the prisoner's hand leave my pocket, and that my watch was safe before, because I generally carry my thumb in my pocket—the watch was worth 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

I was at the Spotted Dog, on 26th July, and heard someone call out that a watch had been lost—I made my way to the place, and found Kemp holding the prisoner by the collar; he gave him to my custody—another man was also taken, who was afterwards discharged—the watch has not been found.</p>

He could have seen the watch in my hand if I had it; they searched me when they got me out of the crowd, but they found nothing. They made me undress myself at the station, but found nothing. The other man could pay for a solicitor, and he got off. I could have got the case settled at ford, and should not have got more than three months'; but I preferred to wait in prison a month to be tried.</p>

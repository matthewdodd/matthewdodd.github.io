                  </hi>. About half-past 10, on the morning of 9th June, I was standing in front of Guildhall—there was a slight crowd—I saw the two prisoners—Murray pushed against me, and kept doing so for some time—I put up my hand, caught hold of his wrist, and he had the end of my chain in his hand—my watch was attached to the chain before that—it was broken off—he then put his other hand behind him—Manning was close behind him, with his hands in front of him—I did not see whether he had the watch—I called for a policeman—Murray said, "I have not got your watch; you may give me in charge"—I have not seen it since.</p>

I am a clerk, and was outside Guildhall on this day—I saw the prosecutor there; he was looking over my shoulder—I also saw the two prisoners before that, knocking about—I heard them mumbling; and they forced a way between me and Mr. Sault—I then saw Murray's hand on the prosecutor's waistcoat, then on his guard, and then there was a snatch—at that moment Mr. Sault said, "You have got my watch"—Murray then put his hand behind him suddenly, and Manning moved his at the same moment—I did not see the watch; the hands covered it—just then something fell at my feet, and I picked up the handle of the watch split open—I gave it to Mr. Sault.</p>

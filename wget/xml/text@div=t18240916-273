On the 6th of August my husband's watch was in the back parlour of one of the shops. I had left that shop a few minutes to go to the other, and on returning I saw the prisoner coming out of the back parlour; he came into the shop and asked for something, but what he I said don't know. I enquired what he wanted there; he said,</p>
               <p>"Nothing, mistress; I have not touched any thing." I caught hold of him, he struggled, and I began to scream out. He took this watch from his pocket or his bosom, I cannot say which, and laid it in the window.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went on the 6th of August and took the prisoner; the last witness had detained him. He said he hoped we would excuse him; he had nothing about him.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner put in a written defence, stating that he had no idea of the watch being taken by any one; there were other persons in the shop at the time, and it must have been deposited by some one else in the place where it was found; he had nothing about him.</p>
               <p>HANNAH CLARKE re-examined. Q. Are you quite sure the prisoner took the watch from some part his person - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>One witness gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

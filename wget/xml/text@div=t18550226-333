                  </hi>. I know the prisoner. In June, 1854,1 entered into partnership with him; I supplied the capital, 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., at first—he did not put any capital into the concern; he introduced the printing apparatus, the type and presses—the terms appear in the partnership deed, as far as I know (<hi rend="italic">the partnership deed, dated 5th June</hi>, 1854, <hi rend="italic">was here put in</hi>)—in addition to the agreement contained in the deed, it was agreed that whatever articles of printing he had on his premises were to be used for the purposes of the partnership—I have had letters from him, which I think will convey the idea—no document was drawn up about that—(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>., <hi rend="italic">for the prisoner, objected to this evidence on the ground that no verbal agreement could alter the effect of the deed The</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">considered that evidence could not be given of anything that varied the deed, or that qualified it, because it would speak for itself; but that a subsequent agreement, inconsistent with the deed, could not be affected by it, and could, therefore, be given in evidence.</hi>)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

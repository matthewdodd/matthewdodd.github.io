               <p>who lives in Spital-square. The prisoner was his porter—I remember Friday, the 20th of October last—my young masters, Mr. Bennett's sons, dined at home that day at five o'clock—the prisoner and I took tea together that day, as soon as I could get the gentlemen's dinner up, but he did not stay to finish his tea before he went out—I had spoken about going out that day, and about one o'clock he asked me at what time I should go—he asked me that at one o'clock, and at five o'clock also—I told him at one o'clock that I was going as soon as I had cleared away the dinner things—I gave him that answer on both occasions—he had wished me, during the whole of the week, to go out with a friend of his—after dinner was over, the two Mr. Bennetts went out—that was a little before six o'clock—the prisoner and myself were then the only persons left on the premises—we had not finished tea at that time—he went out without finishing his tea—before he went out he said I was to be sure to be ready to go out at the time he should come back, and that would be seven o'clock—he went out as soon as the gentlemen went out, that was before six o'clock—he went almost directly they did—I cannot say to a minute—he returned about twenty-five minutes after seven o'clock—I was then ready to go out, all but my bonnet—he asked me if I would go to my late employers, where I had lived eight years, to ask for a situation for him—they live at King's cross—I knew he was about to leave—King's-cross is a long distance from Spital-square—I told him I could not go, it was too late to go so far—it was a quarter to eight o'clock when I did go out, and I came in at nine o'clock—I shut the door after me when I went out, and tried it after me—I had told him that I should be back at nine o'clock, and he asked me to get something for supper—when I returned at nine o'clock I found the door still closed—the prisoner let me in, and I saw him in the scullery, soon after my re turn, cleaning some harness-irons—I went into the scullery Boon after him—while I was in the scullery, and he was cleaning the harness, some man passed the window, and said, I say, halloo, when you have done with that, hang it up"—I asked the prisoner who that was, and he laughed at me—that window looks out into the street, by the side of the street-door—the window was not open—the bar was down, but the shutters were shut—I could not see out, but I could hear the voice—I could hear distinctly what was said—there was a light in the scullery.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were the shutters in such a state as to enable any body outside to see what was going on inside? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; they could not see what was going on—they could see a light, and they might, if the shutters were not quite closed, see any one pass, but not distinctly see who it was—a person outside could not see a person in the scullery—it was the voice of a man that I heard—it is a very quiet place—I can easily hear what passes—I had noticed that the warehouse doors were both shut before I went out—they were as they usually are when my masters have locked them, and they were in that state, as far as I observed, when I returned, but I did not take particular notice—Mr. Bennett's sons returned about ten o'clock—I let them in, and they went up stairs to bed—I and the prisoner remained below in the kitchen till about twelve o'clock—the prisoner fastened the street door that night—I never had any thing to do with it—I used to light him to do it—I did not light him on this occasion—I was in the kitchen, and heard him fasten it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came you not to light him on this night? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He went up before I was quite ready—he went up in the dark—I followed him immediately after, and heard him fasten the front door, and put the bar down—we then both of us went up stairs to bed—I went into his room to turn</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183712110035"></xptr>
               <p>the bed down, and afterwards saw him close his room door—I got up about seven o'clock next morning—when I went out of my own bed-room, I called, "Richard"—he answered me, and said he should not get up yet—he answered me at once when I called him—I proceeded down stairs, and when I got down within four stairs, I saw the warehouse door open—that was the lower warehouse door, at the top of the kitchen stairs—I went up stairs, called the young gentlemen, and told them the warehouse door was open; and after that I called "Richard"—I called him three times—I was two or three stairs up from the gentlemen's bed-room door when I called him—he made no answer, and so I went quite up—I was eight or nine stairs from his room—I called him three times, and he did not answer me, and then I went up—I called out loud—finding I could not get an answer I opened his bed-room door, and told him to get up directly—he was in bed as usual—he came down in about one or two minutes after—he was then quite dressed, all but his boots—I do not think he had his boots on—I told him the warehouse door was open—he did not say any thing to that, but passed by me, and went down directly—he then called out for me to call Mr. Francis Bennett—I judged by his voice that he was then in the warehouse—the gentlemen then went down; and after they went down and found out what had happened, the prisoner said to me it was a strange thing how they got in, and be said, "They roust have got in at the ware house window"—I said, "How can that be?"—he said, "Why, I don't know I am sure; I opened the shutters myself, what are open."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On the previous night had you observed a white bag any where? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; there was a white bag in the little room adjoining the kitchen—there were two bags, one black and one white—the prisoner used those bags—he generally carries the linen up to Compton-terrace every Thurs day night—I had given him the black bag to carry it in on Thursday night—the white bag remained, and I saw it on the Thursday evening—I do not recollect seeing it afterwards, and I think it is lost—I cannot find it—I have not missed any thing else out of that room—the prisoner was in the habit of taking the goods out in those bags.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were not you in the habit of using them also? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I never used them in my life.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PHILLIPS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you first called the prisoner up, did not he tell you he did not intend to get up for half an hour? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—he said, "I shall not get up yet"—those were his very words—I am not aware that I ever said his answer was, "I shall not get up till the half hour"—I did not follow him up stairs, the night before, quite immediately—I was in the kitchen a minute or two—I never said I followed him up immediately, that I am aware of—I will not swear I have not said so—I have been in Mr. Bennett's service nine months on the 10th of next month—I found the prisoner in his service when I went there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have the prisoner and you been good friends? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, we have not—we have had a great many quarrels about his being out so late at night, but he has been down on his knees, and begged me not to tell Mr. Bennett of it—he asked me for my company once, but I found he was engaged to a great many—he wished to pay his addresses to me—I did not refuse him at once—I told him I should see how he went on—I have told him that a great many times—it was not long after that I found out he was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183712110036"></xptr>
               <p>engaged to a great many—he said he was not—I told him I should not have his company, and he asked me again—I never thought any thing of him particularly—I heard he was engaged to one or two—he told me him self there were a great many came after him, but he did not think any thing of them—he said Mr. Bennett's nurse-maid came running after him to the house—I have seen her come after him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How soon after you told him you would see how he went on, did you find out his engagements to a great many others? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I knew it be fore, when he asked me for my company—I knew he was engaged, and told him so—by seeing how he went on, I meant providing he gave them up—after that Elizabeth Lester came to see him, and several others—I never cared any thing about him—Lester is Mr. Bennett's nurse-maid—she used to come, and she said she would come running after him un known to master—I did not tell my master of her coming—I did not wish to make mischief, and I gave him up—I would have allowed him to keep company with me if he had given up the others, if he went on in the way I should wish.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is it true that you never cared any thing about him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not like his way of going on—he was out sometimes all night, and sometimes till three or four o'clock in the morning—I have had quarrels with him about other women—he was unwell once while I was in the house, and had twelve leeches on—I put them on myself, and attended on him for two nights.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. DOANE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you do that with your master's knowledge? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I sat up with him two nights.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">PHILLIPS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now attend—did he not tell you in the beginning, if you did not go out that night that he himself should go out again? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—when he came home, at twenty-five minutes after seven o'clock, he said, Now are you going; if not, tell me, and I will go out again?"</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">DOANE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long did you live in your former place? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not live there a great while, on account of the family being unfortunate, and failing—the situation before that I lived eight years at—I am still in Mr. Bennett's service, at his private house, No. 26, Compton-terrace—that is where Elizabeth Lester lived, who came after the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the prosecutor's sons. His Christian name is Henry—he has a house at No. 10, Spital-square—it is in the liberty of Norton Falgate—he carries on the business of a silk and velvet manufacturer, and resides himself at Islington—I and my brother live in the house of business in Spital-square—our premises are at the cor ner of the square, and are entered by one door—there are two warehouses on the ground floor, a front and a back one—as you enter the street door, the door leading into the front warehouse is on the left hand—it may be about two yards from the hall door, not more—if you proceed to the end of the passage and turn to the left by another passage you come to the door which opens to the back warehouse—there is a door inside opening between the two warehouses—after business is over we lock the front warehouse door inside—there is a spring to that door which rings a bell if opened inward—we leave the key in the lock after locking it inside—I locked up the premises on the night in question—I did as I have stated that night about half-past five o'clock—I locked the front warehouse door inside, and left the key in the lock—I then proceeded into the back ware house—there are two iron safes there—one safe is inside the other—I locked them both—there is a drawer inside the inner safe—that was locked,</p>

               <p>and the key of it was in my father's possession—I saw that the window shutters and bolts about the premises were all secured—I then locked the back warehouse door on the outside—that door leads into the passage to the left which communicates with the hall—there is only one entrance to the street—I locked up the key of the back warehouse door in one of the drawers in our bed-room—my brother and I sleep in the same room—there are two keys to the safes—I deposited them in the back of a till belonging to my desk, in the upper warehouse on the first floor—the upper warehouse is over the back warehouse—there is a communication from one to the other by a small staircase—there was money kept in the desk where I put the keys—the drawer is about a foot and a half long—I should think it would be necessary in order to get at the keys to pull the drawer out nearly to its extreme length—we dined that day at five o'clock—I locked the ware houses after I had dined—I had been round the greatest portion of the house that afternoon about a quarter of an hour before I went to dinner (about a quarter before five o'clock)—that was after business had closed—I cannot say exactly whether it was after the front door had been shut—I went over the greater part of the premises—it was to look for something that was missing—the foreman and a lad accompanied me—it was quite light at the time—we have work people who come to our premises with work and to fetch it—they come to the back part of the premises, on the first floor, over the back warehouse—I searched all the front part of the premises and the greater portion of the back—I searched the part the workmen are in the habit of coming to—the dwelling-house is not entirely separated from the part used for business—they are on different floors—there is a door as you go upstairs which you have to pass through before you leave the business premises to get to the dwelling-house part—it has a spring which causes it to shut of itself—there is also a spring to it which rings an alarm-bell—I searched all the parts of the premises below that door on this evening, and I did not find any person in the place then—my brother and I went out directly I locked up the warehouse—it might be about twenty minutes to six o'clock—we let ourselves out—I found the outer door closed when we went out, and I closed it after me, I am quite positive—my brother and I were generally in the habit of going out after dinner, and usually returned about ten o'clock—we returned rather before ten o'clock that night—Susannah Baker let us in—I noticed that the front warehouse door was closed when I came in—my brother and I proceeded to bed directly—we did not lock our bed-room door—I was not disturbed at ail in the night—I was alarmed about seven o'clock by Baker, and on proceeding down stairs I found the front warehouse door open, and the spring inside communicating with the bell, turned up—the key was in the lock—it did not appear to have been at all forced, but as if it had been opened from the inside—I had noticed that door closed at ten o'clock the night before.</p>

               <p>my father had the key—I did not find a key in that lock—I saw a small key lying on the counter, but it was not in the lock—on applying that key to the lock of the drawer I found it would enter but not turn—the drawer had not been opened—that small key appeared to me to have been recently filed, so as to enable it to go into the key hole—I have the key here, and the drawer too—this does appear to me to have been recently filed—it goes into the key-hole, but will not turn—I found some skeleton keys, crow bars, and dark lanterns spread about—I then looked at the door of the back warehouse, which was wide open—there did not appear to have been any force used to that door—I then proceeded to my desk in the upper warehouse, and found the top of the desk forced off and prised up, by which means the drawer could be got at, but the desk had not been opened—that would enable the parties to get the keys of the safes from the drawer—there is a flap to the desk itself—that was not interfered with—there was about 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or less in the fore part of that drawer—the greatest portion of that was gone—there was a half-sovereign, a fourpenny-piece, and some copper left—I found the keys of the safes in the same part of the drawer as I had left them—I brought the key of the lower back warehouse down with me—I had it in the drawer of my bed-room, where I had put it the evening before—I found that drawer locked as I had left it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the brother of last witness. I dined with him on this day, and returned with him about ten o'clock at night—next morning I was alarmed by the witness Baker—I came down first, and observed the prisoner standing at the street door—the front door was unfastened—it had been fastened by a bolt at the top, another at the bottom, a chain in the middle, and a bar which goes into the ground in the middle—it is a great cross-bar—there was also a lock to the door—the lock must have been undone, because the door was ajar, but I did not go to the door—the removing of those fastenings would make a considerable noise—I can always hear them removed in my bed-room of a morning—I have always heard them—I did not hear them on that Saturday morning—I had seen some inferior velvets on the counter of the back warehouse on the Friday evening before I had dined—I saw them on the following morning—they were in the same state then, except that two pieces of paper, which were put on the top to keep the dust off, were on the ground—that would enable a person to see the quality of them—I do not know who opened the warehouse shutters that morning—I did not see my brother open them—I did not hear any noise from the dog that night—it always used to bark very loud when any strange noise occurred, or any stranger appeared—when the policeman came we found various crow-bars and other things—the policeman is ill—I have seen one of the keys that was found—that key goes into the lock of the drawer exactly—it has been filed.</p>

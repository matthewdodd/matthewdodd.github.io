About five weeks before I was before the Magistrate (I do not know the date), I was standing before the door of No. 1, Thomas-street, where Richard Dart, my brother-in-law, lives, when a dead animal came against my face—I stooped down to pick up a <hi rend="italic">bit</hi> of mortar to <hi rend="italic">heave</hi> at James Carver, and instead of hitting him it hit the prisoner, who was standing against Mrs. Good right's window just below No. 1—he came and hit me twice in the head, but I took no notice of that—his daughter came from Mrs. Frewin's, the chandler's shop, and called me names not fit for any gentlemen to hear in Court, and then went to the stall to get a mug of water—my mother heard me <hi rend="italic">rowing</hi>, and came out to take my part—she caught hold of the prisoner's hand to save me from being knocked about, and he took and knocked her down—he hit her under the left breast twice—I did not take much notice what sort of blows they were—she fainted away, and Mary Ann Dartled her indoors—I went in doors with her; she was lying on the bed, and had fainted away—she complained of the prisoner hitting her in her left side—she was taken to the workhouse next day.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. On 9th July, I think it was I was called to attend the deceased; I found her sitting up in a chair in the room, complaining of great pain in her side—I examined the place, and found it very much inflamed, and bruised—my impression was that she had received some direct injury—I asked her if she had received a kick or a blow, but she did not reply—I saw her afterwards, daily—she was removed to the House by the relieving officer, and was under his care when she died—I assisted Mr. King in making a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination of her body on the day after her death, which was about five or six weeks after the injury—we found the lungs in a very unhealthy state, the right lung particularly was filled with purulent matter, the kidneys were diseased, the liver having that nutmeg appearance of persons addicted to drink, and also the kidneys—we examined internally, where I saw the external injury, and found an internal abscess of the pectoral muscle of the chest; but the ribs and the <hi rend="italic">periastium</hi> were quite healthy—such an abscess as that might be the effect of external violence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Tell us whether you can trace any connection between the blow and the death of the woman? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In a person so very unhealthy as she was, a blow might excite an abscess of that kind, or it might not; in an unhealthy person it very probably would—the abscess may have been excited by the blow—death was caused by the abscess, and not by the disorder of the viscera, certainly not—I cannot say whether the abscess arose from the blow, or from great derangement of health; but she had no abscess when I saw her on 9th July—it may have arisen from the blow; it was in the same place where I observed the blow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You found her in a general state of disease? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; she was a very unhealthy woman—she gave me the appearance of a person of drunken habits—the abscess might have occurred independent of any blow; that is, looking at her general constitution—she died from the effects of the abscess, from the exhaustion—there was certainly no abscess when I saw her—there was chronic disease of the kidneys, they were not inflamed, and chronic disease of the lungs, but nothing of an active character—I cannot say the abscess was caused by the blow—while I was attending her she had no abscess—there was nothing to cause the abscess, except the violence.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, in the parish of Camberwell, and have had considerable experience in my profession. The deceased came under my charge on 13th July—she was suffering from a very extensive abscess on the left side, which was the result of acute inflammation—there was at that time no external appearance of any injury or bruise—I after<lb></lb>wards assisted at the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination of her body—there were marks of chronic disease in various parts of her body—if she had received two blows on the left breast on 8th July, that would account for the abscess I found on 13th—there was an external livid mark on 13th; there was a redness—the mark of a bruise would be very quickly absorbed; I think it might have been ab<lb></lb>sorbed</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185210250077"></xptr>
               <p>in that time—the redness was not what I call inflammation—I attribute her death to the effect produced by the abscess, coupled with general weak<lb></lb>ness of constitution; the immediate cause was hectic fever, which arose from the abscess, and diarrhoea set in, and vomiting—I attribute the abscess to an injury of some kind inflicted, but an abscess may certainly come on spon<lb></lb>taneously—there was no connection between the disease of the liver and the abscess—it is not unusual for a person to have an abscess; it happens very frequently—she would be no doubt less likely to recover from the abscess from being an unhealthy subject.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Can you form a judgment whether the abscess was from the diseased state of her body, or from a blow? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say more than this, that if I had not heard what I have heard to-day respecting the matter, I should be inclined to impute it to the general deranged state of health—it has occurred frequently for a person in that disordered state to have an abscess—if I had found her with the abscess, and had heard nothing about a blow, I should not have been at all surprised.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you attend the deceased up to the time of her death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; she died on 27th Aug., about six weeks after the alleged injury—in my judgment, this abscess might have taken place in that diseased body, independent of any blow.</p>

The Counsel for the King pleaded hard against the Prisoner: The sum of the Evidence was thus, that the Prisoner and his Wife going home through Chancery-lane to his own House about Eleven a Clock at Night, the Deceased meeting them in the Street, Justled his Wife, upon which Words arose between them, and afterward Blows: It was proved in behalf of the Prisoner that the Deceased gave the first Blow, and drew his Sword, and that the Sword of the Prisoner was never Drawn, but in the Scuffle they all three fell upon the Ground, where the Deceased received his Wound, and was afterward carried home to the Prisoners House, where he Died. Several Witnesses were on both sides, and some of them were positive that the Deceased Gentleman should say upon his Death-bed, that Ridley Killed him with his own Sword; the Constable deposed that the Gentleman should say it was his own fault. The Tryal lasted a considerable time; and in conclusion he was brought in <rs id="t16880425-43-verdict217" type="verdictDescription">

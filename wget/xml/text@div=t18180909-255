            . I am a patrol, and belong to Bow-street. On the 12th of August, between twelve and one o'clock in the morning, I was returning home to Little Chelsea, I saw the prisoner in company with a man, and listened to their conversation; she went towards the turnpike, before she got there she tried the gate of a house, but could not open it. She went to the toll-house, and said, "Halloo, tollman, have you got any porter?" He made no answer; she then went on. I passed her, stood at the corner, and heard her say, if you will give me two-pence I will get some porter, I have got the rest; they are up at the Princess of Wales, which is about two hundred yards off. Hearing no answer, I came back, and stood where I could see her and the prosecutor; she put her hand into his apron pocket, and took something out; she made use of a very indecent expression, and said, I shall go and get the porter, and immediately come to the door. I took her, and said she had been robbing the man; she said she had not. He awoke while I was struggling with her. I found five shillings, two sixpences, and 81/2d. in copper, an old halfpenny, and a pocket piece, in her hand. The man said he could swear to the old halfpenny, the pocket-piece, and a crooked halfpenny.</p>

             re-examined. I never saw the prisoner before. I can swear to three of the copper pieces, having had them sometime. I lost the monies stated in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going to Fulham to receive 8s., I saw Gordon at eight o'clock, very drunk, he gave me the crooked halfpence to get some porter, the publican would not take them; as I returned I went to the tollhouse, and tried to awoke him, as I came out I was taken.</p>
               <p>JOHN MANSHIP. I am toll-collector at Kensington, and lodge opposite the turnpike-gate. I was standing at my door, and saw several things go by without paying; I also saw a man go into the toll-house afterwards; I told a gentleman I would go and see if there was any money, as the man might take it. I went in and awoke the prosecutor, I could only hear halfpence rattle in his apron, I could hear no silver rattle-this was at ten o'clock at night; he could not have taken 5s. from that time until one o'clock. Next morning he told me he had lost 5s. in copper; I said I had taken it over to my lodgings to take care of - He was very drunk.</p>

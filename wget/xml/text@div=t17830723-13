               <p>Court. They were not removed only moved? - No, my Lord, he took up one buckle and asked the price of them, I told him they were four guineas, says he I will not have any silver buckles, they are too dear for me, shew me some plated ones, I did so putting the last drawers away; he took this pair of buckles, I saw him take them off the drawer, I saw his arm go while I was putting the drawer back, and the buckles were gone, he said he wanted to see some fashionable plated buckles, I said I will shew you some, I shut my glasses and went and shut the shop door, I caught him by the collar and said, you rascal, now I have caught you, you have got a good pair of silver buckles in your left-hand pocket in your coat, no, he said, he had not; a gentleman came and knocked at the door, I led the prisoner by the collar to the door and opened it, the gentleman said what is the matter, says I, I have just caught a thief, says he, there is Sir Sampson Wright going by the door, shall I call him, I begged he would, he did call him and brought him into the shop, I told him what was the matter, he told me to send for a constable, and he came, the prisoner was searched, but the buckles I told out of his pocket to convince the gentlemen that I knew where they were, and they were where I said they were, in his pocket, I took them out by Sir Sampson's orders, the constable ordered him to be searched, this was all in my shop, when he was searched the constable found a knife and some money, pretty near 4 l. the Justice told us to go to Bow-street immediately, we did so.</p>

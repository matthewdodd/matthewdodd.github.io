                  </hi>. I am the wife of Ebenezer Foster, of 2, Renfrew Road, Kennington Lane—on Saturday evening, 24th February, I went with my daughter to the Homerton Station and took tickets by the North London Railway—we got into a second-class carriage; there was no one else in it—I had a purse in my pocket containing a half-sovereign, a half-crown, a 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece, a shilling, and some coppers—I was sitting with my back to the engine near the door—there was scarcely any room between the door and myself—when we got to the Shoreditch Station the prisoners got into the carriage—Wilson pushed between me and the door and sat beside me, and spread a parcel out on his lap—it came a little way over my dress—Jones sat on the other side of me, and my daughter opposite me—on arriving at Broad Street, in consequence of what my daughter said to me, I felt for my purse, and it was gone—the prisoners had got out of the carriage at that time—my daughter went after them, and I followed her—she laid her hand on Wilson's shoulder and said "You have got my mother's purse," and we went into the cloak-room with the prisoners and a porter.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the daughter of the last witness—last Saturday week I was with her in a second-class carriage going from Homerton to Broad Street—on arriving at Shoreditch the prisoners got in, one of them sat on one side of my mother and one on the other; I was opposite—I saw Wilson with a parcel, which he pushed over my mother's lap—he leant forward, and 1 thought he was putting his hand in her pocket, and as they got out I asked her if she had got her purse—she felt in her pocket and said she had not—I then went after Wilson, put my hand on his shoulder, and said "You have my mother's purse"—he said "That is a strong asser<lb></lb>tion to make"—I said "Perhaps so, but you don't pass this barrier until I know"—he then went to the cloak-room with the porter and my mother, and Jones walked on—I went after him and stopped him on the stairs, and said "You are wanted here"—he turned round and smacked me with his—he came back—he said "It's very hard to keep us here, we do not know each other"—a porter came and produced the purse, and I said it was my mother's—I had seen it in Wilson's hand as he got out of the carriage.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I said at the police-court that I saw something in his hand that looked like my mother's purse—I said to Wilson "One of you have it"—Jones was standing by his side—there were very few people on the platform—they were both together till they got to the barrier—the purse was empty when it was brought back.</p>

I am foreman porter at the Broad Street Station—I was on the departure platform on the 24th February when the 8.44 train arrived—I noticed the two prisoners coming down the platform in a hurried manner—Wilson had a parcel done up in a very careless manner—I saw Miss Foster running up to Wilson—she laid her hand on his shoulder and said "You have my mother's purse"—I immediately went up—Jones was standing immediately behind Wilson—Miss Poster said "I charge you both with taking my mother's purse"—I took Wilson into the cloak-room, and thought Jones was following—I looked round and saw him on the stairs—Miss Foster put her hand on his collar and requested him to come back—I saw his arm go up very sharp; I thought he was striking her, and I hurried to her and brought him back to the cloak-room—I left him in charge of one of our men, and on going down the stairs to fetch a constable I found this purse, about four steps down, just at the back of where Jones was stopped—it was open and empty—I took it back, and the prosecutrix described it and identified it as hers—Jones said he thought it was very hard he should be detained as he was a stranger to the other man.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I saw something fall on the stairs, it was not the purse, it was a rose from the young lady's breast—the purse was found about 20 yards from where Wilson had been; he had not been near the stairs—there were not many persons on the platform.</p>

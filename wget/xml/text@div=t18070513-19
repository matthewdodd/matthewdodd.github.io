               <p>MR. BISHOP. I am a bricklayer, I live at 42, Great Coram-street. On the 1st of May, between the hours of twelve and one at noon, I saw the prisoner go into the prosecutor's house; I could not swear whether it was No. 36 or 37, I am sure it was one; I saw him come out with something under his coat; I took hold of the prisoner, and took him home to my house; I told my wife to go and ask this person whether they had lost any thing, the woman came over and said they had lost a gown.</p>
               <p>(The property produced and identified).</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was walking down Coram-street, I was not on the side of the way of that house at all, I was going to Islington; I was in want of a house for a gentleman, he had applied to me to get him one; there were several houses had paper in their windows, that the houses were to be sold; I went into a house, I found this gown, I tied it up in a handkerchief and brought it away; when I was in that house he came in, he said do you live in that house, I said I do not; I came to look at it for a gentleman; he then said, you had not that bundle when you came in, I said I had not; he took me to his own house, he sent for the woman, and she swore to the gown.</p>

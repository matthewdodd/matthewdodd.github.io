               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner Jackson - A. I do not. On the 19th of last month I lost five pounds of ham from off the window of the shop; I saw a woman take it; I cannot swear to her face again.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of the ham - A. Eight shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you perceive what it was when she took it - A. Not at the time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I went into this shop to ask for three halfpennyworth of soup; at the time I went out she asked me if I saw any body in the shop, besides myself; she took a bit of candle and looked round the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180902150028"></xptr>shop and said she had lost something, kept me three hours, and found I had nothing; after that I was taken up.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I went into the shop on perceiving the inner shop door open; I saw the person taking something off the window; I holloaed out her, she returned into the shop from the street door, when I called her; I went into the shop and accused her with it; she came into my shop before seven, she was taken to the watch-house before eight; I sent for a constable.</p>

            . I am a constable belonging to St. Ann's. I was sent for at half past seven, I searched the prisoner and found no ham upon her; I saw a suspicious person looking in the shop window; I discharged the prisoner and told Mrs. Hoare I would find it out: I followed the woman to Grafton street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing - A. I followed the two women to Grafton street to a chandler's shop; I looked in the window, I saw part of a ham on the counter, I went in; the prisoner was in the shop; I asked the landlady if the ham belonged to her; she said no, she said the prisoner offered to sell it her; the prisoner denied the fact.</p>
               <p>MRS. STONELY. I keep a chandler's shop; I live in Little St. Andrew's street, Seven Dials. The prisoner came in my shop about half after seven o'clock, I do not know the day of the month, it was on the day the constable came in and apprehended her.</p>
               <p>Q. On that evening did the prisoner offer you any ham to sell - A. Yes; I did not chuse to buy it; she asked for a farthings worth of beer, and while she was drinking it the constable came in; he left the ham in my charge till he came again.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. After I was discharged from the prosecutrix's shop a woman came to me and asked me if I could tell her where Mr. Broome's carpet warehouse was; she asked me if I had any halfpence; she said she had four pence; she took me into a place and gave me a glass of elder wine; this woman was going into a chandler's shop. I told her I was very dry, I would go in and get a farthings worth of beer; I was drinking when the gentleman came in; when the ham or something, I did not know what it was, was on the counter; I asked the gentlewoman if she would buy that; I did not know what it was.</p>

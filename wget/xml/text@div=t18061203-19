               <p>Q. Was the door of the house broken open. - A. No, it was fastened up with iron bars, there is a passage with a door, where they take goods in to the manufactory; my husband found that door had been unbolted.</p>
               <p>Q. How was that opened. - A. It was opened by his getting in at the front shutter, which a child might pull down.</p>
               <p>Q. Then by pulling the front shutter down, he might get into the shop, immediately and without any breaking. - A. Yes, and into the parlour, because the door was only shut to; and they could let themselves out of the door; that door is bolted, and the door that they take the goods in from the street, The umbrella was found in his lodgings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it found. - A. No.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 10th of November, the prosecutor applied to me to apprehend the prisoner at the bar, as he had a suspicion<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180612030020"></xptr> that he had done the robbery. On the 11th I went to his lodgings in the morning; I took him out of his bed, and took him and locked him up at the office; I came back again and searched the place; I found this umbrella in one corner of the room; when he was before the magistrate he said that his wife bought it of a woman in the street.</p>
               <p>(The property produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. At the time I was taken out of my bed, I did not know what it was for, they took me and locked me up at Hatton Garden office; my wife came up to me and said that the officer had come down and searched the house, he had taken away some duplicates and an umbrella; I asked her what umbrella, she said it was one that she had bought a week before; I was not at home then, she said that she bought it in Fleet market, and a bonnet. I said I suppose you have a witness of it, she said yes; the woman is here who saw my wife buy the umbrella and a bonnet. I have worked for that master three times; if he can give me a bad character let him speak.</p>
               <p>Court. Then if you call your witness, you will take care, if that witness is not believed you will be dealt with the greatest severity of the law.</p>

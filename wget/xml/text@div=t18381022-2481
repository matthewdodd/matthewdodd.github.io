                  </hi>. I live in Surrey-place, Old Kent-road, near to Surrey-square, and am a cheesemonger. On Sunday night, the 30th of September, I had been dining with a friend in Holborn—I was returning home between eleven and twelve o'clock—I was in the New Kent-road, near the Elephant and Castle, on the left hand side of the way going from London—I met a friend, and we proceeded as far as opposite Cumberland-place, Old Kent-road, together—we were then on the right hand side—the foot path is wide enough for five or six people to walk—on coming opposite Cumberland-place, we saw several persons—one man came and pushed very violently against me and Mr. Keeping, and forced us to turn round—there was plenty of room for two or three people to pass on the wall side—Mr. Keeping said there was sufficient room for all of us, or something of that kind—the man instantly struck Mr. Keeping a violent blow in the face, which knocked him down, and some man from behind instantly gave me a tremendous blow on the face, and knocked me</p>

               <p>into the road—I had an umbrella, which broke into three pieces in the fall—I attempted to get up, and a struggle ensued between me and the prisoner and another—(I am quite certain of his person,) and in the struggle the prisoner drew my watch, which was scarcely exposed—my coat was but<lb></lb>toned, and nothing but the seal could be seen—I struggled violently to save my watch, and fought with him—we had several blows—he ultimately drew it from my person—it was a gold double-cased watch, and gold chain, and a very valuable watch—I cried out, "Police, I have lost my watch"—I expect the second man went to assist his companion, who was with Mr. Keeping—he ran away the instant I called "Police," and I collared the prisoner instantly—I never lost sight of him—he drew from me across the road—he did not get away from my hold then—he dragged me nearly across the road—Mr. Keeping came and assisted me—we went on calling, "Police, police," and about Swan-street he got from my hold, and ran down Swan-place, into a court which is no thoroughfare, and there I se<lb></lb>cured him—he had an opportunity of getting rid of the watch—he could not get out of Swan-place without jumping a ditch at the bottom, which was very wide and had a paling—the police secured him there—he was scarcely three minutes out of my hold there—I cannot be mistaken in his person.</p>

                  </hi>. On Sunday evening, the 30th of September, I met my friend on his way home—we went together along the Old Kent-road, and were run against by a man—there was quite sufficient room for him and another to pass—he appeared to run against the prosecutor on purpose—I said, "Surely there is room for us all to pass quietly"—I immediately received a severe blow from the man who ran against the prosecutor—it knocked me down on the ground, and as I was in the act of rising, I received either a blow or a kick in my head—my friend was knocked over into the road by parties I had not previously seen—I saw two persons with him, and the one was still in front of me—I had not an op<lb></lb>portunity of observing the two that were with him, but I can say that the prisoner is the man who I saw fighting with the prosecutor after the other two had ran away from me—there was a cry of "Police—my watch, my watch"—the prisoner immediately ran away, and we followed him across the road, and came up to him immediately—we were not two yards behind him all the time—we went with him to Swan-street, where I had hold of his arm, and the prosecutor of his coat—he there made a violent struggle, and got away—we still kept crying "Police"—he ran across the road, and</p>

               <p>was going towards a place which used to be called Kent-street—he then turned down Swan-place, but finding he could not get out, he turned and said, "What are you following me for? it is a pretty thing to be running after me in this manner"—I am certain he is the man who had been fitting with the prosecutor—a policeman had followed us down Swan-street, and secured him—I was quite sober.</p>

On the 30th of Septem<lb></lb>ber I was standing in Scott-street, between twelve and one o'clock, and heard the cry of "Police—I have lost my watch"—I heard it repeated, and immediately ran to the spot, which was about two hundred yards—I saw the prisoner run down Swan-place, Baseley and Keeping following him—I apprehended him as he was returning out of Swan-place—Mr. Baseley told me where he was knocked down, and there I found his hat and part of his umbrella.</p>

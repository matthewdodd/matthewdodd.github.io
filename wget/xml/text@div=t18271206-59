I saw the prisoner looking out of a window; she asked what I had to sell; I said jewellery; she told me to come in - the door was open - I went into the parlour, where I saw her and two other women; she said, "Let us see what you have got?" I put my box on the table, and opened it: the prisoner said she should like to buy something, but she had no money; I said I would take old silver or rings in exchange; she said, "Let us go into my room, and very likely I have got some there;" she took me into a room up two pair of stairs; I put my box on a table; she took hold of a coral ring, tried it on her finger, and asked the price; I said 8s.: she then took up a French opera-glass, and asked the price, which was 4s. - she put that into her bosom; I said, "Now, where are your old rings?" she began to laugh at me; she then collared me, and turned me out of the room - the other girls were down stairs; I went down, and tried to get out, but the street door was locked; she followed me down stairs - there was one of the other women in the passage; I passed her, and went up to the door; the prisoner then came up to me in the passage, and struck me on the side of my head; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182712060054"></xptr>fainted away nearly, I was so frightened when she struck me; the servant came up from the kitchen, and said,"What is the matter?" I said I was not well, and asked for cold water, which she brought me; I washed my face, and got better: I then said to the prisoner, "Pray open the door - I want to go about my business?" she said,"You had better come into the parlour, and open your box, to see if you have lost any thing;" I said I knew I had lost the ring and opera-glass, and would not go into the parlour; she said, "You shall not go out if you don't look - may be you will find them in your box;" I said "I cannot open my box here, for I am afraid I shall lose more, and if you don't open the door, I'll make a row here;" she then opened it; I went out, and went to a baker's-shop, at the corner, and told them what had happened: I waited there about half an hour, till an officer came by, and I went with him to the house; he asked the prisoner to give my property back; she took the opera-glass from her bosom, and gave him; she had the ring on her finger.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did she take the ring off her finger up stairs? A. She put it on her finger; I did not see it afterwards; I was about five minutes in her bed-room - I made no proposals to her; I only went to sell my goods; the officer saw the mark of the blow on my forehead - I did not kiss her; her clothes were not disordered when she came down. I swear there was a lock on the door, and it was locked. The officer went up and searched, but the ring was not found; she said I had given her the glass, having taken liberties with her, but I had not - it is against my Religion; she said she would look for my ring. I swear I never said to any body, that the ring might have rolled away, and the servant got it.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was passing the baker's shop, and saw the prosecutor there; he complained of losing a ring and an opera-glass, and took me to the house; I went in, and asked if the young woman was in - the prisoner came up from the kitchen; I said, "This gentleman says you have robbed him;" she said, "I have not"- she then took this glass from her bosom, and said, "He gave me this for a certain purpose, but I have no ring - you may search." I went up stairs - she wished to go before a Magistrate, and we went; I did not examine to see if there was a lock on the door.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. In what state was she? A. Her hair was loose, and her bosom open, and when we were up stairs she pointed to the bed, which was tossed about, and stated, before his face, that he had taken liberties with her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He proposed to go up stairs; he gave me the glass in the parlour, and said it was worth a guinea, and I should give him 3s. to boot; he never opened his box up stairs; he put it on the foot of the bed; I said,"Have you no money?" he seized me by my hair, and went out. He brought an officer - I gave up the glass, and told what I had it for.</p>

            . I am an historical-engraver. I saw the prosecutor at the Northumberland Arms public-house, Clerkenwell-green, yesterday, about half an hour after this bill was found; he told me he was sorry for what he had done, but he was urged by the baker, and that it was very probable the ring had rolled away, and the servant got it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How came you there? A. I went to inquire after the prisoner, knowing her brother. I have worked for the late Sheriff Kelly twelve or fourteen years; we drank together. I knew nothing of the prisoner. The officer was not present.</p>
               <p>JOHN PRIECE re-examined. There was a lump on the side of the prosecutor's head - he complained of being struck in the passage.</p>

               <p>SARAH WEALTHDALE sworn. - I live at North-green, Worship-street: On the 24th of September, about two o'clock, I was going for some butter, into Bishopsgate-street, at Norton-Falgate; I was sitting on the step of a door, and had this child in my arms; the prisoner came up to me, and asked me when the Cheshunt stage went off; I said, the best place to enquire was at the inn; she said, she did not know where the inn was; I said, I would shew her; she said, she never was in London before, and I shewed her the Bull-inn, Bishopsgate-street, when she found the stage was to go off at half past three; she wanted to come to my house, I said, no, she could not, for I was going up to Shoreditch-church; she said, she would go with me, and would have a pint of beer facing <placeName id="t18021027-55-crimeloc300">Shoreditch-church</placeName>

             sworn. - I live at No. 10 Hare-walk, Kingstand-road: In consequence of seeing Mrs. Wealthdale, who had lost her child, I went in pursuit of it; she said the prisoner had gone up a court in Kingsland-road with her child; I advised her to get a constable to search the house; we got one, and searched three or four houses; I asked for a description of the prisoner and child; I said, if I saw them, I would bring her back; opposite Ironmongers's alms-houses, I met two young women, and described the prisoner to them; they had seen her, and I went on, and nearly opposite Kingsland Chapel, I overtook the prisoner, who was sitting down by the road side; she rose up; I went to her, and said, my dear, how far are you going with that child; she hesitated, and said, not much further; I asked her if the child was her own; she said, no, she had it from a woman in Shoreditch; I told her she had acted wrong in taking it there; she said she was sorry if she had caused the woman any uneasiness, but she was entirely mistaken; that she went to see her cousin, who lived in a court in Kingsland-road; that her cousin took her into the brick-field, in Kingsland-road, and upon coming out again across the bank, she lost her way; I persuaded her, if that was true, to come back, and I would endeavour to find the mother, and for her to make some apology for keeping the child; she took off a handkerchief of her own, which she had put round the child's neck, and gave me the child and came back with me along the road; when we got towards Shoreditch, I met the mother and the constable, and I delivered them up; she had got near a mile and a half from Shoreditch church; the handkerchief was put in a common way round the child, apparently to keep it from catching cold.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer, and went in search of the child, the prisoner was given into my custody, by Mr. Warner, and she told me the same she had done him; she was taken to my house, and asked me if I would send for her sister, I said, I would; she said, she was with her sister that morning, and the sister asked her if her child was dead; she said, yes; that her sister said she wanted a child, and if she could procure her one, it would be the making of her; the prisoner then said, how could the think of sending her out to steal a child; her sister said, you are a country girl, and a stranger in town, you can do it better than I can; in the evening, I took her before the Magistrate, and she told him the same, but afterwards she denied it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I did not intend to hurt the child, I meant to take it down into the country as my own. <rs id="t18021027-55-verdict301" type="verdictDescription">

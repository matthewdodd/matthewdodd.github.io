On the 22d of March (Saturday) about eight in evening I was in our counting house, and I heard one of our shopmen say that a man had got a bag of sugar out of the shop; I immediately ran out, as did several of the servants, and came up with the man, whilst he was struggling with the shopman, who gave me the information; we secured him, and brought him to the shop again, it was the prisoner; we sent for an officer, and took him before a magistrate; when I laid hold of him the sugar was by him, he had put it down, it was close by the side of him when I first see it in the street, the sugar was in a bag, going into the country, with a direction it; I believe one of our porters took it up, and brought it back, and I have kept it separate from that time to this.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you last observed it before it was missing? - I did not particularly observe it before.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say certainly that such sugar was missing of your knowledge? - No, I cannot, no further than having seen it by the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask Mr. Gilbert whether he saw me take the bag up, or whether he thinks that I was the person that took the bag up.</p>

               <p>I am a shopman to Messrs. Gilberts. The prisoner came into the shop about eight or nine o'clock, for a quarter of a pound of moist sugar, and a halfpenny-of allspice, which I served him, he gave me a shilling, and I gave him change, when I served him I expected he would go, but he seemed in no hurry; in that time there was four more young men much of the same appearance, came into the shop, and I had a suspicion of the prisoner, and when he went out I looked at the window, and I see him with this bag of sugar, in this manner, in his arms, and stooping, in going by the window, and when I looked through the window, he was looking me full in the face; I called immediately to our porter, and desired him to go after the man; he went out and did not go the right way, I ran out immediately after him, and got my eye on the prisoner, he got about thirty or forty yards, he had quitted the bag when I collared him; I did not lose sight of him after I got out, I don't know particularly what passed between him and myself at the moment, but I saw the bag at his feet, and his hand on it; he let the bag fall, I see him.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you see him go by the window had you missed any thing out of the shop? - No, but when I saw it, I knew it was a bag which had been laying in the shop among some other bags. I, by the assistance of Mr. Gilbert, brought him back to the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Who brought back the sugar? - The porter, he is not here; the sugar was put in their shop again, there was a label on it, where it was going, into the country.</p>

               <p>I am an officer of the parish, I was sent for to take charge of the prisoner that stands at the bar; on a charge of felony, with stealing this sugar, I sealed the bag before ever I delivered the prisoner out of my hands, momentarily as soon as I quitted him at the magistrate's, I went back and sealed it at Mr. Gilbert's; it was in Mr. Gilbert's shop; I know nothing more than taking the man before the magistrate, and from thence he is come here, this is the self same sugar on which I put my seal.</p>
               <p>Court to Gilbert. Did you know there was such a parcel going into the country? - I knew there was such a parcel but I did not put it up. I saw a bag of sugar lay by the prisoner in the street, and I saw a parcel of sugar brought in, which I know to be ours, by the bag and direction, this is the same.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I called at Mr. Gilbert's shop for a quarter of a pound of moist sugar, and a halfpennyworth of allspice, the mean time a person came in with an empty bottle for half a pint of raisin wine; he told him he could not serve less than a pint, and he went out of the shop, and there were three or four more about the shop door, it was Saturday night, and when I went out, he had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179404300100"></xptr>given me change for a shilling, and I had the change in one hand, and the sugar and allspice in the other, when I came out I saw a man run by with the sugar, and he put it down, and when I came up to it, I put my hand down to see what it was, and they came and took me, Mr. Gilbert's son said in the shop that they thought I was not the person.</p>

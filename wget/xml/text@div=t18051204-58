               <p>Q. In the month of October last the prisoner offered herself to you as a servant? - A. She did; she stated to me that she had not been in service before.</p>

I did; she came into my service on the 30th of October; on the 16th of November, she requested to go out and get a pair of shoes, I believe it was between eight and nine in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. She was your housekeeper? - A. She was; she had the care of the whole of my linen; she did not return any more; between eleven and twelve o'clock on the same night, Mr. Edwards called on me, he brought with him a sheet that I knew to be mine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp.</p>
               <p>Q. She came to you recommended I believe? - A. She did by a written character.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you made any enquiry, and did you not learn that she has had the misfortune to have her husband desert her? - A. I have been since informed that she is a married woman and parted from her husband.</p>
               <p>Q. I understand that you have sworn to this sheet; is there any particular mark, by which you know this sheet? - A. I know the mark on the sheet; it was not my sheet originally; there is printed on it March, and the C is left out in March, the name of the month, and the C is put at the top; it belonged to my father-in-law, and there is a T on the other.</p>

             sworn. I am a pawnbroker, I live at No. 6, Portpool-lane. On the 16th of November the prisoner at the bar came to my shop between the hours of nine and eleven; she produced a pair of sheets to pledge, and asked me eighteen or twenty-eight shillings, I am not certain which; I looked at them to see what mark was on them; the prisoner I had known by pledging goods before in the name of Wilkinson; looking at the sheets, I found there was one letter T on one sheet, and on the other was March, with a C on it; it did not strike me that it was March; I goes to her and says, Mrs. Wilkinson, what are the marks on these sheets, and whose sheets are they.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she answer to the name of Wilkinson? - A. Yes, she said they were her sheets; I asked her where she lived; she answered me, you know me very well, I said I know you very well by the name of Wilkinson, but I find these sheets marked different; I said what is the name that is on the sheet in full length, she said there was no name on them; I said there is a name on them, and I shall certainly know what name there is on them before I lend money on them, and if they are your's you know; I asked her again where she lived, she seemed confused, after some time she said at Battle-bridge; I told her Battle-bridge was no direction; I must know the house, as I must go or send to know if she lived there; she said she could not recollect the name of the place, it went down by the Small-pox Hospital; I said you are a housekeeper in some family, she then seemed a good deal hurt, and said, me a housekeeper or a servant, that can come out at all hours; her making use of that expression made me look upon her with a greater degree of suspicion; I said I must trouble you to walk backwards; the shop being full, I made her come into my back parlour, and called my maid servant to attend to her.</p>
               <p>Q. In point of fact, you found out from her where she lived? - A. Yes; I said to her I am sure the sheets are not your own, she then says I will tell you all about it if you will not tell any body, nor take any notice about it; she wept bitterly; I told her, I could not make any promises, she was now detained against her will, and I must answer for it, and I should send for an officer for her, which I did.</p>
               <p>Q. She told you that they were Mrs. Tomkins's? - A. Yes.</p>

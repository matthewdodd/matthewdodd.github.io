On Friday, the 30th of August, about a quarter past eight in the evening, I undressed my child, and went up into the two-pair of stairs to put her to bed; I live in the one-pair of stairs; I had been there about two minutes; I heard a foot fall upon the stairs, which made a great noise; I immediately ran down to the one pair of stairs, and enquired of the person below if she had heard any thing; then I returned up stairs again into my room, and missed two gowns off a mahogany dining table; I then ran down stairs into the passage, and the first person I saw, was a person of the name of

             sworn. - On the 30th of August, I saw the prisoner come out of Mrs. Webb's house with something which I took to be a child; a woman came out and asked a child if she had seen any body come out; I said, I had seen a man come out, and I immediately ran up the passage; he was then out of sight; when I got into White-horse-yard, I observed the prisoner walking very leisurely; I asked him, what he had got there; he said, nothing but my own; I told him, if he had nothing but his own he would not object to my seeing; I immediately collared him, I took him back to the light, and he said, he would go with me very willingly any where, and so he did a second time; he went with me thirty or forty yards out of White-horse-yard into Stanhope-street; he then said, he would be d-d if he would go with me, and immediately a scuffle ensued; in the scuffle I threw him down, and the things all sell from him; I suppose, upon the alarm of the scuffle, a number of the neighbours came out; among the rest, I saw Mrs. Jolley, I desired her to pick these things up, and give them to me, which she did; I took them under my arm, and collared him with the other, and took them to Mrs. Webb's.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the things Mrs. Jolley picked up, were the same that dropped from the prisoner? - A. Yes, I saw her pick them up; the prisoner begged my pardon, said it was his first offence, and that if I appeared against him he should be transported for house-breaking.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you made any promise if he would confess? - A. No, I had not; I took him to the watch-house, and the next day I went to Bow-street; he was committed.</p>

On the 30th of August I heard a noise at the window; I looked out, and thought it was going to be a fight, till Mr. Pring called out, you are the thief; I then ran out, and trod upon something that was very soft, and Mr. Pring immediately called out to me, Mrs. Jolley, pick up the things; I picked them up all in a lump, and put them under his arm; I went with Pring, and saw him deliver to Mrs. Webb, two gowns, and two cloaks, and an umbrella; the prisoner begged for mercy, and said exactly what Mr. Pring has related.

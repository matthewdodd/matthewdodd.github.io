            . I am the prosecutor's wife. Part of these goods were sent; and three dozen of dessert knives and forks, I took afterwards myself, to No. 91, Gloucester-place. I saw a servant - he told me to call the next morning before eleven o'clock, or before six in the evening. I went the next morning - he said his master had been gone out twenty minutes - I was to call in the evening. I went in the evening, and he called the prisoner, who gave me a dozen forks, and said they were sent instead of knives. I told him he should have the knives in the morning - he said there was no hurry for them. I went there two or three days afterwards, and took the knives, which I gave to the servant, who said his master was at dinner. I went again that evening, and saw the prisoner, who said he had my bill, but he was not prepared to pay me, as he had no money in the house, and he must go to his banker in the City to get it, but would call and pay me next day - he did not call, and I went on the following evening - I told him I called for my money; he said "I have nothing to do with the transaction; I do'nt even know you - my name is not Ireland; Mr. Ireland is at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182512080058"></xptr>Richmond, but he will be in town on Saturday or Monday, and I will speak to him on the business, and he will call on you." I went and told Mr. Danell, who made some inquiries of the Magistrate. I went to the prisoner's house on the Monday, and saw him; he said Mr. Ireland had not been in town, but if I would take his word till Wednesday, at five o'clock, I might depend upon having the goods or the money. I asked him if he would let me have the goods, or part of them - he said he could not do that. I looked at him very hard, and said "Pray Sir, what is your name" - he said "Ireland."</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you seen Mr. Ireland, when the order came to your house? A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you said you insisted upon having the money when the goods were left? A. No.</p>

            . I am an officer. I saw the prisoner in Coppice-row, about seven o'clock in the evening of the 4th of May, carrying this basket; I asked what he had got - he looked at me for a moment, and said brushes.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182606220040"></xptr>which he had brought from the New-road, where a man can against him, and told him to carry them to the corner of Redcross-street, Barbican, and he would give him a shilling: I asked if he knew the man - he said he had not seen him before, but should know him again. I found these twelve brushes in the basket.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Robert Walkington Crump, who lives in Judd-street, Brunswick-square. I know nothing of the prisoner. We had not missed the brushes, but when they were brought I knew them to be ours; we then missed them from the drawer in which they had been kept, on the top of the warehouse stairs; the shop had been entered on the night of the 3d of May, through the warehouse window; the money had been taken from the till, and these brushes from the drawer; we have some reason to believe it was done by a lad who lived with us, but we have no evidence against him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the night I was taken I was coming down Coppice-row, and I met a lad, who asked me if I could tell him where to sell a dozen brushes; I said No, and he said if I would go with him he would give me a shilling to go and sell them for him; his name was Clinton - he used to live at this gentleman's house.</p>

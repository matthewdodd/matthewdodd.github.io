I went to a public-house and had some dinner and got change. I then went and called for the half-and-half; I offered a shilling, which was refused; I put it to my teeth and put it in my pocket. I said I would take good care it should deceive no one else. I put down another and that being bad Mr. Brown asked for the other, which I immediately gave him—it is not likely I shoud have done it knowing it to be bad.</p>

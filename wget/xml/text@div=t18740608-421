                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the employ of the East and West India Dock Company—the prisoner was also a clerk employed there under my superintendence—Mr. Beck was the cashier for the Western Dock previous to May, the prisoner had the right to" make requisitions upon Mr. Beck, for the payment of the labourers' wages, during the week—in case any mechanics and labourers had to be paid before the proper pay day, he would draw money from Mr. Beck to pay them, or if he was instructed by me he would draw any money that he was told—there are labourers employed at the docks by the hour, and if the men so employed leave after a day, or a day and a half, they must be paid before the proper day—the prisoner would have authority to make requisitions without my knowledge to pay those men, it would be done in this way, if the men had to be paid off, the foreman would instruct the time-keeper, who would send in their time, and the prisoner would draw the money to pay them the amount would vary very much—we employ as many as 300 men sometimes—on a general average, he would require 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week, but sometimes much less—I have known occasions when no money at all was required to be drawn on account, in other words, that no labourers had been paid off—I did not give the prisoner any authority on May 2nd, to request an advance of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Mr. Beck—the prisoner did not speak to me about paying Bruce before that—if Bruce wanted money he came to me himself—Bruce is a stonemason, working piece work—Bruce had not made any request at</p>

"—I did not speak to him about it at that time, but on the Tuesday or Wednesday following, I sent for him and told him in Bruce's presence, that I had discovered that the receipts he had given were not genuine, and that the money had not been paid to Bruce—he had produced two receipts purporting to be signed "Edward Brace"—he turned to Bruce and said "I had your authority to sign those receipts," Brace said that it was no such thing—I told him that having discovered Bruce had not received the money, it made a deficiency of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in his accounts, and by the Saturday following he must make the balance up, and if the money was not returned by that time I must inform my principals—he said it was a bad job, but he must endeavour to get the money—that was all that took place at that time—I saw the prisoner of course daily, but not to speak about this—I reported to my superior on the Wednesday following—I was obliged to allow a Saturday to pass, my principal being in Manchester, on the Company's business—I had no accounting with the prisoner on Saturday, 16th May, the whole matter was then in my hands, and I waited for the return of my principal to report him, the money not having been returned—I asked him on Wednesday, the 20th, if he had got the money a few minutes before I spoke to my principal, he made no re<lb></lb>mark, and I said "I must now tell my principal"—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is his book in his own writing—I struck through the two payments of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Bruce myself—I left the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the debit side standing to be accounted for to the cashier—these are the two receipts which he produced to me—they are printed forms from the office—the month is" filled in, but not the day—when I was discussing it with the prisoner on 9th May, he said one 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid on Saturday, 2nd May, and the other 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on Friday, 8th May—this little book is in his writing. (<hi rend="italic">This contained the draft of a letter to a Mr. Webb, stating that he had lent a friend</hi> 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">out of the money belonging to the Company, which he had not been able to pay back, and that he was now sud<lb></lb>denly called upon to refund it, and asking Mr. Webb to advance him the money or any part of it.</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> After I discovered the deficiency he was at his work daily up till the time he was arrested—I have always found him an honest and trustworthy servant up to this time, and I have no doubt that induced me to give him time to refund the money; I did not believe him to be bad—he had no knowledge of Brace's work at all, and would not know without asking me or Bruce, what was due to Bruce—he never asked me how much was due to Bruce—the prisoner was what is railed prime cost clerk in the engineer's office, and Brace was in the habit of working for that office upon contract—it was the prisoner's duty to make out the costs of the jobs performed by the labouring staff, and to return the cost of work done; but Bruce's work was done without reference to the prisoner—if he liked to take the trouble he could</p>

               <p>estimate the cost of Bruce's work, but it was not part of his duty—he told me in Brace's presence that Brace told him he might sign those receipts—he said before the Magistrate "I have got two witnesses who can prove it"—I don't recollect him making that statement at the time you speak of—I am not sure that he did not, but I have no recollection of it—the prisoner would have to pay out about 370<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week on an average, sometimes less, sometimes more—I gave those figures at the police court—he has mentioned once or twice to me that he has been short in the money, and on one occasion he handed me back some money which I had overpaid—there were two or three sums I think on that occasion—I am not surprised at his getting into difficulties occasionally with his money in consequence of the large amounts he had to pay, and undoubtedly it might happen without any intention to defraud the company—I checked the accounts on 9th May, because I was going to pay the men, and I was obliged to see the amount of money drawn and paid—I could not check the pay lists at that time because the men were not paid—I considered the prisoner's book a sufficient voucher at the moment that Bruce had received the two 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was sufficient debit to to account for the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. paid out, and I should have thought so if Bruce had had the money—the prisoner had paid Brace, of course, a number of amounts upon prior occasions, upon instructions—his explanation of the whole matter from the beginning to end was that this 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had been received by Brace's authority—that was what he told me—I have since heard that they were on friendly terms—I have had to pay money myself when I could not get the accounts exactly square—if a man comes up to you and disputes an item, it is very often forgotten at the time, and very often I have had to pay money myself—in the course of the fourteen months in which the prisoner has been in the employment he has paid out about 25,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 30,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> He has had pay sheets to pay by—the greatest error I have made was under 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and it has generally been a few shillings—I did not know at the time the prisoner produced the receipts that they were not Bruce's writing—he brought me one receipt first, and said "That is for the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that I paid Bruce last Saturday, and he wanted some more money last night, and I gave him 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. then"—or words to that effect—on the following Wednesday he said that Brace had authorised him to sign the receipts, and Bruce denied it.</p>

            , (my father) and me; it was quite a new shop; the lead was laid on the 3rd of February; I missed it on Monday, the 12th. When I went to let the men in to work I saw the tiles had been replaced and put on the parapet wall; I went up and saw that part of the lead was taken from the gutter. I weighed the lead that was found, it weighed seventy-two pounds. I knew the lead as soon as I saw it; I matched it, it completely matched the lead that was left.</p>
               <p>Q. How high is the wall from the ground - A. Twenty feet.</p>
               <p>Q. Could a person get up without assistance - A. Not well.</p>

            . I am inspector of the lamps and watch for the liberty of Golden-lane, St. Luke's. About half past three on Sunday morning, the 11th of February, I saw two people pass at the back of the Toll-house, at the top of Golden-lane, about three hundred yards from Mr. Allen's shop; I followed them into Golden-lane, when I got into Golden-lane I lost sight of them, the lamps were out; I went up to the end of Honduras-street, and then stopped; I thought I heard a voice, I called the watchman to bring me a light; it is<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181002210062"></xptr>a dark place. They then went from that spot into Old-street, and then I saw the prisoner with a large bundle on her shoulder.</p>
               <p>Q. She had no child with her then, had she - A. She had not; and the man that was with her had no bundle at all; I told them to stop, I must examine to see what they had got; the man made off immediately the woman stopped, I asked her what she had got; she said, a little bit of lead. I took her to the watch-house. The lead was tied up in a rug. On Monday morning the lead was owned by Mr. Allen.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am a native of Ireland; my husband has lately died, leaving me with two children. I was coming along Old-street, I met a man with the lead in question; he requested me to carry the lead; I took it, and when I was charged he ran away and left me.</p>

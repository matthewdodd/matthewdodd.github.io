                  </hi>. I am a coachman, of No. 5, Saville-row, Walworth. On Monday night, 12th May, about 10 o'clock in the evening, I was in Norton-street, Fitzroy-square, and just as I get to the corner I heard two men's voices—as I got to the railings I saw the prisoner and a shorter man coming towards me—we should have both met, but, having my umbrella up, I held it down, for them to see how much room to take—as they turned the corner I heard one say to the other, "There is a prig," or, "Take a <hi rend="italic">prig</hi>;" the other grasped my watch; the swivel broke, and left the watch—I called, "Police! stop thief!" and, with my umbrella up, turned to go after him, and as I ran across the street the prisoner came close to me, and touched me between my legs twice with his leg to trip me up, and when he found he could not succeed he pushed my umbrella over my face, and I fell, and dislocated my shoulder—I am sure he is the man—I am still gof<lb></lb>fering—my rail nearly tripped him up; he came against the umbrella, and could hardly save himself from going down too—he took hold of me as if to help me up—Mr. Johnson came up and took hold of me—I said, "Pray, take care of my arm; it is either broken or dislocated;" and the moment I got on my legs I said, "That is one of the men who has robbed me; take him into custody;" but no police came—the prisoner said, "I do not know anything about tile man that is gone; I only stopped to assist you; "but they were both together—a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> came up, and Mr. Johnson spoke to the driver—the prisoner told the driver that he had only stopped to assist me, got behind the <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> and made off as quickly as possible.</p>

                  </hi>. I am articled clerk to an attorney, and live at No. 44, Duke-street, St. James's. On 12th May, about 10 o'clock in the evening, I was in Norton-street, and saw Mr. Isaacs and two men following him, three or four yards off—the prisoner is one of them, and the other was behind him, but they were quite close together—as they got to the corner of the street I saw the smaller one snatch at Mr. Isaacs, and then run away—the prisoner was at that time standing close against Mr. Isaacs, and pushing against him—I ran across the road to help him; the prisoner offered him his hand, and he said, "That is one of the men"—a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> drove up, and while I was speaking to the driver, the prisoner ran or walked off—I am perfectly sure he is the man.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What had you taken? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had been at a private house to dinner, and had only one glass of wine after dinner—I saw the prisoner in a cell, but was not certain of him till I heard him speak—I heard him say on this night, "I am innocent," or, "I have nothing to do with it"—I observed his voice, it was very peculiar—I recognized his face, but I knew him by his voice as well—I could not have recognized him without his voice, or without his face; it is the conjunction of the two which makes me say that he is the man—the taller man of the two had a cap, I think, but I am not sure; this is the taller one—if Mr. Johnson says that it was a hat, that would not alter what I say—he was shown to me standing, with a dozen more, in a passage which all the cells open into; the constable said something, and he said, "What is all this about?"—I then said, "That is one of them"—it is a very peculiar voice, rather cracked.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, S</hi> 24). I took the prisoner on a charge of assault—I saw him on the night in question, about half past 12 o'clock, at the comer of Tottenham Court-road and the New-road, with the other pri<lb></lb>soner, whom I took for an assault on me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The prisoner's statement before the Magistrate were here read as follows: "I deny the charge, and have witnesses to prove that I was at home.</hi>")</p>

               <p>in Harrow parish. On 6th Sept. I had nine wether sheep and one ewe there—I saw them safe between ten and eleven o'clock that morning—in consequence of information, I went on Sunday afternoon, the 10th, in search of one of the sheep—after searching some time, I found the fore-quarters with the skin on—it was the skin of one of my wether sheep, and the entrails were underneath—I took away the two shanks to my house, and afterwards gave them to the policeman—we left the remainder on the spot till night; Harris then took it—I went with Colebrook and two other policemen that Sunday night, between eight and nine, to the prisoner's room—we found him in bed; he came down, partly dressed—Colebrook asked him what he had for dinner—he said, "Some dumplings"—Colebrook asked him if he had had any mutton for his dinner; he said, "No"—he asked him whether he might search; he said, "Yes"—we went up stairs, went to a cupboard, and found some dumplings and some mutton, which was cooked—it was part of the hind-quarter, cut rather differently to what a butcher would cut it; it was part of the loin, and under the bed was a bone partly picked, and a marrow bone—there was a box near the bed—Colebrook said to the prisoner's wife, "What have you got here?" she said, "You break that if you dare!"—he gave it a shake, and found there was something in it—he lifted it up, and pulled it open—he found the thick part of two legs of mutton salted—Cole<lb></lb>brook said to Johnson, "You are my prisoner"—he asked him where he had the mutton—he said, "At Edgeware"—I had branded my sheep myself, with, pitch, with the letter "L" in a ring.</p>

I went with the prosecutor, and Braddle and Harris to the prisoner's house—after a while, he came down—I asked him whether he had had any mutton for dinner—he said, "No"—I asked if he bad any in his house—he said, "No"—I followed him up stairs, and in the cupboard found some mutton cut like mutton chops, and some dumplings; and in the box two parts of the legs of mutton, and the back bone wrapped up in some blankets—the prisoner's wife was sitting on the blankets, and dared me to move them—after some time she got up, and I found the back-bone, a leg-bone, and a shin-bone—there was some meat cut off them—I asked the prisoner where he got the mutton—he said, "From Edgeware"—we were there two or three minutes, while the prisoner was get<lb></lb>ting up—there was time for him to have cleared the cupboard and taken out the things.</p>

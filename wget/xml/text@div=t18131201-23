            . I am an officer. On the 7th of November, I was stationed at the back door of Mr. Dunman's house, in Petticoat-lane; there is a window there which enabled me to see what was going on in the warehouse. I saw Tongue walk along the warehouse; he had a candle in his hand, and two bundles; he came and opened the back door of the house in Petticoat-lane, when he opened the door, he gave Heseldine two parcels under her blue mantle; she then came out; I followed her into Aldgate High-street; I stopped her there. I told her I was an officer; she made great resistance. I shewed her my authority; she submitted then. I searched her, and found eighteen pounds of soap upon her, a pound and a half of tea, a pound of coffee, and five pounds of sugar. I asked her where she lived; at last I went with her to her lodgings. We went down stairs to a lower apartment; she said there was nothing there. She then took me up stairs, there I found tea, sugar, nutmegs, cloves, plumbs, raisins, and currants; after that I returned to the house where the prisoner Tongue was; I told Tongue. I had taken Heseldine in custody, and had taken her to the Compter; he said, he was sorry for it; he gave it her; he was guilty. Heseldine told me the mam lodged in the house where I found these things, and he had give her the property. Heseldine opened the door of the house with the key she took out of her pocket, and with her key she opened the drawers in the room where the things were found. This is a bag of tea I took from Heseldine.</p>
               <p>Fairbrother. That is the bag of tea I found in the closet in Tongue's room; there is my mark upon it.</p>
               <p>The prisoners said nothing in their defence; called four witnesses, who gave them a good character.</p>

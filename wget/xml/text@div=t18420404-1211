                  </hi>. I am a dress-maker, and live in Upper York-street, Bryanstone-square. I know Mr. Roake, a tobacconist, opposite my house. On the 10th of March I saw the prisoner in company with two others, come up to the shop—there are railings in front—one of them opened the gate—all three went up to the shop, came out again, talked a little while, and the prisoner then went in—there was nobody in the shop—I saw him look towards the parlour window, come towards the shop window, then lift up the glass and take out a bundle of cigars—I came down, and told my landlady what I had seen—she went over to Mr. Roake; and when the others saw me watching them, they ran away—the prisoner walked out of the shop, walked half-way across the road, and then com<lb></lb>menced running.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joseph Roake, and keep a tobacco<lb></lb>nist's shop. On Thursday, the 10th of March, between eleven and twelve o'clock, I was in the parlour at the end of the shop, and saw the prisoner</p>

               <p>looking in at the shop window, and then I saw him in the shop—I went and liked what he wanted, he said a half penny-worth of tobacco—I said I did not make so small a quantity—he then asked for a penny-worth—I served him with it—at that time Thompson's landlady came and stood behind him—the moment he was gone, she said, "I think you have been robbed"—I looked to the glass case, and she said "Run after him"—I called the policeman—the boxes of cigars were worth 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—they were safe three minutes before—I am certain he is the person I saw in the shop—I recol<lb></lb>lect him as well as if it was at this moment,</p>

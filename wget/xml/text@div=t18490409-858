                  </hi>. I am a messenger in Exeter-hall. I was in the Exeter hotel on the night of 11th March—I saw the prisoner standing close to the bar at the Exeter-street door—he asked me if I did not think it was a bad job that his money happened to turn out to be a bad half-crown—I told him as the landlord and landlady had taken so many lately, it behoved them to keep their eyes open, and that I should do the same if I were in their place—the prisoner paid for what he had and went away—I followed him; he went out of the Exeter-street door, and went straight towards the City—the first street he came to was Savoy-street—he just turned the corner, and he had hardly time to say "<hi rend="italic">Jack"</hi> to a man he met—they joined company, and went straight up the Strand towards the City, and I after them, till they got to Lombard-street—they stopped about two minutes—they went to a court and stopped about one minute, and then the prisoner went into the court, and into the Woolpack tavern—the other man went away—I gave information imme<lb></lb>diately to an officer—I went into the Woolpack after the prisoner had been taken back there by the officer—I asked the prisoner if he knew me—he said "Oh dear no"—I said, "You do not recollect seeing me in the Exeter hotel"—he said, "No"—I had the half of the half-crown which Mr. Dicke<lb></lb>son's brother had put into my band—I held it up, and said, "Do you know this?"—he said, "Oh dear no;"he knew nothing of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> To whom are you messenger at Exeter-hall? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> To Mr. Stammers—he engages the hall once a week—I am messenger for the Wednesday evening concerts—I gave the prisoner into custody because I knew he was telling falsehoods when he said he did not know it was bad, and I might have gone to the hotel for change for my employer, and it stands to reason that I might have got this bad money—I gave the prisoner in charge because he had passed one bad half-crown, and he had gone to the Woolpack to pass another—I told the policeman to be on the alert—I put the police<lb></lb>man on guard, and when the prisoner came out I pointed him out to the policeman—that was before I had been into the Woolpack, but the waiter had run out just after the prisoner had come out, and the waiter said it was a bad one—I did not have the prisoner taken before I knew that he had done anything wrong at the Woolpack—I knew it from the waiter's mouth.</p>

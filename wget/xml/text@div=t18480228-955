On 17th Feb., about twelve o'clock in the day, I met the prisoner at Merton Rush, going from Wimbledon to<lb></lb>wards her home—I stopped her, and asked if she had anything belonging to any one else in her basket—she said "No"—I said I must see—she said she had a piece of bacon—I found she had two pieces, and said, "I must take you to the station"—she said she hoped I would not take her to Mr. Mason's—I took her to the station, and then took the bacon to Mr. Mason's, and saw it fitted to some bacon, it corresponded.</p>

                  </hi> I am shopman to Thomas Mason, of Wimbledon. On 17th Feb. the prisoner came and bought some tea, soap, and salt, but no bacon—I served her—there was some bacon on the next counter, two yards from her—I went to the back of the shop for the salt—she paid me and went away—Golding afterwards brought me some bacon—I then missed a piece—this is the piece which remained (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it fits exactly—I am quite sure it had been in the shop—I am not certain of the other piece.</p>

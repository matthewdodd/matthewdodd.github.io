                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at Green-bank, Tooley-street. On 24th Oct, about half-past eight o'clock in the evening, I was at Havill's public-house, the King's Head, Green-bank—I went into the tap-room, and saw several people there—the prisoner was there when I went in, smoking his pipe—he had a pint of ale and a glass before him on the table—I knew him before—he filled me a glass of ale, which I drank—-another working man went in with me—the prisoner drank with us both—I cannot tell how much he drank, but we had three pots of beer between four of us—the wife of the man who went with me had come in before we had done drinking—after being there some time, several people came in—the prisoner's wife came in a little before nine, with a baby in her arms, and her mother came in directly after—when his wife came in she put the baby out of her arms into the prisoner's arms, and <hi rend="italic">blowed</hi> him up—she scolded him—I cannot tell her exact words, but she got hold of the hair of his head behind, and punched him in the face very hard—I cannot tell how many times—I think thirteen or fourteen times in the face—I cannot recollect what she said at the time, but she was crying, and was very much bad tempered with him—I do not recollect her calling him names, but the mother called him a murderer, a Greenacre, a man-eater, and a whoremonger, and, after her calling him these names, he called her a b—y w—c—she then ran and got hold of a quart pot, abused him as much as she could, came towards him, and hit at him with the pot—I got hold of her, and told her neither man or woman in the house should injure him—I prevented her striking him—his wife and mother kicked up a <hi rend="italic">gallows row</hi>, and at last the landlord turned them out—the prisoner then had the baby in his arms, and was smoking his pipe—he shed tears, and said, "Tears cannot Help but come down"—after that he went outside the door, as far as the corner of the house, with the baby in his arms—I told him to come into the tap-room again, and we would have another pot of beer, and to bring the baby in, as it was too late at night to have it out—he came in, and when he got in a woman offered to take charge of the child—he gave it her, and she suckled it—she did not keep it above two minutes, I think, because she had a baby of her own crying—when he had the child back, there was a little girl, an aunt of the child, there—we told him to give the child to the aunt, and she would take good care of it—he gave it her—she had it for a few minutes—the aunt's mother came in and <hi rend="italic">blowed</hi> her up—the aunt was the sister of the prisoner's wife—the mother-in-law came in and <hi rend="italic">blew</hi> the aunt up, and hit her on the shoulder—she came in again, and made the girl give the child to the prisoner, which she did—they kicked up a <hi rend="italic">row</hi>, and the publican turned the lot of them out—the prisoner shed tears, and said again, "Tears cannot help to come down"—when we had been there some time, he said he wanted to go out—we did not want him to go out, fearing the child, which he still had, would catch cold—he told Havill, the publican, he insisted on going out—Havill told him to give the child to the woman who had suckled it before—he said he would not, and nobody but himself should do for the child, it was his child, and he would do for it himself, and nobody else should—he asked Havill's liberty to go out—Havill spoke to him—I cannot say what he said, and we got up to let him pass by—he went as far as the bar,</p>

               <p>and stood about a minute, with the baby in his arms—he took it up, cuddled it to his breast as near as he could—I was standing close to him, and the next thing I heard was the baby's head come on the bar—I was not above a foot and a half from him—I saw the baby's head coming on the bar.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> He had hold of the child at the time its head came on the bar? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I think he had, but I cannot prove that, as my eyes dazzled when I heard its head coming on the bar—I saw nothing before that—the child's pole came on the bar, and the child came down on the ground—I took it up, and the prisoner held it by the clothes at the same time, and I said, "The baby is dead"—the report went round that it was killed—the baby's mother came in—I gave it to her, and she went to the doctor's with it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> At the time you heard and saw the baby coming on the bar, had the prisoner hold of it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I saw the pole of its head coming on the bar, and the head slipped down—I stooped down, and picked the baby up—the prisoner held it round the hips at the time its head came against the bar, at far as I could understand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How did the head come against the bar? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot tell whether it was his good will or accident, or how—I do not think I saw anything more than I have said—I do not recollect it if I did—before he left the tap-room to go to the bar, he said a good many things I could hardly make any meaning of—I did not hear him say anything while he stood at the bar, that I can re<lb></lb>member now—before he left the tap-room he said a good many things I do not recollect, and some I do recollect—he had his finger on some beer that was spilt on the table, and was writing figures, or something—I could hardly understand what—he talked about starvation, or something—he said, "When you see the jaw-bones moving, it is very <hi rend="italic">queer;</hi>" and after that he said blood on a brick wall looked very funny, and if there was a bullet on a brick wall there would be blood, and blood on a brick wall looked very funny—as far as I recollect, that was all—this was before the child's head came against the bar—I think it was better than half an hour after the mother had gone out that the child's head came against the bar.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was he doing when he stood at the bar with the child in his arms, was he doing anything with the child? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No more than taking care of it, as far as I could expect a man to take care of it—he appeared to be cuddling it at the time, and I saw him take it suddenly by the thigh—I saw no change in his position.</p>

I was at Mr. Havill's public-house, at Green-bank—I went there between eight o'clock and half-past, and saw the prisoner sitting in the tap-room—I had never seen him before—a person I understood was his wife was with him—they were falling out—he had a baby on his knee, and offered it to the mother—she would not take it, and he put it on his knee again—I walked up to the fire, and a woman I understood to be the mother-in-law called him a Greenacre and murderer, and he called her a w—she then seized a quart pot up to strike him, or throw at him—I took it out of her hand—Havill came in, and turned them out—Spelling also prevented her striking him—after they were put out a woman took the baby from the pri<lb></lb>soner, and gave it to a girl fourteen or sixteen years old—the prisoner sat down, and he could not help dropping a tear or something—he was sitting by me—the mother-in-law came in, and made the girl give the child back to the prisoner—he took it, and put it on his knee—Havill came, and turned the mother-in-law and girl out—he then told the prisoner to go out—he went out quietly with the child in his arms, and returned again in about five minutes, and sat down by my side with the baby—he said the child was his, and be would do for it, and with the same breath he said he would be the death of it before the morning—he said; Stood sprinkled on a brick wall would look funny in the morning—I tapped him on the shoulder, told him to take a fool's advice, and not revenge himself on a poor innocent baby—he made no reply—he appeared vexed—he sat a while, then said he would go out—the company in the house said he should not—they gave no reason—he called Mr. Havill as a witness that they would not let him out, and then they let him go out—he went out of the tap-room to the bar—I drank my beer off, and went—the prisoner was standing at the bar—I stood with my face towards the bar—the child was then in the prisoner's arms—he took the child, I cannot say whether he took it by its legs or clothes, as it had long clothes, but he took it, and struck it on the counter of the bar.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you observe the effect of that blow on the child? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was a blow on the head—he then said, "I have done it; I have left one behind, now take me"—he then went into the tap-room, and sat himself down—I thought he was crying—he said he always stuck to his word—I remained there till the constable came, and Mr. Havill gave him in charge.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How far do you live from Havill's house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About 100 or 200 yards—I had been working at my trade that day—this was the first time I had been in the public-house that day—there might be a dozen or more persons in the tap-room when the prisoner made the observation I mention—I saw Donovan there—I sat next to the prisoner on one side at one time—I do not know who was on the other side—Spelling was not quite opposite to him—there was a table between them—when the prisoner said he would be the death of the child that morning, Spelling was in the room, and about as near to him as I was—there were several persons by the bar when I saw what I have stated—the landlord was there, but I do not believe he saw the blow struck—Spelling was there—I did not see the barmaid or any</p>

I went to Mr. Havill's on the 24th of Oct., about half-past nine o'clock at night—I was not sent for—it is on my beat-—I went in, seeing a mob round the door—the prisoner was sitting down, leaning on the table—he was gives into my custody by Havill—I took him to the station—in going along he said to me, "I shall go to the Old Bailey for what I have done"—he was sober, but appeared very much agitated—I took him part of the way, but he got so very violent, I was obliged to call the assistance of another constable—I had hold of him.</p>

                  </hi>, <hi rend="italic">surgeon, St. Thomas-street, Southwark.</hi> On the night of the 24th of Oct. I was sent for to Guy's-hospital, where I am assistant-sur<lb></lb>geon, and saw a child who was brought there—the woman who brought it said it was her child—I examined, and found its head very much swollen and mis-shapen—a great swelling on the right side, produced by extravasation of blood—I had no doubt the brain was injured, and that there was a fracture of the skull—it was alive then—I did all I could for it, and left it in care of the dresser and sister of the ward—I hardly expected it would live more than two hours—I saw it dead next morning—I attributed its death to the injury on the head—I made a post mortem examination, which entirely confirmed my opinion.</p>

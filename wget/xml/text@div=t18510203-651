                  </hi>. I have been at Mr. Armstrong's asylum, at Peckham, nine months. I was attendant at the Infirmary three months—I left three months before this happened, and the prisoner succeeded me, he had then about nine or ten patients in the Infirmary to look after—it is one room, a door opens into it from the prisoner's bedroom; there are double doors—no one slept in the same room with the prisoner—no attendant slept in the room with the patients to take care of them—the patients put into the Infirmary were generally of an inoffensive kind—the deceased came to the Asylum I believe at the latter end of last March—he was placed in the Infirmary—he died on the 2nd Jan., at ten minutes to six in the morning—I first heard of something having been done to him on 27th Dec.—the prisoner gave me that information—he said, "I wish you would come and look at Barnes, he appears to have got an accident—I went with him, and found Barnes standing with his shirt off; his small<lb></lb>clothes were on, but the upper part of his body was naked—he appeared as if he was changing his shirt—his left-shoulder looked as if it was broken, or out of joint—it was swollen to about the breadth of four inches—there were black marks which looked inclined to be yellow at the edges—the swelling did not go higher than the joint of the shoulder—it was not so big as my fist—his arm was hanging down—the prisoner said, "I cannot imagine how it has happened"—I said he must have had a very severe fall to cause it, and that it appeared by the colour to have been done two or three days—I do not recollect that he made any observa<lb></lb>tion—I was going to fetch the doctor, and he came up—the prisoner had made no communication to me before that morning about Barnes; if he was aware of any injury happening to any man, it was his duty to tell the doctor immediately, there are two resident in the house, Mr. Burton and Mr. Dickenson—I had last seen the deceased at four o'clock the day before—he was then in his usual dress, which is a jacket, waistcoat, and a pair of flannel trowsers, on purpose for the Infirmary—it was the prisoner's duty to wash and dress him, or to see him dressed—the deceased was a very sullen, obstinate person.</p>

                  </hi>. I am medical superintendent of Mr. Arm<lb></lb>strong's private asylum, Peckham-house—I assumed that office on the 20th Dec, before that I was assistant-surgeon; since Oct. 1849—I suc<lb></lb>ceded Mr. Hill as superintendent—I knew the deceased, he had been a patient there since the 30th of March, 1850—I first heard of his injury</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185102030162"></xptr>
               <p>on Friday the 27th of Dec, about ten in the morning—the prisoner told me of it in the Infirmary ward—I told him to strip Barnes, and I found his arm fractured close up at the shoulder joint, and the arm was very much swollen, inflamed, and bruised down as far as the hand, more espe<lb></lb>cially about the shoulder joint—at the lower part of the upper arm there was a bruise presenting a striking appearance, as if produced by a grasp—the bruises were all round the shoulder joint extending to the upper part of the chest, which was very much swollen—I should attribute the appearances to violence; to a fall, the consequence of violence, not an accidental fall, but a fall some other person had occasioned—I ordered him to bed, and sent for Mr. Fidler the visiting surgeon—while I was making the examination, I said to the prisoner, "This must have occurred some days ago"—he replied that Barnes had been complaining two or three days of having boards in his shoulder, but that he was always talking nonsense of that sort, and he took no notice of it—I then said it must have been caused by violence—he replied that he knew nothing about it—from the state in which he was when I examined him on the 27th, he could neither have dressed himself nor have assisted in dressing himself on the previous day nor from the time it happened—from the appearance I think it must have been quite of three days' standing, and in the state in which it was, I do not think that the person dressing him could have failed to have observed it—he could not have raised his arm after receiving this injury without assistance; it was quite useless—it was the prisoner's duty to dress him, or to be present while he was dressed—I had never been told or heard of his complaining of boards in his shoulder before this morning—I had only been superintendent for a week, but it was the prisoner's duty to report accidents to me—I was in attendance daily up to the 27th, and had gone into the Infirmary every day.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had you occasion to examine the deceased before the 26th? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I had looked at his head on the 26th, but saw no<lb></lb>thing the matter with his shoulder then—he had on his coat and waistcoat, with short sleeves—he was completely dressed—his delusion was that he imagined his belly was as big as a but—I have never had any reason to complain of the prisoner's conduct before—Barnes did not complain to me on the 27th; the prisoner gave me the information himself, he appeared anxious about it—Barnes was capable of giving a correct answer to a question, but his memory was affected: not a great deal—he was a lunatic in the ordinary sense of the term—he was of a sullen disposition, and silent—I am acquainted with the condition of Donnelly, Attwood, and Taylor—they were in the habit of assisting the prisoner in taking care of the patients—I do not know of my own knowledge that Attwood has sometimes dressed the patients—I have seen him arranging their dress when they have been slovenly—I do not remember seeing him feeding them—they are allowed to assist him in the general duties of the ward—Donnelly labours under a delusion that he has various spirits about him—I do not know what particular delusion Attwood and Taylor labour under—Donnelly has never been free from that delusion that I am aware of—Attwood is incapable of carrying on a connected conversation, and at limes is excessively abusive—he is of an irritable temper, and in my judg<lb></lb>ment is a fit subject for a lunatic asylum—Taylor is a man of weak in<lb></lb>tellect</p>

               <p>—he is incapable of taking care of himself—I consider Donelly to be a lunatic—I should not hesitate to sign a certificate to that effect, by reason of the delusion of spirits in his head—Barnes was capable of giving an account of an ordinary transaction, and if anything extraordinary had happened, such as violence to himself, or having been the witness of violence to another, I think he would be capable of giving a rational account of it—I believe Donelly to be quite capable of giving an account of any transaction that happened before his eyes—I have always found him so—it is solely with reference to the delusion about the spirits that I attribute to him being a lunatic—when I have had conversation with him on ordinary subjects I have found him perfectly rational, but for his delu<lb></lb>sion—I have seen nothing in his conduct or demeanour in answering ques<lb></lb>tions otherwise than the demeanour of a sane man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a doctor of medicine. I was formerly district<lb></lb>surgeon, at Mr. Armstrong's asylum—I ceased to be so on the 22nd of Dec., and was succeeded by Mr. Burton—I was there on the 27th of Dec., and my attention was called to the deceased—I found him suffering from a severe injury of the arm, which was fractured, and there was a great deal of swelling and inflammation—I examined him—my opinion is that he had received a severe fall on the back part of the shoulder—the injuries I saw could certainly not have resulted from a man falling of his own ordinary weight, unless he fell from a very great height; certainly not in that room—he was rather a tall man; a little above the ordinary height, and of spare habit—he was not a strong man by any means—I noticed three or four stripes across the top of his arm, as if it had been tightly grasped by another person's hand—I asked him several questions, but the prisoner was not present at the commencement of them—he told me how he had received the injury, and by whom he had received the injury—the prisoner then came into the room, and I said, looking at him and then at the deceased, "This is a sad occurrence; the man's arm is broken"—the prisoner replied, "I assure you I know nothing of it"—I said, looking at the deceased, "And be says that you did it, and Donelly here says he saw you do it"—Donelly was close by—the prisoner replied, "That is quite false, I never injured him, I never lifted my hand to him"—Don<lb></lb>elly said, "Yes, you know you did; you took hold of him by the arm" taking hold of the prisoner's arm at the time and showing me "in this way" (<hi rend="italic">with both hands</hi>), "and tripped him up, and threw him heavily on the floor" placing his foot against the prisoner to show me how it was done—the prisoner replied, "That is quite false"—I said I was sorry to hear him accused of such a thing, as I had no reason to suppose him guilty of hav<lb></lb>ing done so—I remarked again that the injury must have been done several days—he replied, "I assure you I knew nothing of it, till this morning"—I did not ask him any more questions—the deceased was pre<lb></lb>sent—we were standing at the foot of his bedstead—his countenance was directed towards the prisoner and me alternately—he had answered my questions quite rationally, and appeared perfectly to understand what was said and done—I had seen Barnes on the 24th of Dec, between eleven and twelve o'clock—he was then fully dressed, and sitting on a form—I saw him again on the 26th fully dressed, in the same position—he was of a sullen temper, and did not usually speak to anybody unless they first addressed him, and generally then he was by no means communicative—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185102030164"></xptr>
               <p>he did not speak to me on either of those days—from what I saw on the 27th he could not have been able to put on or take off his clothes, or wash himself for two or three days before—I have had my attention directed to the insane for nine years—the result of my experience is that in many cases persons of unsound mind bear personal injury and pain without complaining.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You have been asked about your general know<lb></lb>ledge of the insane; if a man is insane, is his memory necessarily affected? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not always, not necessarily—it frequently is, but frequently is not—I have seen Dr. Haslar's work—I do not agree in all cases with his remark that "Memory appears to be perfectly defective in cases of insanity"—certainly not—it may probably be so in the generality of cases—madness is commonly accompanied by a great deal of excitability of the brain, but in some cases it is not—it is very often accompanied by physical irritation of the brain—it is one of the most common causes of madness, either primarily or secondarily—in certain cases of acute madness, the ideas in the mind of a madman succeed each other more rapidly than in the mind of a sane man, and in a more confused manner; that is, where there is actual irritation of the brain—it is quite possible for a man to entertain a delusion on one subject without its affecting his mind generally on other subjects—in most cases where a delusion prevails and the man is mad, the rest of his mind is affected to some extent—I agree with Dr. Pritchard in his observation that" In monomania the mind is unsound, but unsound in one point only"—there is no doubt, however, that all the mental facul<lb></lb>ties are more or less affected, but the affection is more strongly manifested in some than in others—I have had opportunities of seeing Barnes pretty often—the only delusion he laboured under was, that his stomach was always full, as full as a butt, and that it could not contain more—that was the great reason why he objected to take food—it is difficult to ascer<lb></lb>tain, without strict inquiry, the extent of a madman's delusions—they have some times the power of concealing their delusions even from their medical attendants, especially after having been conversed with frequently about the delusions, and knowing that they are the cause of their detention, but it is infrequent—it is a doubtful point whether what they say is not for a particular purpose; for instance, to obtain liberty—if a madman has an object to answer, he is sometimes capable of concealing his delusions—I have known it, but not as a general rule—they are probably capable of a good deal of dissimulation; many are, I know, but many do not exhibit that tendency—it is common for a certain class of madmen to exhibit a great deal of cunning—Barnes had been very weak ever since his admis<lb></lb>sion—his mind was weak also—he bad refused food, and during the whole of his residence he required to be fed—he frequently refused food—I agree with Dr. Burton that his memory was impaired—Donelly laboured under a delusion with respect to spirits—he is, in the strict sense of the word, a lunatic, inasmuch as helabours under a delusion—he is not excitable by any means—Attwood is an excitable person—during the four years I have been there, I have questioned Donelly as to the extent of his delusion—he has always laboured under that notion about spirits—when I saw Barnes on the 24th and 26th of December, I saw nothing unusual in his appearance—I know that the patients sometimes assisted Hill in the discharge of his duties inperforming offices about the persons of the others,</p>

               <p>and making themselves generally useful in the presence of Hill—occa<lb></lb>sionally in washing and dressing the other patients, but not as a general rule—the prisoner has been generally kind, humane, and attentive towards those under his care—I have not known Barnes quarrelsome and irritable with the other patients—I have known that he has been sullen; he would probably not speak to them unless addressed—he was sullen, obstinate, and disinclined to do what might be required of Him—I have seen the other patients feeding him—after the deceased told me that the injury was done to him by a keeper, I asked if he could tell me his name—he said, "I don't recollect his name; I don't know his name"—I said, "Was it Muncaster?" "No;" "Was it Stevens?" "No;" "Was it Hill?"and he said, "Yes, that is him"—Donelly was not present then—I had not seen him—I saw him a few minutes afterwards—the deceased took no part in the conversa<lb></lb>tion, but from his manner he evidently understood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How soon afterwards did Donelly come into the room? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Five or ten minutes after I went in, and the prisoner about five minutes after—I had given no account to Donelly of what Barnes had told me before he came in—from seven to ten minutes, at most, elapsed between Barnes giving me the account and my repeating it in the presence of the prisoner—I certainly believe the deceased to have heard and under<lb></lb>stood all that was said—Barnes was a patient troublesome to a keeper—I have found monomaniacs perfectly rational on all subjects unconnected with the delusion under which they are labouring.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Speaking as a man of experience in these unhappy delusions, can you, in your judgment, trace any connection between the statements made by the deceased and the delusion under which he was labouring? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> None whatever—I have known instances of lunatics concealing their delusions, but in all these cases there has been an apparent and evident motive—I have known decided lunatics, not monomaniacs, in what are called lucid intervals, capable of going about and managing their own affairs—in ordinary cases there is no particular difference between a mono<lb></lb>maniac, apart from his particular delusion, and an insane person in a lucid interval—during the lucid interval of the insane person he is well, but a monomaniac is a monomaniac all the time—in the instance of a mono<lb></lb>maniac you produce the insanity the moment you touch the particular chord—it is possible that you might revive insanity in a madman during a lucid interval, by touching on the same subject, if it is but recent—I always found Donelly perfectly rational, except on the subject of his particular delusion—I have heard him examined as to his knowledge of a future state, and of the obligation of an oath.</p>

               <p>portion of the bone was in its situation, and the joint was not injured, but the lower portion was driven right up into the arm-pit, pressing on the nerves in that situation—there were also fractures of the sixth and seventh ribs, on the right side, about their centre, and also of the eleventh and twelfth, on the same side, which had penetrated the lining membranes of the chest, and produced evident signs of inflammation—the lungs were diseased by consumption of long standing—the substance of the brain was thickened, and bore the ordinary appearance of the brain of a lunatic—its substance was a little soft—I cannot state the exact time that this injury must have been inflicted, but from four to ten days—the injuries had been sustained for some time—I say that from the appearance of the bruises—they all bad the same amount of discoloration—I should attri<lb></lb>bute the injuries to great and inordinate violence, I have no doubt about it—they could not have been from a simple fall, nor could they have been occasioned by the man himself—I think if the party had been tripped up on the ground, that would not have caused it, without some additional weight falling on him—if the person who tripped him up had fallen on him, that would account for it—the injury could not have been occasioned by a person falling from a great height to the ground—if a person of con<lb></lb>siderable power had taken him by the arm, and thrown him on the ground with violence, that would account for it, but then it would be difficult to account for the fractured ribs without additional weight—I should say exhaustion was the immediate cause of death—that would naturally follow such injuries, and within the time I have mentioned—I have had some experience of lunatics, and have found that they suffer severe pain without complaint.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PARNELL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did you examine the deceased? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On 3rd Jan., the day after the death—the examination was partly conducted by Mr. Flower—I do not know whether the body had been washed—the skull and membranes presented the appearance of a con<lb></lb>firmed lunatic—it is impossible for me to say how long he had been so—it is usual for lunatics to have an antipathy to the persons who are set over them to keep them—that would be more probably the case with a person of a sullen disposition than with ordinary lunatics—the deceased's lungs were diseased from consumption—I do not think some of those injuries could have been inflicted at the commencement of the ten days, and the others at the latter end—assuming that the injuries were done at different times, I do not think a fall could have occasioned them—it must have been very violent—the sixth and seventh ribs were over a part which was in a disordered state; but not the eleventh and twelfth—a sudden jerk from a fall on the floor, if a man had been standing, or even if he had fallen from a form, would not have been violent enough to have occasioned it—I do not think it possible that it could have been produced by being thrown down by a man's hand.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You observed the bruises on the shoulder and arm? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, they extended from the shoulder down to the back of the left arm—the arm was bruised all the way down, more or less—it is possible that might have been produced by a series of blows on the arm if it had been</p>

               <p>held up, and the series of <hi rend="italic">pummellings</hi> made on it—there were a great many different bruises—there was one on the left side of the head—that might have been caused by a blow with the fist—there were also bruises on the breast; they did not necessarily result from the arm being broken; they were separate from those on the arm—there were also bruises on the left side; those might be the result of a severe beating with the fist, or with some blunt instrument—it is my opinion that whoever injured the man must have exercised a great deal of violence—I do not think it could occur in an ordinary struggle—it is very unusual for such injuries to result from wrestling, unless the deceased fell on some very hard substance, or on the floor—if a very heavy man fell upon him in that way, the fracture of the ribs might have arisen—the broken ribs were a very short distance from each other; my impression is that the knees did it—the sixth and seventh, and eleventh and twelfth ribs are about the same distance at if a man had fallen with both his knees upon him, and they were driven in, much as though such an occurrence had really taken place—it might have been caused by the man falling on a form—it must have been very violent wrestling to have caused it—the bruises might have been produced by the bands, from blows—it is possible that the bruises might have been caused by a fall on the floor, considering the sympathy with the muscles, and between the parts—I examined the bones, but did not find them more brittle than ordinarily—I tried to break the ribs on the same side as those that were fractured, but could not do so with ordinary force.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing a person to have fallen on the deceased with his knees upon those ribs, would that account for the whole that you observed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, such a fall would account not only for the broken ribs, but also for the bruises.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you generally dress and undress Barnes? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, because he would resist me, and I had to tell the keeper that he was not in bed—I did so on this night—it would depend on whether we agreed—we often disagreed—Hill would put him to bed, whether he would or not—I recollect Attwood, another assistant-patient—he used not to put Barnes to bed—he would feed him, he would put on his clothes sometimes, but the keeper dressed him generally—sometimes Attwood did it, but Barnes would not let him; he was often irritated with him—I believe after his arm was hurt, Attwood was irritated with him—Attwood was a man of irritable temper, very easily vexed, but neither Attwood nor me could do anything with Barnes—he was particularly irritable with Attwood—I have known Attwood to be violent even with me; he would get angry, and I would evade him—I never saw him very violent—I have seen him irritated very much, calling names to the superiors of our place, and delivering his pas<lb></lb>sions—I have known him violent towards Barnes twice—he put me in mind of myself, for fear I should evade my memory—I saw him push him, and he pushed him backwards on the form, but he did not fall on the ground—that was all that I saw.</p>

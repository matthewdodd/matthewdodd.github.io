I said No, and told him he was to go himself; I said that from the directions I had received - While we were talking together, Aldred the officer came up, and asked me what it was about; I told him the circumstances, and he took the prisoner in charge - we went to Masterman's together; the prisoner had beckoned me over to him, before I went up to him; as we went along, I heard him say to Aldred, that it was all right, he had been there the night before.</p>

            . I am a City-officer. I was in Cannon-street, near the London Life Insurance Office, on the 18th of September - my attention was attracted by Perkins and the prisoner talking; in consequence of what passed I took the prisoner into custody - he said in my hearing that he came into possession of the cheque from a person at No. 78, Grosvenor-street, or Grosvenor-square, I will not be certain which; this was before we got to the banking house, and before we got there he said he was at Masterman's the night before with a cheque, and I should find it all right - on arriving there Brand identified him, and said, "You are the young man who presented a cheque here last night;" the prisoner made no answer -I took him into the office and searched him, and heard him say he was the young man who had been there the night before; as I took him to the Compter, after his examination, he said, "I have one thing I wish to state to you;" he put out his hands - I shook hands with him, and said, "If it is any thing to benefit you, I shall be happy to hear it, if not, say nothing;" he said, "What I want you to do will be the means of clearing me of this altogether - if you will go up to the corner of St. Martin's-lane, near Orange-street, Leicester-fields, you will there see a young man, between the hours of half-past five and six o'clock; his dress will be a blue coat, with yellow buttons, and trousers, or a green coat with yellow buttons"- I said, "Can you give me any further description of the young man;" he said, "He has a roundish face, fresh colour, dark hair, smoothed over his face," and that he was to meet him there, if he got the money, and give it him- I went there with White, my brother officer, at the time he stated, and waited till half-past six o'clock, but saw nobody at all answering his description; I afterwards went to the Feathers, in Orange-street, kept by Page - that is eight hundred or a thousand yards from the place I was desired to go to; I went there because the prisoner had told me he lodged there the night before, and was well known to Mr. Page - a room was pointed out to me there, which I searched, and found these strips of paper(looking at them) - I found all these in the room on the first search; some in the fire-place, some on the floor, and some on the cill just outside the window of the room- I marked them; on the Saturday I searched the dustcellar in that house, and found these papers which I produce - they have never been out of my possession.</p>

            . ESQ. I am the son of John Smith, who is a banker - I have lived in Grosvenor-square; there is no No.72 in the square - I think the last number is 44; my father was out of town at the time this cheque is dated, and I think the whole of September - I was in town the greatest part of the month; I know nothing of the prisoner - I am not aware of having seen him before; my father had so dealings with the prisoner, to my knowledge - he lives at No.22, Grosvenor-square; I am not aware of any other John Smith living in Grosvenor-square.</p>
               <p>The cheque was here put in and read; also the papers which had the words "Please to pay Mr. John Smith, 75. A. 
               <persName id="t18291029-127-person1031">Geo. Young</persName>
            ," and parts of other words composing the cheque.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to CHRISTOPHER PERKINGS. Q. Are you certain whether I told you No.32 or 72? A. I understood you 72, and am sure you said Grosvenor-square.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I told him Leicester-square. On Thursday, the 17th of September, a gentleman I know very well to have been at the Horse-bazaar, having horses there, met me by accident in Leicester-square. and asked me to go to the Bank for him, to draw the money for a horse and gig he had sold on Saturday; it was customary for them to give a cheque four days after the sale - he said he had received it four days before, and had not time to go- I had frequently seen him in the counting-house and yard: he went by the name of Smith: he desired me to meet him again at nine o'clock that evening - I went to the banker's; the gentleman said he was under a heavy penalty if he paid it, wrote "Not dated, &amp;c.," and returned it to me to get another more correct; I took it to the gentleman at the time appointed - he was in company with another gentleman; I handed him the cheque - he said he would give it to Young and get another; I was to meet him at the top of Martin-street, Leicester-square, at nine o'clock next morning; he gave me the cheque, and desired me on no consideration to go myself, but to employ a Temple porter - he gave me 1s. to pay the porter: I had no money myself, and thought I could not get a porter there for that money - I went on to the lane, gave this man the job, and told him to come to me, not to the public-house in the lane, but to another in Cannon-street; I waited a considerable time for him, and a few minutes after I saw him going up the lane with another person - I called him over, and asked if he had received the money; he said No, I had better go myself; I said I would - this gentleman came and took me to the banking-house, and asked me several question, which I answered as well as I could; Mr. Gates asked if he went with me, whether I could find the gentleman - I said not till the time appointed, half-past five o'clock, but he would not give me an opportunity of going then, or I dare say I could have pointed him out.</p>

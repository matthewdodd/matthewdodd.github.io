I told him I had not, he asked me if I would let him see them? I looked in the window for them, where I had seen them the same morning, but they were gone, I then went and asked my wife and children, if either of them had disposed of them in my absence? they told me they had not, Mr. Packer told me there was a man detected for stealing a table cloth at the White Horse inn, at Uxbridge, and at the top of his bundle he had a set of weights, which he thought he saw at my house; the next day I heard the prisoner was to be examined. And I can prove the weights, I saw the weights produced before the magistrate, the weights are here.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am constable of Uxbridge. On Tuesday the 7th of January I stopped the prisoner, between the hours of two and three in the afternoon, being sent for by Mr. - , of the White Horse, to take the prisoner into custody for stealing a table cloth; after I had the prisoner in custody, he informed me he had a bundle at the Chequer inn, at Uxbridge, I went with the prisoner to the Chequers, the landlady there said that was the man that had left the bundle, and it was produced to me, the bundle was not tied up very tight, the prisoner tied the bundle up, and gave it into my care; I immediately put a string about the bundle, and sealed them up with a seal, and they were in my custody till they were had before the magistrate; the next day before the magistrate I opened the bundle, wherein was contained a quantity of things, such as a brass flower drudger, a brass candlestick, one set of brass weights, and a number of other things, the set contains seven weights.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you enquire of the prisoner how he came by these things? - When he was before the magistrate we enquired of him how he came by these things, he said he found them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When I came into Uxbridge I left my bundle at the sign of the Chequers, I untied my bundle, and left it untied; ask him where he found the bundle? - When you went to the Chequers inn, it laid on the dresser.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It was moved from the place where I left it.</p>
               <p>Court. Did the prisoner see the brass weights? - I did not see the brass weights in the bundle, they were tied up in this cloth, and delivered to me.</p>
               <p>Court to Mason. What time of the day was the prisoner at your house? - Between one and two in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is your house from the Chequers that Harman has spoken to? - About two hundred yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray is the person that keeps the Chequers here? - No. These brass weights they are my property, I have had them a great while by me, I have taken notice on the pound weight there is marked sixteen ounces, avoirdupois; I believe them to be mine, by having them so long by me, and often having them<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150126"></xptr>in my hand, there is no other mark but what is common, on them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. One weight is like another, and I have had them almost three years, I am a gingerbread-baker by trade.</p>
               <p>Mason. I can very safely say they are my weights.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I used to go to markets and fairs, and I have had occasion for weights and scales ever since I left Woodstock, I have been absent from there some time, I was in business there upwards of twenty-five years, but affairs did not go on as well as I could wish; I know two gentlemen, Mr. Sangster in Milk-street, Cheapside, and Mr. Peters in the Borough; I never said that I found them weights, I said I found the other things.</p>

               <p>Thomas Hills. I live with Mr. Shepherd, an ironmonger in the Minories. On the 7th of June, between 9 and 12 at night, coming over Tower-hill I heard a young fellow say, you stole them stockings; I seeing the prisoner with a parcel under his arm stopt him, and brought him to a shop where I found he had offered them to sale; I carried him on into Rosemary lane, where I met two sailors that lodged with Mr. Blare, they said this is the man; they took him in at a public house, Mr. Blare was sent for, who said the stockings were his property; then the prisoner said, it was the first fact, and he hoped he would forgive him. The next day he confessed before the Justice, that he took them out of Mr. Blare's shop.</p>

            . On the 7th of June, about 9 in the evening, there were two or three of my lodgers, seafaring men, in my shop, a man came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176307060031"></xptr> in in a sailor's dress, I did not mind him; soon after he was gone, one of my lodgers said, did that man buy any thing, he has got something out with him? then they ran out, and in about three quarters of an hour one came back and said, they had got him in a public house in Rosemary-lane; I went, there lay my stockings by the prisoner; he owned he took them from a shelf behind the door in the shop; he confessed the same before the Magistrate; (the stockings produced in court, and deposed to) he named a man's name, who he said was in the street at the time, advised him to come in, and told him that he might with safety take what he would, and that he had robbed the shop himself.</p>

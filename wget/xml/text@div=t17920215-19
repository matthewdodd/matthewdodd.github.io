On Saturday preceding the 18th of January, my brother in law called upon me; there were some people in my room, so that I could not talk to him; when he went down I followed him, I told him in the passage we had got some money, and begged him to come in the middle of the week to place out the money with Mr. Kirkman; when he was gone, Mrs. Baker came out and said, is that your brother? I said yes; she said, he is a pretty man; she then said, I find you have got money. On Monday I was going out to buy potatoes, Mrs. Baker said, where are you going? I said only to buy some potatoes: she said, if you leave that girl at home, you will repent every vein in your heart; I told her I had no suspicion of the girl; but if she had, to go up stairs, and wait till my return: she said she would go up and make a pretence to borrow the rolling-pin. On the same day she wanted me to go with her and buy a pair of pattens; I refused; she then wanted me to go and buy a patch for a gown; I refused. The same day, about two o'clock, she wanted me to go to Cranbourn-alley, to see some of the Dutchess of York's bonnet's; I said, I will not go: she then pressed me to go to see the King and Queen going to court; still I refused. On Tuesday I was going to washing, and she said, I had better go out, the air would do me good; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179202150022"></xptr>said I would not. On Wednesday she came up and lighted a candle, and asked me if I would go and see the King go to Court; I refused; she asked me whether I was going to market; I said yes: she said if you leave Nanny in the house, you may take my word you will be robbed: I asked the girl to go to market: she said she would; then she said, if Nanny and me went to market, she would boil the kettle against our coming back; I said, I will drink tea before I go; I did so, and she went to market with me and the girl; after we had got about five yards from the house, Mrs. Baker said, Nanny, have you shut the door, go back and see if it is safe? she did so, and joined us again; when I went out I did not know of any person being in the house; there were four men lodged in the back-room, I shut that room window about a minute before I went out, there was not any body in that room; we went to Lombard-court, she wanted me to go into a linen-draper's shop to look at some shawls; I said no. I did not want any; then she said, Mrs. Ashley, this is the first time I have been out with you, what will you drink? I said nothing, it will make me sick; we were gone about an hour; when I got home I saw the lid of the chest open in which we kept our money, open and propped up by the lid of the till; it was broke open; the girl was at home about two minutes before me, not more; she said to Hunt she is ruined; I heard that before I got up stairs, the pen-case was kept in the till, and the several articles mentioned in the indictment, the drawers had all been broken open, and the things thrown about; the watch hung over the mantle-piece, the lock was broke open, and it is an extraordinary good one; I was very much alarmed, and I went into fits. On Thursday morning Baker and his wife were taken up, I went down into their apartment, I saw Mr. De la Fontaine pick up this pen-case, it was on the floor under the bed; Mrs. Baker said, Mrs. Ashley has put that there; I left two receipts for rent in the till, that I swear, these receipts were found in the room, but not by me; they were picked up by the constable.</p>

No body was left in Mrs. Ashley's apartments; when I got a little way from the house, Mrs. Baker said, have you shut the door? I went back and found it fast; when we went out I left the door of Ashley's room double locked, and when I returned I found it only single<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179202150023"></xptr>locked; I saw the chest broke open; I shrieked out, and Hunt, the publican, ran into the house; Mrs. Ashley came home in about two minutes after I had got home: when Mrs. Baker came home, Mrs. Ashley said, are you not a base woman to take me out, and let your gang rob me? I was in the front room when the officers searched; one of them took up a bonnet, and under it he found two papers with Ashley's name on them: I cried out, Oh, Lord!</p>

               <p>Prisoner Baker. I leave it to my counsel.</p>
               <p>Mr. BRIANT sworn.</p>
               <p>I am solicitor for the prisoner: on the Thursday after the Queen's birth-day, the prisoners were examined, between six and seven, I think; the following evening, Friday, I was sitting, in a family manner, in Mrs. Merryfield's bar; De la Fontaine came in, and the conversation turned upon Baker; he then said he had heard Baker speak to his wife; this was the day after the first examination; he said that he would not do the prisoner any harm, for that he would not reveal it.</p>

               <p>I lodged at Ashley's house at the time of the robbery; I saw a man at Baker's door; I thought he was an acquaintance; he was a middle-sized man; he had a green upper-coat on; I told this to Mrs. Ashley: I cannot say whether the prisoner is or is not the person I saw.</p>
               <p>Jury to Mrs. Ashley. Did you ever see the prisoner in a green coat? - Frequently.</p>

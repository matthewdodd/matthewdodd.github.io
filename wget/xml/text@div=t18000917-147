               <p>The Hon. Spencer Percival. May it please your Lordship. Gentlemen of the Jury. In this case, I am of counsel for the prosecution, and you will find that your attention will be directed in the trial of this indictment, to a very interesting and extremely important case; of the importance of it, you must be already apprized by the opening of the indictment, which discloses that it charges the prisoner with a capital offence. Gentlemen, I feel myself fully justified in saying, that in the decision of this case, and in your attention to it, you will feel great anxiety and concern, because, in the part that I have had to discharge, and a very inferior part, in such a duty as this, I have felt very considerable anxiety and concern, for, Gentlemen, I have felt it to be my duty, and an extremely painful duty, I can assure you, to advise this prosecution to be carried to this length against the gentleman who now stands at the bar.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, Mr. Thomas, the prisoner at the bar, is an attorney, in Northamptonshire, a gentleman of very excellent character, excepting in this transaction, in which I say he is implicated in very gross fraud. Gentlemen, he is a man of very considerable fortune, as I understand, independent of his professional pursuits; he is a gentleman for whom I see here, from my personal acquaintance with the country of Northampton, many excellent persons attending to testify to his good character; I have, by a letter from the member for that county, received the most ample testimony to that character, furnished under circumstances which render it impossible for him to attend here, on account of his public duty, in endeavouring to suppress those riots which are disgracing that part of the country as well as others. These peculiar circumstances, in the situation of the county, at this time, though they may not have prevented him from the benefit of many respectable witnesses, yet, as they may possibly exclude him from more than I am acquainted with, leads me to think it a duty which I owe to the prisoner, to state in the outset, that I do really believe you may conscientiously come to a decision upon this case, with your prejudices strongly in favour of the prisoner at the bar; leading you to believe, that from his situation in life, leading you to believe, that from his circumstances and his property, leading you to believe, that from his general character, he is as unlikely a person to have been guilty of this or any other felonious fraud as any that could possibly have been brought before you.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, Having said thus much in justice to the prisoner, I must say a little in justice to the prosecution, and if there is any blame in bringing this gentleman to trial, under these circumstances, it is a blame that I wish to let you and the public know should not fall, and should not rest any where but with those, who having had all the materials laid before them, have thought it their public duty to bring it to this issue.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, The case against Mr. Thomas is a charge for uttering a variety of acquittances and receipts, for the purpose, we say, of defrauding his Majesty. A person of the name of Collinridge, who died in 1798, was a public accomptant, and a person employed under the Navy Board, to convert timber for the purposes of the Navy; he had been in that situation several years, and when he died, in 1798; there was a charge against him of 11, 535l. 16s. 1d. a sum of money entrusted to him for the public service for some years back, of which he had rendered no account; it was therefore thought expedient to issue an extent upon the property, not that it was supposed, perhaps, that the whole of this sum, or any large part of it, would ultimately be found to be the balance against the deceased; but, however, the public, not knowing to what extent that balance might reach, made their claim, and under that extent, the real and personal property of Mr. Collinridge was sold, the personal property was sold for something between four and 500l. and the real estate produced upwards of 100l. a year. At this time, the prisoner, who was an attorney in that neighbourhood, wrote to a gentleman in the Navy Office, that he was employed by the executors of Mr. Collinridge, for the purpose of settling and adjusting this account, between them and the Navy Board; he stated, that he had got all Mr. Collinridge's papers, that he had got the rough draft of the account, but not being well acquainted with the matter, found great difficulty in settling this complicated account, and therefore prayed to have the best assistance that this gentleman, under the Navy Board, could give him. This letter was laid before the Navy Board, and Mr. Thomas, not having an answer so soon as he expected, wrote a second letter, which we have notice to produce, and which unquestionably we shall produce. Upon the face of these letters, there is certainly nothing but what appears perfectly right, fair, and consistent with the character of a person intending to do justice. It does, indeed, appear a slight circumstance, that in these letters, the prisoner represents himself to be employed by the executors, and in a subsequent letter, he says, that he did it for the creditors. These letters were laid before the Navy Board, and were, in the due course of office, sent by them to the Solicitor for the Navy Board, for him to give a proper answer; Mr. Bicknell, Solicitor for the Board, accordingly returned an answer to Mr. Thomas, representing to him, that he apprehended, as he had found a rough draft of the account, it would not be involved in that difficulty, that he imagin ed, because, from that rough draft, if it was supported by vouchers, the balance would be easily ascertained; but Mr. Bicknell did undoubtedly give Mr. Thomas to understand, that it was absolutely necessary that he should produce vouchers for the sums that he insisted should be<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180009170114"></xptr>set off. In consequence of this, it will appear that the prisoner undertook the transaction; that he procured vouchers; represented that he had found some vouchers already signed, and procured others to be signed that were due, and transmitted them to the Navy Board, and upon that account it appeared, that instead of a balance against Mr. Collinridge, there was a balance of 1200l. in favour of the deceased's estate against the Navy Board. Gentlemen, this was not expected, and it was, perhaps, the first circumstance that rendered it material to look into it; they were therefore put into a course of examination, and the person employed after Mr. Collinridge, in the same situation in the country, was a person that the Navy Board conceived most capable of procuring useful information, and therefore the account and vouchers were sent into the country to Mr. Boddy, for the purpose of examining their accuracy; upon Mr. Boddy's enquiring into the state of these accounts; the result of it, which he discovered in a very short time after he was employed in this way, was, that he found some of the receipts forged for money that had never been paid, and for work that had never been done; the discovery of this fact, though certainly in the first instance, not to a very great extent, made it necessary to take up the business in a very serious light. Gentlemen, you will find that the prisoner came to Mr. Boddy several times, with great anxiety to expedite the settlement of these accounts, for the purpose of releasing the estates; Mr. Boddy told him he found the accounts very wrong; he told him that he had discovered these forgeries; upon this the prisoner, at the bar, appeared, as I understand the witnesses will say, extremely agitated; such an appearance, I am ready to admit, may be consistent with innocence, because, if a man is charged with a serious offence, it is no wonder that he should feel great anxiety; but, however, in consequence of this, he told Mr. Boddy, that if that was the case, he would give up the balance, he would undertake on the part of the executors that the balance should be given up, and if the Commissioners of the Navy would consent to refund what they had received upon the sale of the personal effects, and remove the extent, that they would give up this balance of twelve hundred and odd pounds.</p>

               <p>Gentlemen. The person who was employed in the country, feeling the great difficulty in which he was involved, in getting accurate information, thought it not inexpedient that such a proposition should be forwarded to the Commissioners; and, therefore, at the request of Mr. Thomas, he wrote to the Commissioners, adopting a letter dictated by Mr. Thomas, the draft of which we have to produce. Gentlemen, this offer the Commissioners did not think proper to accept, and Mr. Thomas, understanding that they did not think proper to accept it, made a more extensive offer; he offered to give up the whole of the demand, and let the Commissioners of the Navy do what they pleased. Gentlemen, if this was a transaction in which Mr. Thomas was concerned for his own interest, in which Mr. Thomas was claiming this balance of 1200l. for himself, in which Mr. Thomas was concerned for his own interest, in endeavouring to procure the release of this estate from the extent and the return of the four hundred and odd pounds for which the personal estate was sold, it might have been a matter of Mr. Thomas's direction to say, I will give this up, that I may not be harrassed with any further proceedings; but this was not Mr. Thomas's money, but money that he was employed to collect for others, for the purpose of making the estate of this gentleman solvent, and to discharge his debts; it does; therefore, seem rather an extraordinary conduct on the part of Mr. Thomas, that rather than the enquiry should be proceeded in, he should be desirous of giving up the whole demand. However, these repeated offers were not thought proper to be accepted, it therefore seemed expedient to have a warrant issued to take Mr. Thomas into custody, and he was brought to town for examination; this was as long ago as October, 1799. In the course of this examination, Mr. Thomas presented a memorial to the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty and Navy. At that time, the case did not seem to me for the purposes of public justice at all, in a state in which either, with regard to the interests of the prisoner, or the public, it was ripe for trial, and therefore I did, and I hope I did nothing wrong in so doing, I am sure nothing harsh towards Mr. Thomas, in consenting on the part of the Navy Board, that Mr. Thomas should be let out upon bail; this was in October, 1799.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, It is now necessary to state to you the contents of this memorial; he states, that after the extent had issued, the executors were so alarmed, and so disinclined to embark in the trouble of enquiring into these accounts, that they determined to have nothing to do with the effects, and relinquished their trusts in consequence of it; and that he was employed by the creditors in endeavouring to liquidate the accounts. He then states, that he had been told by Mr. Bicknell, by letter, that it was necessary for him to procure vouchers, in order to make good his demand against the public, which was to be set off. He says, in consequence of the above letter, your petitioner's clerk examined into the papers for vouchers, many of which were found in a loose state in the box, and some others, for small sums, appeared to have marks to them; and your petitioner then believing, and still believing that those sums had been paid, and were really due; and the said Adams representing to your petitioner, that Mr. Collinridge in his life-time had occasionally procured receipts for monies paid to be attested afterwards; and your petitioner placing such confidence in said Adams's representation, requested him to attest some of them, which he did without the most distant idea of fraud or intention of imposition. He then states the case of his apprehension, and of the forged mark of a man of the name of Onan, who is represented as not having been capable of writing, and whose signature is attested by persons of the name of Adams and Bigxby.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, with a view to that, he says, that he learned from Adams, that Mr. Collinridge was in the habit of obtaining attestations to the marks of persons subsequent to the period of their making that mark, and finding that that was the habit of Mr. Collinridge, he adopted it, but without any intention of fraud on his part; this showed great inaccuracy, great impropriety, and great neglect, in the manner of that gentleman settling his affairs; and it did not appear to me, that if it could be made out, in fact, that this mark of 
               <persName id="t18000917-147-person1377">Wm. Onan</persName>
             had been put in Mr. Collinridge's life-time, he, perhaps, having forged it himself; that Mr. Thomas having<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180009170115"></xptr>procured another person to attest, as if he had seen it done, that that was the mark of the man; however strongly this might lead to fraud, yet, that it would not come up to the charge of uttering an instrument, knowing it to be forged, against Mr. Thomas; and, therefore, the enquiry that I thought important to be made, was to know how far we could, or not, support that part of the assertion contained in the memorial; we made enquiries, and whether it was owing to a great number of persons being creditors, or whether it was from the affection that the people in that neighbourhood have for the character of this respectable gentleman, I know not, but there was considerable difficulty in procuring any intelligence; it then became a question, not being able to prove that these receipts were not so found among Mr. Collinridge's papers, whether it would be proper that this prosecution should be instituted, in the exercise, perhaps, of a very bad direction, I thought it should not, and as soon as I so felt, I thought it proper to give Mr. 
               <persName id="t18000917-147-person1378">Thomas</persName>
             the earliest intelligence, that it was not the intention of the Navy Board to prosecute him; I had hardly given this pleasing information to Mr. Thomas, when we procured intelligence of extreme importance, which will be laid before you in evidence, namely, that the receipts, with the mark of

            , which are represented in this memorial to be found ready marked among the papers of Mr. Collinridge, were receipts not so found, but receipts drawn up by the amanuensis of Mr. Thomas, subsequent to the period at which they were purported to be drawn. We had, at the same time, procured the means of showing the hand-writing of Mr. Thomas, himself, to a forged receipt, which did away, as appeared to me, the defence that was set up for him; it appeared to me, therefore, to be my duty to give Mr.

             the earliest intimation, that the notice, which I had before given, must be considered as countermanded; but as this might lead Mr. Thomas into a situation which might embarrass him very much, the trial was postponed until the present Sessions. Under these circumstances it is now brought before you.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, Having thus stated the general nature of the case, I will very shortly state to you the circumstances that will be laid before you in evidence. The first instrument in the indictment, is an acquittance of a person of the name of

               <p>Gentlemen, The only William Clarke that we can find in that neighbourhood, is a wheelwright; and the receipt purports to be for wheelwright's work; we have made all the enquiry possible, and the result is, that no money had ever been paid; that there was none due; nor any work done by him for Mr. Collinridge, at all, subsequent to the year 1788; and that for nineteen years past, the whole amount of work done, by him, for Mr. Collinridge, was no more than 1l. 19s. The forgery of this acquittance will, therefore, be proved; the concern of the prisoner, with the receipt, will be made out, in his own hand-writing, for money which was never paid, and which was, in point of fact, never due.

               <p>Gentlemen, The next cases are those of Sanders, in which there is this particular and important circumstance: Sanders undoubtedly had been employed by Mr. Collinridge, and had been paid by Mr. Collinridge, and, therefore, there was no impropriety, as far as I conceive, in Mr. Thomas procuring from Sanders, vouchers for money actually due; he applied, therefore, to Sanders, and told him, he found in the accounts of the deceased, some sums of money that had been paid by Mr. Collinridge to him, for which there were no vouchers; Sanders said, he had no demand upon the estate, but if it was so, and others had done the same, he would; he accordingly signed several of these receipts; he found, however, that he had signed one or two receipts of the year 1796, and, upon looking at them, he says to Mr. Thomas, this cannot be right, because I was out of the country in 1796, and, therefore, these receipts I ought not to sign; upon which, Mr. Thomas said, if that was the case, he should sign no more, yet there are, in this account, and charged in this indictment, no less than four receipts of the year 1796, purporting to be signed by this very Sanders, who will tell you, they are not in his hand-writing. If they were receipts that Sanders had signed, Mr. Thomas being afterwards apprized that they could not constitute just items in the account; if Mr. Thomas had not forgot what was due to his own character, and to justice, he would never have presented those receipts; it is for Mr. Thomas to account for that circumstance; if they are signed by Sanders, to be sure, it is no forgery-it is nothing but a gross fraud; but if they are not signed by Sanders, it is both fraud and forgery of the grossest kind.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, There are other receipts of a person of the name of 
               <persName id="t18000917-147-person1387">

            , and he will tell you, it is not his handwriting; that if it is meant for him, he has not signed it, and it is a forgery.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, There are other cases, which I do not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180009170116"></xptr>know that it will be necessary for me to state to you of charges for money not due, for money that has not been paid, and supported and confirmed by false vouchers.</p>
               <p>Now, Gentlemen, under these circumstances, it appears necessary to say a few words, and a very few words more. With regard to the nature of making up these vouchers, I should certainly think, that if Mr. Thomas had got persons, who had been paid, and whose receipts had been lost, to sign vouchers for money actually due, that there could be no possible blame rest upon him for endeavouring to obtain accurate vouchers for payments that had actually been made; but, though Mr. Thomas might believe that these sums were so actually due from the public, no man can doubt that the obtaining a false signature, would amount to the crime of forgery, but if he has obtained vouchers for money not due, and from persons, whose names they do not bear, it is a complication of fraud and forgery together.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, What Mr. Thomas's motive could have been for doing this, is beyond my reach, - an adequate motive for the commission of any crime can never exist; the motives which do influence persons to commit crimes, operate different ways-they may operate upon some minds, and not upon others; but I am afraid, it is too true, that whenever the fraud, intended to be practised, is to operate, either by taking money from the public, or with-holding money from the public, that there is a greater facility in the commission of it, than there is when the fraud is to operate against any of our neighbours. When Mr. Thomas was asked if he had any demand upon the estate, he said, he had none; whether any client of his had mortgages upon the estate which had been extented, I know not; whether from good-nature to the numerous creditors of Mr. Collinridge, he was so far blinded as to think it fit to execute such frauds as these, I am perfectly unable to say, but the fact is done; and if Mr. Thomas has wilfully and knowingly uttered these receipts, upon which there can be no question that they were forged, there can be no doubt that he is guilty of the charge laid in this indictment.</p>

            , of Potters-pury, deceased, for 11, 535l. 16s. 1d. being monies advanced by the Navy Board, on account of his employment in Whittlewood and Salcey Forests; and as his accounts are in a very unsettled state, his executors, Messrs. Yates's (who are gentlemen of character and fortune). have desired me to apply to you on the subject, to know what they had best do in the business, not wishing to bring themselves into any difficulties, but, at the same time, desirous of doing ample justice to his creditors, if any thing should be left after the Crown is satisfied. The books and papers of the late Mr. Collinridge are brought to my house, and, on looking over them, I find a rough account in his own hand-writing, made up to May 1797; but, as myself, or the executors, cannot possibly undertake to make out the accounts (not understanding the business), and as they wish to give up every thing they have found, for the information and satisfaction of the Honorable Commissioners of his Majesty's Navy, in order to make out the accounts in the best manner possible, I will either bring the whole up to town to lay them before the Honorable Board, unless they rather choose to send some person down to inspect and settle them. The sooner something is done in this business, the better, as expences will be continually incurring on the extent, and I am to request the favor of your early answer, which will very much oblige the executors, and,</p>

               <p>"SIR,</p>
               <p>"Some days since, I wrote a letter to you, and directed it for you at the Navy-office, but not having received any answer to it, induces me to write again to you, and direct this letter to Deptsord. The subject on which I address you, is respecting the late Mr. Collinridge, of Potters-pury, who, a little previous to his death, made his will, and appointed two gentlemen, for whom I am concerned, his executors in trust, for the purposes therein-mentioned. I am further to inform you, that immediately after the corpse was interred at Potterspury, an extent, at the suit of the Crown for 11, 500l. and upwards, was entered against all his property, being monies advanced by the Navy-office, on account of his employment in Whittlewood and Salcey Forests, since his last settlement with them in the year 1791. As it is impossible for the executors, or myself, to settle his accounts with the Board, they wish for the favor of your advice and assistance, how they had best act, in order to get the accounts settled, as they wish to shew forth every document in their possession, to enable the Board to make out the accounts in the best manner possible. Mr. Wife. of Potters-pury, advised me to write to you on this subject, as he supposed you must know more of the late Mr. Collinridge's accounts, than any other person. Requesting the favor of your early answer.</p>

               <p>I am, Sir, your most obedient servant, G. THOMAS.</p>
               <p>I find that an extent is gone into Oxfordshire, as well as this county, against Mr. Collinridge's property. The sooner some settlement with the Board could be effected, the better, as the expence must, of course, be very great."</p>

               <p>I am favored with your letter of the 4th instant, respecting  the late Mr. Collinridge's accounts, which I am endevaouring to make out in the best manner, I can, from his books and papers. The following appears in the hand-writing of the late Mr. C. in one of his books of account:</p>
               <p>Total amount in account to 31st Decr. 1789 Cr. - 13,811 18 11</p>

               <p>Balance 507 13 21/2</p>
               <p>I shall be much obliged to you, to inform me, whether the above balance corresponds with the accounts settled with the Commissioners in the year 1789 and 1791, by the late Mr. Collinridge, from which period I do not find any balance made; I will also thank you, to inform me whether I cannot procure from Mr. Slade, what quantites of timber have been delivered from the Forests to Deptford-yard, in order to enable me to make out an account of the carriage of the different years, since the settling, as only a part of appears to be put down in the books. I have found a great many vouchers for monies paid by the late Mr. Collinridge for various sorts of work for the navy business and as a great number more will be wanted to be signed by the several persons who give been employed and paid by the late Mr. Collinridge, who as kept an account thereof in his books, I presume (from your letter) such receipts must be obtained before the accounts can be passed I will endeavor to make out the accounts in the best manner  I can, and send them to the Commissioners as soon as posibile, and hope they will make allowance for any error</p>
               <p>I may make therein, being a stranger to the business, but by the executors to do the best I can, that some* may be obtained with the Board, in order to enable them to judge what will be coming to his creditors, which are very numerous.

               <p>I was favored with your letter of the 21st instant, and, in answer to it, can only say; I advanced young, the sheriff's officer, of Banbury, 51. on account of getting in the grass; the executors do not chuse to interfere in it, I was informed that this crop of grass did not sell for 20l. I hope to be able, in a short time, to bring the late Mr. Collinridge's accounts to London, for the purpose of settling the same with the Commissoners of the Navy-office. I have had an infinite deal of trouble to obtain the necessary vouchers of the many different persons employed by the deceased who were dispersed in various parts of the kingdom, which, Mr. Bicknell informed me. would be absolutely required, before any thing could be settled with the Commissioners. When I come to town, I will do myself the pleasure of waiting upon your for instructions how I am to proceed to get this business settled.</p>

            , of Potters-pury, deceased I have with much trouble, from the papers and documents found in his possession made out the account of that deceased, with your Honors, of memories received ai various times of your Honors, and disbursed by him on account of the navy timber converted and conveyed from thence to his Majesty's Dock-yard, at Deptford, and also for expences. &amp;c. at Whittlewood Forest. I have (through Mr. Bicknell, the Solicitor) delivered the accounts and vouchers to Mr. Hartwell, and I do, on behalf of the executors and creditors of the deceased, most humbly request the favour of your Honors to oder the accounts to be examined, as soon as possible, in order that the extent, issued at the instance of your Honors against the effects of the deceased, which are all in mortgage to different persons, may be taken off. The effects of the deceased sold under the extent, according to the accounts I have received from the auctioneers employed therein, were as follows:</p>
               <p>At Potters-pury, by the sheriff of North. l. s. d. amptonshire - - - - - - - 176 14 2</p>
               <p>At Hooknorton, by the sheriff of Ox. fordshire - - - - - - - - 141 1 0</p>
               <p>At Wigginston, by ditto - - - - 31 9 0</p>
               <p>And at Adderbury, by ditto - - - 182 4 3</p>
               <p>Total - 531 8 5</p>
               <p>This sum, your Honors will please to give credit for in the account, and I am sorry to say, the effects sold at a very great loss to the estate of the deceased. As the late Mr. Collinridge has died very much in debt to a great many poor carters, who he hired to carry the timber to Oxford, and they are now in the greatest distress and continuously pressing upon the executors for their monies, or a part thereof, but as the accounts are unsettled, and the extent still remains upon the deceased's estates, the executors cannot proceed to make any sale, a dividend among the creditors, until the accounts with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180009170118"></xptr>your Honors are first settled and adjusted. As the excent swept off all the personal property of the deceased, immediately after his funeral, the executors have not even the mean of repaying themselves the money they are obliged to pay to the undertaker on that account. I shall be very glad to receive your Honors instructions and directions what to do for the best for the general creditors of the deceased, for whom I act under the direction of the executors, who are gentlemen of property, and very little known to the deceased, and are very desirous of doing what is just and right.</p>

               <p>Q. You have, no doubt, had an opportunity of seeing the estimation in which he has been held by others? - A. He bears a universal good character; no man in the profession need with for a better.</p>
               <p>Q. From an acquaintance with his character, do you think a large pecuniary sum would induce him to commit a fraud? - A. I think not.</p>

               <p>Q. In the early part of 1799, did you see Mr. Thomas at your house in Norfolk-street? - A. I did. Q. Did he ever deliver to you any accounts, as vouchers? - A. He brought a book of accounts, and a parcel tied up, which parcel I did not open.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he deliver them to you as the vouchers for that account? - A. He delivered them to me as accounts to be delivered to the Commissioner of the Navy; the next day I carried them to the Navy-office, and delivered them to Mr. Hartwell.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mr. Hartwell the proper officer for their examination? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Thomas express to you the purpose for which he delivered them to you? - A. He expressed a desire that somebody else should be appointed by the board to settle them; I told him that could not be done, he must make out the accounts himself, and if he could, from the papers that he had found; I likewise told him he must produce vouchers for the payments, or else they would not be allowed; he called once or twice upon me afterwards, and I told him the accounts were in a course of investigation.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Garrow. Q. When you told him he must make out the accounts himself, had you seen those accounts? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It contains a great variety of items for small sums, digging a saw-pit here, greasing wheels there, and an infinity of articles, and not kept with any degree of accuracy? - A. The book was tendered to me after the prosecution commenced, but I never looked into it.</p>
               <p>Q. In those conversations which you had with Mr. Thomas, long before any prosecution was thought of, did he not represent that the account was almost an impracticable one? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That there were a great number of vouchers, some signed, and some not, some with marks, and some with names? - A. Yes, to that effect.</p>
               <p>Q.And wished the Navy-board would take it into their own hands? - A. Yes. Q.Among those vouchers there are several hundred receipts? - A. I cannot say, there were a great many.</p>
               <p>Q. What may be the amount in value of those, upon which this indictment is framed? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dampicr. About eighty or ninety pounds.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Q. Do you know that Mr. Thomas was neither an executor nor a creditor, under Mr. Collinridge's will? - A. No. Q. Have you any reason to know that he has no pecuniary interest up to the extent of one shilling, or one penny in making up the account of Mr. Collinridge against the Navy-board larger than the truth? - A. I do not know that he has.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he any more interest in the subject to your knowledge, than yourself, or any other respectable solicitor? - A. None.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know that the amount of the balance appears to be? - A. There was no balance struck when it was delivered to me; Mr. Collinridge in his life-time carried on his balances in a way that I could not understand, and I gave credit for vouchers accompanied by receipts.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Q. So you found upon the loose papers to be made out after his death, that there was no balance struck? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Dampier. I am a surveyor and converter of timber under the Navy Board, in Salsey and Whittlewood Forests.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been in that situation? - A.Three years last May.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 6th of June, 1799, did you receive from the Navy Board this account book? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you reside at that time? - A.At Potter's-pury; after I had received that book, I received the vouchers.</p>
               <p>Q.The vouchers that you received, you afterwards gave to Mr. Knight? - A. I sent them to the Board.</p>
               <p>Q. Are those the same vouchers? - A. They are.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner afterwards? - A. I did; he came to my house, and enquired whether I could give him any information when it would be settled, and I told him I could not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him afterwards again? - A. He came to my house several times; I shewed him a copy of the book, and the receipts, and I told him the consequences appeared to me alarming; says I, I have found a man that was not in the country during that time, and that he could write his name; that was 
               <persName id="t18000917-147-person1425">Wm. Onan</persName>
            ; I told him, I had shewn him the receipt; he seemed rather alarmed, put his hands together, and said, if I would write to the Board, he would do any thing that they wished; he said, there was twelve hundred and odd pounds, I think, due from the Board, and he would give that up; he sat down in my room, and wrote a copy for me to write to the Board.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that paper? - A. This is the copy that he wrote; I saw him write it; I took out what I thought necessary, and wrote to the Board.(The copy read)." Honorable Sirs,</p>
               <p>In consequence of your letters to me, desiring me to make enquiry into the state of the accounts of the late Mr. Collinridge, I have been with several of the persons stated in the accounts, and find many errors therein. Mr. Thomas, of Brackley, attorney for the executors, hearing of my being employed to look into the account, and on my apprising him of there being many errors and mistakes therein, and for the sake of settling the business, made a proposal to give up to your Honors the balance which, by account, appeared due from your Honors to the executors, and to request your Honors to give up to the executors the monies the goods sold for, and release the extent upon the several houses and estates of the deceased, which were mortgaged for very nearly their worth, and some for more than their worth; which proposal, if your Honors chuse to adopt, I think it will be bringing the business to a conclusion in the best way that I can think of, as it will be impossible for me to find out the true state of all the charges that ought to be made upon your Honors."</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him after that conversation again? - A. He came to my house some time after, and asked me whether I had had any letter from the Board, and I told him, I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him, or did he know, that you had sent a letter according to that copy? - A. I told him that I had; he then said, I am willing to give up to their Honors the estates and lands to do as they please with.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any further conversation pass between you? - A. Not that I recollect.</p>

               <p>Q. Can you recollect any thing at any other time? - A. Whenever Mr. Thomas has come to my house, the conversation has been in the same manner, when I thought it would be finished, and whether the Board would accept it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever tell him what the result of your enquiries were? - A. I saw that there were things and vouchers there that I thought Government ought not to be charged with.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever shew the prisoner your mode of keeping accounts? - A. I did; and he said, he thought it was exceedingly well; he said, there was none like unto that in Mr. Collinridge's accounts; he said, it was all in a confused state, as he had received it, to the best of my recollection; he said, he had got some rough accounts, that he had gathered what he could from, and that there was no book.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Garrow. Q. There was a box full of loose accounts, some importing to be vouchers, some bills, some receipts; in short, a confused mass? - A. Very much confused.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe, before Mr. Collinridge's death, you offered to assist him in his accounts? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Collinridge had been a shipwright in Deptford-yard? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before his death had you applied to him to offer your assistance to make up his accounts? - A. Five or six months.</p>
               <p>Q. From your knowledge of the business, do you not think that it was impossible for any man, but himself, to make out the accounts? - A. I never saw his accounts; he was requested by the Board to give me all the assistance he could, but he never would let me fee any of his writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon all these occasions he was very anxious to have the accounts settled? - A. Yes; after he had applied to me.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember a time that he came when your husband was not at home? - A. Yes; I said Mr. Thomas you must have had a great deal of trouble and patience in making out these accounts, and he signified to me that he and his young man had done it.</p>

             sworn. - Examined Mr. Percival. I am a painter and glazier, and I have been employed to write by Mr. Thomas.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you ever employed to write for Mr. Collinridge? - A. No; I was emloyed by Mr. Thomas to make out of the account between Mr.Collinridge's estate and the Navy Board.</p>
               <p>Q.Have the goodness to look at these vouchers, and tell me whose hand-writting the body of them are? - A.(Looks at one). The two top lines are in my hand-writting; the bottom line is not.</p>

               <p>Q. what is the bottom line? A."For the Honorable the Commissioners of his Majesty's Navy."</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Thomas's hand-writing? - A. Yes; but that is not Mr. Thomas's writing; I was employed to make out the accounts from loose memorandums; as soon as I found any charge against any body, I posted it in the book.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Q. You made the book from loose and rough papers, and when you did not find the corresponding vouchers, you made a voucher to correspond with the book? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Percival. Q. DO you the hand-writting of 
               <persName id="t18000917-147-person1428">Wm. Clarke</persName>
            ? - A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at the five next receipts; are those your hand-writting? - A. They appear to be my hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You must know whether they are or not? - A. Yes, I believe they all are, but the signatures and the attestations.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the word "witness" your hand-writing? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are the word, "The mark of 
               <persName id="t18000917-147-person1429">Wm. Onan</persName>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Garrow. Q. Mr. Thomas is an attorney of great respectability, and doing a great deal of business? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He had no time to do this himself, and he employed to make out these accounts as well as you could? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And for that purpose, he put into your possession, as far as you know, all the papers of Mr. Collinridge? - A. I believe, every one of them.</p>
               <p>Q. They consist of loose memorandums for work done, some receipts signed, some unsigned, and a variety of other matters? - A. Just so; there were some papers with dates, and some without.</p>
               <p>Q. Among the papers handed to you, were there some receipts which imported to be for payment made, which were figured? - A. There were.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there others which imported to be receipts for business done for the Navy Board, not yet signed, but ready to be signed? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And from those documents you made out vouchers; for instance, when you found 
               <persName id="t18000917-147-person1432">Wm. Hall</persName>
             for digging a saw-pit, though there was no voucher, you entered that in your book? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And then you looked for corresponding receipts? - A. Yes; there was a great number of receipts that I found signed.</p>
               <p>Q. In many other instance, did you find receipts made out, corresponding with your charge, but not yet signed? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the solemn oath that you have taken, did not Mr. Thomas desire you to make out the account as accurately as you could, but, above all, to make it justify, and to charge nothing that you did not see a voucher for? - A. Mr. Thomas always desired me to make out a just account, to the best of my abilities, between both parties.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give you the smallest intimation to charge a single farthing against Government, for which you did not find charges? - A. He did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, making out that account, charge a single farthing against Government, that you did not think conscientiously you had a right to do from the papers of Mr. Collinridge? - A. No, I never did.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you, as far as you could collect from the papers of Mr. Colinridge, make just allowances to Government? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Mr. Thomas, upon all occasions, when he talked to you about the account, tell you to charge fairly and justify? - A. He always desired me to do that that was right.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe it happens to you to know, that it was Mr. Collinridge's course, instead of taking every Saturday a receipt for eighteen shillings, seven shillings, three shillings, and so on, from the different people, to get them together at different<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180009170123"></xptr>periods, and take vouchers in the lump? - A. I have understood so from his workmen.</p>
               <p>Q. But in point of fact you found many papers that appeared to be prepared for that object? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you make one single voucher ready for signature, for which you did not find a charge in Mr. Collinridge's papers? - A. No, I never did.</p>
               <p>Court Q. Do you mean to say, that every receipt you made, you found a charge for? - A. Every one.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know, of your own knowledge, that a great number of those memorandums from which you made your vouchers, are actually destroyed? - A. They are, a great of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not make out your account in a room appropriated for that purpose, and in which the children of that unfortunate gentleman, and the children of a Mr. Jones were frequently playing? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose there was a charge of

                  </persName>
             for filling up saw-pits, when you had taken that from a loose paper, did you store it up? - A. No, I frequently laid it a side, thinking it was done with.</p>
               <p>Q.Don't you know that those children played with them, and made thread papers of them? - A. Yes; I have seen them playing with papers, and have taken them away, and given them other slips that I thought were of no use, they had access to the room as much when I was not there, as when I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, have you any doubt that a great number of Mr. Collinridge's papers were destroyed in the manner in which you have described? - A. I have not the smallest doubt.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know, that after you had made out your book account, and had got together such unsigned prepared receipts as were found in the papers of Mr. Collinridge, and had made out other to correspond with the demands, that public notice was given to a persons who had done work for Mr. Collinridge to assemble at a public-house to sign voucher? - A. I know there was an appontment made for them to meet there.</p>
               <p>Q. And made publickly known to the whole country? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When was that? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Soon after you had compleated your work? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Percival. Q. Did Mr. Thomas know that these papers wre upon to the access of these children to destroy? - A. Yes, he knew they were there, he was in the next room, in his own office.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he aware of the careless way in which you kept those papers, which were the only documents for the books that you were making out? - A. He knew that they were in the room, certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, that he knew they were lying about in that careless way? - A. He must have known it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever take occasion to tell Mr. Thomas of the children taking these papers? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know, Of your own knowledge, that there was a great many destroyed? - A. I knew that there were a great many gone somewhere.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see them destroy a single one? - A. I do not know that I ever did.</p>
               <p>Q. Then all you know is, that some of these papers are destroyed and missing? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were those papers destroyed immidiately after the account was delivered in, or lately? - A. None lately, none since Mr. Thomas has been prosecuted.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether Mr.Thomas has looked for those papers? - A. I do not know.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know of Mr. Thomas's bringing those papers to London? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell Mr. Thomas that there were some of them lost? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it that you found out that some of them had been destroyed? - A. Since I have been in London.</p>
               <p>Q. Since you have been in London upon this trial? - A. No, I had been in London before.</p>
               <p>Q. When was is that you looked over the accounts in London? - A. It was the first time that I came to London.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it? - A. At Mr. Thomas's agent's.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it after Mr. Thomas had been before the Magistrate? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the time when Mr. Thomas presented his memorial to the Lords of the Admiralty? - A. I do not.</p>

               <p>Q. The first discovery you made of these papers being absolutely missing, was, when you searched for them in London? - A. I can only say, that there are a great many of them lost, and I dare say, a great many destroyed.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there many memoranda still existing? - A.There are a great many papers.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you do not know but they may be still existing all the originals from which these vouchers were made? - A. I do not know.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Dampier. I am in partnership with the last witness, at Oxford.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever had any dealings with Mr. Collinridge? - A. Yes, twice, about five pounds all together; it was paid me by Mr. Collinridge himself; I cannot say whether he had a receipt for it, or not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Garrow. Q. I believe you have been acquainted with Mr. Thomas many years? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, if it should appear to the Court and Jury that I have done any thing wrong in this matter, I am the most unfortunate of human beings. I was called upon, by Mr. Collinridge, to make his will: after his death, it was necessary that his account with the Navy-board should be adjusted; it appeared to me next to impossible that it could be done; I was desired to do it as well as I was able; I had neither leisure nor ability to do it; I employed an accomptant, and the papers and vouchers were made out by him in the best manner he could; I had no suspicion there was any thing wrong; I had no interest in the subject, I had no indictment to do any things amiss; I have transmitted business to a large amount, for persons of the highest respectability, to whose voluntary and kind testimony to my intregity, I have the satisfaction to appeal with confidence; in October last, I had the first intimation, that a charge of a serious nature was made against me; I have, since that, been many months at large upon bail, always ready to meet any charge that might be brought forward; I have now submitted myself to the justice of my country, in the humble confidence that they will not take away a life valueable to myself, more valuable to my family, for an offence from which, if I had committed it, I could not have benefited one shilling, and for which I hope the whole tenor of my life proves I could have no inducement.</p>

There were five men on my left side, they rushed against me - I felt a hand in my pocket, and laid hold of it as it came out. The prisoner jumped forward, and tried to rescue the man; the others endeavoured to get me out of the door. I held the man as long as I could-no person would assist me. I knocked the man down-the prisoner came forward, and struck me several times - I was obliged to let go. They ran out, my wife followed them; the prisoner was secured immediately. He said, he was not the man who took the money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Your pocket was picked by one of the men - A. Yes, and the prisoner rescued him. The prisoner called out Stop thief! to get away himself. I have never seen the pocket-book since the robbery.</p>

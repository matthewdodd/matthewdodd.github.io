On the 23d of August, I went out at twenty-minutes after six o'clock in the morning for some potatoes - I locked my door, and shut my shutters; I left my key inside my door, which goes with a spring lock; when I came home, in three quarters of an hour, I found the door and shutters as I left them; I found my box broken open, and this property gone; I had seen all safe that morning in my box; the prisoner is a lodger of mine - I have never seen my property since, my wife was out of town.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. It was a spring lock, and you left the key inside; how did you expect to get in? A. I had one key in my pocket; I cannot tell why I left the other key in the door - there was a pane of glass broken; I had no other lodger - I did not leave the key near the broken pane, for him to put his hand in and take it; I met him in the street about half an hour afterwards, and gave charge of him.</p>
               <p>STOTHARD. I am an officer. I took up the prisoner, but found nothing on him.</p>

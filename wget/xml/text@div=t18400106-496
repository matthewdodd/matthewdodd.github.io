                  </hi>I am a grocer, and live in Tottenham Court-road. The prisoner was in my service—in consequence of some circumstances I marked several penny-pieces, and some farthings which were in packets, and placed the packets where they were before, on a shelf behind the counter—on the 23rd of December I missed some of them, as I had done before, but I let things remain as they were till the 28th of December, when I called the prisoner up stairs and told him I had an unpleasant business to per<lb></lb>form, that I had been missing some coppers from the shop, and if he was an honest man he would have no objection to let me see what was in his box—he said, "Certainly not"—I said, "Open the box"—I believe it</p>

               <p>was not locked—he did so, and pulled out several articles of wearing appa<lb></lb>rel—at last, as he took out one waistcoat, it knocked heavy against the side of the box—I took hold of it, and took out of the pocket of it 48 farthings, wrapped in this blue paper, which has my private mark on it—I had lost a great many such blue packets, containing 48 farthings, and two of the farthings in it have the private mark which I put on them—I can swear these two are part of mine—I asked the prisoner how they came there—he said he knew not—he knew nothing about them—I said, "I can swear to the paper and to two of the farthings inside"—he said he took the waistcoat down stairs a day or two before Christmas-day to ask the servant to mend it for him, and he supposed some one had put the farthings into his pocket—I said he knew the servant had no access to the coppers, and I did not see how she could do it—I then told him I missed some 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. papers of cop<lb></lb>pers—he said he knew nothing about them—I said, "Be cautious what you say, I know more than you are are aware of—where are my half<lb></lb>pence? "—he said he knew nothing about them—I said, "I don't believe that, because several packets are gone"—he said, "There is only one gone"—I said, "Yes, I know more are gone"—he then said, "There were but two"—I said again, "Where are my halfpence? "—he said, "There were not three, for one was not full"—I said, "Where are they? "—he said, "I spent them on Christmas-day to buy things for use"—(I had before that spoken to a policeman, who was opposite in the road)—I said it was my duty to put him in charge—he said he would forfeit his wages if I would not put him in charge—I said I considered it my duty so to do, and by a signal the officer came in and took him.</p>

Yes, a shopman, a porter, and a boy—they all had access to my counter—the room I took the prisoner to was his sleeping-room, at the top of the house—they all slept in that room—I called him up from behind the counter, and walked up stairs with him—there is no lock on the bed-room door—he came into my employ on the 6th of December—he pulled out several things before he pulled out this velvet waistcoat—the box was nearly full—I do not believe he asked me to open the box—I will not swear that he did not—I do not believe there was a lock on it—there was no lock on it when the policeman came up—I found nothing else belonging to me—there was a pair of stockings and a collar belonging to the shop<lb></lb>man, they were on the top of this small box, which was at the bottom of his box, and in this small box was a quantity of stationary—I had not been in that bed-room previously that day—I had before said to my shop<lb></lb>men that I thought all was not right, but they knew nothing of the parti<lb></lb>culars—I did not tell them that I had lost some farthings, or that I had lost any money—I did not allude to the halfpence at all—I did not tell him not to tell me a story about the half-pence—I told him to be cautious—I wanted to know the truth—I did not tell him it would be better to tell the truth—I told him to be cautious how he answered—I attend a place of worship, but I do not accustom my servants to go with me to church—they are at liberty to go where they please—I did not at first tell the pri<lb></lb>soner that I had marked these farthings—I did not mark both these far<lb></lb>things alike—they were marked on the Friday or Saturday before Christ<lb></lb>mas day—the mark I put on the paper is a letter which I use as a private mark for one shilling, and the word farthing in short-hand under it—when I marked the farthings there were three or four packets of them—I called</p>

                  </hi>. I am a licensed victualler, living in Brewer-street Somer's-town—Goodwin gave me information, in consequence of which I marked one shilling on the 27th of March—the prisoner was in my em<lb></lb>ploy as barman—when he had finished his pots he came into the bar—I desired him on that night to count out the copper in the till—(I had put the marked shilling in the till which contains the copper, but no silver what<lb></lb>ever)—when he had counted the copper, I asked him if he had found one</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184104050129"></xptr>
               <p>willing there—he said he did not—I said, "Are you sere?"—he said "Yes"—I said there was a shilling put in, and he must hare found it—I tent for a young man to look at the coppers, and he did not find it—I then asked the prisoner what he had got in his pocket—he said 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I asked him to poll them out—he pulled out 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and the shilling was the marked one—I sent for the policeman, who asked the prisoner what money he had got of his own—he pulled out one shilling, but he did not say how he had got the other.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is it not the custom of small shoemakers, when in distress, to sell shoes on Saturday nights to shops? A. It may be - Smith asked the prisoner if he had any shoes to sell - he did not offer to sell these - he said he had kept these for his own use, and he had worn one pair - he was liberated on bail, and has surrendered here - he made search for the person he bought them of, and had one person taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not that person's name Smith, and was he not a cousin of this very Smith the officer? A. No, he was not - the magistrate asked him that - he said he was not, but that he always called the policemen cousins and uncles - I do not know what his name was - these shoes hung on our door-post - a person might stand at the door and take them.</p>

             (police-constable H 80). I produce the first pair of shoes that was found at the prisoner's - the other officer afterwards found the other two pair - when I got up to the door, Smith and the prosecutor were talking to the prisoner - Smith said, "Were any shoes sold here on Saturday night?" - the prisoner said, "No" - Smith then asked if any were offered him; he said, "No, not to me, but I will ask my old woman" - he turned to his wife, and said, "Were any shoes offered?" she said, "No" - I said,"I have information that some are here which are stolen" - he said, "I have no objection at all to your searching;" and under the bed I found this pair.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was this the first thing that happened? A. When I went up, the prisoner and Smith and the prosecutor were in conversation - we had been waiting at a distance - we thought if we had gone in at first, he would have made away with them, most likely - there were three men in the house, and the prisoner's wife, who would very likely have assisted her husband to get out of trouble.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the boy who was taken up by the prisoner after he was bailed? A. I had seen him about four months ago - I had spoken to him - he gave his name as Peacock - I do not know how long Peacock had known Smith - he said he was related to one of the officers - I should not like to state who gave me the information - I did not receive it from the prosecutor - I received it from a person who was afterwards charged.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, from the same source that you derived intelligence that the shoes were in the prisoner's house, did you not know who the thief was? A. No; he did not tell me who stole them - he said they were sold at that house, and he was along with the party who sold them- it was Peacock told me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not Peacock charged before the magistrate with stealing them? A. No; he was taken up for being in company with the person who sold them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you say he was charged in the presence of the magistrate with being the person who sold the shoes? A. Peacock said, in the presence of the magistrate, that he in company with the person who sold them.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. And the magistrate discharged him? A. Yes - Mr. Broughton was the magistrate - Peacock said<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183409040125"></xptr>he was with the person that sold them, but he did not sell them, and the prisoner said the same.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. I want to know how it was that Peacock was discharged? A. The magistrate said he did not blame the solicitor to want to get out of a bad case.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How long had you known this Mr. Peacock, who admits being with the person who sold them? A. Four months - I have seen him, and spoken to him, perhaps a dozen times - he never gave me information before, I knew he lived in Wentworth-street - I do not know the number - he came to me voluntarily on my beat and told me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What is Peacock? A. In my opinion, he is a thief - I told the magistrate I had seen him in company with thieves - I said that before Mr. Wooller put the question to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean on your oath to say that Peacock was charged with stealing these shoes, admitted he was with the man who sold them on the very night they were stolen, and you told Mr. Broughton you had seen him in company with thieves, and he discharged him? A. Yes - the magistrate said it was very unusual for the thief to tell of himself- it was during the last month that I was on duty in Wentworth-street, that I had a thorough knowledge of Peacock.</p>

             (police-constable H 122). On the 28th of July, I went to the prisoner - I saw him at his door - I asked if he had a pair of shoes to fit me - he handed me down some second-hand shoes - I said they were not good enough, and if he had any better I would thank him to show me them - he said he had none - I said, "Have you no new ones?" - he said, "No" - I said, "Did you get no new ones on Saturday night?" - he said, "No" - I said,"I have been informed you bought some stolen ones on Saturday night?" - he said, "No; we do not do business in that way - we know who we buy of" - my brother officer then came up, and went into the back room - he found one pair of shoes under the bed - nothing more transpired for a good while, till I found these two pair of shoes under the table in the front room - they were concealed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How do you mean? A. There was a dish cover between the sight of persons and them, and there was a green baize over the table - I asked him if he had any shoes to sell - Webb gave me information of this- I believe I know the person who informed Webb - I have no doubt I do - I do not know that any one was taken up for stealing these shoes - I have not heard it - there was a person taken up for being with the person who sold them.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the person taken up was not charged with being the thief? A. I believe that was the charged he was brought on - I believe his name is Peacock - I never saw him till the evening we got information - I believe he has claimed to be my cousin, but not in my presence - I heard he had not been a very good character, but had not been in prison.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he not been a reputed thief, and as such suffered to go at large by the police? A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the Saturday night, about half-past ten o'clock, two persons brought these shoes to my house, and asked 15s. for them - I said it was too much, and they agreed to take 12s. - on Monday morning, Smith asked if I had any shoes to sell - I said, "No," as I meant to keep them for myself - when the officers came, I said they were welcome to search, as I had done nothing I was afraid of - they found these shoes, but they were not at all concealed.</p>

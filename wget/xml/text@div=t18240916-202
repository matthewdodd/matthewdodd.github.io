            . I am a hatter, and live in Field-lane. On the 17th of September, about six o'clock in the evening, the prisoners Fenn and Masters, came to my shop with two hats, one was finished, and the other only wanted ironing; they are both called hats. Fenn asked me to buy them. They produced them, and asked 30 s. for them, which is the trade price; but not knowing the boys, I said</p>
               <p>"I will give you 16 s. for them," they went out; Masters then brought them in, and said</p>
               <p>"Will you give 18 s.?" I said,</p>
               <p>"No." He said,</p>
               <p>"then give me 16 s." I then asked how they came by them: he said, they belonged to a boy. I went over for Marchant, who lives opposite. Fenn directly went away. Marchant came over and questioned Masters about them. He said, they belonged to the other boy. I said no doubt they were stolen, for the materials would cost more than what they offered them at. Marchant fetched Whitehead the officer, but just before he came, Higgins came in, and said,</p>
               <p>"Will they do?" I said</p>
               <p>"The hats?" I asked if they belonged to him. He said,</p>
               <p>"Yes." I asked how he came by them. He said</p>
               <p>"Very well." I thought that a strange answer, and said,</p>
               <p>"Very well." He then turned his conversation, as if he had come to buy a hat. Whitehead came in and took them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Higgins was not in the shop with the other boys - A. While Masters was there he was. I had one of the hats in my hand when he came in, and said,</p>
               <p>"Do these belong to you?" pointing to the other on the counter. I did not intend to buy them, and offered a low price; and thinking them not honestly come by, I sent for an officer. One of them only wanted ironing, the other is not finished, having no lining or binding.</p>

            . I am a beadle. Marchant fetched me to Biddell's shop. I found Masters and Higgins there. Biddell said they had come with another boy to sell the hats. I took them into custody. I received information, and found Fenn at the Cooper's-arms public-house, and said,</p>
               <p>"How came you to have any thing to do with those hats?" He said,</p>

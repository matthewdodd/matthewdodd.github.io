                  </hi>. I live at 126, Crisp Street, Poplar, and am a cook on board ship—on Whit-Monday, 17th May, about 7.30, I was in the Broad<lb></lb>way, Stratford, trying to get my wife and child into a tram-car—there was a great crush—I saw Mullins near me—I could not get into the tram, and when I got off the platform I missed my watch—I can't say that Mulins took it, but from something that was told me I followed him—I was attempting to take him when some one knocked me down—Mulins was taken by a constable, and I went to the station and charged him—the watch was not found.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a varnish maker at Stratford—on Whit-Monday I was seeing a friend off by the tramway at the Broadway—I saw Mulins on the footboard of the tram pressing against Mr. Wilder—I saw him take Mr. Wilder's watch out of the pocket and give it a twist—I saw no more of it—he got off the car, walked across the road, and joined Silver—they talked together—I am quite certain of that because I followed them until I met a policeman—Mr. Wilder was going to lay hold of Mullins and Silver knocked him down and escaped—Mullins was captured in the Broadway and taken to the station—they were placed in a room with a number of others and I picked them both out—Mr. Wilder was a stranger to me—I had been there about half an hour and had been watching Mullins.</p>

Monsieur Van Schendel—I am in possession of your favours of the 4th and 8th instant, and am charmed with the honour you do me in consenting to honour me with your confidence; believe also, Sir, that I will endeavour unceasingly to deserve your esteem. We have seen this work at the Crystal Palace, but we had some days previously purchased a picture representing a brigade taken in ambush, which is almost the same design, and it is from that that we obtained your address, and which caused us to estimate your talent. As soon then as I received your photographs, I hastened to place them in the hands of the gentleman in question, who is Monsieur de Hatford, younger son of Lord Hatford, who has communicated them to several connoisseurs of his acquaintance, and has made choice of <hi rend="italic">" Le General en Retraite et ses enfants;"</hi> of the size of 3ft. 3in., by 2ft. 5 1/2 in.; and of "The Market Piece" of which you make mention, 65 by 51 centimetres; as well as the sketch of "The Visit to the Infant Saviour." He offers you for these three pictures the sum of 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 10,000 francs, payable at two days sight, or by a cheque which he will remit you on the bank, the Western Branch of this town, after advice received of the pictures having been sent off. The price which he offers you is not exactly that which you ask, but as the difference is but trifling and the sum in round figures, I believe you will accept. If your picture "The Visit to the Infant Saviour" is not entirely finished, you can send me the others, disposing of 2,500 francs, and engaging to furnish the other picture. As to my commission, be good enough to tell me in what way I am to be paid, for I should not like this gentleman to know that I am in communication with you. We can probably do busiuess as to the 9,000 franc picture; we must go one of these days to Liverpool, where we shall see of report of the inquiry respecting it; should that prove favourable I think he will like to have it. I beg you to hasten as much as possible the sending off of the pic<lb></lb>tures as soon as may be after the choice is confirmed, for he desires to possess them for Christmas time, the 25th instant, a day on which all families here meet.

Monsieur Van Schendel,—Having received your esteemed favour yesterday I hastened to the gentleman, whom I was able to see this morning only; I read to him such portions of your letter as concerned him, when he said it was all right, and he was going to write to you on the subject by his secretary; that he kept to his determination respecting the two days' sight, lest the pictures should have been in any way injured by scratches, &amp;c.; that he would not be at this risk himself, and that conseqnently these two days were indis<lb></lb>pensable as, in fact, I mentioned to you in my last letter of the 15th; as to</p>

               <p>the rest he agrees, but you must draw at two days' sight through Mr. Pid<lb></lb>dington. If you could send him these pictures by Christmas, it would be so much the better for you. I would counsel you, Sir, to accept these terms, for you know that these gentlemen are tenacious of their word and dis<lb></lb>trustful, more especially when they have travelled on the Continent; and I should say that the affair, if delayed, will come to nothing. As to the historical painting, he is waiting to see one of his Liverpool friends; I have every hope of success. With respect to my commission, I think, Sir, that as I have no banker, the most easy way would be for you to obtain a letter of credit from your banker, Monsieur De Parre, so that I can obtain the same from his London correspondent; you would do me a great kindness by sending me, as soon as possible after the shipment of the picture, say a sum of 600 francs (24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.), for here the living is very expensive, and one has frequently not too much money, especially at Christmas. In the hope then, Sir, that we shall be successful—you aiding me as well on your part, for these people are very tenacious—I have the honour to be: Wastone")—there is no draft of any part of that—(<hi rend="italic">The following letters were here read</hi>: "Mons. Van Schendel,—I yesterday received your favour of the 24th current, to which I hasten to reply. I have been to Monsieur de Hatford, but was only able to see him at midday to-day. On Saturday he received notice of the shipment oi your picture by an agent at Ostend; up to the present time, however, nothing has been received. I attribute this delay to the Christmas fetes, for no one then does any work. It is the only holiday in the year in England, and all offices are closed, as is likewise the Custom-house. As soon as Mr. de Hatford receives it, he will acknowledge the receipt of it, and there is no doubt but that it will safely arrive, and will give satisfaction, since, from what his secretary has told me, he has spoken of it to some of his friends who have seen your works at the Crystal Palace, and who have spoken highly of your talent. He is, therefore, impatiently awaiting its arrival, as also that of the two other pictures which you promised on Saturday next. I should feel much obliged to you, Sir, if in your next letter you would send me about 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account, for I have already incurred some, and shall incur still further expenses in going to Liverpool with this gentleman. In the anticipation of a speedy reply, and hoping you will do me this small favour, I am, &amp;c. Wastone."—"London, 1 Dec 1859. Monsieur Schendel,—As I am doing busines here as a commission agent for the sale of pictures, I beg to ask you if you would be disposed to honour me with your confidence in finding customers for your works, having already had opportunities of appreciating them. At this very time a gentleman, who is furnishing his gallery, and who will only be satisfied with such works as are thoroughly authentic, and proved to be really the production of those whose names they may bear, has instructed me to write to many of your brother artists, in order that if we can come to terms, I may put them in communication with him. Be good enough, Sir, then, if you have any finished pictures, to let me know the price of them with frame complete, the dimensions, &amp;c: as well as a sketch of the design on paper, which you can enclose me in your letter, and the commission which you will allow me in case of effecting a sale. This gentleman is a great amateur of good pictures, and has already heard your talent spoken of. In the hope then, Sir, of a speedy reply, accept my respectful salutation,—Wastone. My address, 34, Brewer-street, West-end-house, Golden-square, London. P.S. Send your conditions as to payment."—"London, 21 Dec. 1859.

I reserve to myself this mode of payment in order to be able, should the pictures be in any way injured, to return them to you; and in such case I bind myself to pay the half of the expense of carriage. I recommend you therefore to use every care in packing them, and to send off to me, as soon as you receive this letter, if not all the three pictures, at least that representing a General in Retreat. I have received the notice in the "Liverpool Journal" sent me by Mr. Wastone, and having shortly after Christmas to go and see one of my acquaintances, a great picture fancier who saw your picture at the Exhibition; I will confer with him, and let you know the result. At the same time I may observe that I find your price somewhat high, &amp;c. (Signed) De Hatford, 29, St. Mary-at-hill." "London, Dec. 28, 1859. Monsieur P. Van Schendel,—I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of 22d December, as well as of the painting, the General in Retreat, which has reached me in very good condition, and with which I am much pleased. The Christmas fetes have until to-day prevented my obtaining possession of your work. I do not the less thank you for the promptitude you have used in sending it off so as to enable me to get it before Christmas. I expect every day the two other pictures, which will perhaps have been sent off by the time this reaches you. In your next please let me know what day you have drawn on me, and whether it be for the 240<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the first picture, or for 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the price of the whole three together. I shall put off for a time giving my decided answer as to the historical painting. Awaiting some intelligence from you, I am, &amp;c. De Hatford."</p>

I had hardly made acquaintance with Edouard then; he had told me that he represented an artist at Brussels; after that I demanded that I might represent Mr. Van Scheudel, and he allowed me to act as his agent. I never saw the picture in my life; the husband of that lady was ex<lb></lb>amined at the Thames police-court, and admitted that he never saw me.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Edouard's Defence.</hi> It never was my intention to defraud Monsieur Van Schendel of the picture; I had a party to whom I could have sold it, and I only wanted to realize a benefit by selling it. I am noble, and my name is D'Hatford; but I don't know how they put on the letters, Lord D'Hatford. I took the picture to my lodging, and it remained there till the person was to come to see it. I never would have disposed of the picture before that. I offered myself to Mr. Van Schendel the very same day to give the picturo back; I thought perhaps the prisoner would not call, and I did not want to be in a difficult position.</p>

               <p>a little property in the country that I wished to dispose of, and I placed that conditionally in your hand, that if there was any discrepancy in the account it might be made straight? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, you did not say that; you said you had at Leeds left in charge with a gentleman, who advanced you 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., a diamond ring, two mourning rings, and dessert knives and forks, which this gentleman advanced 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on, and you wished me to send down a check to that gentleman and get the property, and sell it to pay myself 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that I advanced you.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I acknowledge having received the check from Mr. Woolf; I put it in this book, with a great many more papers; I went round to six or eight houses with my samples, and having lists of different goods to show them the prices, and by so doing I imagine I lost the check in one of those places; for on the following morning, when arranging my papers, and preparing to pay the check over to Mr. Bate, I found it was not there; I immediately went round to every place where I had been, and made inquiries, and I went to the Bank of England to see if it had been paid; I found it had been paid the afternoon previous; of course I was in a very awkward predicament; I did not mention it to Mr. Bate, because I knew that he is of such a very irritable temper, therefore I tried to get the money from a friend to replace the value of the check, and not to mention the circumstance to him, and if I had got the money I should have mentioned it to Mr. Bate; I used every exertion to pay it; he never mentioned it to me; I never heard a word of it till I was taken into custody; the Lord Mayor remanded me on my own recognizance of 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I was taken again, and committed by Mr. Alderman Moon; I never appropriated one penny to myself; I never knew the check was crossed; I think you cannot look at this in any other light than as a trivial, frivolous prosecution; there is not a particle of proof that Mr. Bate ever told me not to receive money, and I solemnly declare, before Almighty God, he never did; there was one small account I handed to him after his return, and he never found fault with me—on the contrary, he thanked me; I had one class of customers, and he another; mine were confined to the East end, and amongst the Jews; and the parties with whom I did business all looked to me to receive the accounts, and he never told me not to receive them; the whole proceeding hinges on this simple feet, whether in this individual case I have lost this check, and not repaid it.</p>

               <p>Are you quite sure this is the man that snatched the chain and seals from you? - Yes, he never was out of my sight.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, coming up to him with that violence, and seizing his watch chain, and he resisting, constitutes a violent taking from the person, if done with a design to steal.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The prosecutor said that he tore off three inches of the coat of the man that had robbed him, and I produced my coat to see whether there was any piece of my coat tore off, and there was none.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I caught hold of his coat on the inside, and when he wreached it away, a bit of something came off in my hand, which I took to be shalloon, and I threw it away.</p>
               <p>Court. Was his coat searched at the Justice's? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Does that leave you any reason to doubt of his being the man? - Not in the least, he positively was the man.</p>

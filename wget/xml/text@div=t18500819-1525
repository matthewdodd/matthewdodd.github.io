                  </hi>. I am in the service of Thomas Webb, of West Ham. On 6th July, between twelve and one o'clock in the day, I was com<lb></lb>ing out of his yard—I saw Thompson open Mr. Stevens's gate, which is opposite Mr. Webb's, and the prisoner came out with a truss of hay on his back—I noticed the hay and followed him, and saw him take it to his father's—I went to his father's yard with a constable about an hour after, and found two trasses of hay—I believe the top truss of the two was the one the pri<lb></lb>soner was carrying; I believe it to be Mr. Thomas Webb's—the way it came to be in Mr. Stevens's yard was, because Mr. Stevens lent Mr. Webb his chaff-cutting machine, ours being broken—the hay went to Mr. Stevens's yard to be cut: I saw some there.</p>

In consequence of what Billings said to me, I went to the house of Robert Utton, the prisoner's father—I went to a shed and found two trusses of clover hay, covered over with some loose mea<lb></lb>dow hay—I took the prisoner—I told him it was on suspicion of stealing two trusses of clover hay belonging to Mr. Webb—he said he bought it at Stratford for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I asked him whereabouts—he then said in London—I asked if he could tell me where the shop was—he said he could not—he begged me not to take him in charge, and to say what I could for him, and he would give me anything</p>

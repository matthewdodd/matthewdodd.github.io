I got up on the Sunday morning, about eight o'clock, and found the window in the servant's-hall, backwards, was broke open; the hinges were wrenched from the shutter, and the sash flung up: I am certain that window was fastened, when I went to bed: I observed a snuff of a candle thrown against the kitchen door: I miss'd the plate out of the plate-cupboard, that is in a room on the same floor, that I saw the night before I went to bed: the door had been undone, but the lock was not so much damaged, but that I could lock and unlock it: that I left locked when I went to bed.</p>

            . (He takes the cup in his hand.) I bought this cup of the prisoner at the bar, on Tuesday, the 18th of December: he came in the morning, about six or seven o'clock, and brought a silver tumbler, this silver cup, six chocolate plates, three table spoons, six tea spoons, three rings to put upon chocolate plates, three saucepans, a large one, a middling one, and a little one, all silver. I gave him 4 s. an ounce for them. I gave him 8 l. directly, and sent the other by my little boy, in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the other money?</p>
               <p>Levi. That was eight guineas.</p>

               <p>Abraham. There was a 27 s. piece, 4 s. 6 d. in silver, and the rest in guineas and half guineas, and the prisoner gave me a shilling. When he used to come to our house, my father sent me away.</p>

               <p>This boy was brought by thief-catchers, that came after me; he learns of his father: as his father swears, he swears; the thief-catchers all hang together, and when a man has been once under a cloud, they fix a thing upon him, and so swear his life away. They get their bread by helping people to stolen goods: I have been taken up three or four times, and they have brought people to look at my face, yet nothing was found upon me, to the value of a pin's point. The Jews will swear to clear a man, or cast him, for a trifle: the thief-takers might put the dark lanthorn there; it did not belong to me.</p>

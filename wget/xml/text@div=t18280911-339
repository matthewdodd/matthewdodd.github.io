On the 18th of July, I let a truck to the prisoner, about half-past two o'clock - I heard no more of it till the next day; he said I had seen him before, but I could not recollect him; the next day I heard there was a truck stopped; I went and found it was mine - part of it was gone then.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I borrow it of you or steal it? A. You borrowed it, and said you lived in Bunhill-row; he left 1s., and was to pay 3d. an hour for it - it was worth about 50s.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I borrowed the truck for my own use, as I am in the habit of doing work for myself; I sent it home by my labourer, and till the next morning I did not know whether it was gone home safe - I came home from my work; he had sent word that he had given a boy 2d., and he had left the truck at such a place - I went and took it to Smith's to ask what it would cost to make it good, as I was in a very awkward predicament; I was going back and was taken.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM SMITH re-examined. Q. Did he bring it to sell or to mend? A. To sell.</p>

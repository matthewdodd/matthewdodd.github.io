                  </hi>. I am the widow of Charles Ratherbee—he died on the 30th of July—he was a trumpeter, and lived in Lorinier-lane, Wal-worth—he rented a piece of ground of Mr. Westbrook, and let a piece of it to the prisoner. On the 8th of April I went out at the back door, and saw the prisoner sowing seeds in that ground—I told my husband—I then went and said to the prisoner, "My husband says it is useless for you to sow soed in that ground, for we want it to plant potatoes"—he said, "I will see him d—d first before I will give it up"—I returned to the cottage—my husband went out and told him it was no use for him to sow his seed, as he wanted it himself to plant potatoes; and how foolish it was of him to be so obstinate—the prisoner said, "You do, do you; I will tee you d—d before I will give it up"—my husband said, "The ground I want, and the ground I will have"—the prisoner said, "I will not give it up without it is by law"—he had bad a notice to quit the ground, and told my husband that be ought to have a twelvemonths' notice, not six—my husband said he never knew a twelvemonths' notice, six months' notice was always good in law—the prisoner said he would not give it up, and my husband said he should—the prisoner then said he would have a fair up and down for it—I suppose he meant a fight—he said, "You ought to have taken possession of the ground"—my husband said, "I am always in possession of my own ground while my cottage stands on it"—when my husband first went on the ground and spoke to the prisoner, he went a little distance, raised his arm, and drove his left elbow into my husband's chest, and threw him flat on his back—my husband had not done anything to him before he did that—I cried out, and said, "Oh, Mr. Hurvey, you will kill my husband!"—my husband got up, and said, "What did you do that for?"—the prisoner said, "If you don't stand out of my way I will knock your b—y life out!" and the prisoner's niece said "He did not knock your husband down, he only pushed him down"—when my husband said he was always in possession while bis cottage stood on it, the prisoner said that was not possession, my husband ought to have</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Hen and Chicken<lb></lb>Jane, Walworth. This matter happened on a Tuesday morning—I lived next door to Mr. Ratherbee's cottage, on the right hand—I saw Harvey sowing seed—I saw Mrs. Ratherbee go up to him, and I heard her say, "Mr. Harvey, my husband has sent me to tell you it is not any use your sowing seeds in the ground, for we want it to plant potatoes in"—the prisoner said, "I will see him d—d first"—she went into the cottage—Mr. Ratherbee and she came out—they went straight to the prisoner, and Mr. Ratherbee said, "Mr. Harvey, what is the use of being so foolish not to give up the ground? you have had a regular notice six months, why do you want twelve months?"—the prisoner said, "I will have twelve months"—Mr. Ratherbee said, "A six months' written notice is quite plenty by law"—the prisoner said, "I will not give it up unless by law"—Mr. Ratherbee said, "I do not want to go to law, I have no money to go to law; all I want is for you to give up the ground by peace and quietness"—I then saw the prisoner go from Mr. Ratherbee—he stooped, and picked up a stick, which appeared to me to be about six inches long—he was marking the beds of seed with it—I then went into my cottage for a cup of coffee, and as I got up to return I looked through the window, and saw the pri<lb></lb>soner going towards Mr. Ratherbee with his left elbow up—in passing to the door I lost sight of them for a moment, and did not see the blow struck—when</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Canterbury-row, and am a sur<lb></lb>geon. On the 10th of April I was called to attend the deceased—he had a vessel by his bed-side witb a quantity of blood in it, and was spitting blood at the time—he complained of pain in his side, which he said bad been caused by a blow—I examined his chest—I found no bruise, and nothing to indicate a blow, but by examining with my ear I heard a noise in the chest—the spitting of blood proceeded from the rupture of a blood-vessel—it diminished gradually for about three weeks—he went on for a week or ten days without, and then there was a return of it—it diminished again by treatment, but from his general state of ill health it returned—he went to the hospital—I saw him there—he was very low, and was expec-torating mucus tinged with blood—that was about the 29th of June—I did not see him again alive—on the 2nd of Aug. I saw him lying dead at his house—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—I found the cells of the lungs dilated very much, which I attributed to his occupation as a trumpeter—the lungs were gorged with mucus, a little quantity of blood and air—there was an extensive disease as well, which had existed for some time—that would eventually have caused him to die—the lung where the vessel had been ruptured had recovered itself—there had been extensive bleeding, and the effect of that was to weaken him, and cause great debility—the more immediate cause of his death was the state of the air-cells and the spitting of blood, which would decidedly weaken him—supposing him to have received a blow from a man's elbow on the 10th of April, which knocked him down, and he bad been then pulled about the ground, one or both of those things would account for the rupture of a blood vessel, and that would accelerate the disease—he would have died of the diseased lungs, but the rupture of the vessel would accelerate the disease.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Bolingbroke-row, and am a surgeon. I saw the deceased on the 9th of July—I found his respiration carried on very imperfectly, scarcely at all in the right lung, and very slightly through the left—I attended his <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—Mr. Otway has described it correctly—the deceased stated to me, while I was attending him, that he had ruptured a blood-vessel six months before; that a caldron which the japanners used was overset or burst, and nearly suffocated every person, that they were obliged to leave the place to get fresh air, and when he got out he had a cough which caused him to vomit blood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> If an injury of that kind had existed six months, would there not be a predisposition of body to have a similar occurrence? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—it is a difficult question to answer whether he died from the bursting of a blood-vessel from excitement, or from external injury—if a man had received a blow with an elbow sufficient to knock him down, it would rather surprise me if there had been no mark—there was no internal evidence that any external injury had been sustained—I was particularly careful in that respect.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter. Between eight and nine o'clock that morning, as I passed from breakfast, I saw this assault—Ratherbee made the first blow at Harvey uith a spade—Harvey did not strike at all—I saw Ratherbee down on the ground, which was caused by Harvey wrenching the rake out of his hand—if he had not done that he would have struck Harvey with it.</p>

                  </hi>. I was standing at the door of my cottage and saw Ratherbee lying on his back, but I saw no blow struck—I was looking on—my granddaughter was leaning on one side the door-post, and I on the other—I do not think it was possible for my granddaughter to hear all that passed—she might hear them talking—it was about fifty yards from the place.</p>

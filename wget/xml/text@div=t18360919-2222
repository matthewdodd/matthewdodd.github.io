                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Hall, a sawyer; he lives at a timber wharf in the Commercial-road. On a Saturday in August, I was passing along Waterloo-road, near the New Cut—I had a cloak on my right arm—I saw the prisoner there, with some men and woman—my cloak touched another young woman, but not the prisoner—she struck me directly several blows on my left eye, and called me dreadful names—I lost my senses for a few minutes—I did not fall down—I fell against a post—when I recovered I missed my shawl off my shoulder, and 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was gone out of my hand—it was loose in my hand—I was going out to buy a little meat, I never wear a pocket, I always carry my money in my hand—I did not say or do any thing when I missed it—she ill-treated me and kicked me—the people were gone when I came to my senses—I have not seen my shawl or money again—I did not give her in charge till two hours after.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> She gave me in charge at ten o'clock, and said she had lost 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; and when the policeman came up, she said she could not swear I took it out of her hand, but she had lost it—did you not call in names? <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I never spoke to her—I did not give her in charge for two hours after.</p>

               <p>several times afterwards—I did not know Flynn, but the prisoner called her by that name—I went home then—I afterwards went with Mrs. Hall to the New Cut, and saw the prisoner standing opposite the Victoria Theatre—she was given into custody by Mrs. Hall—she called Mrs. Hall very ill names—Mrs. Hall told her, if she would give up her shawl, she would not give her in charge, but if she did not give it up she would—she made a dreadful oath, and said she had not got the shawl, but she had had the worth of it.</p>

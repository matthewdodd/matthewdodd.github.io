               <p>Q. In the month of December last, did you let the prisoner a lodging - A. I did, the parlours; they were both ready furnished, at two guineas a week. On the 18th of December last, she took possession of the apartment, and she left on the 6th of January, and took the key with her. On Friday she left the apartment; on the Tuesday following I had the door opened. I missed a pair of sheets, pillow-cases, and two blankets, and a pillow, tablecloth, and four curtains. These things were let to the prisoner with the lodging. I missed them. On the next morning, I saw them at Mr. Wadmore's, the pawnbroker in Tottenham-court-road, where I found the prisoner's char-woman,

               <p>Q. Did the prisoner employ you to pledge any articles for her - A. Yes, during the time I was with her, when she was at 67, John-street, I pledged for her four curtains, a tablecloth, two pillow-cases, one pillow, and two blankets; and several other things that are owned by Mr. Colwel. I pledged them at Mr. Wadmore's, Tottenham-court-road, and the money that I obtained on these articles I gave to the prisoner. Some I pledged in my own name, and some in Mr. Colwel, and some in the prisoner's name. Mr. Wadmore detained me. I then said who employed me to pawn them. I then had the possession of the tickets. I gave them to Mr. Wadmore, with several other tickets that were not owned by Mr. Colwel. The prisoner gave me the tickets on the morning that I pledged the blankets.</p>

About twelve o'clock at night, on the 18th of March, I was on duty in Lamb's-gardens, Bethnal-green—the prisoner Lee is a housekeeper there—I do not know what he is—a woman of the town was making a noise in front of his house, and he gave charge of her—she was taken to the station-house by two other police-men—she complained of ill usage from him—he had refused to admit her, and she broke his window—she said to him, "If you serve me out, I will serve you out; go and bring that stolen horse out of your stable, at the back of your house"—I had refused before that to take her, unless he went to give charge of her—he then said he would go and press the charge at the station-house—when they proceeded a little way, I left them with two others, and turned back—I knocked at the door of Lee's house, and Enever opened the door—I said, "Oh, Enever, I am surprised to see you here; I did not expect to see you here"—he said, "Why?"—I said the officers were after him a few days before, I heard, in a case of felony, and I said, "What is this about the horse?"—he made no answer to that—I said, "Let us see him?"—he took the light off the table, and opened a door at the back of the room which led into a stable—I there saw a bay mare—I asked him who it belonged to—"Oh," he said, "It is Lee's mare, which his brother lent him to work with"—I examined the mare particu<lb></lb>larly, so that I might look over the list of stolen horses in the "Hue and Cry," and then went to the station-house—I overtook the woman before they got there, but Lee was gone—after the woman was charged, I went back again to Lee's house, and knocked at the door—nobody opened it—I remained there about twenty minutes—I then went round to the back of the house, where the stable is—looked through a little window in the stable, and the mare was gone—I have seen her since, but she was in dif<lb></lb>ferent condition to what she was then—when I saw her in the stable, she looked as if she had not been groomed for some time, but I am certain it is the same one I have seen since.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a chemist and druggist. In Feb. last I lived in Millpond-street, Jiermondsey—I also have a shop in the Deptford-road—the prisoner Jenkins called on me, and after going to see the business, he agreed to purchase it, subject to the opinion of his friend—on 21st Feb., five or six weeks afterwards, Sanderson came, and said his friend Mr. Jenkins was not in a state to pay cash, but he was a young man of good character and property, and was about to marry a young lady to whom he (Sanderson) was trustee, and if I would allow him to have it upon two bills, at four months and two months, he would be married in the meat) time, and should be in a state to pay; that the young lady was entitled to 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on her marriage, under the will of her father, but that the other trustee would not advance anything until they were married; that the young lady's mother, Mrs. Harley, who was entitled to 113<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a year, payable half-yearly,—which money passed through his hands, would accept the bills—we entered into an agreement—I have not got it here—before it was signed I said, "Mr. Sanderson, excuse me, you tell me Mrs. Harley is a widow?"—he said, "She is a widow, for all I can say is that I followed Mr. Harley to his grave, seven years ago, and have had the management of her property ever since"—I afterwards went to 4, Llewyllen-grove, West-street, Bermondsey, saw the prisoner Harley, and asked whether she had accepted bills for Jenkins and Sanderson—she said she had, and asked me into the parlour—she said she had accepted two bills, and expected I had received them—she said, "If you have any doubt, Mr. San<lb></lb>derson, who is my trustee, will put his name on them"—I said, "That was the arrangement he proposed"—she said her property was 113<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and pointed to a portrait in the room, which she said was her late husband's—she referred me to her landlord, but I was so satisfied that I did not make the inquiry then—the property made over to the defendants was worth 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was for the good-will—early in April Sanderson called, and said Jenkins had been with him, and said he would not keep the premises any longer, that he could not get a living—I said, "It is of no consequence; if you like to have the bills back, they are not due, and I will take the business back"—he agreed to meet me at six o'clock—I went with Sanderson, and found the place had been stripped of everything but a small portion of the shelves—the fixtures were completely <hi rend="italic">gone</hi>—I refused to have anything more to do with it, expecting the bills to be paid—the prisoners went away—I could not find them out—they were taken three weeks ago—Mrs. Harley had left her house, as the holder of a bill had tried to sue her for it—the bills were dishonoured.</p>

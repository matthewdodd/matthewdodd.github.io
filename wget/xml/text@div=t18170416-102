On the 5th of March, the prisoner came down from our coffee-room, with two gentlemen, about eleven o'clock. They came into the bar to settle with me. The prisoner proposed walking home with one of the gentlemen. I was called from the bar, and left the prisoner and two gentlemen in the room. While I was standing in the bar, the prisoner left the other gentleman, and passed me. Previous to this, I had placed a bundle of linen, which had been left in my care, in the corner of the room. It was Colonel

Turner said,"here is only one shirt!" and the prisoner said, he had got the other on, and if he would give him another out of the drawer, he would take it off. We found the other neck handkerchief hanging over the chair. We secured him.</p>

I observed a man rush right through between the two women, and push my sister up against the wall; my brother-in-law instantly asked him what he shoved his wife for: a man, who was in his company, turned round and struck my brother a blow in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182709130008"></xptr>eye, and gave him a tremendous black eye. I then asked what he struck him for, and the prisoner then up with his hand, and struck me on the head; he was in company with the rest - there were three or four of them; he knocked my hat off, and with his other hand made a grasp at my watch ribbon and seals; the ribbon broke, and he got the seals - I felt the jerk, and said, "You d-d scoundrel, you have not got my watch!" I instantly pursued him, struck at him, and knocked him down; I laid hold of him by the hand as he was trying to put the seal into his pocket. I took my seal out of his hand, with the ring and two metal keys - they were all in his hand: my wife called out for the watchman, who came up; he began to talk Irish to the watchman; the watchman collared me - he spoke to him in Irish, and then the watchman tried to make me let go the prisoner, and said he saw me strike him, but he was not there at the time. I would not let the prisoner go, and took him down to St. Giles' watch-house. He was never out of my hand- the watchman was an Irishman.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a blow was it the prisoner gave you? - A. With his fist; he knocked my hat off - there were three or four in company - this was the only one I could secure; I am sure he got possession of the keys, ring, and seal; I took them out of his hands - they were tacked on the ribbon- he tore them off without any of the ribbon to them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did he appear quite in his senses? A. Yes; he spoke very well - he did not appear half-witted nor drunk. I am sure I did not strike him before he struck me; nobody struck him till I was struck myself; I then struck him; I did not call him any names; he had no weapon about him.</p>

I am the prosecutor's wife, and was walking with him on the 5th of August, a little before ten o'clock, in Holborn; I was with my sister-in-law; three or four men were standing; one of them rushed in between me and my sister; my brother asked what he pushed his wife for: a man in a white hat then struck my brother, and knocked him back against the shutter; my husband came up, and asked what was the matter; the prisoner then struck him, and knocked his hat off; I saw him put his hand down to his watch, and saw the seal, keys, and ring, in his hand; my husband said, "You have not got my watch, you scoundrel! you have got my seal, ring, and keys;" with that he knocked him down, and took them out of his hand; I called Watch! the watchman came up, and struck me with the rattle, and knocked me on the pavement; the prisoner and he talked Irish together; he was however secured and taken to the watch-house; the watchman collared my husband instead of the prisoner, but my husband kept hold of the prisoner; when we were going to the watch-house, the man in the white hat walked in the rear of us, and I said he was the man who struck my brother-in-law at first; they talked Irish with the watchman, and he did not take him, though he could easily have done so.</p>

            . On the 5th of August I was walking up Holborn; the man in the white hat came in between my wife and sister; I stepped up, and asked what he had pushed my wife for - he immediately gave me a blow in the eye, and cut it so that I could not see for a few moments. I heard my brother call out, "D-n you, you have not got my watch, but you have got my seal." I saw the prisoner at the watch-house afterwards.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I declare to God I am innocent of what they are swearing against me - he struck me first, and of course I struck him afterwards; he then gave me in charge. I was never in Court before, and ask for mercy.</p>
               <p>Three witnesses gave the prisoner a good character, and stated him to be a widower, with two children.</p>

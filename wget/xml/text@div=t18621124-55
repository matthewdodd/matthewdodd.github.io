                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, and have offices at No. 61, Watling-street—on the 14th of October I had a photographic picture; it was hanging up in my private office—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—it was in a second-floor front room, and my clerk has an office on the first-floor—I went out on that morning at about 11, or half-past 11—at that time the picture was hanging up in my room—I locked the door, and took the key down to the clerk's office—I placed the key on my clerk's desk, in the usual way, and left the office—I returned a few minutes before 2—I found that my clerk had gone out, and left the key in his door—I went into his room for my key, and found it had been taken away, and a strange key was left in lieu of it—I went upstairs and found my own door would not open, and I had a locksmith to pick the lock—I then found that the photographic picture had been taken away, and some other things.</p>

I was formerly clerk to Mr. Steinberg—on the 14th October I was in the office, on the first-floor, from about 10 to a quarter to 2—I then went out—I did not leave anybody in my office—I just went round into Bucklersbury to get something to eat, and I locked the door and left the key in it, on the outside.</p>

From instructions, I went to Kynaston-street, Gibson-street, Portland-road, about 3 o'clock on the morning of the 8th of November—I went into the back room on the ground-floor—I saw the two prisoners in bed together—I found in the room the photographic picture produced—it was hanging up in the room—I was told by the landlady that the room was rented by the elder prisoner—I had not seen him there before—I know nothing, of my own knowledge, beyond finding them both there on that day.</p>

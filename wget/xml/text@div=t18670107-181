I took the prisoner in custody at 14, St. Paul's Road, Lorrimore Square—I was in plain clothes—I said, "I am an officer, and hold a warrant for your apprehension, for writing a false libel concerning one Miss Trimble, of Foxcroft Villa, Brompton"—he said, "Yes, I did write it; I am very glad this has come to light, it is the best job which was ever done for me, I shall make her pay dear for this; I shall get my money now that is owing to me"—I then said, "I have got the letter here, which I shall show you"—I showed him the letter, and asked if it was his writing and his signature—he said, "Yes, I wrote it; it is true; there is nothing there that I am afraid of; I can prove what is stated there"—I then read the warrant to him, and he said, "There is nothing there that I am afraid of"—he was going on to say more, when I cautioned him that what he said might be used in evidence against him—he said, "Then I'll say nothing more, for there's nothing that concerns you, I dare say"—on the way to the station he said, "I sent the letter to Brighton, to Captain Oldhara"—that was the letter I had.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">The libel, being put in, charged the prosecutrix with having committed perjury, for which it stated that she was about to be indicted, also with bigamy and with the murder of her children.</hi>)</p>

                  </hi>. I am the solicitor for Miss Trimble—I was consulted about some proceedings that had been taken against her by the prisoner—I have those proceedings here—a declaration was served on the 31st October, 1866—it is an action by the plaintiff, clerk to a solicitor, for slander, and there are several money Counts—I took her instructions, and pleaded on the 9th November, 1866, as to the slander "Not guilty," and as to the money Counts "Never indebted"—notice of trial was given on the 16th November, 1866—after these proceedings the prisoner counter<lb></lb>manded the notice of trial—the letter was written to Captain Oldham three days before the notice of trial—that letter was put into my hands, and I applied to the Magistrate for a warrant, and directed the officer to execute it.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186701070076"></xptr>
               <p>sovereign to induce him to depart from the path of duty, and wring out a confession? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I gave the officer sufficient money to take a cab to Fox-croft Villa, belonging to Miss Trimble, and inform her that she must be at the Court on the following morning, and then take a cab to my office and inform me of the fact—I simply gave him money for his bare expenses—I did not state at the Lambeth Police-court that I had given that money as a bribe—it was stated on your behalf that there was no intention of having you apprehended, and I stated to the Magistrate that, so far from that being true, the police constable had money given to him to give me the earliest information of it; it was a mere statement in Court—I have been consulted by the prosecutrix with reference to proceedings against Mr. Brutton for bigamy, but not with reference to instituting proceedings—I was at Foxcroft Villa with an inspector of the detective police with reference to the charge of bigamy, but I was never instructed to institute proceedings—I have never had communications on this question of bigamy with Sir Joseph Hawley.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner in his defence stated that he had been clerk to Mr. Brutton, a solicitor, having offices in Regent Street, who had given him his confidence; that he then learned that the prosecutrix, with whom Mr. Brutton lived at Foxcrofl Villa, Brompton, was not his wife, although the ceremony of a mock marriage had been gone through between them, for he was in fact married to another lady, who was still alive; that he kneivfrom the prosecutrix's own lips that she was well aware at the time of the ceremony that Mr. Brutton was a married man; that a great quarrel took place between Mr. Brutton and the prosecutrix, and that they then separated and proceedings were commenced against Mr. Brutton for bigamy. They, however, became again reconciled, and immediately began blackguarding him, although he had acted faithfully and kindly towards both, and had spent a great deal of his money in the pro<lb></lb>secutrix's service, and commenced an action against her to recover it, but, these proceedings being brought against him, he was obliged to countermand the action, and urged that they were brought for no other purpose than to compel him to do so. He admitted writing the letter to Captain Oldham, but stated that he could prove that the allegations in it were true. The prosecutrix had committed perjury in swearing, as he would show she had, that none of the furniture at Foxcroft Villa had ever been Mr. Brutton's property. He was aware that she had not committed bigamy in the legal sense, but would show that she had done so in the popular sense. As regarded the charge of murder, he had her confession of it from her own lips, and would call a witness to whom she had also admitted it.</hi>

I have been cook to the prosecutrix—I left on 8th November—she was in the habit of reposing her confidence in me—she told me that a great part of the furniture in Foxcroft Villa had been bought by Mr. Brutton—she mentioned two bedsteads, looking-glasses, and furniture enough to furnish a small house—she told me that Mr. Brutton had handed</p>

               <p>them over to her—I went there on 17th April, 1865—she told me that she was married on. 3rd March, last year, at St. Peter's, Westminster—she has repeatedly told me she knew Mr. Brutton was a married man, before she married him, and that his wife had beaten her before her marriage to him—she sent me one night with a message to his wife that Mr. Brutton was ill and she was out of town, and would the wife come and fetch him away—that was, I should think, about two months before I left—Mr. Brutton was not ill—they had had a row—I heard her say that when the other wife came she would turn her out of doors, and ask her what she came there for—we were to have said that she had come home during the time I was gone—the wife would not see me—the prosecutrix told me she had had three children by Mr. Brutton—she told me that two of them were miscarriages, one caused by the wife beating her, the other by his beating her, and that the third was born alive and smothered in a bowl of water—she said the child born alive had got eyes and ears just like its father—she said it was a seven months' child—I have often seen the prisoner at the house at all hours, late in the evening and early in the morning—she has sent for him, and he has been there at her request a good many times—she has received him in her bedroom while she has been in bed—I have heard her say she put her confidence in him—she has told him in my presence to spend his own money on her business, and told him she would make it all right with him, to spare no expense, but to go about and try to find out what he could for her—I have never heard him ask for money—I have never known him to receive a halfpenny—she told me about a month or six weeks before I left that they were going to take Mr. Brutton up for bigamy—she has left one room, where Sir Joseph Hawley was, to come into another to speak to the prisoner—I have seen Mr. Lewis come in at the gate—I do not know whether Sir Joseph Hawley came with him—she told me Mr. Lewis came about taking Mr. Brutton up for bigamy—she told me to tell the prisoner that she had given Mr. Lewis Mr. mutton's photograph, because the detectives were after him, and so that they might know hint if they saw him—I know the prisoner was the means of conciliating them after that quarrel—since that time, while I lived there, she has behaved very badly to the prisoner—as far as my knowledge went, I thought the prisoner was acting kindly and faithfully—she never told me who drowned the child: she said, "They smothered it"—she said that the reason why it was born at seven months was because she had been ill-treated.</p>

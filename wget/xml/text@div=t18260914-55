            . I am foreman to Mr. Chubb. On the 1st of July I sent the witness with these clothes - he returned about four o'clock without the basket; Forrester brought the prisoner to our house three or four days after- Jay saw him, and said he was the boy - he was allowed to go away; I think he had on a blue coat and a cap.</p>

            . I am a constable. I apprehended the prisoner the beginning of July; Jay had given me an account of the robbery - I took the prisoner with another boy, and took both to Mr. Chubb's; Jay said the prisoner was the person who took the basket; he was allowed to go home, as Jay had described him as a fair lad, and the one with him was fair. On the 24th of July I took him again, with two others, in Smithfield.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The other boy was much fairer than the prisoner? A. Yes - I took that boy by Jay's description - he said he had corduroy trousers on, and a round hat.</p>

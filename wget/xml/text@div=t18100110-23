               <p>Q. Where did you go for that purpose - A. I <rs id="t18100110-23-viclabel132" type="occupation">keep the Windmill public-house</rs>

The prisoner at the bar came down stairs, he was a lodger of mine, he had lodged with me about two months. He asked me for half a pint of beer. My small clothes were lying on the tap-room table; they were those that I had taken off, my apron was lying over them. I delivered the half pint of beer.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner the only person in the room at that present time - A. He was. I had another lodger come down stairs; he brought the half pint of beer back from the prisoner, and desired me to make a pint of it; I made it a pint. They then called for a quartern of gin. I left my breeches on the table in the room during this time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go and fetch the gin - A. I was in the bar, and they came for the liquor; the bar is on the other side of the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of them came for it - A. Not the prisoner. The prisoner remained in the tap-room during this time the man came for the gin. After they had drank this, they got up and went out together. My wife went into the tap-room, and found my things laying on the tap-room table, she brought them in the bar to me, and said, how simple I must be to leave my small clothes there; I said, there were no men there but our own lodgers, and a man that worked for Mr. Cotterell. She took my money out of my watch pocket, I immediately missed the check which the Bank of England notes were rolled in it.</p>
               <p>Q. How many Bank notes had you - A. There were nineteen pounds altogether, with the money and the check. The check was for five pounds ten shillings, drawn by Mr. Hobbs on Manwaring. At that present time I did not miss any Bank of England notes. I was rather flurried. Afterwards I missed a one pound Bank note. My wife said, our lodgess must have taken them, and desired me to run after them. I did run after them, and took them in King's-road. I stopped them, and told them they had been playing the rogue with my pockets, and desired, if they had to return me my money; they denied having any money of mine. The prisoner asked me how much I had lost; I told him, I supposed he knew better than I did: I could not exactly tell. I said, you must go back, and I will have you all three searched. They did come back; and coming down Liquor-pond-street, as I walked after the prisoner, I perceived him breaking paper and dropping it. I catched up a piece of it, and seized his hand, where there was the remains of the check. I then seized him and brought him to my house, and I sent for Mr. Hancock, the officer, to take charge of him. The other men were searched, but nothing was found on them.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen this check and the one pound note in your pocket before - A. On that morning; before I had undressed myself I had looked at them, and folded them up in this check; that was, when I was first up in the morning. The officer has the two pieces of the check.</p>
               <p>Mr. Arabin. How long had you worn the breeches that morning - A. From six o'clock, I dare say; it was when I first got up.</p>
               <p>Q. You counted your money when you got up - A. I did. There was nobody about the house till these men got up. It could not have gone out of my pocket without it was taken out. I put them in my fob; they were tight breeches.</p>
               <p>Court. What parish is your house in - A. Saint Andrew's.</p>
               <p>JAMES HANCOCK. I was sent for on the morning of the robbery. I went to the house of Mr. Conner; he told me had been robbed; he pointed out three men; I searched the other men, then I searched this man. This note was given to me by Mr. Conner. I took the prisoner off to the New Prison. I asked for the one pound note; he had put it in the other notes, he told me.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The prisoner delivered to me a one pound note; he said, that was all the money he had got. I put it into my pocket and mixed it with the others. I could not pick it out again.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a note of one pound - A. Yes, they were all one pound notes but the check.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your asking him to deliver up the one pound note, he gave you a one pound note - A. He did.</p>
               <p>JOHN HOBBS, Senior. Q. Did you at any time draw a check upon Manwaring and Co. - A. I did, on Saturday last.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that check; is there any thing there that you know - A. This is my hand-writing; this is the check that I left with my son.</p>

            . Last Sunday morning I was in Mr. Conner's house, between seven and eight o'clock I called for a pint of beer. I sat down by the fire, on the stool. The prisoner was on the right hand of the tap-room fire; he removed to the left. On the table there was something with a white cloth or apron over it. When she prisoner removed from the right to the left of the fire I heard something move; I looked of one side.</p>
               <p>Q. What was there on the table - A. I thought it was rolls, it was under a white cloth; what it was I did not know. The prisoner's hand was underneath; I saw it move; I drank part of my beer. I looked over my left shoulder, his hand was very busy for the space of two minutes and upwards. I drank my beer, and came out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see where Mr. Conner was at the time - A. He drawed my beer, brought it to me, put it on the stove, and went into the bar again.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The note and check I picked up under the tap-room table in the morning after that gentleman was gone out.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

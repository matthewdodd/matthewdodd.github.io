             was in company with me; suspecting that he had something, I listened at the door; after a minute I heard something go into the scale, as if it was metal.</p>
               <p>Q. What shop does she keep. - A.Her husband is a blacksmith, he keeps a shop of ironmongery, and buys old iron; I then lifted the latch of the front door to try to get in; I found it was fast; I went round to the back door, I left Thomas at the front door; when I came to the back door it was fast, when I got back again Thomas had got into the house; I went in to him at the front door, and Thomas had hold of Randall by the collar, and these nails were lying on the floor; and the woman at the bar was standing close by him. I then asked Randall where he got the nails; he says what nails, I know nothing of any nails, I brought none here; I then asked Mrs. Hill where she got the nails, (pointing to the nails on the floor); she told me that she had them of the prisoner Randall; they were both standing together, he said not a word. I then took Randall to the office; I searched him; I found two nails in the inside of each pocket; as I was carrying him to the office, I asked him what yard he worked in; he said he worked in no yard at all.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Reynolds. You do not know that this woman was in the shop at the time this man went into the shop. - A. I cannot say that she was, she was there when I went in.</p>
               <p>Q. You never did take the prisoner Hill up. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. She in point of fact, voluntarily came up to the office. - A. Yes.</p>

            . I am an officer, I was in company with the other witness; the prisoner lifted up the the latch of Mrs. Hill's door, and immediately went in; Adams tried the latch just afterwards; he could not get in; I was with him, he went round to the back door; in the mean time, I lifted up the latch, and the door was opened to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any thing after he lifted up the latch. - A. I heard a jingling, as if iron nails had been put in the scale; I went in the shop; Mrs. Hill turned the nails out of the scale into her apron, and went immediately into the back parlour; I asked her what she did with the nails that she took out of the scale; she said, what nails; I said the nails that you had from the carpenter that just come in with them. She then threw the nails out of her apron on the floor; I turned my head then and saw Randall; I took hold of him, he was just by the door; we took Randall to the office; I saw the two nails taken out of his pocket.</p>

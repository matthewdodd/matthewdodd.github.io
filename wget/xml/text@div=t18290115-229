               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is the other lady here? A. No; she had made a mistake in the road, and had a young child to carry - she had been with me all the evening; I never saw the prisoner before she spoke to me: I fell on one of my knees in running after her - I had only one brace-button; there was but one button to that part of my trousers - the flap-button and brace-button were both one: that button-hole might slip off the button - I swear it was not unbuttoned when the watchman came up; she had run one hundred yards with the watch - it was between eleven and twelve o'clock; I had drunk a share of three pots of half-and-half.</p>

            . I am a watchman. About half-past eleven o'clock that night I saw the prisoner and the prosecutor together - he said,</p>
               <p>"Will you take this woman?" I took hold of her; she said to me," Do call the gentlemen, and ask him to make it up, before I go to the watch-house" - I took her there, and gave charge of her; I saw the watch in Jones' hand - I cannot say whether his trousers were down.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met this man in the highway -I asked him to go with me; we went up the court - I told him I would wish him a good night as there were passengers passing; I came out, and passed one watchman-the prosecutor came up and knocked me down; I shewed the mud at the watch-house.</p>

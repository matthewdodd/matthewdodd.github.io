On the 2nd of November, I went to bed between twelve and one o'clock; I had secured the club-room windows about eight, and was the last person in the room; before I went to bed I went to take the glasses and the club-box out of the club-room - it is on the first floor: the windows were both safe - one looks into Archer-street, and the other into Windmill-street; they were fastened by a bar going across them: there was money in the club-box; I put out the lights, took the club-box into my bed-room, and went to bed in a few minutes - I was disturbed between four and five o'clock in the morning by the Police-officer knocking at my door; I went into the club-room, found the shutter partly broken away at the window in Archer-street- the window was thrown up, and part of the shutter broken away; that window was quite safe when I left the room - it is the middle window, and has four squares of glass on each side of it, one above the other; the window which was open is in the centre of them - it has three squares lengthways; there are twelve squares in the middle window; the squares on each side are fixed: the Police-officer has the part of the shutter which was broken off - that was broken off inside the room; the shutter goes over the whole window, which is five squares in length - it was not broken off at the part of the window which was thrown up, but at the side of the wall; the window had been thrown up first, and a hand put in to force the shutter away from the side, apparently by a chisel - the person must have been partly in the premises, or he could not get to that part of the shutter; his hand must have been partly inside the room to force the shutter off - he could not get at that part of the shutter without having a hand inside; there are leads about a foot and a half wide, on which he could stand, and throw up the window sash, and get his hand inside - there was no fastening to the sash; the bar of the shutter was not down - they had not time to do that, I suppose; the window was thrown up, and the shutter broken away from the side; the shutter had given way by being forced away inside, and that must have broken it where the hasp of the bar goes into: I am satisfied a hand had been inside the room at the side of the window - the window was down when I went to bed, and every thing secure.</p>

            . I am a Police-man. On the morning of the 3rd of November, between four and five o'clock, I was on duty in Rupert-street, and observed the shadows of three men at the upper part of Rupert-street; I observed them turn down Archer-street - I followed them in a few minutes, and on standing at the corner of Archer-street, I observed at the other end of Archer-street two men under Mr. Delaney's house, and one man on the leads; I made towards them, but the two men, I suppose, gave an alarm to the one on the leads, who instantly jumped down, and the three ran away - I followed them, and bad nearly got to them, when the one jumped down, one turned down Smith's-court, Windmill-street - I rather suspect that to be the prisoner; it was the man who was on the leads, I am positive - a man named Skelton (who was at Marlborough-street) stopped me at the end of the court, and dodged me, to prevent my pursuing; I cannot say he was one of the three men - I do not know what became of the other two men; I should not know the man again who ran down Smith's-court - the court is not a thoroughfare; I was within three yards of the man who ran down there, I should imagine -I remained at the end of Smith's-court, and directed Hobbs, the Police-man, who came up to my assistance, to go down the court, as there was a man down there - Hobbs came up the court again, with the prisoner; that was nearly ten minutes after I had seen a man go down the court - I was at the end of the court at the time the man who came off the leads ran down, and remained there till Hobbs brought the prisoner up - nobody went down there from the time he went down till Hobbs brought the prisoner out: we took him to the watch-house - I searched him there, and found on him a small piece of candle, in his coat pocket, which is here.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. This man says he was not more than three yards from me - I should think he could tell whether I was the person who jumped off the leads - when I was apprehended he said I was not the person who jumped off the leads, for that person had no shoes on. Witness. I did not say he was not the person who jumped off, nor that he had no shoes on; I only said I was not certain as to the man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He said two or three men ran down this coach-yard, and one person had no shoes on - he went back from the watch-house with two or three Police-men, to search for them. Witness. I did not say so - I said I left three Police-men there while I brought him to the watch-house, and that two or three of the Police had gone down after the prisoner, but no other person; we were sent out by the inspector to search the place where he was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182912030005"></xptr>concealed, not particularly to search for men, but for implements, or things of that kind; I did not say the man who jumped off the leads had no shoes - it was stated by a tallow-chandler, who was at work, that he supposed the man who ran down the court had no shoes on, by the lightness of his running; the prisoner had shoes on when brought to the watch-house.</p>

            . I am a Police-man. On the 3rd of November I was on duty in Brewer-street, between four and five o'clock in the morning, and heard a rattle spring; I went down Windmill-street, and Seaman sent me up Smith's-court - I went and searched all the premises round the court; the doors were all shut and fast - it is no thoroughfare; I saw a dung-heap, and over that was a privy erected - I took my truncheon out of my pocket, put it round the dung-heap, and hallooed out "Come out;" I received no answer - I could see nobody there; I returned to a tallow-chandler who was at work in a court in Smith's-court, which is no thoroughfare, borrowed a lighted candle of him, returned to the dung-heap, and found the prisoner curled up underneath the flooring of the privy, laying on the dung; I said, "You d - d rascal, come out;" he put up his hands and robbed his eyes, just as if he was asleep, and said, "What do you take me for? what have I been doing?" I said, "You have been doing enough;.' I took him from the dung-heap to the watch-house, searched him, and found this chisel in his coat pocket; it was quite a dark night - I could not even see the dung, much more a countenance.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I told him I came there to ease myself, and had my breeches down at the time. Witness. He told me so - his breeches were unbuttoned, but not down at all - there is a privy seat for a man to ease himself, without going under on the dung.</p>
               <p>GEORGE BLACKMAN. I am an inspector of the Police. I saw this chisel found on the prisoner by Hobbs, on the night of the 2nd of November - I afterwards went and examined Delaney's premises; I found two impressions on the folding shutters, which are inside the window - I fitted this chisel in the impression; it exactly corresponded with it - the piece of the shutter was left at Marlborough-street- it is not here: I fitted the chisel into the impression where the two small hinges of the folding-shutters go - I did not fit it on the piece of wood broken off; it was broken off at the hinges - the part broken off was brought to St. James' watch-house: I myself took off the part of the shutter the hinges were on - the part of the shutter which was broken off was at the hinges, and it exactly fitted the rest of the shutter.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the state of the premises when you went there? A. Part of the shutter had been broken off - I did not fit the chisel to that, but to the part where the hinges go; that part remained fixed to the shutter - the part broken off was taken to the watch-house, and is not here.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you fit the chisel to any part that remained at Delaney's house? A. No, only the part that was broken off - it was taken to Marlborough-street, and is not here; it is at Marlborough-street now.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I should wish the Jury to see it, for it does not correspond with the chisel, for I am sure it was never out of my pocket - I am certain it does not correspond. Witness. I am certain it did correspond.</p>

            . The piece broken off was where the screws go into; it was at the watch-house with the other part, which was taken there - the chisel was not fitted into the part that was broken off, but to the part below that- I was not present when Blackman fitted the chisel; I saw the part of the shutter at Marlborough-street, and at St. James' watch-house; it was a part of the shutter which was broken off - there were two pieces of the shutter at St. James' watch-house, one which I found broken off, and another which I saw the chisel fitted to.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am not satisfied about the shutter - he says it was broken off at the hinges and down the middle; if I broke it at the middle, what should I break it down the middle for? it was not done with that chisel - if I had used the chisel I could have made away with it while he went for the light: if I had done wrong with it I would not have had it about my person.</p>
               <p>The prisoner then handed in a written Defence, as follows: I declare my innocence in the presence of God. Three days before I was apprehended I came from Watford, of which place I am a native, and served my time as a carpenter - I came to London to endeavour to procure employment, but got only a few days work at times. On the evening preceding the day mentioned in the indictment I went to the Theatre - on my return, I promiscously fell in with two females, and went to different public-houses, till my money was exhausted, and they left me; I was taken ill in my inside, and being intoxicated, went down this yard to ease myself; I was very drowsy, and am unconscious of how long I had been there. Having nothing but a chisel in my possession, I leave it to the Court to say whether I could be guilty of such a charge, and not conceiving I was committing any thing illegal in having such an implement in my possession.</p>

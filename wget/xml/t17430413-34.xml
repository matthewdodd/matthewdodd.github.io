Said I, it does not signify any thing searching you, for you have got it in your Mouth, or else have swallowed it. - We did not find it upon him, for he had it in his Mouth to be sure.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure, when you held out your Hand to give him Change, that the Ring was upon your Finger?</p>
               <p>Evenden. Yes, I am sure of it; that at the Time the Money was in my Hand the Ring was upon my Finger; I had not had my Ring off for six Years, and the Blisters which he raised upon my Hand, did not break for several Weeks afterwards; he hurt me very much in the doing it.</p>

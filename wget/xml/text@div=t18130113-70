               <p>Q. Does your husband keep the whole house - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you lost this bed - A. On the 14th of last month. It was near upon two o'clock when I went out.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you leave in the house - A. Not any person. I am sure they were all out, and when I returned it was just dusk. I saw my shutters broken open. My shutters were bolted inside.</p>
               <p>Q. How had he got them open - A. I cannot say. I saw a piece of the bolt broken off.</p>
               <p>Q. Had anybody got in - A. Yes, the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that - A. We took him, and he told us where the property was. It is a sailor's flock bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was anything else gone - A. Not anything else.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not a new bed, was it - A. It was just upon a new ticking. I saw the bottle-screw laid on the table, which fastened down the sash, and a part of the bolt laid on the table also, and a paper which<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181301130043"></xptr>had been pasted on the window, laid in the middle of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there nothing gone but this flock bed of yours - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever found your flock bed - A. Yes. I found it at Mrs. Levi's the next morning. The prisoner came the next morning, and owned it to me, and took me to Mrs. Levi's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the prisoner lodge in your house - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to own it to you - A. I do not know. He came to me and my husband the next morning; he took me and my husband to Mrs. Levi. He said, that he had sold it for eight shillings. On Tuesday morning he came and told me he had taken it. I did not know him before the Sunday morning before that.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there anything of more value besides the flock bed, in the house - A. There was a watch on the mantle-piece. He never touched anything but the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know anything about him, what he is; Did he visit your lodgers - A. No. I never knew him before the Sunday, that he came on the Monday, and took the bed. The bed laid on the ground, tied up as it was brought. A countryman of the prisoner brought it there, and we had bought it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had it been in your house - A. Near upon two or three days. It was not untied.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say it was his property - A. No, he did not, and he came and owned it himself.</p>

            . I live in Rosemary-lane. On the 14th of December, the prisoner came in and offered a bed for sale, about half past three on the Monday. He asked for the bed twelve shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. What country man is he - A. An Italian. He speaks broken English very well to be understood. I offered him eight shillings. He said he could not take it. He took it on his shoulder and walked away. He stopped about an hour and a half away, and then returned, and said I might have it. Then I gave him eight shillings for it. On the 15th, the prosecutor came and claimed it. The officer came and took the bed. They came, and the prisoner along with them. He shewed them the house where he sold it.</p>
               <p>MRS. MARTIN. I live four doors off Mrs. Gracia. I saw the prisoner knock at Mrs. Gracia's door about half after two o'clock. I saw no more of the prisoner till the next morning.</p>

            . The prosecutrix came to me on Tuesday, the 15th. She said, that she had her house broken open, and she had found where her bed was; it was at Mrs. Levi's, in Rosemary-lane. I went there, and found the bed. I produce it. I went back to the prosecutrix's house. The prisoner came in, and I took him in custody. I asked him, how he came to do it. He said, he believed the devil occasioned him to do it.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I know the bed by the piece of red cloth being put on as a mettrass bed. I am quite certain it is the same bed.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence: being a foreigner he was allowed an interpreter.</p>

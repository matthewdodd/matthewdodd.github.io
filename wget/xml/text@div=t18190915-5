On Tuesday, the 27th of July, I went to West-end fair, with Mr. Helder. Between eight and nine o'clock in the evening, as we were returning, we had occasion to pass between two booths - there was a passage between them; it was considerably narrower than the booths at the fair; they were in a field near <placeName id="t18190915-5-crimeloc27">Hampstead</placeName>

I heard a noise, and then the word trap was given by some of them, both before and behind us. Upon this signal being given, I was struck behind on my head by some instrument or stick; my hat fell off, and I fell down. I rose, and instantly as I got up, I was attacked by six or seven of the gang, who grasped my pockets. I was knocked down again by some person striking me behind with a fist; I got up again, and they tore my pantaloons. I made all the resistance in my power, and knocked one or two of them down. I was all over blood, which flew on me from their mouths or noses - I did not bleed myself; when I knocked them down, I got separated from them a little. There was an immediate cry of</p>
               <p>"D - n the little fellow, he has escaped, give it to him again!" I suppose about twenty of them came in a body, and knocked me completely through the canvass into a booth - three or four followed me in. Two or three fiddlers, who were in the booth, protected me; the men retreated through the hole, and joined the gang. I was separated from my friend immediately as they attacked us, and he received several blows.</p>
               <p>Q. How were the gang armed - A. Several of them had sticks. It was quite daylight, but it was so sudden, that I could not notice them; they all acted in concert; there were full from sixty to seventy of them. I was obliged to remain in the booth until three o'clock in the morning; I dared not come out as they knew I had money about me; they had cut holes in the booth and watched me from nine o'clock in the evening till two o'clock in the morning, so that I could not stir. Several other persons were brought into the booth much cut and wounded; they were cut and wounded by the same party, and in the same place. I lost my hat and handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the persons who were brought into the booth, remain there as long as you did - A. Yes. Two young ladies in particular were cut, and their clothes torn off. Furrian brought me my hat and handkerchief two or three days after; my name is in the hat. I was in great terror, and cannot identify any of the men.</p>

I apprehended the prisoner on Tuesday, the 27th of July, at eleven o'clock at night, with the assistance of my brother officers, in a field at the back of the fair. I found a hat and two handkerchiefs on him; one round his neck, and the other in the side-pocket of his coat, which the prosecutor claimed. I made enquiry at the hatter's, and was referred to the prosecutor, who claimed the hat and handkerchief.</p>

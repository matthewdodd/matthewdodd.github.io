                  </hi>. I am a working-silversmith, and live in Red-lion-court, Clerkenwell. The defendant is a working-goldsmith—about the 15th or 16th of October, I gave him an order to make a plain gold standard ring, the weight was to be 6 dwts. 15 grains—eight or ten days afterwards, I re<lb></lb>ceived</p>

               <p>a ring from him—I did not take particular notice then, whether there was a stamp on it, but I think there was—I returned the ring to him to be made a little heavier—it was returned to me, altered, in a day or two afterwards—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a ring</hi>) I cannot say whether this is it—I had it so short a time in my possession, and took so little notice of it—it is so altered, I cannot say whether it is the ring—I should say it was not, from the appearance, because it has been chased since—I delivered to Gleeson the same ring that I received from the prisoner—it was at that time quite a plain ring.</p>

                  </hi>. I am deputy touch-warden of Goldsmith's Hall, and reside there. Mr. McMinn called on me on the 1st of November, and brought me this ring—in consequence of what passed, I subjected the ring to a certain process—it was not the colour it is now; the process has changed it—I found the Company's mark had been transposed on exam<lb></lb>ining it—the mark has been taken from one piece of gold and put into the ring produced—the three marks, the duty mark and two of the Company's marks, (the lion passant is one of them,) they have all three been trans<lb></lb>posed—the small Roman "t" denotes the date—jewellers deposit at the Hall a certain mark, by which their own work may be known—the prisoner's mark was "J.O."—I find that mark on the ring—I attended at Hatton-garden on the 6th of November—the prisoner was there, and the ring produced, discoloured as it was by the process—I do not think he could see it distinctly—I do not recollect whether it was shown to him or not—what he said was taken down, in writing—I have kept the ring safe ever since.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to the Magistrate at Hatton-garden. I was present when the prisoner appeared on this occasion, and I acted as clerk—the ring was produced—he heard the depositions of the various wit<lb></lb>nesses against him—they were read over to him—he was first brought up on the 6th of November, and committed for examination till next day—only a short examination was taken on the 6th—he appeared again on the 7th—he was asked on the 6th, if he had any thing to say, and his answer was taken down by me in writing—it was not returned with the deposi<lb></lb>tions—I have the book in which I took it down—(Mr. Sharp, the witness, was examined previously, and the ring produced)—(<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>)"The pri<lb></lb>soner says, 'It was sent to me to be made by Mr. Beebe, of Red Lion-square, a spoon-maker—I made it, and sent it home—it was returned to me to make heavier, and a little smaller—in doing so, I obliterated the Hall mark; and the party sending to me, that the ring must be sent home that day, I destroyed another ring, and put the Hall mark of it into this ring."—I took this down from his lips—I read it over to him afterwards, and he corrected one error which I had made, and I have now read it accord<lb></lb>ing to his correction—this deposition is my handwriting—the prisoner dictated that declaration to me—it was in answer to a question, whether he had any thing to say?—that was on the 6th of November—(<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>) "The prisoner says, 'The ring now produced is a genuine ring—it has been stamped at the Hall—it has been sent there with my work."</p>

O"—it was in Mr. Sharp's hands and the Magistrate's, and I rather think I took it up for a moment—I was not aware of the error in the date of the deposition till this moment—it is my error—I think Mr. Alexander was at the office on the 6th.</p>

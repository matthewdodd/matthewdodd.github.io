                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's wife. We have been married fifteen years—I have three children by him; the eldest is a daughter, named Eliza; she will be fifteen next Feb; and I have two younger children—on Monday, 24th Oct., we were living at No. 35, Little Park-street, Kennington-cross—I was living there with my husband—he is a wheelwright by trade—my brother, Peter Westbrook, had recently before this transaction lost his wife, and had since that come to live in an unoccupied room in our house—he came on the Wednesday as this happened on the Monday morning—it was a room on the ground floor—my brother had an acquaintance named Henry Lee—before this Monday my husband had threatened me—I went to bed on Sunday night about 10 o'clock, with my husband—my daughter Eliza slept in the same room—about three o'clock in the morning my brother came home—I was asleep at the time, but, my husband awoke me, and said, "Did you hear a knock at the door?"—I said, "No, I did not hear it; but if there is a knock, it is not for us, so you can let them knock"—I did not know that my brother was coming home that morning—my husband got up, and looked out of the window, and asked who was there; and Thomas (who is a young lad that my brother brought up) answered him—his name is Thomas Sears—my husband said, "Do you wish to come in?"—he replied," Yes"—my husband shut down the window, went down stairs, and let them in—I remained in bed—he asked them if they wanted to sleep there—he said, "Yes"—my husband came up stairs, and my daughter got out of her bed, and went into bed to her two little brothers, and my husband carried her bed down stairs into the room my brother occupied, for their accommodation for the night—Henry Lee was with Thomas, but not my brother—as soon as my husband had done the business, he desired me to cover them over with a pair of</p>

It is just 7, my dear, and came down stairs—I had been washing myself, and putting my hair to rights, and he came down and stood by my right side, apparently buttoning his right hand trowsers pocket—I was putting on my things to go out; I was going to my sister's, No. 24, James-street, Camberwell, and I was putting my black brooch in my dress—he said he should like to have my brother Peter to himself—I said, Well, you know, Philip, my brother Peter will not be with you by himself, as you have threatened both our lives.</p>

               <p>I got into the passage, and there he forced me backwards—at that time my daughter had come to my assistance, but she could not get the street door unbolted—when my husband forced me backwards, he drew a second knife from his right hand pocket, and commenced cutting me in the left side of my throat—he had hold of me by my hair—I struggled with him, and succeeded in getting up on my feet, and told my daughter to open the parlour shutters, and give an alarm—she was trying to get the door open, but could not—my husband was then cutting me in the left side of my throat, and I was struggling with him—I had hold of the blade of the knife with my right hand, and as my daughter passed through the parlour door, my husband made a terrible strike at heir in the back with the knife; had she not stumbled the knife would have passed through her between the shoulders—when she had got the shutters open, he said to her, You b, I will pay you for this—she got the shutters open, and screamed Murder! during this time I was struggling with my husband—I at last succeeded in wrenching the second knife from him, and as soon as I had done so, and threw it down, he tried to force his fingers through the left side of my throat, and tore the flesh towards the left ear—I was then on my feet in the passage he then dragged me by the hair into the back room, and got a third knife—where he got it from, whether he picked it up, or took it out of the table drawer, I cannot say, for I was almost exhausted—I was then on my knees and he commenced cutting my throat again with the third knife—he did not say anything during this time, till the last part of it—I struggled violently with him, and got into the parlour, where he endeavoured to get me down with my head against the cupboard door, and then he exclaimed, Now I have got you, you b, I will do for you—after he had used that expression, assistance came, but he had the knife, point downwards, trying to force it through the left side of my throat, but I clasped the blade so tight with my right hand, that he could not force it as he would have wished to have done; I fear I must have lost my life if assistance had not come—I do not know who it was that came; I was too far exhausted—I only recollect getting out of the house door into the gateway, and I recollect no more, till I found myself in the hospital the same morning—there were three knives used—I threw two away in the passage; he dragged me into the back room before he got the third knife—they were all three black handled table knives.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cabinet maker, living at No. 77, Park-street, Kennington-cross. About half past 6 o'clock in the morning of 24th Oct. heard cries proceeding from the window of No. 35, Park-street, right opposite where I live—I saw Eliza Grinney looking, out of their window—ran across, went into the house, and took hold of the prisoner—I took a knife out of his hand, and <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> it over the bed—after bringing the prisoner out of the front parlour, I went in again to assist the woman to get up—she met me at the door, and fell back against the railings—I afterwards went in and picked up two knives, one where I had <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> it, and the other at the foot of the bed; the bed was on the floor—I delivered those knives to the policeman, Masser—I did not see a third knife—those that I picked up were all covered with blood—they were black handled table knives.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, L</hi> 39). On the morning of 24th Oct., about half-past 6 o'clock, in consequence of being called, I went to the house No. 35, Park-street—I found the prisoner outside the railings—he said, Is that you? I know you, and I will go anywhere with you—I took him to the station—on the way there he said, I hope she will die, I shall be hanged, and then I shall be happy—I produce the knives I received from the witness Smith, at the time I took the prisoner; they are smeared with blood now—I also produce a third knife—after leaving the prisoner at the station I went to Guy's Hospital, and saw the wife—I afterwards returned to the house, No. 35, Park-street, and in searching the premises I found this knife under the bed, in the front parlour, and on the floor in the back room I found this black brooch, covered with blood and hair—the third knife was more discoloured with blood than the others.</p>

I was at the police station on the morning of 24th Oct., between 6 and 7 o'clock—the prisoner was brought there by Masser, who produced the knives—the prisoner said, I only used one—nothing was said to induce him to make any statement—he also voluntarily said, If she is dead I shall feel happy to be hanged for it; and when I had killed her I intended to have cut my own throat—on my saying, Why did you do this? he said, Because she had two men in the house with her all night, and she was going away with them in the morning, and leave me and the children"—I observed that his hands and the sleeves and front of his shirt were all thickly clotted with blood.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon, at Guy's Hospital. On the morning of 24th Oct. I was called upon to attend the prosecutrix—I found a wound between three and four inches long on the upper part of her</p>

               <p>throat, in the middle—on the left side of the throat there were two wound communicating with the central one; they were either the terminations or the commencements—they could not all have been done with one stroke; it was not a deep wound, though there was a considerable amount of hemorrhage—I am speaking of the whole of the wounds—it was all one wound but two commencements or terminations—the edges of the wounds were rather rough, but not very so; they could not have been inflicted by a very sharp instrument—no large vessels were injured—the direction of the wounds on the left side were one up and the other down; they were two wounds, but communicating with the central wound—there was also a contusion on the left cheek, and a little bleeding from the left ear—there was one wound on the throat, but branching off in two directions—there must have been two cuts; I cannot answer for how many more—it was a transverse wound across the throat, branching off one a little up, and one a little down, on the left side—her right hand was very much injured—there were a number of cuts on the palm, one very deep wound on the ball of the thumb, another between the thumb and first finger, and across the fingers—almost all the fingers of that hand were wounded more or less—there was also one wound, not an extensive one, on the back of the left wrist, and several cuts across the palm of the left hand—the wound on the ball of the thumb was between a quarter and half an inch in depth—one finger of the left hand was injured at the joint, in consequence of which she will have a straight finger as long as she lives—the knives produced might have inflicted the wounds—she has remained in the hospital ever since—she has been attacked with erysipelas, but it was very slight—she has had two or three abscesses in the neck, the result of the erysipelas—in my opinion her life has not been in any danger since she has been there.</p>

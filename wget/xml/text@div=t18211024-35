I stood by the table, and the prisoner came from the fire-side and hit me twice. Harris was sitting down at the table; the prisoner struck me and Harris struck him, and then the prisoner struck him a violent blow on his breast, just under his heart. The prisoner was dressed as a sailor. Harris fell from the blow, and was picked up by two men who were there. I had a pint pot in my hand with some beer in it, and I struck the prisoner on the head with the pot. Harris and I then went into the bar - the prisoner went out and came in again in a short time. I was sitting down in the bar and he hit me again, and then pushed Harris against the table in the bar. I do not know whether he struck him. The landlord came forward, took him by the shoulder, and made him go out. Harris was in liquor, but was sober enough afterwards. I had lived with Harris above seven years and a half, his health was always very good; he was taken to the hospital two days after. He worked the day after it happened, and next day I took him to the hospital, as he complained that he could not hold himself up to work; he was a shoemaker, and about fifty years old; he died at the workhouse at a quarter past twelve o'clock last Sunday night.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. What did you tell Crockwell, the constable about this - A. I told him every thing as I have now.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did Harris strike the prisoner before he struck you - A. No. I had no quarrel with the prisoner, he was a stranger.</p>

            . I am landlord of the house. I was not present till Harris and the woman came into the bar. Harris's waistcoat was torn, and he had a scratch on his face, he did not appear much in liquor; the woman was a good deal in liquor. When I first saw Hurley he did not appear to have received any injury, except a cut with the pot over the head. I desired him to leave the house; he said was he to stand there and have his brains beat out, without taking his own part. I said I knew nothing about that, and told him to leave, he went to the door and stood with it in his hand a few minutes, and the woman began to abuse him; he said if she went on he would come and give her a slap - she did keep on, and he turned back and struck her and Harris also, and knocked his hat off; he was sitting behind the table, he was not knocked against the table. I then turned the prisoner out, and he went away.</p>

            . I was not in the tap-room at the first beginning; when I went in Hurley and the woman were quarrelling, she was abusing him - he went across to her and gave her a slight slap on the face - this was in the tap-room - Immediately afterwards the deceased struck the prisoner, and in the meantime the woman threw a pint pot at the prisoner's head, and cut his head open; she said she would go and fetch somebody to take the prisoner away - he struck the deceased one or two blows after the woman threw the pot. I did not see Harris. I saw no more; the woman and the deceased went out.</p>

            . I went in the tap-room with Cormack, he went out before the affair began, and returned again; the woman was singing a song - the prisoner did not approve of it, and said she had been jeering all the evening long - he got up from his seat and told her she had better be quiet - she would not, but used abusive words; he then gave her a slap with his hand - Harris got up and struck him - they had a scuffle together, and the woman threw a pint pot at the prisoner's head. The deceased did not appear to be hurt.</p>

            , ESQ. I am a surgeon. I saw Harris on Saturday last, at the workhouse, he was very ill then, he had been bled at the hospital, and every thing necessary was done. I saw him again on Sunday, between nine and ten o'clock in the morning, he then appeared to be dying, he died that day between one and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182110240019"></xptr>two o'clock. Next day I examined his body. I opened it, and found the last two ribs on the left side fractured; the spleen was in a very diseased and altered state. I saw no external marks of violence. On searching I could not discover any thing that leads me to say the fracture was the cause of his death. I am unable to decide what caused it. The rib was broken in the projecting or convex part, but in such a way that it projected externally, the inner part was comparatively smooth, and had not injured the lungs. It being broken outside, proves that the force must have been applied to the point of the ribs, immediately over where the spleen lay. Such a state of spleen is often found without any injury - the appearance of the spleen was that which would arise from cronic diseases, rather than from a blow recently received.</p>

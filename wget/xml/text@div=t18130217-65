            . On Sunday the 24th of January, I was in Hyde park about four o'clock. I was walking with two or three gentlemen to Hyde-park-corner, towards Stanhope-street gate. When I got to <placeName id="t18130217-65-crimeloc382">Stanhope-street gate</placeName>

I immediately went towards him, and immediately I saw the man give the handkerchief into the hand of another man almost close to him, I immediately seized him by the collar. I looked on the ground, and saw my handkerchief drop from under his coat. I picked it up and held him by the collar. Eaton was the man that I laid hold of. I never quitted him until he was taken into a public-house. I sent for a constable, and he was taken into custody.</p>

               <p>Q. What became of the other man - A. He went away some where. He was not apprehended till the next morning. I am sure I saw my handkerchief in Eaton's hands.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure Grimaldy was the other man - A. I never saw either of them until they were pointed out to me.</p>

            . I am a silk broker. On Sunday the 24th of January, I was walking in the park, a little behind Mr. Richmond, and between us the prisoner Grimaldy was in company with others, among whom was the prisoner, Eaton; the other prisoner. I saw Grimaldy take the handkerchief one of Mr. Richmond's pocket, what became of it I do not know. Afterwards I saw it on the ground.

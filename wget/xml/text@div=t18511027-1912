                  </hi>. I live at Edney-place, Bromley. On 8th Oct. I lived at 17, Duck's-fields—the prisoner lived in the same house—on that evening I was in my room, sitting on a chair, with my head resting on the bed—while I was in that position, the prisoner came and kicked me in the mouth—I awoke up, and saw a knife in his hand—I told him to put it down, and I would fight him fair—I had never quarrelled with him in my life—he put out the candle, and we had a scuffle in the dark—I got away from him, and ran—he followed me as far as the front-door—before I got to the front-door I knew that I was cut in the left cheek, but I did not think it was so bad as it was—I never saw the prisoner again till he was at the station—a man took me to the doctor—there was nobody in the room but my two children.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> When I came home that night, did I not meet you in the court, and did not you come down-stairs and strike my mistress, and knock the child out of her arms, so that she was obliged to fetch a policeman? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; your wife was not in the house at the time—I did not touch her that night—I had to go through your room to go to mine—I was not drunk from Monday till Wednesday.</p>

                  </hi>. On the evening of 8th Oct. I was standing at my own door, which is opposite the prosecutor's—I did not see M'Donald, but I heard him say,"You have struck me with the poker, and now you have a knife in your hand"—these words came from the bed-room where M'Donald lives—I knew him before for eleven years, and recognized his voice—I am certain it was his voice—I saw him when he came down, and noticed that his face was cut, and told him so—I did not see the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of Bromley. M'Donald was brought to my house—he had a severe incised wound on his left cheek—it extended from the angle of the jaw, about four inches, right through the cheek, upon his mouth—it had cut through all the vessels—it was a very serious wound indeed—he had lost a great deal of blood—I should say such a wound would make a person feel sick—nothing but a sharp cutting instrument would have inflicted it.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I left work at 8 o'clock; when I got home I met M'Donald going into the house; a man came into our room; we had not been long in before M'Donald's wife came in, and began to pack up some things to remove; my wife said, "What are you going to do?" he said, "To go away; do you think I am going to stop with such a dirty little w—as that?" he then struck my wife, and she went to fetch the policeman; I got hold of M'Donald, and shook him about the passage, and told him to go up-stairs to his own place; he turned back and got hold of me; I <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> him away, and he fell on the pail, and upset the water in the back-room down-stairs; I did not kick or strike him; I never was in his room at all; I was in my own room from the time of leaving work till the policeman took me; I have worked ten years in one situation.</p>

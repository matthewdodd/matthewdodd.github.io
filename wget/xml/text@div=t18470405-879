                  </hi> I am a warehouseman, and live in High Holborn, On the 14th of March, about ten o'clock in the evening, I was going along Hol<lb></lb>born with my wife and family—I felt somebody at my pocket, turned round, and saw the prisoner close to me—I missed my handkerchief—the prisoner passed me, and went into a public-house—I stood there—in a short time he came out, and I charged him with taking my handkerchief from my pocket—he denied it—I said I was quite positive it must be him, as there was nobody else near me at the time—I rubbed my hand down his clothes, and found he had a handkerchief—I said, "Let me see what you have got"—he begged very hard to go to his father in Long-lane—I said, "No, I am sure you have got my handkerchief"—I insisted on searching his pocket—he opened his coat to show me there was nothing—I said, "Let me see what you have got in your coat pocket"—he would not—some people and two policeman came up—I? <hi rend="italic">dived</hi> my hand into his pocket, and took my handkerchief out.</p>

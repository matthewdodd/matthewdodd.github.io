                  </hi>. The prisoner was in my service—no oats could go out of my place without his knowledge—I saw these oats safe over night, and they were gone about nine o'clock the next morning—I kept the key of the warehouse—the prisoner was entrusted with it night and morning, and very frequently in the day—I have examined the sack and the corn that the officer brought from Johnson's house—they were mine.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer. I took both the sacks from John<lb></lb>son's house—I showed them both to Mr. White, and he identified them—I went in search of Cook, and found him in Whitechapel, unloading some oats—I said I wanted him for robbing his master—he made no answer—I said I should take him into custody—he said, "I know nothing at all about it"—on the way to the station he said, "They are not going to frighten me; I shall say nothing about it; they will get nothing out of me"—I went to a stable in George-yard, and found this sack in the stable, and this in the loft.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you mark these sacks? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Taylor did—I saw him do it—I think it was the 5th of this month, in Lambeth-street—there were other sacks there—he marked two in the middle part—there was no name on those that came from Johnson's—I know them by the back-stitches.</p>

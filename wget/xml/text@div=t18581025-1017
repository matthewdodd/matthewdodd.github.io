                  </hi>. I am chief clerk at Greenwich police-court—in consequence of a complaint which was made there on 1st September a summons was issued against George Dobinson for selling beer in his house before 1 o'clock on Sunday, 9th August—the hearing came on on 4th September, and George Dobinson appeared—evidence was given to support the summons, and the prisoner was called as a witness by the de<lb></lb>fendant—she was sworn on the Gospels by the usher of the court—Mr. Traill was the Magistrate—I took down in writing what she said; this is it (<hi rend="italic">This was to the effect that the prisoner was in the defendant's house, standing between two doors, about 10 o'clock on the Sunday morning in question; that a man came in and asked for some beer, and said he thought there were two officers outside, but that not one drop of beer was drawn, only two bottles of ginger-beer; that one officer came, but that the other only stood at the door; that policeman 69 asked for a pennyworth of tobacco, and when he found they would not sell it he asked for a pennyworth of apples</hi>)—that was read over to her, and she made her mark.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, M</hi> 69). On 29th August, between 11 and 12 o'clock, I went with Edwin West to George Dobinson's shop, Lower-road, Surrey—it is a chandler's shop—we were both in plain clothes—I went in first—I had before that seen eight or nine persons go in between half-past 10 and a quarter to 11—I followed some one in, and saw five persons sitting down and four standing up—I saw the landlord Dobinson draw some beer from a cask in an earthenware jug and put it on the counter—one of the men took it up and drank from it—I then asked the landlord for a penny<lb></lb>worth of tobacco; he said he did not keep it—I asked him for a pennyworth of apples, which he gave me—I saw him draw some beer in another earthen-ware jug, and saw a man tender him some money, saying, "Here you are;" he took the money—I saw neither child nor woman present—I did not see the defendant there, or any family—I let my brother-officer in, and he saw part of what was going on—when I went out I called the defendant out and asked him if he knew he was doing wrong in serving beer on Sunday morning—he said that he did not think there was any harm in serving a poor man with a pot of beer—I also saw him serve a bottle of ginger-beer.</p>

'—I said, "No," and went outside—that was said in Dobinson'a hearing—Marks was not above a minute in the shop before he let me in—the door was not closed after I got in—I did not tell Dobinson when he came outside that we were going to hare a summons out—I knew none of the men—the case came here by Mr. Traill's direction—we were ordered by our inspector to go before the Magistrate at the police-court—that is all the account I can give yon of how this prose<lb></lb>cution was got up—no attorney was employed in it to my knowledge.</p>

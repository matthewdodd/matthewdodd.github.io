                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, B</hi> 163). On Friday, December 30th, about a quarter past 2, I saw Maybank drawing a truck in King-street, Westminster, about twenty yards I should think, from Fludyer-street—Fludyer-street and King-street join together—I saw Fish on the pavement in Great George-street—I followed them through Birdcage-walk till they came to Arabella-row, Pimlico—I then asked Fish what he had got; he said he had got old lead in the truck—I asked him where he brought it from; he said, "I have brought it from 12, Fludyer-street, and I am going to take it to Mr. Nicholls, in the King's-road, Chelsea, to exchange it for some new"—I should think Maybank heard this; Fish was on the pavement, and Maybank was with the truck—I asked Fish under whose direction he was going to take the lead; he said, "Under Mr. Goldsmith's, the foreman"—he said that he was to take the new lead back to Fludyer-street to repair a leakage in the gutter on a roof—before I began to follow them I had seen Inspector Butt, and received instructions from him—I followed them on to Nicholls's, at King's-road, Chelsea—they knew that I did so—when they got there Maybank drew the truck into the large gates, and Fish went into the front entrance to the shop—I did not go in with either of them—after, a time Maybank came out with the truck—the new lead was in it then, I believe, under the board with which the old lead had been covered—I saw it when it was taken out—Fish came out soon after—he had a bill or invoijce of the lead in his hand—he came to where Maybank was sitting on the truck, waiting for him to come out—they went up to the corner of a street,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186001300097"></xptr>
               <p>and said something which I could not hear; and they went from there to the Lord Nelson public-house, where Fish gave Maybank a half-crown for the hire of the truck—he said to me, "Will you have some porter?"—I ac<lb></lb>cepted the offer—I had a pint, and Fish and Maybank had a pint each; it was served in pint glasses—Fish then said that he was going to 12, Fludyer-street with the new lead, and that he would accompany me there, and would call at the station and speak with Mr. Butt, as he knew him from having seen him at the house in Fludyer-street—he then took up a piece of new lead, and put it on his shoulder—he went with me about a mile towards Westminster, to a place called Tyler's—he there said he wanted to ease him<lb></lb>self—he went into the public-house, and called for a pint of porter—he handed it to me, and I put it on the seat just where he had put the lead; and I sat down beside where he had placed the lead—he was gone out to the back yard about five or six minutes—I said something to the pot-boy, and went out to the back yard to see where he was—when I got there I could not find him—a person could have got away that way—I next saw him on the morning of Sunday, 1st January, at King-street police-station—I after<lb></lb>wards took him from there to Kennington-lane—as I was taking him to Kennington-lane he gave me the description of Goldsmith as the person who hired him—he said, "Goldsmith hired me to get a truck to remove this lead to Mr. Nicholls's, and said that he would pay me liberally for my trouble in taking it"—that in all I recollect.</p>

               <p>to Mr. Nicholls—I met Maybank, and asked him if he wanted a job—the person that employed me gave me a piece of paper, on which was written "One piece of 51b. lead, 7 feet 9 inches long, 16 inches wide"—he told me to bring the new lead where I took the old lead from—Maybank and I went to the house and took the lead; the policeman followed us; there was an old board on the top of it—I sold the lead to Mr. Nicholls, and he gave me the money—we went into the public-house, and I gave Maybank 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for drawing the load, and for the hire of the truck; he said 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. would satisfy him. I took the new lead and brought it some distance, and then began to think I was made a dupe of, and went into a public-house, and asked to go to the closet, and went into the back yard, and got over, and got away. I heard of Maybank being taken, and I went with the intention of giving myself up. To the best of my belief, Goldsmith is the man. It was about twenty minutes past I when he spoke to me—Goldsmith says, "It is not true what Fish has said: I was put at Wapping at the time he speaks of."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Fish's Defence.</hi> On Friday, 30th December, I was standing in Parliament-street to see Mr. Trollope's foreman; Goldsmith came and asked me whether I was out on the strike; I said I had been out of work seven or eight weeks; he said he would give me a job of 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; I said I should be obliged; he asked me if I knew Fludyer-street; I said no, but that I could soon find it; he asked me to go to No. 12, to take some old lead away; before taking it I was to go to Mr. Nicholls, the lead merchant, and ascertain the price of old lead and what was given in exchange for it; he took out a piece of paper and wrote, "One piece of lead 7ft. 9in. long, and 1ft. 4in. wide;" he told me to bring it to No. 12; he said, "You will find an old board there which you can put on the top of it;" he told me to pay for the hire of it; he said he had just come from Wapping; I gave the paper to Mr. Nicholls, and left it there with the dimensions which Goldsmith put on it. In Arabella-row the policeman asked me what I had got; I told him, and that I was going to bring some new lead, and gave him the description of the man that sent me. I paid Maybank 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for his hire. I then put the new lead on my shoulder; the policeman said we had better get on a <hi rend="italic">'bus</hi> as he should have to take me to the station-house; this was the first time that I thought I was in custody; he said, "If you had gone over the bridge to the Board of Works, my Inspector told me not to interfere with you." I then began to think that I had been made a dupe of; and effected my escape by going to the back door of the public-house. I came down when I found Maybank was apprehended, with the intention of giving myself up; the policeman came to me and told me that I was wanted; I told him that I understood it. I went with him to the station-house; the case was remanded for six days, as Goldsmith stated that he</p>

               <p>could prove where he was at 1 o'clock, by his bricklayer and labourer that were at work at Wapping; but the bricklayer said that when Goldsmith left Wapping it was between 11 and 12 o'clock, leaving plenty of time for him to be at Parliament-street at 1 o'clock. Is it consistent with guilt that I should go to Mr. Nicholls to ascertain the price of old lead when I could have gone to another lead merchant not one fifth of the distance, and sold it at the same price? The inspector states in his evidence before the Magistrate that when Goldsmith came back to the works at the bridge, it was a little after 3 o'clock, in a very excited state, as he well might be, when he saw the policeman following the truck I was with, knowing himself to be guilty. This is the first time I was ever arraigned at a bar of justice, and I most solemnly declare I am innocent of this.</p>

             is the person who opens the shop in the morning. I kept the key that night myself, and gave it to Joseph the next morning about half-past six o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Does Mr. Watson live in that house in the winter? A. Yes, it is his dwelling-house - he was not there that night; he sleeps in the country in the summer time.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH LESTER. I went to the shop about a quarter before eight o'clock on the morning of Saturday, the 23d of July; I took down the shutters, and carried them into a little court that leads into Ironmonger-lane. While I was so doing, the prisoner Barnett came and asked me the way to the back of the Bank. I told him I did not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150133"></xptr>know what Bank he meant - I had then about three shutters to take down. When I took down the last shutter, he asked me where Threadneedle-street was - he then asked me for London-wall, then shewed me a note, and asked me again for several places, and then for Threadneedle-street again; he then went away, and turned to the right-hand, to the best of my recollection. I then went and got a broom to sweep the shop. When my brother came about nine o'clock, he missed the clock from off the counter. I had not noticed it that morning, but I had the night before - I then went up stairs and got my breakfast. At the time Barnett spoke to me, I saw a man at the corner of the shop, at the top of the passage, with a sailor's jacket on - it was neither of the prisoners; he was standing in the corner as I thought, to prevent my going up, while Barnett was engaging my attention. I have not seen that man since - I did not see any other man. Barnett was with me about three or four minutes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you ever seen Barnett before? A. No; I saw him again when he was taken up, which was some weeks afterwards. I have not been talking this business over with any one. I am not certain which way he went, but think he turned to the right. I did not stand watching the man - I was putting up the shutters, and happened to turn my eye round and saw him. I was at the Mansion House, and I there said positively that it was Barnett who occupied my attention in the court. I have no doubt of him now. That court leads into Ironmonger-lane.</p>

I looked up, and saw two men standing on the iron grating - one of them was Copas; to the best of my recollection the other was dressed in blue, I believe, but I cannot say positively; the men were there a minute or two, and were looking in at the shop window - there were other persons standing there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Where were you? A. I was in the kitchen standing at the ironing board which is about half a yard broad - they were looking in at the window, but they were not close, they stood on the board of the rail way Copas stood rather further back than the other - I saw him again at the Mansion House, in about a fortnight or three weeks afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not they exclude the light from you? A. Yes, but I had seen him before loitering about.</p>

            . I am the wife of Mr. Irwin, a warehouseman - we live in King-street, opposite to Mr. Watson's shop. A little before eight o'clock, on the morning of the 23d of July, I was looking out at the window for my husband, and saw four men about Mr. Watson's - I am certain the three prisoners were there - I saw them for about five minutes - I saw Barnett talking to the boy in the passage - I saw Ward and the other at the window, and Copas standing a little back from the house - I saw Ward go to the court, while the boy was taking down the shutters - when he had took down the shutters, he went into the shop - Ward immediately went into the shop close at his heels, and brought out the clock - Ward and the other one then went away, turning towards Bucklersbury - the other man had his handkerchief in his hand - I do not know what then became of the other two - they might have been there for all I know. I am quite sure of the three prisoners.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I suppose you gave an alarm immediately? A. No, I did not for some time, till I saw my husband - it did not strike me at the moment - I told my husband as soon as he came home - Barnett was at the corner of the court, and I was at the opposite side of the street - it might occupy about two or three minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the men their hats on? A. I think they had - I am positive they are the men.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. At your first examination did you speak to any of them positively? A. At my first examination I did not know where to find any of the parties, but when I knew where to look for them I cast my eye upon that man, and said "I am sure that is the man who was talking to the boy; and I think I have some recollection of the man in the middle."</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath did you pretend to swear to Ward the first time? A. As soon as I saw him I did. I told Mr. Watson about the robbery afterwards, I suspected that they had stolen the clock, and I told my husband of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you suspect any thing before your husband came home? A. Yes, I did, but I did not like to leave my house, having a good deal of property in it. The first time I saw Ward I spoke to his being one of them. I swore to Barnett when I knew where to look for him.</p>
               <p>Q. Now do you mean to abide by the answer you gave me before; that you had so much property in your own house that you was afraid to give an alarm? A. I was so timid I was afraid to give an alarm.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you sign your examination each day? A. No, only on the second - I was not asked to sign it the first time. I said at the first examination that Barnett was the man who detained the boy, and afterwards I swore to Ward.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen him before? A. No, not till that morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not looking at four different persons? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And do you mean to say that, before an individual or two were pointed out to you, that you said "these are the persons;" they were looking into the shop, were not their backs towards you? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. If you saw there were four person there, how is it you can not recollect the faces of more than you do? A. Because my attention was more directed to Barnett.</p>
               <p>Q. How could you see the man when he was speaking to the boy - was his back to him and his face to you? A. No, he was looking about the street part of the time.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. How soon afterwards did your husband come home? A. In about ten minutes; he looked for Mr. Watson immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. How many of the men were in custody at the Mansion House the first time? A. Only two; on the second examination<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150134"></xptr>the three prisoners were in custody - I then pointed out Ward.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You say you saw Ward come out with the clock? A. Yes, he was close behind the boy when he went into the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. What space of time might elapse between Ward's going in and his coming out? A. Not an instant scarcely.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say that you did not know or suspect that any robbery was being committed? A. Not, till my husband came home, and I told him. When I first went to the Mansion House I saw Barnett and Copas - they were standing before the Lord Mayor.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a great crowd? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pick them out from the crowd? A. Yes; the first examination was about a fortnight or three weeks before the second.</p>
               <p>Q. Who directed your attention to that part of the room where the prisoner's were? A. No one pointed them out to me, but when they were brought before the Lord Mayor, I knew the two prisoners, and said, that was the man who was talking to the man in the passage, and Copas was the other - when I knew where to look for them, I knew them.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen them before they were brought before the Lord Mayor? A. No, not before they were charged before the Lord Mayor - on the second examination, I saw Ward, and knew him.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you examined on the first day? A. No, pointed out Barnett to Mr. Watson.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any oath administered to you on the first day? A. Yes, he asked me, if there was any body there that I knew; I said, No; but afterwards, when I saw them standing before the Lord Mayor, I told Mr. Watson that they were the men - the Lord Mayor said almost directly, they had better be remanded.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH LESTER re-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Where had you to go when you had taken down the shutters to get your broom? A. Through the shop along a passage to the pump, which leads down stairs into the kitchen - I was not aware that any body followed me into the shop.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. When Barnett was speaking to you, had he his face towards you? A. Yes; I was in the court, leading down to Ironmonger-lane - I could not see this lady at the window in the court, nor she me - but the man was standing near the end of the court.</p>
               <p>MR. EDWARD WATSON. My house is in the parish of St. Martin's, Ironmonger-lane - the clock was on the counter, within two yards of the door - I was present at the first examination; the prisoners were remanded, because one of the parties was not taken - Mrs. Irwin pointed out Barnett and Copas.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had Mrs. Irwin any question proposed to her at the first examination? A. She was told to look round and see if there was any body there she knew - Barnett was then about three yards from her - she said, there was not any one she could particularize - they were standing before the Lord Mayor at the time.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. What lead her to discover the men afterwards? A. The second witness (Lester), being called, she recognized them, and said, "Oh! these are the men" - I several times attempted to get it heard before the Lord Mayor, but it was postponed to get the other persons.</p>

            . I am a carpenter, and live in Black Lion-square. I know the prisoners. On the 23d of July, about eight o'clock in the morning, I was going down Bucklersbury, and saw Barnett and a man (not here now) together; the absent man had a clock, and a handkerchief tied over the face, which was carried towards him - they were close by the Hope eating-house; knowing them I went into the Green Man, public-house, and inquired if Watts, the officer, was there, and they went on to Size-lane; I could not get an officer. I came out again, and saw the other person with the clock; they went on towards the Mansion House; I ran on to the Mansion House, to try to get an officer, but I could not; I lost sight of them at the end of Bucklersbury - it was then half-past eight o'clock. I then went to the Mansion House again, and gave information to Drinkwater, the officer. On the Saturday following I was in Leadenhall-street, and saw Barnett, Ward, and the man not here, all coming towards the Mansion House; I ran to the Rose and Crown public-house for an officer - I got Mr. Brown and another, and we came running after them, as far as the Mansion House, but they had got away again; after this I heard of their being in custody - I went to the Mansion House, and saw Hesketh, the officer, with Barnett and Copas outside the house. I knew them to be the same men, and told Hesketh so.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Have you seen the clock since? A. No; it was brass inlaid.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. What part of it did the handkerchief cover? - A. Only over the top.</p>

            . I apprehended Barnett and Copas on Saturday, the 6th of August, in Bishopsgate-street. I had had information of Mr. Watson's robbery, and took them to Bishopsgate watch-house, and afterwards to the Mansion House. Kingsbury came and said he knew them.</p>
               <p>BARNETT'S Defence. I know nothing of the robbery.</p>
               <p>COPAS' Defence. I was at work at the time - I am a <rs id="t18250915-354-deflabel1923" type="occupation">bricklayer</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18250915-354-defend1788 t18250915-354-deflabel1923"></join>, and what that woman has sworn is as false as God Almighty is true. The Lord Mayor asked her on our first examination, and she said she knew neither of them.</p>
               <p>WARD'S Defence. As I was going down Whitechapel-road Mr. Lea met me, and told me he wanted me for a crime that he knew I was innocent of. I went to Lambeth-street, and when I had been there about an hour and a half, Mr. Watson and that woman, who looked through the window came, and they neither of them said they knew me; and after the woman had been there half an hour she said she thought I was the person.</p>
               <p>JURY to KINGSBURY. Q. Did you know the persons of the prisoners before that morning? A. Yes, perfectly well. Barnett and the one not in custody had the clock, but Copas had nothing; they were all four there, but on different sides of the way.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Peele, and live in Anthony-street, St. Geroge's On the 26th of August, about two o'clock in the afternoon, my daughter Hannah, who is two years and a quarter old, went out while I was dressing my baby—she had a yellow silk handkerchief on her neck when she went out—she came back in about a quarter of an hour without it—I saw it again the same evening, about half-past five o'clock, at a pawnbroker's.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a brick-maker. On the 4th of March I was in the brick field, near the barn, and about five minutes before one o'clock, I saw Puzey come into the yard with the cart—a little boy was driving it—the cart passed by me—there was no hay in it—I must have seen if there had been any—I remember the day, for the wind blew very rough, and knocked the barn-door against Puzey, and nearly knocked him down.</p>

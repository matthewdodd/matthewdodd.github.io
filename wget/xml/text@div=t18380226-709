                  </hi>. I live at Tottenham. I hung some things out to dry, on the 6th of February, at the back of the house—among other things, there were two sheets and eleven pairs of socks—I was in the garden, and they were all safe a little before four o'clock—I missed them a little before five o'clock—they have been found—I knew the prisoners—I did not see them near my premises—I saw my property again the next day—my garden is surrounded by pales, and partly by a brick wall—whoever took them must have got over the pales or the wall—the property is in Court now—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>).</p>

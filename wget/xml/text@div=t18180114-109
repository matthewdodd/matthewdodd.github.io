She asked me to go up stairs with her daughter, who is the prisoner Briant; I went up, and, not liking the appearance of the place, I wanted to go down, when she struck me several times in the face with her fist. O'Hara came up, and struck me across the breast, and held me while Briant took some halfpence out of my waistcoat pocket. I went down stairs, they followed me-O'Hara demanded 2s. for the use of the room, which I gave her. Briant struck me several times again - I went towards the door, which I found fast. O'Hara, Briant, and Humphreys (whom I had not seen before), came to the street-door, and knocked me down-O'Hara put her knee on my breast, and held me down-Humphries held me also, while Briant took my silver out of my trowsers pocket. I called out murder several times, when she put her apron into my mouth to stop my breath; a great many people came about the door and windows - A young man came up, and called through the window to them; they rose from me-the young man said he would fetch an officer-an officer was brought, and they were taken to Shadwell-office. This was on the ground-floor-the window is close to the door.</p>

               <p>Q. Why did you not call out when you was up stairs - A. I did, but nobody came to my assistance till I got down. I was not in liquor - I lost 15s;</p>

             STEVENS. I am a butcher. I was cleaning my horse in Elbow-lane, and heard a man crying out; being used to hear disturbances at Mrs. O'Hara's house, I did not notice it particularly. After some time, hearing him again, I went to the door, and found it fast; I went to the window, looked through a broken pane of glass, and saw the prosecutor in the act of getting up from the floor, with his mouth bleeding in a very violent manner-his pockets were turned inside out, and his money laying on the floor. I saw the prisoners, Briant and Humphreys, take it off the floor, and carry it to the fire-place, where O'Hara was sitting. O'Hara turned her head, and saw me overlooking her; she gave the other two to understand that somebody was overlooking them, and then they stood still as if nothing had happened. I told them they ought to be ashamed of themselves to treat a man in that way, as not to be satisfied with robbing him, but wanted to murder him. They denied what I accused them of, and used very bad language. I went to Shadwell-office, and got Brown - We went into the house; it is in Elbow-lane, opposite the Ship and Shears.</p>
               <p>Prisoner O'HARA. Q. Was I drunk or sober - A. Sober, and so was the prosecutor. All the prisoners lived in the house.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was sent for, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181801140046"></xptr>took the prisoners in charge. Briant denied taking the money; when I was going to search her she gave me 7s. 6d., which she said she picked off the floor. O'Hara was not drunk, she had been drinking-the prosecutor was perfectly sober; his mouth was cut, and bled much - He was crying; the flap of his trowsers and pockets were torn off. I found 10d. in copper on O'Hara, but nothing on Humphreys. I afterwards learned that O'Hara was spending money for liquor, and went to the watch-house to her, and found 2s. 7d. on her. There were two 3s. pieces among the money which Briant gave me; the prosecutor said there were two 3s. pieces among his money.</p>
               <p>O'HARA'S Defence. The prosecutor came to my house between eleven and twelve o'clock. Humphreys was sitting in a chair - He behaved very rude to her, and made a great noise, which brought Briant down from bed. I told him to go home - He pulled out two 3s. pieces, a 1s., and a 6d., saying he had money, and he would stop. He struck Briant, she got up and struck him - He fell on the floor, and called out murder-the two women picked the money up, and gave it to him - He would not take it, saying there was more, and pulled his pockets out. He laid the money on the table till the officer came - I never touched it.</p>
               <p>HUMPHREYS'S Defence. It is as she has said.</p>
               <p>BRIANT'S Defence. The noise awoke me, I came down stairs - He laid hold of us, and asked us to go up stairs with him. I told him to go home, he struck us, and pushed us about - I pushed him, and he called out murder. He was not sober.</p>

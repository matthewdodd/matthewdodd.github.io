                  </hi>. I live at Woolwich, with my brother John, who keeps a grocer's shop—he had lost money—the prisoner was in his service. On 9th Aug. I marked a half-crown and a five-shilling-piece, and six shillings were marked and put in the till in my presence—after my brother was gone to London I placed the half-crown in the till—it was the only half-crown there—the prisoner came in ten minutes—he went to the part where the till was—I then went to the till, and the half-crown was gone—I followed the prisoner, who had then left to go to the Arsenal, and charged him with having stolen the half-crown—he said he had not—I told him to produce the money he had in his pocket—he produced a sixpence, some copper, and this half-crown—my brother returned, and gave him into custody.</p>

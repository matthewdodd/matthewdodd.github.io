                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker, and live in Broad-street, Ratcliffe—the prisoner was in my service. On Saturday, the 27th of May, I marked 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of silver, about two o'clock, and placed it in a separate por<lb></lb>tion of the till—it was examined between three and four o'clock by my fore<lb></lb>man, and two half-crowns and two shillings were gone—the prisoner had been down into the shop between two and three, and swept the shop—he went to bed about one in the morning—he slept in the shop, and after he was asleep, I found in his trowsers' pocket 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—a half-crown and a shilling of it were marked—I awoke him, and told him I suspected he had been robbing me since he lived with me; that I had marked money, and missed some of it, and found 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of the marked money in his purse—I asked him to ac<lb></lb>count for it—he said it was his own—I said if he liked to acknowledge it, I should set him at liberty, I did not want to injure him—I had produced the half-crown and shilling to him before he said it was his own—he said it had been given to him by his aunt—he had only been, five weeks with me, and received no wages.</p>

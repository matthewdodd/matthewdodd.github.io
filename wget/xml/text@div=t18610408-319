On Friday, 8th March, I stationed Elliott in the Hackney-road, and other officers at the corners of different streets—about 8 o'clock in the evening I noticed a crowd—I ran in that direction and found Smith in custody in a greengrocer's shop—we took him into a public-house as the mob became large—the constable there gave me five paper packets, four of which contained 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each, separately wrapped up in paper, the fifth contained five counterfeit sixpences, each wrapped up in paper to prevent them rubbing—they were all bad—I said, "<hi rend="italic">Phil</hi>, I have received instructions from the Mint to look after you, as dealing largely in counterfeit coin; where do you live?"—he said, "I refuse to give my address"—I said, "We shall find you one; I will take you to 5, James-street, Hertford-street, Haggerstone"—he said, "I am hardly settled there yet"—this was about a mile from Hackney-road—we went to Haggerstone—I left Smith in a cab with one of the officers, and did not take him directly there—I broke the door open, as it was fastened—we proceeded up stairs and met the female prisoner on the middle of the stairs—she knocked my bat off, seized me by the hair, threw herself down, and pulled me down—I went up stairs, and on entering the room I found Joseph Jones in his shirt<lb></lb>sleeves</p>

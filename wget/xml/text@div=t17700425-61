Then we went all out of the house together. I carried them to my room, while I carried the shoes to the coal-shed to ask Mr. Batson whether he knew any body that wanted a pair of shoes; he said he would carry them to his niece, to see if they would fit her: Newland set the price 4 s. he took 3. 6 d. for them.</p>

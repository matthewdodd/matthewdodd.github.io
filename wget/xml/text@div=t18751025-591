On the 12th October, at about 11.45 in the day, I went to a public-house by Tower Hill Stairs—I was in plain clothes—I there saw the three prisoners and the prosecutor Martin—he was drunk and appeared to be asleep—McLochlan was on the right side of him, and the other two on the left—the prosecutor was sitting on a stool and they in front of him—I was outside and looked through the doors and saw McLochlan put her hand in his pocket and take out some coppers—he did not wake up at that—I could see it was bronze, but not see exactly what it was—they then walked to the other side of the room—I waited outside some little time, and they had some refreshment—they then came out, all there together, and I followed them on to Tower Hill and got the assistance of another constable, and I took Kingston into custody and the other constable took the other women—I told her I should take her into custody for pick<lb></lb>ing a man's pocket in the Tower Hill public-house, and she said she knew nothing about it.</p>

She was taken ill on the Wednesday, I believe it was, the 13th; she complained of a violent head-ach; she was not fit do her business; she went to lie down. At night she was very poorly: she got into bed, and was in a violent sweat. The next morning she complained of her head being very bad, and she was in a violent sweat. I ordered her to keep her bed: she continued very bad in her head for two days. On Sunday I went into the room, and perceived a very offensive smell. On Monday I smelt a bad smell in the vault: it caused me a good deal of anxiety of mind. On Tuesday I ordered a candle to be lighted, and went and searched it: I took out several things, and along with them a child. I acquainted my master I had taken a child out of the vault.</p>

               <p>Was it a male or female child? - A female child: it was tied up in a handkerchief.</p>

               <p>Did you examine it enough to see whether there were any marks of violence upon it? - No; I did not perceive any marks of violence upon it: I just tossed the handkerchief over with it.</p>

               <p>Had you any suspicion before, that the prisoner was with child? - Her good behaviour caused me not to have the least suspicion. I never saw a woman behave better than she has done during the time she has served my master. I asked her, if she had borne a child? She said, No. I had not any reason to suspect her being with child.</p>

               <p>Nor now you have not? - No.</p>

               <p>Have you now any reason to suspect that she ever was with child? - No; I have no reason.</p>

               <p>Did you see the child when it was taken out of the vault? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Did you examine it? - No: I saw it in the handkerchief; it was not taken out; the handkerchief was open.</p>

               <p>You the several prisoners at the bar, have been convicted of returning, and being found at large, after the sentence, and within the period of your respective terms of transportation, this is an offence, which in ordinary instances the law punishes with death, and is in your cases attended with peculiar circumstances of aggravation; it is not the offence of a single person quietly endeavouring to elude the laws of his country, and to set himself at large, but the violent combination of numbers to arise on the Captain, to take possession of the ship by violence, and to set themselves at liberty; offences thus aggravated may call for an exemplary and speedy punishment, and the interval allowed you between pronouncing your sentence, and the execution of it may be very limited: You will do well, therefore, immediately to awaken in your hearts those dispositions, which are best calculated to obtain the favour of the Almighty, to turn immediately from an offended and an unforgiving world, to a Being infinitely just, and infinitely merciful, with the recollection however, that his mercy can only be obtained by a just sense of your faults, which is the surest and most sincere ground of true repentance: You will reflect that you will soon appear before one, to whom all hearts are open, and from whom no secrets are hid; at a triburnal that judges from the hidden motives of the heart, and not as human judicatures, from actions and open effects of them! Your repentence and contriction, therefore, must be sincere, with the wish that you may employ the short remains of life, that will be left you to the obtaining everlasting Salvation; the Court pronounces the dreadful sentence of the law upon you; the sentence of the law is, and this Court doth adjudge, that you be respectively hanged by the necks until: your are dead: And may God have mercy upon your souls!</p>

               <p>You, the several prisoners at the bar, have been tried and found guilty, of returning and being found at large after your sentence, and within the terms of your respective transportations; your offences have been attended with very singular, and with very aggravated circumstances, and as they may call for sudden and for speedy justice, the Court have thought it right to single you from the rest of the convicts, and not to defer pronouncing your sentence till the day of the goal delivery; but as your executions may be sudden, to give you as early and as long a time for preparation, as is within the power of this Court; the rest will depend upon his Majesty's mercy. You will consider, that the faults of some of you, are very considerably increased, from your having experienced that mercy already, as the sentence of transportation itself, to some of you, who were capitally<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178309100030"></xptr> convicted, was rather a condition of that mercy, than a mode of punishment: You will consider likewise, that it is not the offence of a single individual, but the offence of numbers who have violently arisen upon the Captain, taken possession of the ship, and in defiance of the laws of their country, and in elusion of its executive justice, have set themselves at liberty: Under these circumstances therefore, it is more than probable, that his Majesty's pleasure for your execution, will be very shortly notified; it behoves you therefore to improve the short interval that is left you, and having forfeited the peace of the world, to obtain the peace of the Almighty: You will remember however, that that peace is to be obtained only by sincere repentance, contrition, and prayers, and that these have no efficacy, unless they are founded upon a just, and in this instance, the deepest sense of guilt. With a recommendation to you, to awaken and confirm in yourselves those dispositions, which are most likely to obtain the pardon of an all just, and an all-merciful Deity, the Court pronounces the dreadful sentence of the law upon you. The sentence of the law is, and this Court doth adjudge, that you be respectively hanged by the necks until you are dead, and may God have mercy upon your souls!</p>

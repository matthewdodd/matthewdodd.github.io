On the 10th of December I went home about half-past twelve or one o'clock at night, and went to bed; I got up at seven next morning, and found that my bed-room window was forced open - it had been nailed up; I found the nails inside were broken; a piece of paper had been pasted over a broken pane - that was turn away; a hand could then be put in, and reach the nail; I missed a frock-coat off a nail in the room, and a pair of trousers from the foot of the bed, which I had pulled off the night before; there was one half-crown, three sixpences, and a pair of gloves in the trousers pocket; I also missed a black waistcoat; they were all safe the night before - I found them that morning at the watch-house - nobody else slept in the room; the window opens inside, on hinges - I found it wide open when I awoke - it was light then. The prisoner was a stranger.</p>

On Monday morning, the 11th of December, about half-past three o'clock, I was on duty in King-street, three or four hundred yards from Crown-court, which is in the parish of St. James - the prisoner passed me on the other side of the way, and turned own Hayes-court; seeing something concealed under her shawl I stepped up to her, and said,"What have you got here, mistress?" she said a coat<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182701110006"></xptr>and trousers; as I took her to the watch-house she desired me several times not to take her, and said if I would not it lay in her power to do me some good; when we got to the watch-house I found she had this coat and trunsers tied in a handkerchief, in a rumpled manner, and also a towel; there was a half-crown, three sixpences, and a halfpenny in the trousers pocket; she said a man named Rusby gave them to her in Crown-court, and three minutes afterwards she said his name was Burn; I do not know any persons of those names.</p>

            . This coat and trousers are mine; the gloves were in the pocket; the towel was in my room, but it belongs to John Graham, my landlord - there is some blood on it, which came from my nose.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He met me in the court, and took me up to his room; he tied up these things, and gave them to me, saying he was going into the country, and should return in six weeks, and would call for them - that he had earned but 3s. 6d. that week, and was going to the country. I desired the watchman not to take me, not being accustomed to such things.</p>

             re-examined. Mine is a first floor back room; there are some long leads lead along under the window; I do not know how anybody could get on the leads, except through the window of another house, or out of the yard; I could get on the leads - they run up close against the window. Mr. Graham let me in that night, and saw me lock my room door.</p>

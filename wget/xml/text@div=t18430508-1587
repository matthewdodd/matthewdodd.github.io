                  </hi>. I am a widow, and lire in Bedford-street, Commercial-road. My mother, Ann Rix, is eighty-nine years old, and lives in Temple-street, Hackney-road—she engaged the prisoner to attend on her—I think that was in July last—I called on my mother on the 11th of April—the prisoner was there—my mother told me to take something out of her drawer, upon which the prisoner put down the broom that she had in her hand, and left the room, and went out of the house—I went to the drawer, and missed, a great many things—she sent a packet to my mother the same day, containing twenty-one duplicates—on the 20th of April, I saw her at her daughter's house, in Widegate-street—she asked me how my mother was—I said, "You have almost killed her; what led you to steal the things?"—she said, "I don't know what impelled me, but I will pay you by instalments"—I have since seen the articles mentioned in this indictment—they are my mother's, and had been formerly in her drawers—she is not able to come here.</p>

I am in the employ of Mr. Kelly, a pawnbroker—I produce a variety of articles, which have been identified by Mrs. Dymond—they were pawned by the prisoner—I took in die whole of them, and have seen the duplicates which I gave her—these things were pawned between the 14th of Nov. and the 4th of April—the most valuable article is this silk, which was pawned for 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., on the 3rd of Jan. last.</p>

I am barmaid at the International dining-rooms, Fenchurch-street—on 15th August, between 4 and 5 o'clock, Howard came for a bottle of ginger beer, which came to threepence, and gave me a shilling—I gave him ninepence change, and kept the shilling in my hand—he had got to the door, when a policeman came, brought him in, and said, "What did he give you?"—I said, "This shilling," it was still in my hand, and I gave it to him—I had seen Page before that, and I think it was that morn<lb></lb>ing I found a bad shilling in each of the tills—I gave one to the police<lb></lb>man and the barman gave him the other.</p>

I am barmaid at the American Stores, 55, Fenchurch-street—on 14th August, between 3 and 4 o'clock, Howard came in for a glass of beer, and gave me a shilling—I bent it in the detector, and then bent it straight again, gave it to him, and asked him if he was aware it was bad—he said, "No"—he paid fur the beer and took the shilling away with him—about half an hour afterwards he came again for a glass of beer—I cannot swear to Page, but a man came in to pass a bad shilling at the same time, though Howard came in alone—I believe Page was in the house at the same time—Howard paid me with threehalfpence, and then left; that was about 4 o'clock—a policeman afterwards brought him back, and asked if I had seen him in the house before—I said, "Yes."</p>

On 15th August, in consequence of information, I waited outside the American Stores, and at half-past 4 we saw Page come out—he joined in conversation with Howard, who was out<lb></lb>side, and they walked up Fenchurch-street—Page crossed over to the Inter<lb></lb>national dining-rooms—when he came out, he spoke to Howard, who went in, while Page stopped outside, and afterwards went in again—I met the officer Morgan, who went to the International dining-rooms, and, as he went in, both the prisoners came out, and walked towards Lombard-street—I followed them, and told them to come back with me—Page said, "What is amiss?" I said, "Come back and see"—I went back, spoke to Miss Paull, and asked her whether she knew the men—she identified Howard or Page as passing this bad shilling (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which she handed to me—I took them to the station, and found on Howard ten sixpences, seven groats, six threepenny pieces, and fourpence, a small bottle, and some pins, two of which have obscene pictures in them—they had been drinking, but Page was more sober than Howard—the barmaid gave me another bad shilling.</p>

On 15th August, about half-past 4 o'clock, I was in Fenchurch-street, nearly opposite the American Stores—Ruttle called my attention to the prisoners, who were walking along Fenchurch-street in company near me—I watched them—they were near the American Stores, and walked towards Gracechurch-street—I followed them to the corner of Lime-street—they stood by the door of the Inter<lb></lb>national luncheon-bar, which is at the corner—Page went in and came out, and then Howard went in; they then both went in and came out, and I watched them up Fenchurch-street—I went into the Stores, said some<lb></lb>thing to the barmaid, came out, followed them with another constable, overtook them, and took them back to the public-house—Miss Paull identified Page as having passed a bad shilling, and I took them to the station—going along, I took them into the American Stores, and the barmaid, Stiff, said she believed they had passed bad money there, but would not swear to them—going to the station, a gentleman said that Page had dropped something, and gave me these two shillings (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—Page heard that—they were side by side, but Page said nothing—he was searched, and</p>

I saw Page, whom I had never seen before, and asked him to direct me to Lombard-street; I gave him a glass of beer, and then he said, "I will go and have a glass at my own expense, I see you have had too much already;" that is all I recollect.</p>

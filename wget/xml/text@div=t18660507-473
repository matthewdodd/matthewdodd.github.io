I am a labourer, and live in North-passage, Bethnal<lb></lb>green—on 25th March, between 8 and 9 o'clock, I saw the deceased, William Webb, inside the passage of a house where toys are made—he was drunk—I knew him before—I heard him say that he wanted some money—that was said to Mr. Webb, the toy-maker—I don't know whether he was his brother or not—I saw that person try to put him out of the house—he would not go—he up with his fist to strike him, and caught the panel of the door instead—the prisoner came up directly afterwards, and said he would soon have him out—he did get him out, and when he got out he took off his coat on the edge of the kerb, and offered it to somebody to hold—nobody would take it—the prisoner then up with his fist, and caught the deceased in the chest, and knocked him down—he fell as if he was dead—his head went on the edge of the kerb—there is a little opening where the water runs down—a young man got hold of his arm to help him up—the prisoner said to him, "What have you to do with it?"—the prisoner then went away—I helped to carry the deceased to the doctor's, and from there on a stretcher to the police-station—I saw blood come out of one of his ears—that was after he had fallen.</p>

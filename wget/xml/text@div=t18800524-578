                  </hi>. I am a widow, living at Dash wood Road, Battersea—on 29th April I was returning home down the Wandsworth Road—at the corner of Brooklands Road the prisoner threw me down and took my bundle of clothes—we struggled—I called out "Murder!" and "Police!"—he took me by the throat and threw himself on to my chest—I saw him stopped by a railway policeman—he had the bundle with him when he was given into custody—I recognise the articles as mine.</p>

I was on duty at Nine Elms on the 29th April, at the entrance to the Locomotive Department, Brooklands Road—I heard screams and a cry of murder—I went outside the gate—I saw the prisoner run under a lamp with a bundle in his hand—I tried to stop him, but he gave me the double—I ran him in and asked him why he had been ill-treating the woman—he said "She has been thieving, and three constables on the embankment have set me on to watch her; she has stolen property, and it is under her clothes"—I said "What is this bundle you have got?"—then the woman came up and said "Look what he has done to my eye"—there was a mark on her cheek—I took the bundle from the prisoner—she said "Give him in charge"—I said "I am not a metropolitan policeman, but I will hold him while you get one."</p>

                  </hi> I live at 8, Grove Yard Rails, Woolwich—on 24th July the prisoner passed my house with a female about twelve o'clock—he returned shortly afterwards and said, "Are you going in doors? "—I said, "What for? "—he said, "I will give you something to drink"—he put his hand in his pocket and said, "There is a <hi rend="italic">bran</hi> few shilling for you"—I said, "Somebody is taking you in, this is bad," and I put it in my mouth and bent it—he said, "I have plenty more money," and gave me six shillings more, saying, "I shall expect to stop all night for that"—I said, "They are all bad; you must be a rogue to give me money like this"—he said that he had changed a sovereign in Beresford Street, and asked me to give them back—I said. "No"—he said that he should give me in charge for robbing him—I said that I should give him in charge, I stopped the police, and gave the money to the bombardier—this is the first shilling he gave me—I know it because I bent it.</p>

                  </hi> I am a bombardier in the Artillery quarters at Woolwich—on 24th July I was on duty and met the prisoner at Rope Yard Rails about a quarter to twelve o'clock—he was not going towards the barracks—when he saw me coming he stood with his back against the wall—I walked up and asked him if he was on leave—he said he was—I told him to show it to me—he said that he was on leave for seven days, and had lost it—West came up and said, "See what he has been giving to me," and produced one shilling first and then six shillings—I asked him how he accounted for it—he said he had changed a sovereign in Powis Street—that is 150 yards from Beresford Street—I asked him to show me the place—he said that it was no use, he could not find it—I only found a halfpenny on him—on the way to the barracks he said that he lived in Cambridge Cottages—all soldiers who live there have a cottage of their own—I left him with a picket outside, went in, spoke to his wife, searched, and found a spoon and a piece of metal, answering to the description of this money, a little powder, a small bottle, the contents of which I do not know, several pieces of old rag, a piece of glass stained with powder, and a piece of zinc—they were on a top shelf, covered with some clothes—the prisoner said that he knew nothing of the spoon or the zinc—I took him to the guard-room, left him there all night, and next morning went to the Royal Artillery canteen, and received a bad shilling, which I gave to the constable.</p>

                  </hi> I am a corporal of the Royal Artillery, employed at the Woolwich canteen—I did not know the prisoner before 18th July, when he came there about nine in the evening for half an ounce of tobacco, and gave me a bad shilling—I asked him if he knew it was bad—he said, "No"—I asked him where he got it, he said, "From the pay-sergeant"—I told him he would have to wait and see the manager of the canteen, and while I was going round the counter he disappeared—I marked the shil<lb></lb>ling and gave it to the constable.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am a draper, and live in Commerce-place, North Brixton, in the parish of Lambeth. On the 18th of May the prisoner came to my shop to look at some linen, between one and two o'clock—he wanted nine yards, but he took the piece, which was eighteen or twenty yards—he bought a dress and a silk handkerchief—the amount of his bill was 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I made him out the bill, and he gave me this cheque—I asked his name—he gave me George Knight at first—I asked where he got the cheque from—he said he took it of a man in the Clapham. road, named John Smith, he had cashed it for him the day before, and he was a stone-mason—the day before was the 17th, and the cheque was dated the 18th—I asked him his name again, as I was going to write it on the back of the cheque, and he said, "Cross"—he left—I went out, leaving orders, that if the prisoner came again, he was to be given in charge—I put the cheque into my cash-box—my sitter was in the shop when I went out—my cash-box was locked, and she had the keys—when I returned I found the prisoner had been given in charge with the cheque—I saw it in the hands of the policeman at Union Hall—my sister's name is Mary—this is the cheque the prisoner gave me—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—here is my writing on it—it has not been altered since he gave it to me—the amount is 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., for which the prisoner said he gave 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—on looking at the cheque, I see I must have made a mistake—he must have first given me the name of Cross and then Knight, instead of what I said before, because I wrote the last name on the cheque, and here it is—I have written George Knight on it—I then told him Knight was not the first name he had given me, and he said it was—I then went out to ask my neighbours if there was such a person as John Smith, in Clapham-road—I could not learn that there was any such person—while I was out I discovered the date of the cheque, which I did not notice before—and when I came back I asked the prisoner when he took the cheque—he said, "Yesterday"—I told him that could not be, as it was dated that day, 18th of May—he said he did not know when it was dated, that was when he took it—he said, "You don't suppose a person could forge such a thing as that, do you?"—I said, "Yes"—said, "It is all right, you may depend on that"—I asked where he lived, he said, "With Mr. Childs, on Brixton-hill"—I asked how long he had lived there—he said, "Three months"—he said he would leave the cheque and call again the next day, and I was to ascertain whether it was right—he went away, leaving the cheque with me—I put it into my cash-box—I do not think my sister was present—she keeps the key of my cash-box when I am out—I did not let the prisoner have the goods—my sister is not here.</p>

                  </hi>. I was a policeman, but have resigned since for an<lb></lb>other situation. I took the prisoner into custody, on Saturday the 19th of May, about a quarter to two o'clock, at Brixton—he was in the road, walking up and down in front of Mr. Blackburn's house with a horse and chaise—be-fire I took him into custody I got the cheque from Mr. Blackburn's sister in the shop, and have produced it—the prisoner was pointed out to me—I went up to him first, and asked him if his name was Cross—he said, "Yes"—I said he must go with me to the Brixton station-house—he said, "what for?"—I said "For attempting to pass a forged cheque"—he said, "It was not forged"—he said. "I can neither read nor write; how can I forge?" and that he got it from a man living in the Claphain-road—I did not tell him that it would be better for him to confess what he had done, or that it would be worse for him if he did not—he told me that he met the man, who lived in Clapham-road, against Whitechapel church, and the had been to two or three shops to try to get change, and as he was in a hurry, he had given him. 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the cheque, which was all the gold he had—about this time we had arrived at the station-house, and I left him there—I brought him from there to Union Hall the same day—I did not hold out any threat or promise to him—as we came back, the first words he uttered to me were, "This is a bad job; it will take my character away, or else transport me"—I said, "Oh, there are many people charged with things, and not guilty, not till they are pronounced guilty by the Court"—he still wanted to talk with me on the subject, but I did not wish to have further conversation, and turned the subject.</p>

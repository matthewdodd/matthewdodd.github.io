                  </hi>. I am a builder, and carry on business at Teddington. The prisoner was in my employ, on and off, ever since February last—he is a wheelwright—on the 26th of November I had information—I got a search-warrant, and went to Twickenham with the officer to the prisoner's house—I there found a quantity of ironmongery, wood, and other articles—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—I can swear to part of them, but we have left a great deal at the prisoner's place—these pieces of wood I can swear to, they are called "fellies"—the prisoner had no authority</p>

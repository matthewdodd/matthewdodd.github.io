                  </hi>. I am a walking-stick manufacturer, and live in Cornwall-road, Lambeth; the prisoners were in my employ. In conse<lb></lb>quence of something I heard from Collier, I marked three dozen sticks be<lb></lb>longing to a man named Martin, of Norwood—he had sent me three bundles, and I was to select three dozens, and the rest I was to keep—I marked the sticks with a star punch, and put them in one corner of the work-shop, and in about two days I missed some of them—the prisoners had no right to dispose of or to take them out of my house.</p>

On the 3d of August, at about four in the afternoon, the prisoner with two other women came into the shop and asked for a glass of gin; I gave it to her; she offered me a bad shilling; I refused it; she then offered me another; I refused that; she put down another, and then another; there were four bad shillings on the counter together; I then took them all up, upon which she desired one of the other women to give me a sixpence; she gave me one and that was bad; she then threw down a parcel of money for me to take my choice; I found they were all bad. I thought it was not proper she should have them again; I took them to my mistress, and she sent for a constable who took her into custody; there were seven bad shillings and two bad sixpences; I was informed the constable found a good sixpence upon her.</p>

               <p>I am a misfortunate girl of the town. Last Monday week going through Fleet-street, a gentleman asked me to go with him; I went into Shoe-lane, and he made me a present of this money? I went to the Boar's Head in Fleet-street, and staid all night; the next morning I was going with two other women to buy me a pair of shoes, and we called in at this shop to have a glass of gin; I gave him a shilling; he said it was bad; I gave him another, and he said that was bad; I then said good God, have I two bad shillings! and threw down the rest of the money; I did not know that they were bad.</p>

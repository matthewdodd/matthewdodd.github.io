               <p>On the evening of the 9th of Dec. the prisoner came and ordered a quarter of oats—he said he came from Mr. Taylor, cabinet-maker, Southampton-row, and bad been recommended to come there by his master, who had been recommended from some one else who knew Mr. Neville, to purchase a quarter of oats, that his master had lately been dealing with Mr. Shuker, at 26<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a quarter, and understood he could get them cheaper at Mr. Neville's—I took him round to the mill, and stated the case to my master, who received the order from the prisoner, and desired me to give him 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which I did, and booked the order.</p>

                  </hi>. I am carman to Mr. Neville. On the evening of the 9th of Dec. I went with my master's horse and van to carry the quarter of oats to Gloucester-street, Queen-square—I stopped at the bottom of Gloucester-street, and knocked at the gates—the prisoner made his appearance at the same side of the way the gates were on, and said, "I think you will have to go round to the shop, young man; the men are gone; they leave at eight o'clock"—it was then about half-past eight—I asked where the shop was—he said, "No. 8, Southampton-row"—I asked what trade they were—he said, "Cabinetmakers"—he went with me to the corner of the court, at the Queen-square end, and told me to turn to the left—I asked him to give an eye to my horse—he said he would—I went to No. 8, and found no Mr. Taylor—I had to go from No. 20 to No. 8—I afterwards returned to Gloucester-street, and the, horse and van, the two sacks of oats, and the prisoner, were gone.</p>

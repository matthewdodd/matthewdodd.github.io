                  </hi>. I a private in the 2d battalion of the Scotch Fusileer Guards, stationed at Windsor; the deceased David Tarbett was in the same battalion. On 28th Dec, I was in London with him, on leave of absence—on 28th Dec. we were in Rosemary Lane, about 3 o'clock in the day; we were coming from the Commercial Road towards Queen Street, and saw two women fighting, one had a child in her arms; I interfered with them, and said not to strike the child, when I was collared by a mate of the prisoner's—Tarbettat that time was standing by; he did not do any thing—when I inter<lb></lb>fered, I merely put up my cane between the two, not to have any fighting;</p>

               <p>the prisoner was not there at that time—I was caught by the coat, my epau<lb></lb>lettes torn off, and I lost my cap—I took off my belt, and struck the pri<lb></lb>soner's mate with it over the head, when I was overpowered with the crowd—Igot out of the crowd into the street again, and saw my companion knocked down in the street by a hammer; I saw the hammer thrown; that was near the close of the affray, when I got out of it—Tarbett had not been doing any<lb></lb>thing during that time—it was the prisoner who threw the hammer, he came out of a tinsmith's shop, he was about eight paces from the deceased when he put his arm up—I cannot say whether it was thrown above hand or under hand; in the excitement of the affray I could not exactly say; it struck him on the right side of the head above the ear; it was a small iron hammer; the prisoner did not say anything at the time he threw it, in my hearing—I was not above four yards from the deceased at the time he received the blow—Tarbettfell—he got up on his feet again, and I afterwards took him to a Burgeon's, and had his head dressed—we went to a public house, but he did not drink any thing; I then parted with him, he was going home to his friends—I did not see him again.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Hurley, of No. 125, Rosemary Lane. I know the prisoner and his wife—On the afternoon of 28th Dec. I was in Rosemary Lane with a child in my arms coming up towards my own door; a woman came up and asked me whether it was my child, I said, "Yes"—she said, God help me, I had enough to do—I was just telling her that I had buried a fine girl, when another woman came up and struck me—thenthe soldier came up, put up his cane, and said, "Don't, mistress," or "mother, don't strike the woman, with a baby in her arms"—then the crowd all gathered away from me, and I could not tell what happened for a good bit—the soldier who lifted up his cane did not strike any body that I could see—I do not know not know whether any body struck him or not, at that time, not till a good bit afterwards—I saw one blow given by the prisoner on the soldier—I could not tell where he came from—he was close to the soldier at the time he struck—he struck him with a hammer on the head—I saw him put up his hand—I only saw one cane—I do not rightly know whether the other soldier had one.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

(<hi rend="italic">The deposition of David Tarbett was read as follows:</hi>—"I am a private in the 2d battalion of the Scotch Fusileer Guards, stationed—I was on three days leave, from Thursday, 24th Dec. last—I went to London—on Monday, 28th Dec. last, I was in Rosemary Lane, near the Tower of London—I was going home towards Queen Street—Robert Steele, a private in the same battalion, was with me—Isaw two women fighting; one woman was striking another with a child in her arms—Steele interfered with them to quiet them, and a man went to strike him—I stepped forward to protect my comrade, Steele, and was trying to get him away, when some man behind me struck me on the side of the head with a hammer; the blow made me insensible—there was a great crowd round the man now present—Patrick Riley is very like the man who struck me, but I cannot positively swear to him."</p>

                  </hi>. I am battalion surgeon to the Fusilier Guards at Windsor—Tarbett was admitted to the hospital on 2d Jan.—he was in a state of partial insensibility—I examined his head; I found a wound there nearly healed—from the symptoms, I considered it necessary to enlarge the wound, and I then discovered a fracture of the skull—after the operation of trephining was performed he recovered his sensibility—he continued to do well until within two days of his decease, when he became worse, and died on 26th Jan.—in my judgment a blow from a hammer would cause the appearances I found on the skull, and that blow would cause death—the injury to the skull was the cause of death—I examined the head after death—I was present at the examination by the Magistrate—I saw this policeman there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> On what day did you perform the operation of tre<lb></lb>phining? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On the day of his admission, the 2d Jan.—I do not know what course of living he adopted from the time of the injury to the time of his admission—he was at Windsor—It would have been possible for him to recover from such an injury without any operation at all, supposing he had lived carefully and had abstained from drinking—the operation of trephining is one of the very last resort; it is an operation which is mostly fatal—I did not think, at the time this operation was performed, that it was one attended with very considerable danger to the patient; but I considered that the case was one of imminent danger, and had not the patient been operated upon he would have died—it is an operation which is frequently fatal; it would be doubly dangerous, and most probably end mortally, if he had been out drink<lb></lb>ing previously; that would add to the danger—he died from abscess; that is a common result of inflammation—he died on 26th Jan.—that would be twenty-four days subsequent to the operation—I am able to state that death did not proceed from the operation—the abscess was seated some distance from the seat of the operation.</p>

               <p>any opinion that he had not lived carefully, or that he had been drinking? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am ignorant of that; it was a question of possibility, put to me, as I understood; the injury to the skull might possibly have been cured without trephining, and, with that view, abstinence from drink and careful living would have been necessary.</p>

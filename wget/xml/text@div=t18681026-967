               <p>New Road—we occupy the top room, and the prisoner and his wife lodge in the next room to us, on the same floor—they came there on 17th March—about a week after they moved in, the prisoner's wife was taken very ill, and I attended on her and made their acquaintance—I persuaded her to have medical advice, and Dr. Babbage was sent for—his assistant came—she was then suffering from spasms, and the prisoner came in, very intoxicated, pulled her out of bed, and kicked her violently on her shoulders and chest, and also on her left thigh—I got her out of the room, and took her into my room, and there she lay till 2 o'clock in the morning, when she went into her own room, and I heard no more disturbance—but in the morning, between 8 and 9 o'cloek, she had a bruised eye, which she had not got when she left my room—I have seen him strike her a very great number of times—once he threw a jug full of water at her, and it caught her in the back—that was on Thursday, and she died on the following Monday, 21st Sep<lb></lb>tember—I heard a great disturbance on the Saturday; the prisoner came in very drunk, and I heard her say, "Oh! George, don't, you are killing me"—I did not see him strike her, but I heard him say, "If you do not soon die, I will throw you out of the b—window;" and he used very bad language besides—I saw her on the Monday morning, and was with her all day, from 8 o'clock; she was in bed—she was very bad, and had a very bad cut on her ear, and was bruised very much on her right side—she seemed scarcely able to draw her breath—she died that day—she also had a cut on the elbow—she shook hands, and said that she was dying—she did not seem able to take anything, or to sit up in bed—I sent for Mr. Babbage, who came and saw her—on the Saturday night the prisoner asked her for some money; he said he wanted 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to go out and get a woman, as she was not fit for him—she gave him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and he said, "That is no use to me; if you do not give it to me, I will throw you out at the b—window."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of the New Kent Road—on Tuesday, the 15th September, the deceased came to my surgery, she appeared to have a cold, and was rather feverish—on Friday, the 18th, I saw her again; she was no better, and was still feverish—she did not complain of pain—I did not know of any ill-treatment then—on the Monday afternoon, I was fetched to her lodgings—she was in extreme pain, in her stomach from <hi rend="italic">peritonitis</hi>, and her end appeared to be approaching very fast—a motion was shown to me, which was very dark, and contained blood—I made a post-mortem examination, and found that the cause of death was perforation of the bowel, and <hi rend="italic">peritonitis</hi>—there was a wound on the left car, and a small wound on the right elbow; the back part of the left thigh had the appearance of a bruise—there was congestion of the vessels of the surface of the brain; in other respects the brain was healthy—there was adhesion of the heart to the <hi rend="italic">pericardium</hi>, showing that inflammation had taken place, followed by adhesion; there was adhesion of the lungs to the <hi rend="italic">pleura</hi>, and there had been congestion of the lungs—the heart was filled with black blood—the liver was in a diseased state; it was softened; I could easily crush it in my hand—there were patches of inflam<lb></lb>mation on the mucous coat of the stomach, internally, and some ulceration—there was perforation of the intestines, and the contents were escaping through it into the <hi rend="italic">peritoneal sac</hi>: that must have arisen from inflammation, ulceration, and bursting, but there was nothing to indicate that.</p>

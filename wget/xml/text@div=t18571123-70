                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Rich; we live at No. 15, King Street, Golden Square, in the parish of St. James, Westminster. On 23rd Oct. I went out with my husband, about 1 o'clock in the day—I locked the door of my first floor front room; I left nobody in it—I locked the room safely and took the key—I returned with my husband at a quarter before 3 o'clock—I did not notice anything on opening my room door, but as I was going to light a fire I saw a box open, and I found some things had been taken out of it—they were all safe when I went away—I lost seven gowns, two shawls, three mantles, nine waistcoats, and other articles, worth together about 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there are only four of the gowns here; these are mine—these two shawls are mine; two mantles were mine; they were given up to me, and are at home—these other things are mine—these waistcoats have my husband's name and address on them; I identified one shawl when Watts had it on—Atkins has one of my scarves round his neck now.</p>

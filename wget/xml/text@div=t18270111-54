On the 29th of December, about six o'clock in the evening, I was in the room behind the shop, and was called; it was quite dark - I went into the shop, and found the patrol there, with the prisoner in custody; he said the window had been cut, which I found was the case - it was safe a quarter of an hour before; I minded the prisoner while the patrol went out, and brought in a wire; a small piece was taken out of the glass, and I missed a pearl ring, worth 40s., which was safe a quarter of an hour before, when the glass was entire - a person could have drawn it out with that wire - it has never been found; the prisoner said he knew nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Would you not sell it for 40s.? A. No; it was worth 50s. to sell; I had looked at every pane in the lower part of the window a quarter of an hour before - I did not offer to take 4l. to make this matter up.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 29th of December, I saw the prisoner and three others at the prosecutor's window; the prisoner had a piece of wire in his hand, putting it through the corner of a square of glass - I secured him; two of the others were on his right hand, and the other on his left - they went away immediately - I took him into the shop, returned, and picked up the wire which dropped from his hand, and gave it to Camper.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How near were you to them? A. I was at his shoulder when I saw him with the wire - I took him in the act; two other persons saw this - they are outside - I believe Jarrett was one of them - they might have seen me if they liked; the prisoner's back was towards me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wheelwright, at 47, Bridge Road, Mortlake—on 3rd June, at 11 o'clock at night, I was passing the Victoria Theatre, coming from Waterloo Station—I went into a public-house and had one glass of ale—as I was passing the theatre, three men came up to me—one of them seized me by the throat, in front—I could not see who they were then—I felt my chain snatched away—one of them gave me a knock on the knee, and knocked me down—Gains came up, and said, "What's the to-do, gover<lb></lb>nor?" and I said, "All right," and he walked away, and I followed him till I met a constable, and I gave him into custody for robbing me; Cliff came up when I gave him into custody, and I said, "You are one of the parties connected with it," and the policeman took him—Cliff was standing within three yards of me when I was robbed—I was rather excited, but not the worse for liquor—some of the prisoner's friends have been speaking to me about the case—I know that the prisoners were connected with the robbery.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Gains</hi>. I was in the theatre, and it was not over till 11.50. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. The persons were coming out of the theatre as I passed.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman M</hi> 99). I was on duty in Friar Street about 11.30 on the evening in question—the prosecutor came to me, and pointed Gains out, and gave him into custody for stealing his chain—the prisoner said, "I thought so," in a tremulous tone of voice—as I took him to the station, I turned to see if the prosecutor was following, and I saw the prisoner Cliff—he was afterwards brought to the station.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman M</hi> 92). I saw the last witness taking Gains to the station, and a crowd following—as we got near the Winchester Music Hall, the prosecutor called out, "Stop thief!" and I saw Cliff running—he was eight or ten yards off—I stopped him, and the prosecutor gave him into custody for robbing him—Cliff said he knew nothing of it.</p>

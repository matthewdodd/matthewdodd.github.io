B.," to my rooms, and showed them to me—I gave those articles out of my room to whoever came for them—there were no other things brought at the same time—she brought me a toilet-cover, these baskets, and these ornaments—this footman was brought afterwards—I do not know whether this is the cap—she brought one to me, which I wore once or twice—this may be it—(<hi rend="italic">putting it on</hi>)—she lent it me for one day—she brought it, and took it away with her—it was something like this—this may be it—she brought these dusters and doyleys to me—she said they belonged to her mother, and my toilet-table was very bare, and she said she would give me these things—she said, "You have not these things yourself; I will bring them to you, and lend them to you"—she only said <hi rend="italic">lend them</hi>—she brought them under clock, about her person—she came afterwards to visit me, and saw them on the table, and on the Saturday night, about three weeks or a fortnight before I went before the Magistrate, she came to demand them—I said I could not give them to her now, for one was at the wash, but I would send the things I had to the gate between twelve and one o'clock—I was at dinner, and said I was engaged, and would send them on Monday—I had no quarrel with her between the time of her bringing them and this time—I parted good friends with her, and shook hands with her at the door—I did not suppose. she had taken them from any body but her mother—She said she hade made the cap herself—she did not tell me she had made it for her father or brother—she showed it me, and told me to wear it on the promenade that afternoon—I returned it, and she put it under her dress when she went away—I shook hands with her at the gate, and she took the cap back again—I passed as plain <hi rend="italic">Henry Player</hi>—I was called Henry Herbert Player—I have passed as Lieutenant Player.</p>

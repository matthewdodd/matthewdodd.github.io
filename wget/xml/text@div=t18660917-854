                  </hi>. I am a labourer, living at Barking Road, Essex—on Saturday night, August 25, about half-past eleven, I left Stratford with about seven other men, of whom I only know Johnson—I was going home—they walked some distance with me—Johnson then walked a step or two before me, and struck me in the face twice with his fist—I fell, and he said, "Get up; you are as drunk as a pig"—a gentleman was coming along, and I got up and walked with him about twenty yards—he then left me, and I went on to the Barking Road—I got about 200 yards further, and Johnson came and said, "If you do not give me 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I willl knock you about and take your life"—I said, "I have not got 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I was knocked down a second time by Johnson, and one of the boys sat on my face while the others put their hands in my pocket, and took out my purse and 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in coppers, a knife, a ticket, and a bootlace—there were seven persons round me when I was robbed, but I only know Johnson—I know Harris by sight; he was along with them—I do not know what he did because some got on my face and some on my legs—I afterwards identified Harris at the station as one of the men who had been attacking me—Johnson and I had had a pot of 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. ale together—the officer showed me a knife at the station—the men all ran away but Johnson—he remained with me and Driver—he said that he had not interfered with me, but Driver said that he had—I gave information to the police, and gave Johnson in custody—Driver is a person who heard that I had been knocked down, and came back to me.</p>

I am stationed at West Ham—on Saturday night, 25th August, I took Harris, coming from the spot, with his jacket turned inside out—I sent him to the station, and went on, and the prosecutor gave Johnson into my custody—the prosecutor had been drinking, but appeared to be suffering from being knocked about—he charged Johnson with knocking him down, and stealing a sove<lb></lb>reign from him—he said that Johnson demanded a shilling of him, which he refused to give him, and that Johnson then struck him two blows on the face—he identified Harris at the station as one of the boys who had assaulted and robbed him—Mason was covered with blood, and he had a black eye—he had been drinking, but he knew perfectly well what he was about—I found on Johnson 4 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and two knives, one of them the pro-secutor's, and on Harris some coppers.</p>

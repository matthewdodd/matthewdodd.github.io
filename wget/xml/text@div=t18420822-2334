                  </hi>. I am nineteen years old next March, and live with my father, at Bexley-heath, Kent. On the 25th of July, I came up to Lon<lb></lb>don by the barge, and saw the prisoner in Ratcliffe-highway, by Tower<lb></lb>hill—I went with her to a house, and staid with her—I gave her 15<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184208220117"></xptr>
               <p>afterwards left that house with her, and went to another house—she asked me to sleep there—I said I would not, I had somebody waiting for me outside, and I should not like to stop ail night—she pressed me to stop all night—she asked me How much money I had—I said 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—she said that would do—I went home with her—there was a sailor at that house, a wo<lb></lb>man, and her daughter—I had a glass or two of beer with him—the sailor asked the prisoner if she had got 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she said I was to give him 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I threw down 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he took 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out of it, and she picked up the change—they asked me to drink, but I would not—the prisoner, the woman, and I went up stairs—I and the prisoner remained alone, and went to bed—she asked me what she should do about any more money—I said I did not know, I had no more with me—I took off my clothes, and laid them on the table—about four or five o'clock in the morning the prisoner got up, and went away—I got up about eight or nine, and missed my jacket—the pri<lb></lb>soner came back afterwards—I asked her for my jacket—she said it was in pawn, and she put the ticket into my band—I went, and informed the policeman—this is my jacket.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker in Charles-street, St. George's-in-the-East. This jacket was pledged at my shop on the 25th of July, in the name of Ann Coffey, by a girl of the name of Coffey—the prisoner was with her—this is the ticket I gave her.</p>

They were together when I gave them the ticket—I could not observe whether they came in together—the other woman gave roe the jacket, and received the money—they were both toge<lb></lb>ther then—I did not observe the prisoner at first.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I apprehended the prisoner, and asked her what she had done with the boy's jacket—she said he had given it to her, and she had pawned it for 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., at Mr. Carpenter's, and the prose<lb></lb>cutor had got the duplicate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. The person of the house took the jacket, and pledged it; the prosecutor had only 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and that he threw down on the table to send out for some drink; the landlady fetched drink; I told him to come out, that she would hot let us sleep in the house; he would not do so, and we went up stairs; there was nothing but <hi rend="italic">rowing</hi> all night; they brought the jacket down stairs, and I would not pledge it; another woman pledged it; she had another man there, and she took the two jackets together; the landlady sent me after her to see that she did not go away with the money; the other woman was present when the jacket was taken, and Was the cause of its being taken.</p>

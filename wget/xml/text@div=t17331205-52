The Prisoner, Brown, and I lodg'd at White's (an Alehouse ) in the Grainge-road ; the other Prisoner, Whitlock, met us there on the 25th of October, and between one and two in the Afternoon we went over the Water to Rag-fair, to see for Long Will. but not meeting with him there, we went to Stock's-market, where we took Coach, and drove to

            's in Tyburn-road ; Gascee keeps a Brandy-shop; we called for some Cherry-brandy; Brown said to Gascee, Now, Jack, if you will go with us, we may make ourselves for ever, and never want again, for we are going to rob the King's Jeweller. Says Gascee, I wonder you will ask me, when you know I have been unfortunate, and am now got into a little Way of getting my Livelihood! Well, says Brown, do you know Long Will.? What, Will. Blackwell? says Gascee. Yes, I know him very well. I wish, says Brown, you'd send to his Mother's, and see if he is there. I'll step myself, says Gascee; but just as he was going, Long Will. came in. So we went up Stairs together, and had a 3 s. Bowl of Punch. We told Long Will. We were going to rob the King's Jeweller. Damn it, says he, I have got no Arms. Why, says Brown, you shall have my Pistol, and I'll take a Cutlace. When we had drank out the Punch it was seven a Clock, and then we all four (the Prisoners and I, and Long Will.) went to the Jewellers. We saw a grating there that we did not expect. Damn it, says Whitlock, I have often served the House with Poultry, and never saw this Grate before. However, he knock'd, and a little Woman came to the Door; he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173312050027"></xptr> ask'd her, if Madam De Batt was within? She said, No, she was gone out; and so finding our Design not bearable there, we went away again. Damn it, says Brown, now I think on't, here's an old French Gentleman lives hard by, and we can tune him easily; and upon that we went to Colonel

            's, Brown put back the Bolt of the outer Gate, we went to the Door, and knock'd, the Colonel himself came and open'd it, I clapp'd my Foot between the Door and the Threshold, and we all forc'd in; Brown with a Cutlace, and Whitlock with a Pistol, struck the Colonel on the Head, and knock'd him down; we took a gold Watch out of his Pocket, and a Ring from his Finger. The Maid came up from below with a Candle in her Hand, I suppose the Noise had alarm'd her; Will. Black-well went to her, and ask'd her, where the Plate and Money was? She told him, she had not liv'd there long, but believ'd they might be above. I and Whitlock, took the Colonel with us, and went up into his Room, and rifled it; we went to break a Trunk open, but he said, Don't break it, I have the Key in my Pocket. We search'd but not finding it, he felt in his Pocket himself, and gave it us; We took out twelve silver Forks, seven Knives with silver Handles, one of them was a small Knife, thirteen silver Spoons, one great silver soop Spoon, eight or nine silver Pennies, a quarter Guinea, some Necklaces, and other Things; then we tumbled the Beds upside down, a pair of Shoes with silver Buckles stood in the Window, and we took the Buckles out; we open'd the Chest of Drawers - the Drawers open'd, one to the Right-hand and the other to the Left, and took out a Parcel of Linen, and Woman's Apparel.</p>
               <p>Court. Where was /Brown ?</p>
               <p>
            Mitchell. He was sometimes above and sometimes below. He came up to see how we went on. And row and then gave the Colonel a knock and a Damn, and said, You old Rogue, where's your Money? We left the Colonel, and went into his Daughter's Room (as I suppose it was) broke open the Drawers, and took out a Parcel of Head-clothes, and two pair of Scissars, with a Silver-case. Thence we went into the Maid's Room; but finding nothing there, we went into another Bye-room, where was a Trunk and a Box; we broke them open, and took out of the Box, two Gowns and Petticoats. We thought to find some Money in the Trunk, but there was only a soul Shift and 2 or 3 Napkins, which we left there 'till we had searched the other Rooms. We went down to the Colonel, and threaten'd him hard, to make him discover where his Money was; we bound his Hands to his Backside, and going down to the Entry, at the Foot of the Stairs, I saw Blackwell buttoning up his Breeches, and the Maid lying with her Coats up. God damn you for a Rogue, says I, you ought to think of something else, at such a time as this. Brown told me, he had found nothing below but seven Tea-spoons. He hit the Colonel on the Head, and putting a Case-knife to his Throat, said, Let's kill him! I swore he should not, for it was enough to rob him, and I would never be concern'd in Murder. And the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173312050028"></xptr> Maid said to him, Don't kill my Master, rather kill me. In a Back-room we found some Wine; and Brown said, there were some Ribs of Lamb below. We sat down, and eat and drank what we thought fit, and then going to get our Goods together, we happen'd to see a little Closet; says Brown, I'll be damn'd if his Money is not there. But upon search, we found only a pair of Pistols, and a Silver-hilted Sword with a Green-belt - I think it was Green; says Brown, these will be of Service to us, and so we took them. We pack'd up what we had got, in several Bundles, and went to see how the Colonel and his Maid did. By the Way we spy'd a Cupboard. with some Tea and Coffee in it. Says Brown, My Wife drinks Tea, and I'll take this for her. Then each Man taking his Bundle, I went out first, and left them to lock the Door. And Brown, when he came to me told me, that he had lock'd it, but whether he did or no, I cannot tell. We went into the Fields, and thinking it was too soon to venture into London, we sat down upon our Bundles, and staid till we thought the Watch were gone off. Then we parted, Blackwell and I went to the Water-side, and took a Boat to Pepper-Alley, and walked from thence to White's, at the Grainge, by six in the Morning. I knock'd at the Door, Brown's Wife look'd out; I told her, her Husband was coming, and while I was speaking, he and Whitlock came to the Door. White got up, and draw'd us two Pots of Beer; I shew'd him the Tea, and said, Is not this good Tea? We have had good luck to Night ; for he thought we dealt in Run Tea and Brandy. His Wife, my Wife, Brown's Wife, and we all Breakfasted together with this Tea ; they said it was very good, and they had never drank better. After Breakfast, we shar'd the Goods, Blackwell had six Shirts, and two Shirts, for his Share of the Linen, and he sold his Share of the Silks to me, and Whitlock, and Brown, for 14 s. a-piece. I and the two Prisoners left him, and went to sell the Plate to

            , at the Ship Alehouse, in the Old-baily ; Whitlock staid at the Cock, in the Old-Baily, and only I and Brown went to Bodenham's, for I knew Bodenham would be scrupulous of buying the Plate, if we all three went together; Well, says Bodenham, have you got any thing for me? Yes, says I, Here's a gold Watch. He look'd on it, 'Tis very old, and worn, says he, What's the Price? I told him sixteen Guineas. It is not worth near that Money, said he, for I must get something by it, and you know how things are as well as I. At last we agreed for eight Guineas. He ask'd us, what we had got else? Then he took us into a little Room, where he Tutors his Watches; he weigh'd it, said there was eighty Ounces, and ask'd us, what we must have? Says I, 4 s. 6 d. an Ounce, you know what you use to give.</p>
               <p>Court. How came you to say so?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. Because I had sold him Plate before. At last he agreed to give us 24 l. for the Watch and Plate all together, and we took it, because we knew not where else to dispose of it. He did not pay us directly, but said, we must stay an Hour; he call'd a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173312050029"></xptr> Coach, took the Plate with him, and in about an Hour return'd, and paid us the Money: But, says he, I have had a hard Bargain, and when you come again, you must use me better. So to make him amends, I gave him a silver Buckle, set with Bristol Stones; we drank a 3 s. Bowl of Punch, when that was empty, we call'd upon Whitlock at the Cock, and went back together to White's, where we found Blackwell. We shar'd the Money, 6 l. a-piece, and I call'd for some Beer, Damn you, says Blackwell, let's have some Punch; White brought a 3 s. Bowl; it was then about four a Clock. When we had drank it out, Damn you, says Blackwell, I must go over the Water, but I'll come again; but we never saw him more. About two Weeks after, I and my Wife went to Bodenbam's, with this Mourning Ring; he said it was very light, and he could not afford to give us above 5 s. for it, and we took the Money.</p>
               <p>Court. What became of the Pistols?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. We kept them for our own Use.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you those Pistols when you were taken?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. How were you apprehended?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. I and the two Prisoners took Horse at the White-Horse-Inn, in Westminster, about seven in the Morning (I forgot the Day of the Month, but it's within these three Weeks) we rode directly to Fulham, over the new Bridge to Putney, so to Kingston-Bridge, and thro' Hampton-Court, to Stains, where we din'd. There a Man, who knew Whitlock, happening to come in, Damn me, says Whitlock, we shall be blown if we stay here abouts, for this Fellow knew me when I was try'd in the Country. Upon this, we alter'd our Design, which was to rob Whitlock's Uncle. We rid to Black-River - or Black-Water, I don't know which you call it - We met a Man on Banstead-Heath, says Brown, Let's tune him. No, says I, our Horses are tir'd, and we shall lose our Night's Rest. We put in at the Swan, in a little Town, where we lay; in the Morning we went to the next Market-Town, drank there, rid thro', and return'd in the Evening to meet the Farmers as they came from Market; but we got only a pair of silver Buckles: We proceeded to Farnham, lay there, and next Day went for Guilford; we intended to take the Farmers as they return'd from thence in the Evening, but while we were in Town, Brown said, he was afraid some Body would know his Mare, and so we should be blown. So we went to Godlirnan (Godalrnin) where we baited, and coming out of our Inn in the Evening we met a Man, who ask'd us which way we were going? We said, for London, and he pass'd us. I'll be damn'd, says Brown, if this Man has not got Money ; we look'd after him, and saw him upon his Knees, we thought (as it prov'd) he was tying his Money in the Tail of his Shirt, Brown follow'd with this other Pistol, and stopp'd him, the Man, who was a stout Fellow, seiz'd the Pistol, struggled with Brown, and run off; but we came up with him again, took two Bags, in which was about 6 l. from him, and then ty'd him, and rode towards Guilford, but fearing to be pursu'd, we turn'd up a Bye-road, and passing by the Green-Man, we saw two<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173312050030"></xptr> Men drinking at the Door. We rode a quarter of a Mile, and waited for them; when they came up, we stopp'd them, bound their Hands behind them, took 21 Guineas from one, and 1 Guinea, a Knife, and a Tobacco-box from the other. A little farther we met a Butcher's Boy, from whom Whitlock took a few Half-pence, and a silver Buckle, which he had in a Bag, and then we rode on for London. But before we got to Kingston our Horses tir'd; mine, indeed, was in a much better Condition, for I had chang'd Horses with one of the Countrymen we had robb'd. However, before we enter'd Kingston Town, we turn'd our Horses all loose in a Turnip-field, and went to the Bell, and enquir'd for a Waterman; the People said, they believ'd we should hardly find a Waterman that would go so late; but at last a Woman brought one to us, who offer'd to go for 6 s. we agreed for 5 s. and to find him Beer and Brandy. We went into his Boat, lay upon the Straw, and cover'd ourselves with the Tilt; we soon fell asleep, and slept 'till we came to Putney, when two Boats clapp'd along-side of us, and some Men jump'd directly into our Boat, and took us napping. I ask'd for the Constable, surrender'd myself, was carry'd before my Lord Palmerston, examin'd, and made an Evidence.</p>

On the 25th of October, about eight at Night, I heard somebody knock; my Maid, who was below, not going to the Door, I took a Candle and went myself; as soon as I had open'd it, a Man rush'd in upon me, seiz'd me by the Shoulder, and swore, if I made a Noise he'd shoot me dead; he was follow'd by three more, one of whom struck me on the Head with a Cutlace, I cry'd Murder! Help! and call'd to my Maid, Veron Curtis - Veron call my Men! bid 'em bring my Pistols, in hopes to have made the Russians believe I had Men in the House, but they did not regard it. Damn him, says one, beat his Brains out; and presently I receiv'd a Blow on my Head with the Butt-end of a Pistol; the Blood follow'd a-pace, and I fell to the Ground. They rissed me; took a gold Watch out of my Pocket; I lost a Ring from my Finger, but, being in a Surprize, I don't know how it went. I had in my left Fob fix Guineas and a half, in a Purse, which I thrust under the Matt by the Door. They brought my Breeches down to my Knees, to search me, and took away some Silver, I can't say how much, but I believe there might be 15 or 16 s. They ty'd my Hands behind me, and two of them dragg'd me up Stairs, another holding me by the Shoulder, with a Pistol in his Hand, to make me shew them where my Money was - They bid me be hush, or they'd shoot me.</p>
               <p>Court. Did they all three stay in your Room above?</p>
               <p>Colonel. I think so - I think one held me, and two search'd the Room. They first open'd a Trunk with a double Cover; there was a Box in it with Plate; they took the Box out, but did not open the upper Cover, within which I had 45 Guineas and a half. I still deny'd telling them where my Money was, in hopes they would not find it; upon which they again<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173312050031"></xptr> struck me on the Head with a Pistol - They open'd a Press, and threw some Things out; they took two Pistols out of the Closet - these are the same - and a silver hilted Sword with a green Belt. One of them said he'd break the Hilt off, but another said, No, there was no need. They carry'd me into another Room, where they broke open another Press, but I did not see what they took out of it. Then they made me go down with them, and at the Foot of the Stairs I saw my Maid sitting on the Ground, with part of her Coats up, and a Man rising from her, and putting up his Breeches. They ty'd my Hands so hard to my Back as put me to great Pain. They plac'd me by the Maid; put a Napkin and the Maid's Petticoat over my Head, so that I was almost stifled - Some of them went into the Parlour, and up Stairs - One, coming down again, gave me several Strokes, and said, O you old Rogue, you said you had no Money! Another laid his Hand on my Head, and put something under the Petticoat, which I thought was a Hanger, but Mitchell says it was this Knife.</p>
               <p>Mitchell. Yes, this is the Knife, and it was Whitlock that put it under the Petticoat.</p>
               <p>Colonel. I begg'd them to loosen my Wrists, and thought one of them was going to do so, but he only took the Buttons out of my Sleeves. As my Head was cover'd, I could indeed hear them walk about, and speak to the Maid, but could not distinguish what they said. I remain'd thus in the greatest Misery 'till three in the Morning, when hearing no Noise, I told the Maid I believ'd they were gone. She said, Hush! don't make a Noise! they are not gone yet. They certainly are, says I, have not you the Use of your Fingers? She said, she believ'd she had. I bid her see if she could not untie my Hands. She said, her own Hands were not quite at Liberty, but she would try what she could do; and so she did, but it was near a quarter of an Hour before she could loosen the Cord. But, Sir, says she, for God's sake don't stir yet, for I am afraid they are not gone; God has preserv'd your Life hitherto, and why will you run the Hazard of losing it at last? However, as I believ'd they were gone, I went into the Passage, and saw a Light in the Fore-Room, but nobody was there. I found the Door drawn to, but not lock'd, and the Key was left on the Rail without Side. I bolted the Door, and desir'd her to call for Help, but she said, she did not dare go yet, for fear they should kill her. I went myself to a Closet-Window, call'd to a Gardener, and told him what had happen'd; he promis'd to come, but did not, tho' I call'd him again. The Maid was fearful of being left alone, and follow'd me about the House, wherever I went.</p>
               <p>Court. Look on the Prisoners, Sir, - Do you know either of 'em?</p>
               <p>Colonel. I did not then know either of them, but, on Recollection, I believe Brown was the Man who held me - I can't say that I remember any thing of the other. I saw but four in all, and for the other three, I mostly saw their Backs - two of them went before me with a Candle.</p>

               <p>Mitchell. You were sometimes up, and sometimes down - Sometimes you held the Colonel by the Shoulder, and sometimes you gave him a Knock with a Pistol.</p>

            . Between eight and nine somebody knock'd, as my Master said, tho' I did not hear it, but I heard the Dog bark, and listening, heard the Door open, and presently my Master cry'd out Murder! come up, Veron, and call the Men. I went up, and found him lying in the Entry all over in a goar Blood, with four Men about him. I know Whitlock - he in the grey Waistcoat, was one of them. Another of them, who was a tall Man, stept up to me, took me by the Hand, and swore, if I spoke a Word he'd shoot me thro' the Head; Whitlock had a naked Hanger in his Hand, and he (I think it was he) ask'd me where the Plate was? I told him I was a new Servant, and knew of no more than six Spoons and Forks that were in the Kitchen. They rifled my Master, and ty'd my Hands behind me, and three of them took him up Stairs. The tall Man staid below, and ask'd me where the Candles were? I told him, in the Kitchen; and if he would let me have my Hands loose, I would fetch some. No, he would not do that, but carry'd me down, and made me shew him where they were. He took some, and lighted one at the Fire, and taking me up again, carry'd me into the Parlour, where he set me in a Chair, with my Hands ty'd behind me, and abus'd me in a gross Manner. Whitlock afterwards came down, and us'd me as ill as the other had done - I saw but four Men in all.</p>
               <p>- Court. What do you know of their Eating and drinking?</p>
               <p>Curtis. I had dress'd a Neck of Mutton, part of it was left. There were three Bricks in the House, and a Pound of Butter; they eat the Mutton, and best part of the Butter, and two Quartern-Bricks; and one of them said, he'd go and carry a Bottle to the Man that held their Horses.</p>
               <p>Whitlock. Did I go up?</p>
               <p>Curtis. I think they all went up, but the tall Man, who took hold of me first; and when Whitlock came down, he and the tall Man kept me Prisoner in the Room by Turns.</p>
               <p>Whitlock. You said I seiz'd you first.</p>
               <p>Curtis. No; the tall Man seiz'd me, and Whitlock came up with a naked Hanger, and swore if I would not discover where the Plate was, I should be shot. A quilted Petticoat that I had been working, was put-over my Master's Head, and I had a white Handkerchief round my Head. Whitlock said, the best Way would be to kill the Master, and gag the Maid, and he took a Knife to cut my Master's Throat. For God's sake, says I, don't kill my Master, but rather kill me; and the others preventing him, Why then, God damn them, says he, gag them both down close.</p>
               <p>Brown. Did not you deny me when I was brought to Newgate?</p>
               <p>Curtis. It was duskish then, and I could not see very well, but as soon as I had a Candle, I said to the best of my Knowledge you was one of the Men I saw in the Entry when I first came up.</p>

               <p>Curtis. I said, if I knew any Thing of you before, it was the Day before Michaelmas, when you came to our Door with a Couple of Geese, and I shew'd them to my Master.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you believe him to be the Man who brought the Geese?</p>

            . The same Night the Robbery was committed, Mitchell and the two Prisoners were at my House, and call'd for a quartern of Cherry Brandy. Brown ask'd me to go out with them, and said, we should never want Money afterwards. I told him, No; for tho' I had seen a great deal of the World, I was now got into another Way. Then he said, it was no Matter, and ask'd me if I knew Long Will. What Will. Blackwell? says I, Yes, I believe he's at his Mother's, hard by. He desir'd me to send for him, and while we were talking about it, Long Will. Came in; they shook Hands with him, went up Stairs together, had a 3 s.

In two or three Weeks after, I went and lodged at White's, and Mitchell lodg'd there at the same time; He was in a great deal of Trouble, and said, he wished I would go to such and such Places. I told him, I had stain'd my Character already, and did not care to bring my self into a Scrape again. He told me, he had been in a great many Concerns himself, and if he was taken, he was sure to be a dead Man, and therefore he would swear any Man's Life away to save his own, for he did not care who he was an Evidence against.</p>

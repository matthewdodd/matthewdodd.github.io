                  </hi> I live at No. 151, Bishopsgate-street, and am a cheese-monger—the prisoner was in my service. On Tuesday, the 24th of Aug., I cleared out the tills, and emptied four tills into the one with a look—I disco<lb></lb>vered two shillings between the till and the bowl—I expected they were put there for some improper purpose, and I marked them before my wife, and put them there again—I have seen them since in the policeman's hands.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What time were you up the next morning? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About seven o'clock—I marked the money on Tuesday night—I did not examine the till until Wednesday night—I then found one shilling was gone, and on Thursday morning the other shilling was gone—the prisoner had been in my service about nine months—Ray had been in my service five or six weeks—I do not know that the prisoner was about to leave—I do not know that he had an offer from some cheesemonger near me—he has never told me that people have complained to him about short weight—people have not complained to me—I cannot account for my men when I am out—I have been three times fined for short weight—sometimes we are busy when the jury come in, and there is sometimes more draft in consequences of the wet—the weights are not short, it is from the scales—I pay the man for adjusting the scales, and we cannot alter them—there are no bowls to the scales—on the Wednesday night I found one of the shillings was gone, and the next morning I called the young men at half-past six or a quarter to seven o'clock—they got up—the carman was down first, and the prisoner next—I went for the policeman, and called the prisoner in—I said to him, "If you will acknowledge the thing, I will not give you into custody"—I said that once or twice—I did not say it half-a-dozen times—he said he had nothing to confess—I did not call him back when he was going out, and say I would forgive him, Mrs. Carr did—I did not have the cellar searched, nor did Mrs. Carr—the policeman went down into the cellar, and searched—I do not know who told him to go down, I think he went without my telling—nothing was found there—the prisoner was then at the station—the porter had not been</p>

               <p>in the cellar before the prisoner was taken to the station—he was in the cellar afterwards, cleaning the tools—I went down and searched the cellar with the policeman, but we did not search every hole and corner—it is generally the porter's duty to clean the tools—if he were out, the boy might do it—I am not aware that I have ever attributed to Ray that he has robbed me, or sug<lb></lb>gested that I had lost things, and thought he had taken them—I do not remember anything of the sort—I will swear I have not suspected him, to the best of my knowledge—I do not think I have—I have never talked to Mrs. Carr about suspecting him—a number of persons serve in my shop—we do as much business as we can.</p>

                  </hi> I am the prosecutor's wife—I was present when he marked some shillings on the Tuesday evening, and on the Thursday morn<lb></lb>ing I saw the prisoner take a shilling out of the crevice of the till with a knife—I am sure of that.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You are quite sure? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I saw the shilling after it was out of the crevice, on the top of the bowl, while the prisoner was at the till—the shop was not open—it was quite light—we have a win<lb></lb>dow at the top of the shop—the till is about half a yard from it, pretty close under the window—the shutters were not down—the fanlight is over the door, and there is a very large skylight over the shop, which gives a very great light—I was examined before the Magistrate—this is my signature to this deposition—I did not say I saw the shilling in the prisoner's hand—I saw him take it out with the knife, and saw it lying on the top of the bowl<lb></lb>very likely I did not tell the Magistrate I saw the prisoner take the shilling out—(<hi rend="italic">the witness's deposition being read stated</hi> "This morning I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner go down stairs softly, go behind the counter, draw out the till drawer, I saw him using a knife in the crack of the till; he then went to open the door")—I made the same statement then that I do here—I saw him take the shilling out which the knife, and saw it on the bowl—I was on the staircase—I had not seen Ray that morning: he did not come down for a quarter of an hour after I saw the prisoner go to the till—I did not see Ray go down to the cellar—I do not attend to my husband's business—I have not expressed myself strongly with respect to Ray—I have never said to the prisoner that Ray took soap—I may have said that they used a good deal of soap—Ray did not suit us—I did not know that the prisoner had had an offer to go to another shop—there has been no complaining of short weight—there have been charges against my husband about short weight, but he was not deserving of them.</p>

                  </hi> I am porter to Mr. Carr. On Thursday morning, about ten minutes before seven o'clock, I went down stairs from my bed-room—I went with the prisoner into the shop, and then down stairs to fetch up some cheeses—he fetched the first two, then I fetched two, he fetched the third two—I swept up the shop—I then went down into the cellar, and there was a tub, and I saw some saw-dust on the board the money was on—I hit my head against it, and that made a jink—I drew out the board, and there were these three shillings.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

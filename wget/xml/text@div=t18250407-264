On the 4th of April, the prisoner whom I have known for some years, came into my house with a Mr. West; he stayed there about an hour and a half - I saw him go out running, but did not see anything in his hand; I followed, and saw him running - he turned round a street to Carnaby market - he there fell down - I assisted him up - and when I returned, I found the till down in the passage of the bar - it was safe about five minutes before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was it not lying on the counter? A. No, it was in its place, the prisoner had been drinking and appeared a little intoxicated.</p>

            . On the night of the 4th of April, the till was safe about half-past eight o'clock; the prisoner had been there some time - in two or three minutes afterwards I heard a running in the passage - I saw the till being conveyed over the counter by the prisoner, and then it either fell down by accident or purposely; he did not move off with it, but when it fell, he ran off immediately - he was very tipsy.</p>

               <p>Q. I believe you are servant to Mr. Sudlowe? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you live with him the 22d of last month? - Yes, I did, I was in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179507010060"></xptr>Laundry, at the top of the house, when the bell rung; hearing the bell ring I came down stairs; when I came down one pair of stairs, I looked down the stairs over the banisters (it is a wall stair case) and I see Mrs. Moore in the passage, and the prisoner going down stairs, I see her within five stairs of the passage, going down I said to Mrs. Moore, did you see a woman with a child going down stairs? she said, yes. I ran after her, I overtook her in Pudding-lane, I took hold of her arm, and asked her what business she had up one pair of stairs, No. 4, Monument-yard, at Mr. Sudlowe's.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the one pair of stairs? - The dining room. She said she went to enquire after one Mr. Williams, an attorney.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any such person as Mr. Williams, at No. 4, or in any other part of the Monument-yard? - No, such person. She came back with me, and I left her in the care of Mrs. Moore, and went up stairs to the dining room.</p>
               <p>Q. From the time she was in the stair case to the time you took her, did you ever lose sight of her? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you go up to the dining room? - To see if any thing was missing, because I knew there was plate there. I missed three silver table spoons and two salt spoons.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately before had you seen them in that room? - A quarter of an hour before.</p>
               <p>Q. You are quite sure of that? - I am.</p>
               <p>Q. In what condition did you find the salt cellars themselves, and the other furniture of the table? - I found that two of the salt cellars were emptied of their salt, and the salt laying at the dining room door, chucked out.</p>
               <p>Q. Having made these observations, what became of you? - I went down stairs immediately, and on going down I heard some spoons rattle, the noise of the silver spoons falling.</p>
               <p>Q. How near might you be to the prisoner at the time that these spoons fell? - I met her coming up the kitchen stairs; Mrs. Moore was sitting in the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of hearing this a search was made? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when they were found? - Yes; they were found at the bottle rack, three table spoons and two salt spoons, at the foot of the stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that near the situation where the prisoner had placed herself? - Yes, it was; she went down stairs while I went up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. I understand you to say, that as you went down the dining room stairs, you met her coming up the kitchen stairs? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe it is the same in Mr. Sudlowe's house as it is in many other person's of business, that on any person's knocking they are let in by the clerk in the office, by a string that fastens to the lock; so then if they have business in the office they go into the office, if they have business in the house, they go into the house? - Yes, it is.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the office on the right hand or left hand side of the passage? - On the right hand side.</p>
               <p>Q. Can any person in the office see who comes into the passage? - They cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. May or may not a person, going into Mr. Sudlowe's, get admittance into the dining room without seeing any person in the house? - They may.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. How many persons are there in the house besides yourself? - Only one, the Cooke and myself; we were both washing in the laundry.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Sudlowe's street door is kept shut? - It is.</p>

            Had you ever seen this woman in the house before? - Never, nor any where else.</p>
               <p>Q. You have no reason to suppose that she had ever been there before? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. You say it is necessary to knock at the door, and one of the clerks opens it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe she told you that she had been enquiring for a Mr. Williams at the house? - She made no enquiry.</p>
               <p>Q. The Cooke is not here? - She knew nothing of it; she was up in the laundress, and heard nothing of it, till it was all over.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you did not observe any person till there was a ring at the door, the induced you to look down, and there you see Mrs. Moore, the laundress? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You held no conversation at all with the prisoner in the house? - None.</p>
               <p>Q. You followed her, and she came back with you immediately? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. She told you she had been enquiring for a Mr. Williams, an attorney? - She did.</p>
               <p>Q. There are a great many Mr. Williams about town, you know, It had been a quarter of an hour before since you had seen these things, and therefore who had been there you cannot tell?</p>
               <p>Mr. Vaughan. Whose name is on the door? - Mr. Sudlowe's.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this in the day? - About one o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. I would ask you how long this whole transaction might have taken up? - About half an hour.</p>

               <p>Q. I believe you were at the house of Mr. Sudlowe's, on the 22d of June? - I was.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time of the day was it? - About one o'clock. I take in clear starching; I see the prisoner at the box there; I see her come down stairs out of the dining room. When I came first to the house, I went to the kitchen stairs and called out for Etty, the maid; the street door was open; I called out Etty; nobody answered; the servant not answering the call, I went to the street door and rang the house bell.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not go up stairs? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, how soon after you had rang the bell, did you observe the prisoner at the bar? - Momentarily; as soon as it was possible to come down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ring the bell for the purpose of seeing the servant, as she did not answer to your call? - I did.</p>

               <p>Q. As soon as you rung, you almost see the prisoner at the bar. From whence did she proceed? - Apparently from the dining room; I could not see the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she come down the stairs leading from the dining room? - She did.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she any conversation with you as she passed? - None.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after she passed down the stairs, did you see the last witness? - Before the prisoner at the bar had got down the last stairs Etty was in sight, and she asked me whether I see the person going down with the child in her arms? I told her yes; and she ran after the prisoner, without giving me an answer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she bring her back? - Yes; she desired me to take care of her, while she went up stairs to see what was gone off the side board.</p>
               <p>Q. Am I to understand you, that she did go up stairs, and left the woman in your charge? - She did.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I have it to my counsel. I went to a house in the Church yard, which I thought was Mr. William's, I knocked at the parlour door; nobody answered. Mrs. Moore came in, and the servant came down stairs, and came after me, and she asked we what I wanted? I told her I had been to ask for one Mr. Williams; she said come back with me. I went with her; she went up stairs, I stopped while she went, and stopped with Mrs. Moore; she says I went down the kitchen stairs;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179507010063"></xptr>but I did not, I stopped all the time by her.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness to her character, who said she was a married woman, her husband sold fish, and kept a potatoe warehouse.</p>

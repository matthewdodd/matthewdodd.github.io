                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">through an interpreter.</hi>) On the 15th of Sep<lb></lb>tember was a seaman on board a vessel in the West India Docks—the prisoner was chief mate—we were lifting out the cargo—it is the custom among foreigners to sing whilst unloading—the rest of the crew were all singing—I could not sing, and told the prisoner so—he had a handspike in his hand, and bit me on the shoulder with it, so that my arm dropped directly—he then struck me on the back, and once on the thigh, with the handspike—I had done nothing but said I could not sing—he held me fast with one hand by the hair, and with his double fist struck me on the neck and head—he dragged me by the hair up and down the deck—I could not move my shoulder at all—I was taken to the hospital.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a lighterman, and live in Wellington-place, Limehouse. On the morning in question I was passing by in my cart—I saw the prisoner pulling the prosecutor about the deck by the hair with one hand, and striking him with the other with his fist—I called out to him and told him he ought to be ashamed of himself to use the man in that way—he said the man would not work—that was what I understood him to say—I got out of my cart, which was very near to the ship, and told the prosecutor if he would come with me would take him somewhere—he was crying very much—he came down the ship's side on to the jetty—I asked him what was the matter with his arm—he said the prisoner had hit him with the handspike—I got him into the cart, took him home, gave him some breakfast, and went to the Thames-police with him—the prisoner spoke English or I should not have understood him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. The prosecutor was brought to the Thames Police. I examined him there, and saw two very severe bruises on his shoulder, which appeared to be made by some piece of wood—they were very severe blows, and were black—I got a warrant, and went to the ship next morning, in the West India Docks—I then saw the prosecutor crying on the deck—I asked for the prisoner, saw him, and told him it was a very bad case—I said, "How came you to do this?"—he said, "It was not done with the handspike, I only hit him twice with the handspike, it was done with a rope"—I am in the habit of seeing marks made with ropes at our office, and think it impossible these marks could have been made with a rope—the prosecutor made motions to me that he had been <hi rend="italic">punched</hi> with it as he was lying on deck—I examined his hack lower down, and found black marks corresponding with the end of it—I took the prisoner into custody, and took the prosecutor to the London Hospital—he had his arm braced up, and we took him to the Magistrate—he is still an out-patient of the hospital—the doctor said it would be some time before he was able to work.</p>

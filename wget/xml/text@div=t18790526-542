I am a labourer at Hammersmith—on 15th April, about 8.30 or 8.45, I was at the Crown public-house, North End, Fulham, with my wife, who is the prisoner's sister; she had had a little too much to drink—I took a rose out of her hat—she said she would fetch a policeman and lock me up—after this I was standing outside the Crown holding a horse's head—I saw the prisoner come up and I saw Shawcross fall on the road on the back of his head—I did not see the prisoner do anything to him; he ran, up and said "Bo!" and Shawcross fell—he pushed him, whether with his open hand or his closed fist I could not say—he had his hands in his pockets, and he fell on the back of his head.</p>

I am the wife of Henry Kerl, of Garden Cottage, North End, Fulham—on 15th April, between 9 and 10 o'clock, I was by the Crown public-house—Mrs. Edgson and her husband were fighting—the prisoner was there—Shawcross stood facing the Crown about a foot off the kerbstone, with his hands in the waistband of his trousers—I saw the prisoner strike him, and he fell on his back in the road, where there were some granite stones; he was picked up and taken to a surgeon's—I did not see him do anything to the prisoner.</p>

I am a registered medical practitioner at Fulham—on the night of 15th April the deceased was brought to my surgery—he was suffering from a lacerated wound at the back of his head, and was bleeding from both ears and nose; the wound was about the size of a half-crown—from the grit and sand in the wound I fancied it was from a fall on a Macadamised road—I had him taken to his own home, and I attended him daily till he died; I saw him in one fit; it was reported to me that he had others—an injury of that kind would be likely to produce fits—the cause of death was fracture at the base of the skull caused by the fall.</p>

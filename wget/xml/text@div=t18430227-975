                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. James Francis Thompson, a pawnbroker, in East-street, St. Marylebone. On the 21st of Feb. the pri<lb></lb>soner offered a handkerchief to pledge for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I lent him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on it—he then went to the back of the shop, and I served another person—he then came to the counter and inquired if I had given him the shilling—I said yes, and he left the shop—previous to his coming to the counter the second time I had seen him put something into his pocket—I missed a handkerchief—I followed, and overtook him about twenty-five yards off—I found this hand<lb></lb>kerchief on him.</p>

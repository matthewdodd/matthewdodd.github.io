The women ran up stairs but dropped my hat in the passage, which I took up, and then ran up after them I told them I wanted my handkerchief, upon which they cursed and swore, and said they knew nothing of it. The prisoner said what will you give me to drink? I said go about your business, I know no reason for that. She said if I would give her something I should have my handkerchief again. I gave her six-pence out of my purse, and they saw my other money; then she said you must stay all night; then the other said, you bitch, he must stay along with me. The other laid hold round my arms, and the prisoner took my purse out of my pocket. Then they ran down stairs, and I followed them, but one of them stopped me on the stairs, and had like to have run me headlong out at a window on the stairs. Stevens stood at the stair foot, and pushed the two women into another room. I went in and demanded my money and things. Then Stevens took and shoved them out of doors, and kept me in the house till they were gone.</p>

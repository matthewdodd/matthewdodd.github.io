            . I keep the Crown and Dolphin public-house, in Cannon-street. I saw the prosecutor there that Saturday night - he was troublesome, and I sent him to the watch-house; he left his pack in the care of the prisoner, who was my servant - she has been five or six months with me; she was afterwards charged with taking the handkerchiefs, and said she knew nothing about them; I found a duplicate under her bed, and one in an old hatbox in her room.</p>

On the 14th of June the prisoner owed me, on my own account, some money, he said he wished to have more goods of me, but could not expect a further extent of credit, and if I would take the bill which he presented to me, and let him have goods, he should feel obliged - I took this bill in payment of what he had from me; the amount of it was more than the goods, but he was to have more - the bill was to pay what he owed, and for other goods - he gave it to me in Nicholas-lane.</p>

               <p>Q. State exactly what he said? A. He said, he ought to have paid the account in cash, but could not do it, but he had a bill of exchange which would be duly honoured, when it became due - he presented me the bill, wished me to take it, and furnish him with more goods; I let him have goods - the bill was presented by a notary - the amount of goods he had that day was 4l. 2s., and he owed me previously 5l. 19s. - I did not give him the difference - I put the bill by as a collateral security; I could not give him credit for the bill, it not being cash - I took it expecting it to be honoured when due; that was my inducement to part with my goods - I have received several letters from the prisoner, which I have acted on and have become perfectly acquainted with his hand-writing - it is my firm belief that this acceptance is not his hand-writing.</p>

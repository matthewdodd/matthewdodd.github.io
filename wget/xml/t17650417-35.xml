I brought her to my house; all she owned was, that she had not taken so much as I said; she said she took only fifteen guineas and a half; and that she owned she had taken: when the young man delivered me a half-crown, she arose up, and said, That never was your's; so I gave it her: before she went to the Justice she said she had received 25 l. from a person in Wales; but before the Justice, she said she had only twelve guineas.</p>

            . I am an apprentice at the St. Alban's tavern. On the 4th of April, the prisoner at the bar sent a chairman to me, desiring me to come to St. James's Square, not in any house; she told me she had received upwards of twenty guineas from Slough: and she desired me to take eleven guineas and half a crown, and these buckles and glass, and I might do as I pleased with the money. I have known her near twelve months; I believe she had not left Mr. Denmead's Service then; she said she was to come away that evening; Mr. Denmead's man came and enquired of me about her; I asked what was the matter; I observed he was slurried: he said she was in custody: I having received these the day before, went and carried them to Mr. Denmead.

               <p>All that the young man says is very true: I had that money of Mr. Williams; he has taken lodgings at Lambeth, and is now out of town; but will be back in a day or two: the buckles I have had six years; they were made me a present of before I left Wales; my father is a Justice of the Peace there. When my mistress was ill, I gave her some stuff in that spoon, and put it in my pocket instead of my own.</p>

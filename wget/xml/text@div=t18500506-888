                  </hi>. I am single; I have known the prisoner twelve months next August; I was in a situation at Finchley. On Sunday, 7th April, the prisoner came to pay me a visit—he said his work was very bad, and he wanted a little assistance—I told him I could not assist him—I put</p>

I said I would, but instead of waiting the fourteen days, she gave me in charge.</p>

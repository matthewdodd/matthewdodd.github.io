                  </hi>. On the 10th of June, the prisoner came to me in Bishops-gate-street—he asked me if I was willing to earn a pound—I said I was out of service, and should be glad to carn a pound—he said he had got a duplicate of a gold watch, and if I would take it out he knew a gentleman who would give five guineas for it—I went with him to Dept ford—I took it out for four guineas—I came back with him to Brown's-lane in the evening, and he then said if I would let him have the watch he would go to the gentleman with it—he took it, and I never saw him again till he was into custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I told you I had the ticket of a watch, and if you would go and get it, we would share the profits—we went and got it—I put it into my pocket—when we got to the rail-road you asked to look at it, and I let you—we came on, and tried several pawnbrokers to get the money on it again—when we got to Brown's-lane, I said, "If you will wait here a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, if I do not come back you may call me in the morning; you know where I live, "and if you had called you would have had the watch—I should suppose I was part owner of the watch, as we were to share the profits—the watch was given to me, as I understood most about it—he told me to put it into my pocket carefully, and mind it did not fall—he told me to do what I could with it. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> We went to two or three pawnbrokers to try to pawn it—I had known him about seven weeks, but I did not know where he lived till I went on the coach rank the next day, and inquired, and when I went to his house he was not at home—I went three times, but could not find him—I gave the information at Spitalfields station-house, and he was taken in ten days or a fortnight afterwards—the pawnbroker gave me the watch—I had it till we got to Brown's-lane, and then he asked me for it, to show to a gentleman who he said was a clerk.</p>

                  </hi>. I was second officer on board the ship <hi rend="italic">Scawfell</hi>, bound from Japan to England—on Thursday, 21st April, I was residing at the Sailors' Home, in Wells-street; and on that day, I met the prisoner Russell on Tower-hill—I asked him the way to the shipping master's office, and he pointed me out the direction; and he said, "I am a stranger in London myself; I have been a farmer. I have sold my farm, and am going to Australia on the 30th"—he then asked me to take a glass of ale with him, and I went with him to a public-house, and had some ale—from there I went to the shipping office, leaving him at the corner of the public-house—having transacted my business at the shipping office, I came back, and found him where I had left him—I went back to the public-house again with him, and had some ale or wine; I believe it was ale—whilst we were drinking, Lofts came in—he spoke to Russell—I don't remember how he opened the conversation; but he said he had been a farmer, and had just come from the country to see London; and that he had given a man a sovereign to show him about, and he had robbed him of it—the prisoners talked together some time—I did not take notice what they said then—Lofts said he was the biggest man about his part of the country—he said, he could throw a weight of fourteen or eighteen pounds, I forget which, eighteen or twenty yards—Russell said he could not, and I said the same, I believe—he then offered to bet Russell 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that he would do so—they then asked me if I would go to see it done, and we all went in a cab together—after I got in the cab, I found I had a nasty headache, and seemed as if I had been drinking a great deal of spirits, which I had not done, and I could not account for it—after we had been driving about for a long while, they stopped at a beer-shop, or a public-house; where it was, I can't say—they took me to the rear of the house, where there was a skittle-alley—they then said they could not heave there, the place had been inclosed, or something like that—there was a third man there, who is at large—then skittles was proposed—I can't remember who proposed it—I refused to play—playing commenced between them, and they bet upon one another for a long while—after a time, I bet, and I lost 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Lofts then proposed to play me at a game of skittles for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said I had not enough money, but I would</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186405090060"></xptr>
               <p>draw the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I would get a bill and lay it on, or get the money from the bankers—I then went in a cab with the other man who is at large, to the Sailors' Home, in Wells street, and got a bill for 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of my desk there—this was all on the Friday—I got my wages on the Friday morning I lost them—that was the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and it was after I had lost that that I went to Wells-street to get the 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill—at this time, I was like a man half-drunk—I was stupid; neither drunk nor sober—I saw the principal things that went on, but I could not remember the different circumstances, or the places where I went to—when I got the 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill, I took it back to Lofts—he would not take it; he said he wanted gold for gold, and notes for notes—it was payable at Robarts', who were agents for my bankers at Plymouth—the third man went with me to Robarts', but we could not get the money—Lofts then proposed that I should telegraph to my bankers at Plymouth, and all four of us went to the telegraph office together—Lofts went into the station with me, and I telegraphed to the bankers to send money to their agents to permit me to draw some money on the bill—I got an answer to that, stating, that they could not do any banking business by telegraph—then one or the other proposed that they should go down with me to Plymouth by express train that night, to draw the money—I think it was Russell proposed that—I went down to Plymouth that night with Russell, and on the Satur<lb></lb>day morning I went to the bank, presented my bill, and got 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England notes—Russell waited outside the bank—the notes were given to me in three bundles of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, and one bundle of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; four parcels altogether—I only half cashed the 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill—I put them in my trowsers pocket—I had 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in a sealed parcel in sovereigns, which I took down with me, and which I had had ever since I left Japan—I changed it out there—Russell and I then went back to Loudon—when we got to the Paddington station I saw the third man, who is not here—we went to an hotel where we found Lofts—I don't know what that place was—all four of us got into a cab to go and play this game of skittles—I had recovered from this stupefying effect—I was not drunk; it was forty-eight hours afterwards—I saw nothing wrong with them then; they behaved very properly—we went to the house where we had been before, and the landlord said the alley was engaged, and we could not play there—they then proposed betting, which I refused—at last we went to different places to look for an alley, and at each place they wanted me to play at pitch and toss, or bet, which I refused to do on all occasions—we then went to the "Prince Albert," Old Ford, which is near the police-station—they said they could get a skittle-alley there—after some time they proposed betting again, and a bottle of sherry was called for—I went out to see the landlord to show me the skittle-ground—I did not drink anything before I went out—when I came back I sat down again, and Lofts offered me a glass of sherry, which I drank part of—they were playing pitch and toss, and betting, and they wanted me to do so—I refused for a long while; ultimately I did bet—I can't remember what it was, but I know it was nothing over 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I lost it, and in the play I saw that Lofts was cheating, and I made the remark that he was cheating—Lofts then said, I will give you the first toss for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I then put one of the four parcels of notes on the table (the remainder were in my pocket at the time), and he put this bag (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) and said, "There is my hundred pounds"—the contents were not opened out—we tossed, and I won—I was going to take the bag when Lofts said, "Oh, no; I have two more chances for it"—directly I found him cheating again I immediately put my hand into my pocket, and found the remainder of the notes were all gone—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186405090061"></xptr>
               <p>I then said, "You have robbed me, I will call the police"—Lofts then grabbed up his beg and my 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with one band, and knocked my wine-glass off the table with the other, and the other two men jumped out of the window—I collared Lofts by the throat; we had a very heavy struggle together, and I ultimately got him under me, and I sang out for the police; a fourth man then came in—I asked him to assist me, and he came over and pulled me off Lofts, and they both escaped out of the window together—looked on the ground directly, and saw my purse, which I had dropped in the struggle, with a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note and some other money in it, and some papers—I then rushed to the door and can after them, singing out that I had been robbed—they got out of the window into a yard, and then over a gate eight feet high at the very lowest—I came out at the door——I next saw them at the police-station—directly after I reached there I saw them searched, and these parcels of notes were produced; they are the same as I received from my bankers at Plymouth—they were not tied up then; they were in parcels—there is 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. here now—I felt the other notes safe at the moment—I took the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of my pocket to stake against Lofts 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

M. S. Euryalus—I never played on board ship or on land—I am not at all fond of it—I don't remember having gambled at all—I might have played at billiards and that, for small amounts, nothing in the skittle line—I never saw a skittle-ground abroad—I don't remember ever playing at skittles—I have played at American bowls a broad——I am set a good hand at that—I spoke to Russell first—I had never seen Lofts before—we did not play at the first public-house—we drank either two glasses of ale or one of ale and one of sherry; it was not more—I believe it was ale en both occasions—we stayed there ten or fifteen minutes—I thought these men behaved very well—I saw nothing wrong with them, and I thought the extraordinary effect the liquor had upon me might he owing to the change of climate—I went somewhere with Lofts to sleep that night; I can't say where it was—I was never in London before—I was not drunk—I was all right the next day when I got up—I went about with these men to different places that day, and went down with the third man to the shipping master's office to see about paying the men off, and getting a balance of wages due to me—I had coffee for breakfast—I believe I had a glass of sherry or half a glass, at different times that day, but no more—I declined to bet—they told me I should be sure to win.; but it is a sort of thing I never did—I did not care about doing it at that time—I did not bet at all the first day—we went to different places; at some I drank, and at some I did not—I objected to Lofts paying for drink on several occasions—I did not want to get the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. back again particularly; I believed they had won it fairly, and I did not wish to get it back, and thought no more of it at that time—I did not tell them I had 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in my pocket at the time we were going to play for the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was the bet, and I said I had not got it—I was challenged for it, and accepted it—they advised me to go down to Plymouth—I paid the passage down and up; we took return ticket—I did</p>

               <p>not object to Russell going with me, because before we went they proposed a stake should be made as a security that I should come back, and I left some jewellery and money, and Russell loft that bag of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; the contents of the bag were counted by the landlord of the public-house, and he said there was one more than 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he gave the one back to Lofts—when we tossed for the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Lofts said, "I will give you the first toss for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," and I won the first toss, and said, "I have won it,"—to the best of my recollection those were the words used—we were then in the room behind the bar—Lofts was sitting at the same table, opposite to me, within arm's length; it was a small narrow table, a common taproom table—I consider, by the headache I bad, and the state I was in, that it could not have happened from the drink I had had—my head was aching very heavily at that time, but I was in such a state as to know what was going on—I could distinctly see and understand what was doing, I had my senses about me—this public-house was not a great distance from the police-station.</p>

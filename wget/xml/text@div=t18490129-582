                  </hi>. I am porter to the Phœnix Gas Company. On Sunday night, 7th Jan., I went my rounds as usual every half-hour—I went by Mr. Pridden's at half-past eleven—the window was all safe, and the blind hanging as usual, and closed—about ten minutes to twelve I beard glass break at the rear of the house, and then a noise as if woodwork was cracking—I went to the door, and saw a policeman with the prisoner in charge—the Venetian blinds were broken, and this blind torn out—I afterwards found it behind some palings; it had the tassel off and the cord attached—a square of glass was broken exactly over the window fastening—I found marks about the opening of the catch—the left square was broken also, and the bottom square where the Venetian blind was—the house is in St. George's parish—while the prisoner was in custody, I observed his hands were bleeding; I afterwards saw a cord taken from his pocket, which exactly corresponded with what was left.</p>

I was at my door at the Corner of Wellington-street, and heard glass breaking more than once—I listened, and after a while, saw the prisoner coming in a direction of the gas-works—he went to the opposite side, as if to make water—he returned, and in about two or three minutes, I heard another smash of glass—I beckoned to a policeman at the corner, and told him what I had heard—I afterwards saw him take the prisoner.</p>

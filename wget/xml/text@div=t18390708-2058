                  </hi>. I am a baker, and live in Little Shire-lane, where the prisoner's father and mother live. I lodge in the garret—another young lad slept in that room—the prisoner is a copper-plate printer—he does not live there—his brother sleeps with his father and mother, but the other one sleeps with me—he is about sixteen years old—on Sunday, the 16th of June, I went to bed about twelve o'clock—I then had 28<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my</p>

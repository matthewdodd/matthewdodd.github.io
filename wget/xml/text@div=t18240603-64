I said to him,</p>
               <p>"That it was too bad to rob and ill use a woman so." The female prisoner said,</p>

               <p>"I will not stand here to see a woman robbed;" an officer came up, I pointed them out, and they were taken directly; I had known them both before a good while; the man had run away, I described him, and he was taken.

               <p>"It is a great shame that a poor woman should be knocked down and robbed." I went to him; he pointed out the female prisoner. I took her, and took the shawl from her hand; she had it behind her - Cordwell ran away, I left the female in custody - pursued, and found him in a house in Castle-yard, Jew's-row. I had seen him before; Wright told me that it was Cordwell; I knew his name before - I had seen him a few minutes before, and he had a coat but when I took him he had a jacket on.</p>

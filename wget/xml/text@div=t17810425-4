               <p>I am servant to Mr. Emery. I was at the parlour-door; the prisoner came into the shop; it was a little before eight o'clock in the morning; the parlour is facing the shop; there was nobody in the shop at the time, except another man with the prisoner; I saw him take a watch off the hook at the window; I said, My God! he is taking some watches! he made to the door to go out; I followed him.</p>
               <p>Does the shop-door open into a passage? - No; it opens immediately into the shop, only there is a little partition in the shop to break off the wind: when the prisoner went out, I immediately followed him.</p>
               <p>What became of the other? - He stood at the door: I cannot say whether he went into the shop or no, I was so frightened.</p>
               <p>Are you sure it was the prisoner that went into the shop? - Yes; for I had hold of his coat while he was taking the watch off the hook. When I came to the parlour-door, I made up to him; and when he got to take hold of the watch, I laid hold of his coat pocket, and said what I mentioned; he went out.</p>
               <p>How did he get from you? - I can't be sure whether I had hold of him then or no; I cried out, That man has stole some watches! he ran as fast as he could; when he got off the pavement a little way, I saw him drop a watch; a person picked it up, and gave it to me; I cried out, Stop thief! he was pursued, taken, and brought back to the shop.</p>
               <p>Are you quite sure that the man that was brought back, was the same you saw take the watch? - Yes; this is the watch (producing it) that was picked up, and given to me.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This watch was in my shop: I had it left to repair.</p>
               <p>From the prisoner. Whether you did not say the man that took the watch, had an apron on? - I never said any thing about an apron; but when he first came into the shop, I thought he had been one of my master's workmen.</p>

A gentleman came up on horse-back, and said he saw him fling down a watch or two; I laid hold of his collar, and said, My lad, two can play at that as well as one: he had an apron on, a clean shirt, and his waistcoat open; I thought he belonged to some branch of business.</p>

               <p>I was coming from Spring-Gardens on Monday morning, the 19th of March; it wanted about five minutes to eight; just as I came by Mr. Emery's door, I saw the prisoner run out of the shop; the maid followed, and said, My God! that man has stole something out of the shop! I cried, Stop thief! but could not catch him; I saw him drop the watch just now produced, in the road; I thought, as he had dropped the watch, he had got no more, and I did not pursue him immediately; but he still kept running on; that rather gave me a suspicion that he might have more; I pursued him; he crossed over towards Mr. Nicholson's, and going upon the flag pavement, his foot slipped, and he was near falling down; he then crossed over towards Mr. Pinchbeck's, in Cockspur-street; I followed him then, and in St. Alban's street he stopped of his own accord; when I came up, he said, Who did you call stop thief after? I said, to you; I saw you steal the watches: I catched hold of his collar; he put himself in a posture of defence, and said, If you offer to stop me, I will cut or knock you down: I catched him by the collar, and brought him back to Mr. Emery's.</p>

On the 21st of January I stopped the prisoner coming out of the gate of the West India Export Dock, about twelve o'clock at noon - I searched him, and found in his hat three paper parcels, which altogether contained twelve dozen pair of scissors, and five dozen pen-knives - I asked where he came from - he said he was steward of the Hedley, and he had brought these things from there; I asked whose they were, and he said his own, and they were the remains of a venture he had taken out on a fromer voyage in another vessel - the property was taken before the Magistrate, but no person appearing to claim it, it was returned to him - I asked where he bought the articles - he said of a person in the neighbourhood of Smithfield, about eleven months ago; I went on board the Hedley on the 28th of January, and asked the mate if he knew the steward had those things when he left the ship - he said he did not; I then asked if there was any cargo of this description on board - he said he did not believe there was; I apprehended the prisoner while on board, and asked what he had done with the property which I had stopped him with before - he said he had sold them to a jew, in Mileend-road, for 12l.; he then took me to his lodgings and I searched his box, and found thirty sovereigns, and six half-sovereigns, which he said was what the property had been sold for; I found some cotton prints and other articles, but nothing relative to this charge - and on the 1st of February I found this piece of tin by the side of the ship Hedley.</p>

            . I live at No. 30, High-street, Whitechapel - I am a cutler. The prisoner brought some articles to our house on Friday, the 22d of January - he asked if I wanted to buy any scissors - I asked where he got them - he said they were the remains of a venture he had taken out to the Brazils; that he had sold the table-knives and pen-knives, but the scissors were too good for the market - I said they had not the appearance of having been to the Brazils, and asked where he bought them; he said in the vicinity of Smithfield; I found they were scissors of a superior quality, and asked what he gave for them - he said 14s. a dozen, but could not tell the man's name, or in what part of Smithfield he bought them; he said he bought them all at a price; I saw there was at least 10s. a dozen difference in them - the average value was, I think, 25s. a dozen; I kept him in conversation till I opened the whole of the papers, and then I found one dozen which had the name of Gibbs on them: I asked if he bought this dozen with the rest; he said, Yes; I asked him his name, he said, "Harris, 39, High-street, Poplar;" I then said, "I shall have nothing to do with the twenty-two dozen of scissors, but I shall detain this dozen, as I know the person whose name is on them, and I have no<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182602160043"></xptr>>doubt they are stolen;" he said, "Surely I am not to lose the dozen of scissors." I said, "Certainly not - if you call on me to-morrow evening, if I find you have told me a true story, you shall have them again, or I will purchase them." I then communicated with Mr. Thornhill, who is the successor of Mr. Gibbs, and he went on board the ship the next day.</p>

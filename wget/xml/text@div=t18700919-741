                  </hi>. I am a painter, and live at 47, Moorgate Street—on 8th September, about 9.35, I was in Finsbury Pavement, with a friend—two men came up and wanted to fight—a crowd came round—the prisoner was in the crowd—he came behind me, and took hold of my chain and tried to pull it out—I got my pocket torn—the men who were fighting wanted to hit me, and I ran away—they halloaed "Stop thief!" and I was stopped by a constable and brought back—the prisoner was then walking on the other side of the road—a waterman said "There is the man who tried to take your watch"—the prisoner then began to run—he was fol<lb></lb>lowed and taken into custody.</p>

I live at 59, Canal Road, Kingsland, and am waterman at the cab stand, Finsbury Pavement—shortly before 10 o'clock on this night my attention was called to a crowd on the Pavement—I saw the prisoner there—I had seen him before, a number of times—when I got into the crowd, I saw the prisoner with his arm round the prosecutor—I said "Your watch is going" and I caught the prisoner's hand on the chain—the prosecutor ran away, and was brought back by a policeman in plain cloths—I touched him on the shoulder, and said "That is not the man you want," and I pointed out the prisoner on the opposite side of the way—he ran towards Fore Street, and the constable caught him.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a servant to Mr. Campbell? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you the care of the pots? - Yes, I got them all in. On the 3d of March, Tuesday, I was getting my pots in the morning, and I had this gallon pot on my rope, and I laid them down under the cook shop window in Holywell-lane; I reckon it to be between eleven and twelve o'clock. In laying them down I put the gallon pot at the head of the rope, and while I went up the passage at the corner of the cook shop for a pot, when I came down again, the gentlewoman of the cook shop came out to the door, and asked me if I missed any thing? I told her I missed a gallon pot; she pointed to Mary Roberts, and said that that woman in an old red clock stooped to pick up something, she did not know what; I ran after her, and just by the Crown, I found her up in a corner, between two trees, inside of the palisades, with the gallon pot by the side of her, on the ground close by her; I took up the gallon pot, and looked at it, and saw my master's name on it; and I asked her how she came to take it? and she said she did it for want; I see a young woman, and desired her to run home and inform my master; when she came to my master, my master was out, and my mistress came and took the gallon pot from the side of her, and asked her how she came to take it? and she told her the same as she told me before, that she did it for want.</p>
               <p>Q. Who has had the care of that pot ever since, you or your mistress? - My master and mistress together; they were ordered by the justice to put it up, and not to use it, and it has been laid by ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. To Mrs. Campbell. Did you see the woman in this situation, with the pot by her? - I took the pot up from the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. And you have kept it till now? - I have locked it up, my husband's name is on it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was going for some water, and it being hard weather, I took the pot to drive it out, as I was going to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179504160075"></xptr>cistern for it; I had the pail in my hand, and took the pot, knowing Mr. Campbell I thought I might take the liberty of using it.</p>
               <p>Q. To Prosecutrix. What did she say to you about the pot? - She said she was in great distress, and took it for want.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When Mrs. Campbell was sent for and came up to me, she took the pot from me, and bid me go about my business, and let me go about my business, and it was above an hour after, and I had brought my water home, before Mr. Campbell took me in my room,</p>

               <p>Q. To prosecutor. Is that true? - It is.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses who gave her a very good character, said she got her livelihood under the protection of her father.</p>

               <p>Q. What are they?</p>
               <p>Gunston. They are made of silk and cotton. Just at the same time a person came in, and while I was talking to him the prisoner moved to another part of the counter. I looked at her, and saw her hand<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176001160012"></xptr> move under her cloak. She immediately pitched upon a handkerchief, asked the price of it, and bid me cut it off. She turned round, in order to take her money out to pay me, and I saw something stick out in a bulge. She went out of the shop and I after her, and I saw her as she was stooping put something into her petticoat. I took her back, and said she had got something that was not her own. She fell down on her knees, and desired I would have compassion on her. I sent for my master, and we took her into our back warehouse and examined her. She pleaded guilty, and desired my master not to prosecute her, saying she could send for no friend that would appear for her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the handkerchiefs?</p>
               <p>Gunston. We did, she had kick'd them down on the ground (produced in court, and deposed to as his master's property.)</p>
               <p>Q. How kick'd them on the ground?</p>
               <p>Gunston. She dropped them on the ground when she was brought into the shop again, and immediately fell down on her knees, and said, she hoped I would forgive her, for it was the first fact she ever committed, and I heard her confess the same to my master. She was very big with child, and has since been delivered in prison.</p>

The Evidence against Stephens was, that he gave two of the Halfcrowns, and two Shillings to another Man, for some Service he had done him; and that Stephens was to watch at the Door, whilst Seal and the rest stampt the money. Under the stairs in the cellar, was found several Blank Halfcrowns unkempt, which were False Metal, and the Blows were heard to be given by some that stood at the door; and in Stephen's Pocket was found a Parcel of clipt money that was naught, and made of False Metal. There was no Witness against them that could say they saw them Clip or Coin, only one Witness who was concerned with them, swore that he saw a Stamp to Coin sixpences, and that Seale told him that he was going to work, and bade him get him gone to the Door, or to some Alehouse, for he must not see him work. Wild said that he Let his Cellar to the said Seale to make Spurrs, and that he knew nothing of the Clipping or Coining, calling some Witnesses for his Reputation, who said that he was a <rs id="t16940830-18-deflabel83" type="occupation">Smith</rs>

So said some for Stephens, that he was a poor honest Fellow, for ought as ever they saw. There was no Proof that they did either of them actually work at the Clipping or Coining Trade, so they were <rs id="t16940830-18-verdict84" type="verdictDescription">

                  </hi>. I am landlord of the Feathers, in Lambeth Walk. On Tuesday morning, 24th March, about 2 o'clock, the prosecutor, Mr. Rankin, came into my house; the two prisoners were with him; they had a quartern of gin together, which I served them with—Saunders went out with Mr. Rankin to see him home, Hammond remained in the house some little time afterwards—the prosecutor had some money, I could not say how much; he had some few shillings, and I think I changed a 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece for the gin, and that was all that he had in my house, for he was in liquor—my house is generally shut by 12 o'clock, and I was having alterations made at the time, and happened to have one or two of my neighbours there, and as they knocked I let them in.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Saunders. Q.</hi> Was not the prosecutor fighting in front of the bar with your barman? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, there was no fighting in the house at all; the barman was there, and three tradesmen, neighbours of mine; no one was serving behind the bar but myself.</p>

Q.</hi> The barman was before the bar, was he not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, he used to live barman with the person I took the house of; his name is Thomas; he was drinking with a Mr. Palmer, a builder—I swear I saw no disturbance between him and the prosecutor—the prosecutor was not struck by him and turned out of the house—you did not ask me at the examination for the address of the gentlemen that were there, or the address of the barman; I did not know where he lived—I did not promise the Magistrate to give you the addresses—you stopped in the house it might be a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes after the prosecutor left—you were taken into custody just as you were going out.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 58, Catherine Street, Lambeth. On 24th March, about 2 o'clock, I was going home not quite sober—I went into the Feathers public house—I met the prisoners near the door of the Feathers, they both spoke to me—Saunders professed to know me; he said he worked in the same place with me, and he would see me home—we went into the Feathers, and had a quartern of gin—I am not aware that I fought with anybody there—I did not observe any fighting—I was in there I should say ten minutes—I left with Saunders—after pro<lb></lb>ceeding about fifty yards from the house, I was knocked down, and became insensible; I had power to call "Police!"—I believe it to be Saunders who knocked me down—I felt something like pitch or tar about my mouth, I do not know how it got there—I believe I lost 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and my handkerchief, I do not know how I lost it—I had never seen either of the prisoners before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Saunders.</hi> I was going home, and he asked me to see him a little way down the street. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> It is false; I wanted to get <hi rend="italic">quit</hi> of them, and it was through kindness that I took them in to treat them—I cannot swear that you took my money.</p>

               <p>time—seeing that the prosecutor was the worse for drink, I came up to Saunders, and said, "Do you know this man?"—he said, "Yes, we belong to the same firm, in Lincoln's Inn Fields; he is a clerk, and I am a porter there, and I am going to see him home"—they went in the direction of the railway arch—I stopped where I was for about five minutes—I heard a scuffle and some noise, and I heard "Police!" called loudly—I ran in the direction of the railway arch, and met Saunders running from the arch—I caught hold of him by the breast, and asked him was there anything amiss—he said, "No"—I said, "You will come back with me until I see"—I went back to the railway arch, and saw the prosecutor lying on his back with his face all smothered in blood—I said to Saunders, "What is this, how came you to knock the man down?"—he made no reply—when the prosecutor recovered himself, he said he believed Saunders was the man that knocked him down—when I got him to the station, I observed a pitch plaster or something like tar smeared about his mouth—there was nothing of the kind about him when I first spoke to Saunders about him—I saw nothing more of Hammond until he was taken into custody outside the public house.</p>

On Tuesday morning, 24th March I came from Lambeth-walk up to the Feathers—I saw Slack, Saunders, and the prosecutor standing together, and two females and a man standing on the pavement—Slack said to me, "This man's face is smothered in blood and torn to pieces"—I turned on my lamp and looked at Saunders, and said, "You hold him tight, I know him, his <hi rend="italic">pal</hi> is here somewhere"—I turned and saw two prostitutes and Hammond standing on the pavement by the Feathers—I seized hold of Hammond—he said, "Leave me go, I have done nothing"—I said, "I will see first"—I took him into the Feathers, and asked the landlord if he had been in company with Saunders—he said, "Yes, they were both in here together"—Hammond got hold of me by the throat and threw me down.</p>

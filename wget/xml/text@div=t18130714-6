            . I am a Thames police surveyor.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember any time in June, seeing the prisoner in the river Thames - A. I did, on the 19th of June, about half past one in the morning. I was on my duty. I was going down the river; I saw three men in a boat; the boat came round the stern of a lighter. The moment they saw me in my boat they shoved on shore; two of the men ran out of the boat and escaped. The prisoner jumped into the mud, and in trying to extricate himself he fell on his hands, which enabled me to take him. I found in the boat three bags of coffee. The three bags of coffee weighed three hundred weight and a quarter. I afterwards went on board the lighter. The name of the lighter was the Castle Douglas. I found her laying at the entrance of the West India docks. The hatches were on, and the main hatch bar ran along the hatch. One hatch was fast, and the other unlocked. One of the hatch bars were down, with an excise lock, and the other was not locked at all. The starboard was loose; the larboard was secure. By shifting the starboard bar off you might get all the hatches off.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any one on board - A. No. When I first saw the wherry she was about one hundred and fifty yards off. She was rowing up the river, but whether her head was inclining on the shore I cannot say; I should suppose not, by the direction she was going in. They landed on the same side at Limehouse-hole. I searched the prisoner. I found a key on him that unlocked the hatch, where they may go out of the weather. It has no communication but to where the cargo was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. So you never saw him but one hundred and fifty yards off the lighter - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where they were exactly coming from, you could not ascertain - A. No, I could not. When I got in the boat he told me he was a watchman to Mr. Betts. The prisoner desired me to go after the other two men. He said, they were going to Mackilbery's, a house down the stairs; I should find the two men there. I asked him where the coffee came from. He told me that they were watchman of Mr. Betts's, and that they had got it out of the lighter; that himself had been on shore in the watchhouse at the West India docks, and had fell asleep there, and on his coming down to his coming down to his craft he perceived two men heaving something out of the lighter into the boat. He called to them, and asked what they had got there. He then found it was coffee from out of the lighter, and requested them to put it back, but finding they would not put it back he went with them. On my asking him how they came to get out of the boat; first he said they were rowing, and he was sitting aft.</p>
               <p>Q. He told you very freely where they were going to take the property to - A. He did, and he told me he was asleep at the time these persons took the property.</p>

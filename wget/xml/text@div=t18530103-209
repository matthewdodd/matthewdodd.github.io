On 22nd Dec, between 2 and 3o'clock in the afternoon, I received some information which induced me to follow the prisoner; I saw him about 200 yards below my own house, handling his pockets—I followed him, and saw him speak to the policeman when he got into the Plumstead-road—the prisoner then went away—I made a communication to the policeman, and we both followed the prisoner—we overtook him, and the policeman said he was wanted for uttering bad money—he said he knew nothing about it, and he had no bad money about him—he walked on a few yards, and I followed to watch him—I saw him put his hand through a fence, and something like money fell from his hand—I called to the policeman, and told him what I saw—I went to the spot and found seven bad shillings—one of them I identified directly as a shilling that he bad tendered at my house—they were all loose, and one of them had rolled through the fence—these are the seven shillings I picked up—this one of them is one that had been tendered to me,</p>

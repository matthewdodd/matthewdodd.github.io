                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's father. I gave up the farm to my son at Wanstead, in Essex, but I live there—on the 11th of June, I got up about two o'clock in the morning, and saw from my bed-room window Joseph Lazell coming out of the stable, with a sack with something in it—he put it into the waggon—he then got into the waggon,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183506150164"></xptr>
               <p>and moved it from the hind part to the front—I saw he was looking about to see if he saw any body—he then got out of the waggon—shut up the tail<lb></lb>board, and fastened it—Lovell was in the yard with him—the horses were then put to, and they went out of the yard—I heard Lazell say, "I will drive out of the yard, and you shut the gates"—both of them were waggoners in my son's employ.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the son of the last witness. Lovell and La<lb></lb>zell were in my employ, as carters—on the 10th of June I gave out a sack of spilt beans to each of them to feed their horses—on the 11th they were to go out twice for dung—I was out that morning, from three to a quarter-past three o'clock—I came to Carr-hall-lane, and I saw my two waggons; which these men ought to have been with, standing at the corner of the lane—I saw Lovell—I told him he ought not to go on with his waggon, and leave the other waggon in the position in which it stood—I then saw Lizell coming in a direction from the Thatched-house, which is in the high-road to Woodford—I went home, and at breakfast-time my father made a con<lb></lb>munication to me—in consequence of that, I sent two patrols, with a sample of beans which I took from the bulk—they afterwards brought about there bushels of spilt beans in two sacks—these are them—I believe they an part of my beans—these are my sacks—I took them of my father at a valuation.</p>

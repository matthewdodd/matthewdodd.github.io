I am the sub-manager of the Birmingham Banking Company at Birmingham—at the latter end of March the prisoner Taylor came to the bank, and had a conversation with me about opening an account—he wanted to know our rates of commission—I asked him the nature of his account, and asked him whether he should want to pay in bills—he stated he should want to pay in trade bills, and should require to draw against them—I then asked him how many would be current at one time—he said, "Some 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I then referred him to the manager—he subsequently opened an account at the bank—we were in the habit of furnishing our customers with credit papers—this is one of them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I believe it is Mr. Taylor's handwriting—there are five entries on the credit paper—among others this bill of 279<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I believe the endorse<lb></lb>ment to this bill of exchange to be in Mr. Taylor's handwriting—the endorsement to this other bill of 134<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is also in Taylor's handwriting—I know nothing whatever of the other part of the bills—both these bills were paid into the bank by Taylor (<hi rend="italic">The first bill was for </hi>279<hi rend="italic">l. </hi>8<hi rend="italic">s. </hi>9<hi rend="italic">d., dated April 10th, 1865, drawn by J.

On the 21st of December, about four o'clock, the two prisoners were coming out together to get their beer; I saw them; I staid away from the Exchange, in consequence of suspicion, to watch them; they went out of the laboratory, I stopped them in Mr. Maud's premises, and told them I had something to say to them; they followed me; when I got them up stairs, I sent for Cartwright the officer. Mr. Maud was present; he told them he suspected they had robbed the premises; they hung their heads and said nothing. Cartright came; they were searched; he found a piece of saltpetre in each of their hats. Connor said, he was sorry he had done it; and Stephens expressed sorrow; I do not particularly remember what he said.</p>

            . Q. You are a marshal-man of the city. - A. Yes; I was sent for; I went up into the room, the two prisoners were present; I took Stephens's hat out of his hand; I felt his hat very heavy. I said, Mr. Maud, there is something in it; I searched further and took out this salt-petre; and in Connor's hat, which he had put on the table, was this piece of salt-petre; I weighed them, one piece is five pound weight; and the other is five pound and a half. Connor and Stephens begged for mercy; Mr. Maud said, he had lost so much, he could think nothing at all of it. I handcuffed them and took them to the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. to Biggar. What quantity is there of this. - A. About five pound weight in each, worth about ten shillings. Stephens's sole employ was in cutting the salt-petre out of the crystals.</p>
               <p>Connor's Defence. I lived eighteen years with Mr. Maud, and during them eighteen years, he gave me a very good character; I have been away from him, and only lived with him two years this last time. I superintended the laboratory for Mr. Biggar, for twelve years; and I have had the care of some thousand pounds; I behaved as an honest man all the time. I asked my mate to give me a piece of salt-petre, it was to give to a friend. Mr. Biggar knows me, he can give me a good character.</p>
               <p>Stephens said nothing in his defence, nor called any witnesses to character.</p>
               <p>Conner called six witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

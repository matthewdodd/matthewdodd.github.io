            . The prisoner about the 4th of this month came into my house; I live at the Turks Head, Diaper-street, Bloomsbury, he came about three in the afternoon, with five or six more. I saw the watch in his hand, and they were disputing about who was the proprietor of it one said, they had as good a right as the other; after I heard these disputes, I fear for the constable, I sent to Mr. Welch's office, and Hewetson and another came and secured all the people in the room; the prisoner in the time I had sent for them, came up to the bar, and said, they have got my watch away from me; I said go into the room, and I will get you your watch again; I locked the doors, one of them had got it, and said he would go out of the room; I was obliged to use him roughly, and knock'd him down, to secure him; when he found he was detained, he shoved the watch through a hole in the floor, which went into the cellar: one of them said, I would not let any body go into the cellar till the officer came; then this gentleman went into the cellar, that is Bryer, and brought up the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. You never had it in your own hand?</p>
               <p>Tollington. No; not till after it came out of the cellar: I did not see him put it down.</p>
               <p>Hewetson (again). I secured eight of these people; I searched the prisoner's pocket at Mr. Welche's, and found this gold locket in his pocket, which is crooked; I asked him which way be came by it; he said he took it off the watch; and when he was examined before the justice, he said he had the good fortune to find three guineas in a piece of rag, and he gave fifty shilling for this watch and lockets, and he had thirteen shillings and six pence, and half a crown remaining: he was committed for further examination.</p>
               <p>Delahoy. ( again) I made the watch and sold it to that lady; I know nothing more of the matter.</p>

            . I am one of Mr. Welche's people; I was in the office; I went to Mr. Tollinton's and I went down into the cellar, along with Tollington's servant, to seek for the watch; she said here it is; I saw her pick it up; she gave it me; I went up and searched several of the people; there were two or three chimney sweepers; we tied them hand in hand, and took them to the justice; they were all discharged but this one; when the locket was found, the prisoner said he met a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177110230054"></xptr> person that was looking at the watch to see the time and could not tell, but asked if he could; that he said he could, and asked if he would sell the watch, and he bought it of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing of a chain?</p>
               <p>Bryer. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any thing about the locket?</p>

I said it was a good deal of money for such a watch, I would give him 40 s. for it; he would not let me have it; I then rose to 45 s. I bought it at last for 50 s. I gave him three guineas; he asked if I had a 6 d. I had, and gave it to him, and he gave me a 13 s. 6 d. I found the money by Covent Garden; I have one witness to prove I found the money that saw me pick it up; and another to prove I bought the watch, it was just as it is, with the lockets to it.</p>

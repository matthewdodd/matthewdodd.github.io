                  </hi>. I am principal superintendent of the London, Brighton, and South Coast Railway. The prisoner was head clerk in the booking-office at the London-bridge station—Mr. Francis is the second clerk. I know the funnel through which the tickets pass; it is supplied with tickets from a drawer, where the tickets are placed in rows consecutively—when tickets are required for the runnel they are taken out of the drawer and put into the funnel—they should be taken consecutively as they run—at the close of the proceedings, the number given, will indicate the number of tickets issued from the funnel. In consequence of information I received on 3d Sept. I communicated with Mr. Slight on Tuesday, 4th Sept., but I had examined the drawers from which the tickets are supplied to the funnel, on Monday night—in the course of business the person issuing the tickets has no right to take any tickets from the drawer unless the funnel is exhausted, and then he is to take them consecutively, not promiscuously—on the Monday evening I found the number of tickets that should be in the drawer, was correct, but some of them evidently had been taken out of the drawer and</p>

               <p>used, and returned—in the ordinary course of business none of the tickets in the drawer should bear the stamp of a date—I selected thirty-one of them—these are them—on the greater part of them there is the stamp of the date—it is more visible on some than on others—on the Saturday night previous, I have no doubt that the prisoner had the issuing of the tickets for the Brighton railway by the seven o'clock train—on finding these thirty-one tickets on the Monday, I sent for the prisoner on the Tuesday morning, and for the auditor of the Company—I took the drawer and took out the tickets—I pointed out the tickets I have here now, and laid them on the table—I said to the prisoner, "These tickets have evidently been issued incorrectly out of the drawer, and you must account to me how they were issued"—he hesitated for some time, and then said it was easy to account for it, or words to that effect:" I issued them myself"—I then said he could not carry out the system of thus robbing the Company, unless he had persons to assist him at Brighton, and I named a person, Mr. Springett, a guard, and he said that Springett assisted him in carrying it out—I then said there should be a ticket-collector who was partly concerned in it—I did not mention any name, but he mentioned the name of a ticket-collector, the name of Cheeseman—I then asked him if it was the first time he had done it, or if it was the first time he had been guilty of it, and how the money was disposed of—he said then," jointly, "or that the parties at Brighton would not have joined in it without having part of the money—I then took the prisoner to Brighton, to have it investigated by a Magistrate—I found these thirty-one tickets did not run consecutively—I cannot say what was the lowest number in the drawer which had not been issued, but the lowest number on the books on Saturday was one between 400 and 500, and the funnel only contained about 250, so that the lowest number would be between 700 and 800.</p>

               <p>prisoner's duty to put them into the funnel; whether he had done so I cannot answer—when the funnel becomes vacant it is filled from the drawer—it was the prisoner's duty to fill it, and then the tickets are issued by the clerk from the funnel—it was the prisoner's duty to issue tickets from the desk when the other clerks were off duty—it was his duty to supply the funnel from the drawer—some other clerks may have done it in his absence—the drawer from which these tickets are taken, is accessible to all the clerks on duty in the office, the prisoner having the charge of it—he was head clerk—he had the key of the drawer, and was supposed to lock it when he went away—the other clerks could get the tickets in his absence, by sending to him for the key—it seldom occurred that the funnel would be destitute during one or two trains—it was the duty of the head clerk to supply it—he was the sole person who was answerable for it—he issued the tickets to the passengers for the seven o'clock train that night—he was not out of his regular line of duty—he occasionally served a train—he had the charge then both of the funnel and the train—he was well competent to do the duty—he had not more than his regular duty to perform at that time—it may be that during that train he had not to supply the funnels, or may be none were deficient—the Saturday seven o'clock train is generally a very busy train—there were other clerks there—I cannot say whether they were supplying the trains; I did not take notice—the prisoner served the first and second-class—there may be another clerk who served part of them—I have the book here, to show how many tickets are acknowledged to be issued that night; "on 1st Sept., for the second-class, thirty-eight"—I have not the first-class book here—this book would show all the second-class tickets that were issued that night, if it were correctly kept, and none but the proper number from the funnel had been issued—the prisoner kept this book that night—here is the commencing number, 45, and the closing number is 83, which makes thirty-eight—he charges himself with thirty-eight tickets that night—I have a book which tells the amount of money I received from him that night, but it is not here—the money embezzled for these tickets would not be accounted for—the money was correct to a farthing according to the tickets he accounted for—he accounted to me about a quarter before nine o'clock that night—I cannot tell how much money he paid me.</p>

            . About the 24th of July I saw a man crossing the road towards Bow, with something white; I went and felt it, and found it was cloth; he took the bundle and throwed it at me, and said, take it, you may be d - d, he ran away; then I called to the man at the gate, I brought the bundle there, the same which Mr. Bowering has swore to, being taken from the custody of Mr. Napper.</p>

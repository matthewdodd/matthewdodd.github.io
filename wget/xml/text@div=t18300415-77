On the 17th of March I put down a 5l. note to pay for two glasses of grog, and this was the change of it; it was lying on a table in a public-house - the prisoner took it up; he was quite a stranger - he walked out at the door, I did not stop him; I met his wife at the door - she asked me where I was going - I said after Walker who has gone off with change for a 5l. note; she said she would take me home - I found him there, he said he had not had it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. What house was this? A. The George - I was not quite sober; I left my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183004150048"></xptr>vessel between two and three o'clock - I went to a house as soon as I got my money and had some grog; I do not think I took any spirits neat - I had seen the prisoner on board the ship, looking after lodgers and boarders; he had gone with me to the captain for company - there was only ourselves in the room; I had no money at all when I left the ship in the morning - I had received 6l.; I do not think I could have spent the other pound in the time; but I gave the note to be changed - the change was laid on the table - the prisoner counted it, put it into his pocket, and walked off - I went home with his wife and the other lady, who said, "Do not alarm yourself; no doubt you will find him in the house, and it will all be made right" - I had no other reason for going home with them; I know Mary Long - I have never been to them and said, "One of your girls have taken my money from me; if you will give me 2l. I will say no more about it" - I have received one sovereign, but not two; I have not been to the woman who keeps the house, and said if she would give me another sovereign, or do another thing, I would say no more about it.</p>

            . I met the prisoner's wife, who was looking for her husband; we went to the house and met the prosecutor coming out - he said her husband had taken his change; she said she dare say he was gone home, and she would get him his change - we went home, and he asked him for his change; he said he had no change - he was sitting on a chair, and was in liquor; this was about five minutes after - the prosecutor said he would fetch an officer; Walker said he would give him a sovereign, and he gave him one - he said he had not the change; when the officer came the prisoner ran into the yard - they had bolted the door, and I opened it to let the officer in.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was the prisoner drunk? A. Yes, more so than the prosecutor - I saw the prosecutor come to Mr. Walker afterwards; I did not hear him say,"Some man has taken my money, but who I cannot say;" he made no offer in my presence to Mr. Walker - I had not known the prosecutor before; I did not volunteer to come against the prisoner, nor say any thing about having a quarrel, or I would serve him out; he never did me any harm - I was in a little bit of trouble once about poisoning a sailor, but it was cleared up; I was before a Magistrate once before that - I will not swear I have not been five times at a bar; I never said I would serve Walker out the first opportunity.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. On the 13th of March the prosecutor called on me, and took me to the prisoner's house - when I knocked at the door it was locked, but Long let me in; Walker ran into the privy - I came back for a light, and took him out; I found a Mexican dollar, and some silver and copper on him; I went to the watch-house the next day, and the prisoner had a pen in his hand - he asked me to write a promissory note to pay the prosecutor; I said "It is a thing not allowed, and I will not do it" - I took the prosecutor, and had him bound over; Walker's wife kept him away, and the prisoner was remanded; the prosecutor was sober, but had been drinking.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where did you go? A. To Walker's, within three or four minutes after the prosecutor told me of it - I had known him before; I found no sovereign on him.</p>

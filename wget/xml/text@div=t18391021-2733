                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's wife, and live in Boston-street Hackney—he is a bricklayer—I have been married to him sixteen year, We had a few friends to take refreshment at our lodging on the anniversary of our wedding-day, and I became intoxicated—the prisoner was not quite Sober—he went out with my friends on their way home, and then returned—I called him very bad names, which irritated him—I was in fault, and I thought that would hide it—was not much intoxicated when be went out as when returned—I had been drinking in company with Robert Bentley, who works with my husband—when the prisoner came home be found Bentley upstairs in the bed room—I began to call my husband bad names, as I thought it would prevent his seeing the person—I got up and struck my husband, and he hit me, I think with his hand—I did not know that I was wounded till long after the words were over—I do not know how it was done, nor who did it—I was undressed when he came home—he had been absent more than an hour, but I was in that state, I cannot tell the time—a better husband could never be than he was—he did not do any thing to the man—I believe he saw him—I found my arm was bleeding after some time—I neither knew how or when it was done, or who did it—I never had any pain from it, nor has it been any hinderance to me—when I went into the House of Correction the doctor looked at it, and said it was nothing—the knife that was produced at Worship-street was turned up against the bone of my shoulder as the doctor thought, but it was turned up with cutting a leaden bob which he does his work with, some time before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. Between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, on the 22nd of September, I saw four or fire person come out of the prisoner's house—the prisoner followed behind them—I saw him return in ten or fifteen minutes—it was not an hour—I heard a quar<lb></lb>relling in the house—he was calling his wife a waste and she was calling him a drunken scoundrel—this continued until three o'clock in the morn<lb></lb>ing, when I heard the cry of "Police," "Murder"—I ran to the place and looking up at the bed-room window saw the blood streaming down from it—I tried to burst the door open, but it was bolted inside the prisoner I believe opened it—I found his right arm covered with blood I said, "What have you done? what is the matter?"—he said, "I have killed my wife"—he "said he had found a man in bed with her, and he had stabbed her—the woman said, "I am murdered "—I found the prisoner had no knife in his hand—I sprang my rattle for assistance, <hi rend="italic">sent</hi> for a doctor, and in a box I found a common white-handled knife I said to the prisoner, "Is that the knife?"—he said, "No, it was my own clasp-knife that I took out of my pocket, and did it with "—I asked the woman where the knife was—she said he had thrown it behind the bed I at last found it on the floor, and the prisoner said, "That is the knife—I have got the woman's bed-gown—here are two cuts towards the last shoulder—there are spots of blood on the knife, and the point of the blade</p>

I live in Trafalgar-place East, Hackney-road—between three and four o'clock on the morning in question I was called on to attend the prosecutrix in bed—she was in an excited state, and bleeding at the left shoulder, where I found two wounds—one was more than an inch deep, and nearly half an inch wide—they were rather dangerous—I probed them, and it is my opinion one of them reached the bone—the knife pro<lb></lb>duced would inflict such wounds—the point would be, bent by coming in contact with the shoulder-bone.</p>

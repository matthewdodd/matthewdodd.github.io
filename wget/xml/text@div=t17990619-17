               <p>Q. Then, if he took them, it must be at another time? - A. It must be at another time; no other person came into the shop with him.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH NORTON sworn. - I stopped the prisoner at the bar with the things upon him, in his apron, on the 4th of June, about five minutes before six o'clock, he was going up Butcher-row, East-Smithfield; I suspected him, having seen him a number of days about the neighbourhood; he said the goods belonged to his father, that he would give them up to no man, or go with any man; he afterwards altered his tone, and said, that two boys that were with him had given him them to carry to Tower-hill; I sent for an officer, and delivered the goods into his custody, and went to Mr. Dresser.</p>
               <p>JOHN THOMPSON sworn. - I am headborough; The things were delivered to me, and have been in my possession ever since. (The goods were produced, and sworn to).</p>

               <p>Q. Was it near the door that any person passing could see the robbery? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. No person walking past could see it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was going along the street, and two boys asked me to go into the shop and ask what was the price of a pair of stockings like mine; I said, my stockings were not big enough for them; they said, they had a brother as big as me, and my stockings would sit him; I went in, and asked, and when I came out, they gave me a shilling, and the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179906190019"></xptr>things to carry for them, and told me to say they were my father's; I was going along, and this gentleman stopped me; and I said they were my father's, and how that two boys gave them to me to carry; they both run away, and left me, and the gentleman took me before the Justice. I have one witness, my father is not here.</p>

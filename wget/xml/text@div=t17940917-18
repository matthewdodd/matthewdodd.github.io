            Why do you think the prisoner took them? - Because I have sufficient proof that he threw them out of his pocket running across the field; I did not see him; I was at dinner; I got the things again; I know them to be my property; they are here.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner a fellow workman with you? - No; I never changed a word with the man in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after was he taken? - In the course of twenty minutes, or it may be less.</p>

               <p>This Haylock works for me as a journeyman; at this time I was going home, and I perceived the shop door open, I went into the shop, and finding my back door open, I did not know but some one might have gone back for convenience; there was another person with me, and he presently hallooed out stop thief! and the prisoner was pursued by him; in the middle of the field he was seen to take something out of his pocket, I saw him; I cannot say they are the two planes, but I saw him take out somethings while he was pursued, and he threw them on the grass.</p>
               <p>Q. How far from him was you? - About one hundred yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go up to the place immediately? - No, I kept in pursuit after him till he was taken, I did not see what he threw down till I returned with the prisoner, which might be full twenty minutes after, or more, and there were three planes in that place, two where I saw him take some thing out of his pocket, and the other at some little distance. The plow I did not see thrown down, but three of the moulding planes I did; Haylock was with me when I picked them up.(Produced.)</p>
               <p>Haylock. They are all my property.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Was you present when he was taken? - I was not, I lost fight of him for some little time.</p>

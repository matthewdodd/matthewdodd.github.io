               <p>Q. In a short time after she came into your service had you occasion to reprove her - A. I had, about three weeks after she came.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181504050021"></xptr>Q. What was the occasion that you reproved her - A. I observed her one night go into the young men's room partly undressed. I said it was very indecent of her to go into the young men's room thus undressed.</p>
               <p>Q. What age were the young men - A. I suppose seventeen or eighteen years old.</p>
               <p>Q. How many of them were they - A. Two; I reproved her severely the next morning for her conduct; I threatened to discharge her, and gave her warning to quit; but she shewed contrition for it. I forgave her, and retained her; that passed over.</p>
               <p>Q. What was her department after that for the remaining month - A. I observed that she failed in the respect that she before paid me, and appeared extremely sullen.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she, after this, say any thing to you upon the subject of yeast dumplings - A. She did; a fortnight before the transaction she requested me to let her make some yeast dumplings, professing to be a capital hand. That request very frequently was made. On Monday, the 20th of March, she came into the dining-room, and said the brewer had brought some yeast.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you given any order to the brewer to bring any yeast - A. Oh, no. I told her I did not wish to trouble the man, that was not the way I had them made, I generally had the dough of the baker, that saved the cook a good deal of trouble, and was always considered best, but as the man had brought a little yeast, on the next day she might make some. On Tuesday morning the 21st, I, as usual, went into the kitchen. I told her she might make some; but before she made the dumplings, to make a beefsteak pye for the dinner of the young men; and as she would have to leave the kitchen to get the steaks, I did not wish her to leave the kitchen after the dumplings were made. I told her I wished them to be mixed with milk and water. She said she would do them as I desired her. This was about half past eleven; she carried the pye to the baker's before the kneading of the dough commenced. I told her, I wished her not to leave the dough, that she might carry the pye to the baker's. She carried the pye to the baker's near twelve. I went into the kitchen after she had been to the baker's; I gave directions about making the dough. I said, I suppose there is no occasion for me stopping; she said, Oh, no, she knew very well how to do it. Then I went up stairs. In about half an hour I went into the kitchen again; I then found the dough made; it was set before the fire to rise.</p>
               <p>Q. What other servant have you - A. Another maid; her name is 
               <persName id="t18150405-18-person241">

             orders to go into the bed room to repair a counterpane. I am certain that during the time the dough was made no person was in the kitchen but the prisoner; this was about half past twelve; we dine at three, the young men at two. From half past twelve to three I was in the kitchen two or three times, until the dough was made up into dumplings.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the dough - A. It remained in a pan before the fire to rise; I observed it never did rise. I took off the cloth, and looked at it. My observation was it had not risen, and it was in a very singular position, in which position it remained until it was divided into dumplings. It was not put into the pan as I have seen dough; its shape was singular; it retained that shape to the last. I am confident it never was meddled with after it had been put there.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time was the dividing the dough into dumplings - A. I suppose about twenty minutes before twelve. I was not in the kitchen at the time; I had been in the kitchen half an hour before that time.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you remark to the prisoner the singular appearance of the dough - A. I did not remark to her the singular appearance; I told her it never had risen; the prisoner said it would rise before she wanted it.</p>
               <p>Q. How many dumplings would there be - A. Six; the prisoner had divided it into six dumplings. About three o'clock I sat down to dinner; the dumplings were brought upon the table. I told the other servant they were black and heavy, instead of white and light.</p>

               <p>Q. Who sat down to dinner with you - Mr. Haldebart Turner, myself, and my husband. I helped Mr. Haldebart Turner and my husband to some dumpling, and took a small piece myself. I found myself affected in a few minutes in the stomach after I had eaten; I did not eat a quarter of a dumpling; I felt myself very faint, and an extreme burning pain, which increased every minute. It became so bad I was obliged to leave the table I went up stairs.</p>
               <p>JURY. You eat nothing else - A. I eat a bit of beef steak that the prisoner had cooked. When I went up stairs I perceived my sickness had increased and my head was swollen extremely. I reached very violently; I wondered none of the family come up to my assistance; I was half an hour alone. When I came down I found my husband's father very bad, and my husband. I was ill from half past three till nine, sick and reaching; at nine it abared, but did not cease; my chest was swollen; we called in a gentleman near, and afterwards Mr. Marshall, the surgeon.</p>

             left the room indisposed. She went up stairs; we did not then know she was very ill. Some time afterwards my son left the room, and went down stairs. I followed him shortly afterwards, and went into the parlour below. Coming out I met my son at the foot of the stairs; he told me had been very sick, and had brought up his dinner. I found his eyes were exceedingly swollen, very much indeed. I said, I thought it very extraordinary; I was taken ill myself in less than three minutes afterwards; the effect was so violent, that I had hardly time to get into the yard before my dinner came up. I felt considerable heat across my stomach and chest, and pain.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the vomitting of a common kind - A. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181504050022"></xptr>never experienced any thing before like it for violence; I was terribly irritated; it was not more than a quarter of an hour my apprentice Roger Gadsell was taken very ill in a similar way to myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your son sick also - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner give any of you any assistance while you were sick - A. None in the least.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe whether the prisoner eat any dumplings - A. I did not; I had suspicion of arsenic; I made a search the next morning; I found a brown dish or a pan that the dumplings had been mixed in; there appeared to be the leavings of the dumplings in it; I put some water into the pan, and stired it up with a spoon, with a view to form a liquid of the whole; I found upon the pan being set down for half a minute, upon my taking it up slowly, and in a slanting direction; I discovered a white powder at the bottom; I shewed it to several persons in the house; I kept it in my custody, and shewed it to Mr. Marshell when he came; no person had access to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any arsenic - A. Yes; I kept it in a drawer in the office: any person might have access to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you happen to know whether the prisoner can road - A. I believe she can read and write.</p>
               <p>Q. To Mrs. Turner. Is that so - A. She can read and write very well.</p>
               <p>Q. To Mr. Turner. Was that drawer locked or open - A. It always has remained open.</p>
               <p>Q. Who lit the fire in that office, do you know - A. It was the prisoner's duty to do so; waste paper was kept in that drawer; she might properly resort to that drawer for paper to light her fire. I saw that paper of arsenic in that drawer on the 7th of March, never after that time; I heard of it being missed about a fortnight before the 21st of March. I observed that the knives and the forks that we had to eat the dumplings with were black; there was no vinegar used in the sauce at all. I have two of them in my pocket to shew, (witness producing two of the knives,) I saw them with this black upon them the next day; on the next day I asked the prisoner how she came to introduce any ingrediants into the dumplings that were so prejudicial to us; she replied that it was not in the dumplings, but it was in the milk that

I had several discourses with her on that day on this subject; during the whole of which, she persisted that it was the milk, as before described, that milk had been used for the sauce only; the prisoner made the dumplings with the refuse of the milk that had been left at breakfast. I asked the prisoner if any person but herself had mixed or had any thing to do with the dumplings; she expressly said no.</p>

I went into the kitchen between three and four in the afternoon; I had dined at two; I observed there a plate on the table with a dumpling and a half; I took a knive and fork up, and was going to cut it to eat it; the prisoner exclaimed, Gadsdell, do not eat that, it is cold and heavy, it will do you no good; I eat a piece about as big as a walnut; there was a small quantity of sauce in the boat; I put a bit of bread in it, and sepped it up, and eat it; this might be twenty minutes after three.

             came into the office soon after, and said, he was very ill. I was taken ill about ten minutes after but not so ill as to vomit. In consequence of the distress the family were in, I was sent off to Mrs. Turner, the mother; I was very sick going and com- coming back; I thought I should die.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner made you any yeast dumplings the night before - A. She had; I partook of them, and the other maid; they were light and white; quite different from these dumplings.</p>
               <p>Q. Who made the fire in the office - A. The prisoner; nobody could get into the office until I did; any person might go into the office in the day; at night it was locked; loose paper was kept in the drawer where the arsenic was kept. I seeing her going to that drawer, it would not strike me as any thing extraordinary; I should not watch to see what she did there.</p>

            . Upon this melancholy occasion I was sent for: when I arrived, I found my husband, son, and daughter, extremely ill, and soon after I came, the prisoner was sick, and vomitting; I exclaimed, oh, these devilish dumplings, supposing they had done the mischief; she said not the dumplings, but the milk, ma'm; I asked her what milk she meaned; she said the halfpenny worth of milk that Sally had fetched to make the sauce.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say who had made the sauce - A. My daughter. I said that cannot be, it could not be the sauce; she said, yes; Gadsdell had but a very little bit of the dumpling, not bigger than a nut; but he had licked up three parts of a boat of sauce with a bit of bread.</p>
               <p>Q. To Mrs. Turner. Was any of the sauce made with the milk that Sarah fetched - A. It was; I mixed it, and left it for Eliza to make.</p>

            . I am a surgeon. On the evening of the 21st of March, I was sent for at Mr. Turner's family in a great hurry; I got there a quarter before nine o'clock; I found Mr. Turner and Mrs. Turner very ill; the symptoms were such as would be produced by arsenic; I have no doubt of it by the symptoms; the prisoner also was ill, that was caused by the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Haldebart Turner shew you a dish or pan the next morning - A. He did; I examined the dish; I washed it with a tea-kettle of warm water, I first stand it, and let it subside; I decanted it off, I found half a tea spoon of white powder; I washed it a second time; I decidedly found it to be arsenic.</p>





               <p>Q. Will arsenic if it is cut with a knife, will it produce on the knife the colour of blackness - A. I have no doubt of it; I examined the remains of the yeast; there was no arsenic in that.</p>

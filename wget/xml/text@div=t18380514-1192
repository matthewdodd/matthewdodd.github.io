About eight o'clock in the evening of the 10th of April, I heard some one getting out of the hedge which surrounds the prosecutor's garden, and soon after saw the prisoner come running down the lawn adjoining—he came running down by me—he stepped back, and ran into the prosecutor's ground again—I followed him—he then said, "It is the policeman"—I said "Yes"—he said he was coming to look for a brother of his—I said this was not the way, why did not he go to the front door—I then left him, and went to inquire what they had lost—they said three shirts—I went after him, knowing him, and found him in Hampstead, with one shirt on him—I asked him where the others were—he said "Why did not you take the other two?"—I said, "Who were the two?"—he said, "Douse and Grissell"—he said that he took two shirts, and Douse one—he gave one to Grissell, and they had all one a-piece.</p>

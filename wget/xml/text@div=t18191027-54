            , Lincoln's Inn. On the 9th of August last, by his directions, I enclosed the halves of two 10 l. bank notes in a letter; I have the two other halves, which were sent on the 5th, and duly received. I got them from Mr. Knapp, to whom they were directed.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this letter - A. This is the letter I wrote on the 9th, directed to Mr. Knapp, Wreslingworth, near Potton, Bedfordshire.

I wafered the letter, and carried it to the receiving office in Chancery-lane, myself.</p>

            , ESQ. I am superintendent president at the General Post Office. On the 9th of August the prisoner was employed in the Post Office, as a charger of letters, and had an opportunity of taking any letter brought to the office that night.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of suspicion which arose, was he on the evening of the 9th of August brought into your office - A. He was, and Vickery searched him.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this letter - A. It was found in his pocket, it was then wafered, and had not been opened; it had the stamp of that night on it, and contained the halves of two 10 l. notes, which it does now - I saw them marked. Mr. Parkins asked him how he became possessed of it? I think he gave no answer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It could not have come into his hands in the course of his employment - A. Any letter might come into his hands in the course of his employ; he was a charger of letters. This has not been charged.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you undertake to say it came into his possession in the course of his employment - A. No doubt of it. It is stamped, and ought to have been charged. He was brought into my office between seven and eight o'clock. The letters go at eight.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The stamping is done before it comes to the charger - A. Yes, my Lord; but the stamping is a proof that it came into the General Post Office - they are stamped in our office.</p>
               <p>Q. Is a person who is skilled in letters, able to tell whether they have bank notes in them - A. It is our duty to look at the letters, to see if bank notes are in them. We have a strong lamp, with a reflector, and by holding a letter under that lamp we can see, without any difficulty, whether they have an inclosure or not - this would be charged a treble letter. It is the duty of the charger to ascertain that.</p>
               <p>Q. Probably, when a charger saw it, he would not be<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181910270030"></xptr>able to tell whether there were one or two notes - A. It requires experience.</p>
               <p>(The notes were then put in and read, Nos. 19002, dated 30th of June, 1819, and 2292 dated 16th of July, 1819.)</p>

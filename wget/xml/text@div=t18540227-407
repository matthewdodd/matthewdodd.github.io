                  </hi>. I lodged, at the time this happened, at No. 13, Stephen-street, Tottenham-court-road. The prisoner is my husband; he is a cabinet maker—we have been married turned six years—on Sunday, 5th Feb., I was putting the supper on the table, and my husband was sitting having his supper—I did not give him in charge, and I do not know who did—I very much aggravated him, and it was all my own fault—I said he had been down stairs for nearly half an hour, and sending out for hall and half, and many aggravating words besides—I would not sit down to my supper, but stood up, aggravating my husband, and he got up in a passion and struck me on the forehead—I was so agitated, that I do not know whether he had anything in his hand—I did not look at his hand—I had laid him a knife and fork—he was having some <hi rend="italic">corned</hi> beef—I bled—the woman down stairs came up.</p>

                  </hi>. My husband is a scagliola manufacturer; we live in the same house as the last witness—on this Sunday night, about 9 o'clock, I heard a noise; Mrs. Pressley called out, "Mrs. Gaul, come up;" I went up, and met her in the workshop, bleeding from a wound on the forehead—she said, "My husband did it with a knife"—the prisoner said, "Do not be alarmed, Mrs. Gaul, she is only doing it to frighten you"—he was partaking of his supper at the time—the prosecutrix had her hand up to her head with a towel.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What part of the forehead was it; was it high up? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I took the towel away—she asked me to take her to the hospital—she had been aggravating her husband the whole of the day, and so she had the Saturday previous; I heard her—he came down into my room on Sunday afternoon, because he would not have any more words with his wife; he brought the children with him—he gave the little girl half a sovereign to take up to her mother, and said, "Ask your mother to get me some tea, and something to eat," but she would not get it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon to the Middlesex Hospital. On this Sunday night, about 10 o'clock, I saw the prosecutrix sitting in a chair in the surgery, bleeding considerably from wounds on the forehead and face—I found two wounds on her forehead, one going almost across it, from above, downwards, and the other passing directly downwards—there was a wound on the eyebrow, and one over the cheek bone—one of the wounds on the face appeared to be continued from the forehead—they had been inflicted with some sharp cutting instrument, such as a knife—I found three bruises about the body; I did not examine the whole of the body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was she in a dangerous state? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; the only danger was from hemorrhage.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came she to be so long in the hospital? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is the custom of the hospital to keep patients till Tuesday; she was not well on the first Tuesday, and was kept till the second—the two wounds on the forehead were cut to the bone; they must have been inflicted by two blows; they could not have been inflicted with the same stroke of the knife—the two on the face might have been inflicted with the same movement of the arm, but if so, the patient must have moved.</p>

We occupied the shop, parlour, one room on the second-floor, and the garrett. On the 24th of December last, I shook up my bed and left it; I did not go up again until seven o'clock in the evening; I left the room, with my bed clothes, and every thing else, quite safe. I do not know as to the door; I generally lock it, but am not certain that I locked it at that time, I took the key out of it as though it was locked; it shuts and catches with a brass handle - I can say it was shut and latched, and the articles stated in the indictment were in the room. I left the room at twelve o'clock. On going up stairs and putting the key in the door, I found it was unlocked, and missed the box with the articles already enumerated. I told my husband of it, and gave them up as lost until I saw them advertized in the paper.</p>

On the 24th of December, about a quarter after four o'clock in the afternoon, I received information, and went to Vine-street, Chandos-street, to a one pair of stairs back-room; I found the door fast, and knocked, the persons within refused to open it; I forced it open, and found the prisoners, and

               <p>SARAH PERRY. I live in Vine-street, Covent-garden, at the house which Edwards has spoken of. I asked the prisoner, Daniels, to drink tea with me about a quarter before three o'clock; I never saw the other prisoner there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the other prisoner before to-day - A. I saw him on the 24th of December; I went out, and when I returned I found him in the room; I do not know how he came there - I had been out for some butter, when I returned the box was in the chair, I had not seen it there before-it was open. I did not hear the prisoners say any thing about it. Just as I got up the stairs the officers came in at the door, and I went in and locked the door. I did not see what was in the box, but the things were on the ground; the officer said they were counterpanes and sheets. I never saw the prisoner, Smith, before that day, and asked him how he came in my room. I had invited Daniels to tea that morning.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>DANIELS'S Defence. Perry asked me to tea; I was going there, and met the prisoner, Smith, with a box, which, he said, he was going to take to the Golden Cross; I told him after he had been there to come to tea at Perry's, as I was going there. He came and said he had let the box fall, and wanted to replace the things. The officer burst open the door before I could open it.</p>
               <p>SMITH'S Defence. A man asked me to carry the box; I carried it as far as Crown-street, where I met Daniels.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181801140008"></xptr>I lost the man who gave it to me to carry. I pitched the box at the bottom of St. Martin's-lane, the lock broke open, and I took it to the house to replace the things.</p>

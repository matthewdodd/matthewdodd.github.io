I went down to Battle-bridge, and I found one horse in my stable, and the other gone; but I never saw the prisoner till I saw him at the Police-office; I called at the watch-house of St. Andrew's, and heard that he was there, but I did not see him; I saw my gelding at Queen-square, having notice given me to attend; I am certain it was my gelding.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you given him these things or given him any orders about the horse? - None at all.</p>
               <p>Q. When this your horse was lost this man was in your service? - No, I made him lock up my two horses at five o'clock, and discharged him immediately; and I ordered him to give me the key, and told him I had no further occasion for him. I had a sufficient reason for discharging him; I met him with my property on his back carrying it away, and I made him carry it back, and put it in the stable, and locked the door, and took the key of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any violence at the stable door? - The staple was pulled out and broke, it was fastened with a padlock.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He was not my employer, he had nothing to do with me, his son was my master; he gave me a key, and he had another key for himself; one of the horses had his legs swelled, and he told me to walk him about, I took him down to Fleet-market; I went for my shirt, and I got myself drinking, he had nothing to do with me.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I have a son, but this man was employed by me. I hired him, and I gave my son money to pay him.</p>
               <p>Court to Wood. What time was this horse brought to you? - About a quarter past seven on Sunday evening, the 4th of November.</p>
               <p>Court to Francis. I think you did not see the gelding till Tuesday? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to see it till Tuesday? - I was informed where he was, and my son went to see him; I could not leave my shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Who carried the gelding to the office? - Mr Wood the hostler.</p>
               <p>Court to Wood. Was that the gelding you received of the prisoner? - It was.</p>

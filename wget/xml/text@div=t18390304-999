                  </hi>. I am a jeweller, and live at No. 199, Strand. On the 12th of February the prisoner came into my shop with a little boy, and asked to see a coral snap—I took out the tray, on which were various rings, wedding-rings, and snaps—the little boy kept looking over the tray, and the prisoner also—he wanted a different kind of snap—the prisoner at last bought one for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., at the same time saying he wanted another one, which I promised to get him in a few days—on the 14th he and the boy came again—he asked if I had got the snap—I said I had not—he asked to see some ear-wires—they were on the tray which he had seen before—I. produced the tray—he bought a pair, and paid me 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for them—as soon as he had gone out I missed six wedding-rings—I had seen them while he was in the shop, and the moment he went out I missed them—I went out immediately in search of him, but could not find him—on the evening of the 22nd he and the boy came again—I was then by myself—the prisoner asked me, "Have you got the brooch?"—I said, "I believe my boy has got it"—I rang my bell, and went between the pri<lb></lb>soner and the street-door—my boy came up—I told him to send my neighbour in from next door—the prisoner immediately sent me forcibly out into the middle of the street—I had not made any charge whatever, or said any thing—I just turned my head to see if my neighbour was coming, when he forced me into the middle of the street, and ran out with the boy—I ran after him, calling "Stop thief"—he was stopped in Holywell-street, and taken to Bow-street.</p>

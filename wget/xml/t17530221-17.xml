The prisoner came for a lodging at the same place, and my landlord let him he with me.

(He names them all over.) They were all in the room when I went out that morning. Upon missing the things I called my landlord up, who saw the box was broke open. I never saw the prisoner afterwards, till I saw him in New Prison taken up on another account . I shewed him the paper whereon I had set down the things I lost; he then owned to me and my landlord, he took every thing mentioned, except the watch, and said he was a dying man (meaning for his other offence) and I might do as I pleased, and if I'd come another day he'd let us know where the things were; we went three or four times, but he put me off from time to time, and would not tell me where they were.</p>

            . On the 17th day of September the prisoner came to my house and asked me if he could have a lodging, and said he was going to work for a jeweller in Turnstile ; I told him he might lodge with a man in my house ( meaning the prosecutor) but I would enquire after his character; this being on the Sunday night I let him be there that night, intending on the morrow to go and enquire after his character where he had directed me. John Cooper went out in the morning to work as usual. I thought the prisoner lay a long time, so I went up stairs about nine o'clock and found he was gone. Then I went to enquire as he had directed, and found there was no such person as a jeweller near Turnstile as he had said, but having<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175302210012"></xptr> seen the prisoner at my house with a porter about two years ago, I went and found him, and enquired after the prisoner, who told me he was born in Shoe-lane, and that his father and mother lived there.

Then I and another young man went into the country as far as Gravesend; I staid there about five nights and lodged at the Angel; then we came to town, and when I came to my mother's I was told Mr. Wilkerson had been there, and said I had robbed a man of his cloaths.</p>

The prisoner came to take a lodging of me the 31st of July last, and we agreed; he said he was a lawyer's clerk; he sat down in the room where I was at work above stairs next room to that he had taken, and fell to writing immediately . There was a crimson waistcoat laced with silver, he took it up with his hand and said it was a flashy waistcoat, who does it be long to? then he said to me, I suppose you think we write very strangely, but we write that which people can't understand that they should not know what we are doing; he sealed it up in another sheet of paper, and said, can you recommend me to an honest person that can carry this to No. 5 in Gray's Inn, and he'd give them a shilling; he had told me his father's name was Morris, a goldsmith, at the corner of Salisbury Court ; I thought I might as well earn that shilling myself, then I could call on his father to enquire of his character as I went to No. 5. The gentleman unclosed the letter, and said, what rogue has sent this to me? said I, he tells me he is your clerk; said he, he is a rogue, let him be what he will, I ran home again as fast as I could, having been absent about a quarter of an hour. When I came home I went up stairs, and out of a chest missed my waistcoat made of silk and cotton.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the chest locked before?</p>
               <p>Hustenson. No, it was not; I there found an old hat and mine gone ; then I looked about and missed the said waistcoat before mentioned and a pair of nankeen breeches; the worsted waistcoat trimm'd with silver belonged to Mr. Hardwick. They were all in the room when I went out with the letter, but have never seen them since. I heard he was taken up about a month after and was in Clerkenwell prison, so I went there to see him, and he acknowledged he had taken them and delivered the goods to a woman to pawn, and said, if I'd be easy and make no disturbance he'd help me to them again, but I never could get him to help me to them.</p>

             . I am wife to the prosecutor, and remember the prisoner coming to take lodgings that day; my husband went out and left him in the room; I was in the yard opposite the stair-foot, and saw the prisoner go out a little time after my husband was gone, his cloaths seemed more bulky behind than they did when he came. I am certain nobody went up the stairs till my husband returned, having fight of the stairs all the time; the prisoner told me at going out he wanted a quire of paper, and wanted to know where a stationer lived, and I directed him to go into Holborn, but he came no more .</p>

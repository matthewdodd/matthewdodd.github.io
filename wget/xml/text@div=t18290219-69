The prisoner came to consult me on the 31st of January, and was shewn into the surgery; this case laid on the shelf, within his reach - he staid there five or ten minutes: I went to tell my young man what to make up for him, and he followed me out of the surgery into the shop - he said he wasted to go over the way, and would return in a few minutes for the medicine; he went out, and in five or six minutes I missed the case - nobody else had been in the surgery: he did not come back - I saw him again in about a week or ten days, in custody: I had applied to an officer, and described him- I found my instruments at Mr. Farrow's, a salesman, in Fleet-market, on the Wednesday after the robbery.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Have you made inquiry about him? A. Yes, and find he was in a most abject state of distress; I believe he really wanted my advice.</p>

            . I am a constable. I apprehended the prisoner on the 8th of February, in Grove-terrace, Paddington: he said he was guilty: I found he was in very great distress - he has a wife and child.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What age is the child? A. Six months - they were laying on straw; I found nothing there but duplicates of necessary clothing: they had but 5d. - he must have been in great distress.</p>

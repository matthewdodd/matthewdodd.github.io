               <p>before going into the kitchen he put his hand into the front kitchen which was facing the foot of the kitchen stairs, and got a bundle of rope that must have been lying on the dresser; be got it in the dark, as if he knew where to put his hand upon it—the box stood in the back kitchen, under the wall, on the left-hand side—he said "I want that box corded"—I said "It don't require cording, it will stand in the bottom of the van"—he said he would have the box corded, and he would cord it himself—he went to cord it round the middle—I told him that was the wrong way—I took the cord out of his hand, and made a loop at the end, and put it under the box—after I had got the rope round over the lock, and under the box, I picked the other end of the box up with my left hand on its end, to make a half hitch with the rope underneath, and I felt something was on my hand—I looked at it by the candle-light, and saw it was blood—the prisoner stood on my right, and Mrs. Middleton on my left—I said to the prisoner "What does that mean?"—I had then got the box out about 2 ft from the wall, and looking on the floor, I saw that there was a pool of blood when I had lifted the box from—I asked the prisoner a second time what it meant—he never answered me—I asked Mrs. Middleton if she knew what was in the box, as there was something not quite right, I thought—the prisoner could hear everything I said—he was wearing a light coat at the time, but-toned by the top button—he did not stop to unbutton it, but wrenched it off over his head, and threw it down into the blood, and then stamped upon it—all this time I had got the box up on its end, resting on my hip—the woman Green stood at the foot of the stairs—I told the prisoner I should not remove the box until he showed me what was inside it—Green, at this stage ran up stairs, the prisoner followed her, and I followed him—he stopped on the middle of the stairs, and said "Go back and cord that box"—I said "Not me"—he stamped his foot on the stairs, and said "Go back, you carman, and cord the box, and do your work"—I said "I shall not, I don't mean losing you, I don't mean to lose sight of you"—when he said "Go back and cord that box "be lost his accent—that was the first time I noticed him not talk like a Frenchman; he talked like an Englishman, as I am talking now; he appeared to lose his temper—he then walked out into Paulton's Square, and turned to the left, towards the King's Road—as he was going up the Square he put on the coat which he had picked out of the blood—he had picked it up as he passed between the box and the wall, as he followed the woman to go up stains, and he put it on going up the Square—he walked on my right up the Square to the King's Road—I saw a constable standing under the lamp-post—it was then raining very hard—I went up to the con<lb></lb>stable, and told him my name, and where I lived—the prisoner was with me, by my side—I told the constable the way in which the prisoner had employed me that night to remove some luggage, and all that I had seen in the kitchen, and the way the prisoner had behaved in cording the box, and I told him to take charge of him, and not to lose him—the constable would not lay hold of him—we walked down to the house, No. 15, again, a distance of fifteen houses—the constable was about to go into the house, and I touched him on the shoulder, and told him if he went into the house we should lose the man—I then said to a man I had with me "Run, George, up to the station, and tell them to send some more men down to 15, Paulton's Square; tell them who sent you"—we were all standing still then, outside the house, at the foot of the steps—after I had sent for more police the prisoner got very fidgetty, and walked backwards and forwards for the</p>

On Wednesday night, 11th May, about 10 o'clock, I went sent for to 15, Paulton's Square—as I was going, I met the prisoner, the witness Cole, and Piper—I sent a constable to the station with the prisoner and Cole, and went with Piper to 15, Paulton's Square—I went down stairs with him, and he showed me a green box—it was locked, and had this piece of cord put round it once—I moved the box, and saw a quantity of blood on the spot that I moved it from—I then took a poker from the fire-place, and broke the box open, and in it I found the body of a female—I found she was cold—I sent for a doctor—Dr. Ryder attended in a few minutes—on moving the body, I found this piece of cord round her neck—after taking it off the neck, I put it together with the other cord that was round the box, and found that it corresponded—it appeared to have been cut—it was the same sort of cord—I took it off the neck—it was tied very tightly, and the knot was just under the ear—it was suffi-ciently tight to cause strangulation—the blood came from the mouth and nose of the female—it had run down the side of the box—the box was 2 ft. 11 in. long, 1 ft. 6 in. wide, and 1 ft. 7 in. deep—it was an old box, painted green, a wooden one, and no covering to it—I afterwards searched the place up stairs—I found a quantity of bedding tied up, ready to be removed—I then went to the station, and asked the Inspector on duty whether any key was found on the prisoner—the prisoner was then lying down in the room—I don't know whether he understood or not—I received a bunch of keys from Inspector Tarlton—I went back to the house, and found that one of the keys unlocked the box—I produce it—I took it off the bunch.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman T</hi> 194). I have been two years in the force—on Wednesday night, 11th May, I was on duty in Paulton's Square, about 10 o'clock, and saw the prisoner and Piper at the top of Paulton's Square, against the King's Road—Piper said that he had been employed by the prisoner to remove a box from 15, Paulton's Square, and when he was moving it he got his hand all over blood, and be believed there was something wrong, he wished me to go down and see what was the matter—as soon as Piper said there was something wrong, the prisoner repeated "Something wrong, something wrong," about three times—when I got to 15, Paulton's Square with the prisoner, I wanted him to go inside the house, all three of us to go in together, to see what was the matter—he would not go in—he did not say a word, but he turned round from the door as though be would rather go back—he did not go in—I said to Piper "We had better get someone else, and see what is the matter," and Piper sent off his roan to the police-station for another constable—after the man had been gone about three minutes, the prisoner became restless, and began to walk back-wards and forwards past the door, and when in the direction of Danvan Street, leading to the water-side, he suddenly made a bolt, and ran about 400 yards, I should say—he went to step off the kerb, and tripped up—he threw off his coat and hat as soon as he started to run; his hat was off and on the ground in an instant almost—he took it off, and threw it on the ground with all his force, and then took his coat off—he was wearing two coats—I believe the overcoat was underneath—he had a light one over the black coat—it was the light coat he took off, and threw down—the one he had underneath was a kind of waterproof, dark colour—I did not pick it up—I ran after him—Piper got up to him first, a few yards before me, about twenty yards, I might say—I then said to Piper "We will take him now; I don't want anything else. I know he has done something wrong, or ha would not run away," and I took him to the police-station—I searched him there, and found on him 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold, 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, 5 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in bronze, a cork-screw, two knives, a pipe, pencil case, spectacles in case (only one pair), three gloves, a common ring, and an abstract of the title-deeds of 24, Wel-lington Square, Chelsea—I produce the things—the abstract of the title was in the breast pocket of the under coat that he had on when he threw the light coat off, it was all over blood—I also found a rent-book and a silk handkerchief, and two envelopes addressed to "Miss Boss, 15, Paulton's Square"—some pieces of glass were smashed up in his trowsers pocket—it appeared that a bottle had been broken in his pocket—I found this card on the prisoner, which was produced yesterday, and shown to Bartlett, but I can't say positively which pocket I took it out of—I saw a bunch of keys at the station—I found those on the prisoner, I gave all the property up to Inspector Tarlton.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of 182, King's Road, Chelsea—on Friday afternoon, 13th May, I was sent for to 24, Wellington Square—when I got there I found the body of the deceased gentleman in the back kitchen—I had known him when alive—this rope was tied tightly round the neck, the knot coming under the right ear, quite tight enough to cause strangulation—there was blood on the right side of the head—I made no further examination at that time—on the following day I made a <hi rend="italic">post<lb></lb>mortem</hi> examination—I examined the head very minutely, and after a time found two small holes behind the right ear, from which the brain matter protruded—I removed the skin, and found the bone of the skull underneath fractured—I then opened the head, and found the inner plate of the bone of the skull fractured also—the holes were rather less than an inch apart—they must have been caused by a sharp, pointed instrument, also a heavy instrument—the holes were not so large as a pea in size—they would be caused by a sharp-pointed instrument, with a heavy weight at the end of it, and also a handle—it would be done by a sudden blow—there must have been two blows, I think—on the opposite side of the head, exactly opposite the blow, I found two distinct clots, or rather, merging into one—the left eye was very much contused, and the right eye slightly—I examined the chest, lungs, and heart, which I expected to have found very much congested, from the rope being round the neck, but they did not present the symptoms which one generally finds after strangulation, which led me to suppose that the death was caused by the blows—I had known the deceased some time,</p>

               <p>and thought him to be seventy-four or seventy-five years of age—he was very active, and walked about very well—I examined the house—in the cupboard, under the stairs on the basement, I saw some spots of blood on the wall, which appeared to have dripped from a wound—there were several spots down the wall, about half a yard from the ground; nothing further—I noticed that part of the floor which the policeman showed me—it had evidently been scrubbed, and attempts had been made to remove a stain—that was quite visible.</p>

I am an inspector of the Detective Police at Scotland Yard—on Thursday, 12th May, after the prisoner was in custody, I went to 26, Seymour Place, accompanied by the prisoner's wife, who had recognized him at the station in my presence; in a box in the front room ground floor I found this abstract of title deeds of 2, Trafalgar Square, Chelsea, with "Elias Huelin, 15, Paulton's Square," written on it in pencil; also an envelope, addressed to the Rev. Mr. Huelin, with some writing on the back about rent, and an enclosed estimate of some work to be done; also a catalogue of ten houses, a bunch of eight keys, one of which is said to be a patent, and unlocks the spirit cupboard on the ground floor at 15, Paulton's Square—I also found a pair of light trowsers, with two or three faint drops of blood on them, they were hanging on the bed, all the other things were together, put down by the side of the box—the prisoner's wife was present when I found the things—I tried the keys to the bureau, but could not find any of them to fit any of the locks in the house; I tried all the locks—I did not find any door key of Wellington Square or Paulton's Square—after finding these things, I went to 24, Wellington Square, I went through 23, and got over the wall at the back, and got in that way—I made a search there, and con<lb></lb>stables were placed there to try and find traces of the body—I was there on the Thursday and Friday—I noticed the marks on the floor in the kitchen, they appeared to have been stains of blood, rubbed over with stone, there appeared to be encircling marks, as though something had been rubbed round—there also appeared to be some stains on the back of a little cupboard under the stairs, about 2 ft high—I could not tell what they were marks of, Mr. Turner examined them—I saw where the body was found—a person at work there could not very well be seen from the adjoining houses, the houses at the back are in a row, but it is a very high wall; it would be</p>

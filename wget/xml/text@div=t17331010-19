No? says she, but I know you; won't you make me drink? No, I can't stay now, says I, for I am going over the Water, and besides, I have no Half-pence. But I know better, says she, for you have got two Pence in your Hand to pay the Boat-man; and with that she took hold of my Coat, and I gave her the 2 Pence to get rid of her, not thinking of my Lace, which was in my Coat-pocket, and so we parted; but when I came to the Water-side I miss'd the Lace, and enquired of the Watermen if they had not seen such a Woman about the Wharf? I happened to find a Woman something like her the same Night, and took her up; but when I came to see her next Morning, I found she was the wrong Person, and so I discharged her. Upon farther Enquiry, I heard of one of the Prisoner's Comrades, Sarah Whittle +, who had pawned the Lace. I took her up, and she was committed to New Prison, and next Day I took the Prisoner and carried her before the Justices in the Tower, where she said, that I had lain with her, and owned that she took the Lace out of my Pocket, because, as she said, she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173310100006"></xptr> was not well paid for her Trouble, and therefore would pay herself.</p>

I got it of a Chap who promised me 3 Pence to lye with me; but afterwards, having no Money, he gave me this Lace: But nobody buy_ing it, she said to Sarah Whittle, If you'll pawn it for me, I'll satisfy you; so Whittle pawn'd it to Ann Garner for 16s. and fetch'd it out next Day, and then I went with Whittle to Mr. Smith's at the Cheese and Pump in Rag-Fair; and says I, Will you lend Sarah Whittle a Guinea upon this Lace? No, says he, I'll lend her nothing upon her own Ac_count,if she was going to Tyburn; but I'll lend 20s.upon your account; and so he did.

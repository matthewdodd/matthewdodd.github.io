            . I keep the King of Denmark, public-house, in the Old Bailey. On the 22d of November, about six o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came and had a glass of gin, she gave me 1 s.; I examined it, and said it was bad, she said she had no more. I asked her where she took it? she gave me no answer, and said she lived at home. I sent for an officer, who examined her handkerchief - I let her go. She said she was a poor woman, and <rs id="t18191201-159-deflabel905" type="occupation">worked in Covent-garden market</rs>

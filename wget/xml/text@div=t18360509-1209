                  </hi>. I am assistant to the prosecutors. I serve in the shop—I know these girls—the prisoner Driscoll came to the shop on the 28th of April, to look at some thread edging—I showed her some—she was fixed to 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard, which she would not exceed—she would not buy any—she was going out, and there was a silk handkerchief hanging in the window—she asked the price of one—I took her back, and showed; her some, and this one handkerchief she bought of me—it was not marked—I had to go from one end of the shop to the other to know the price, which was half-a-crown—this other is the one I showed her at the same time that she bought this other—I knew this one again the next morning, when the policeman showed it to me—my own private mark was on it—to the very best of my belief, about half an hour after Driscoll left, the prisoner Davis came in, and asked for some bobbin quilling, and to the best of my belief this is the piece I sold her—this card of lace, which was found on Atterwell is my master's and has our mark on it—it was not sold to either of them. I have seen Atterwell in the shop several times, and have served her and Davis together—they used to come in very late at night.</p>

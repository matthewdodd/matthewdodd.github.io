                  </hi>. I am single, and live at 8, Nelson-street, Camberwell; the prisoner lived at 5, in the same street. On 27th March she was using bad language to me, and threatening me for about two hours and a half—about half past 6 o'clock I was on the step of the door, and she was at her own door, using awful language—she called me a b—y rotten w—e, and said the child I had in my womb was by a man with the she called me that over and over again—I asked her to shake hands, and she said, "You b—y w—e, I will rip you open," putting her hand in her pocket—she came to where I was, and I shut the door against her—she then went away, about ten yards, to opposite the Nelson—Mrs. Flynn, my landlady, went out, and she called her a rotten we, and pushed her away—I then saw her on the ground—I went out, and when she saw me coming she cut my dress in five places (<hi rend="italic">pointing it out</hi>)—I drew my hand to hit her a blow, and she drew a knife and <hi rend="italic">bursted</hi> my nose in two, and left this half hanging on my cheek, it bled like a <hi rend="italic">water butt</hi>—I had not offered to strike her before she cut my dress—I saw the knife when she cut me—I got myself away, and she ran after me, and said, by the living Jesus! she would rip my b—open, and she would do for me—I went to the station house, and Mr. Flower, the surgeon, saw me—I afterwards went to Camberwell workhouse—I am not yet fit for work.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Flynn, of 8, Nelson-street; the last witness lodged with us. On 27th March, between 6 and 7 o'clock I saw the prisoner opposite to our house—I went out to close the shutters, and she called me a by Cork w----e—I had said nothing to her—I went to her, put my hand on her shoulder to put her away, and she fell down—I did not see anything in her hand—as she fell, she drew her hand across my fore<lb></lb>head, and afterwards I found I was cut—Sheen came out, went to her, and she took Sheen, and held her by her clothes, and drew the knife right across her nose—I saw Sheen offer a blow at her, but cannot say whether it hit or not.</p>

                  </hi>. I saw Sheen at the police station on the night of 27th March—there was a deep gash right across the side of her nose, which cut it completely asunder—I dressed it, and have attended her up to within about three days since—she was in great danger of her life—about four days after it happened symptoms of lock jaw showed themselves, the muscles of the neck and mouth became affected, there was great stiffness—it was such a wound as could have been made with this knife, but very great violence must have been used.</p>

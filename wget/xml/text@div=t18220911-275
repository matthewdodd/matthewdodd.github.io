            . I am shopman to Mr. Craig. On Friday the 25th of July, I saw Mr. Brown mark this money; he gave it me; I returned it to him next morning. I observed the mark. Before Mrs. Weed came in, I cleared the till out, and put five shillings in it - she was in the shop at the time, and made a purchase of the prisoner - he had not seen me clear the till. I saw him put some money in the till; I immediately went and took it out, and put it in brown paper - there were five half-crowns, and two shillings marked, among it, I think, and the five-shillings not marked. I believe there was 20 s. 6 d. in all. I am positive the marked half-crowns were there, but will not be positive to the two shillings.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see Weed in the shop - A. Yes; I was by the parlour door at the top of the shop, a long way from her; the prisoner was serving her; he was a good way from the till - I stood near it all the time; he came, and put the money in. I said nothing to him, but examined it; in two minutes I saw him put the money in. I reckoned the contents of the till at 20 s. 6 d. I saw the two shillings were marked. I was desired to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182209110119"></xptr>watch, and see what the person laid out, and to look at the money, to know it again.</p>

             re-examined. There were seven shillings and five half-crowns in the till, I believe. I must have made a mistake in one shilling; but I gave Reid all the money found in the till, ten minutes after. I kept it in paper till I gave it him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I gave 2 s. 6 d. out of my pocket for the half-crown, not knowing it was marked; they frequently apply to me for change, and I gave change for it.</p>

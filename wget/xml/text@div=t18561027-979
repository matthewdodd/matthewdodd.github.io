On Thursday, 16th Oct., at a quarter past 9 o'clock in the evening, I was at the King's Arms, Hounslow, and saw the prisoners in the tap, drinking and talking together—at about a quarter to 11 o'clock I saw them about three quarters of a mile from Mr. Benn's house, on the road to it from the public house, and Hawkes made a kind of a snort at me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's servant On 16th Oct I had three horses in the stable, one was a bay mare—there was a set of harness there, and in the coach house there was a chaise—I locked the stable door and placed the key in it's usual place on a ledge—on the following morning at a little before 6 o'clock, I went, and missed the mare, chaise, and harness—I have seen them since—they are the same—about a foot of the mare's tail was then cut off—the staple of the stable had been drawn, and all three gates were open.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a blacksmith, and live at the Greyhound, near Reading. On Friday morning, 17th Oct., about 10 minutes to 8 o'clock, the prisoners came to my yard gate with a horse and gig—Riley asked me if I had room for them to put the horse in—I said that I had no stable room, but there was a large shed, which they could put it in if they chose—they did so, and said that they were not going to stop long—Hawkes drove it into the yard—they afterwards said that they wanted to sell the mare and gig for 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I told them I did not want it, but if I could get a customer I would—they offered me a sovereign for my trouble—I looked at the horse, and thought it was not half the value, but it was sweating all over, and was all over mud, and the chaise also—I gave information to the police, and gave them the horse and chaise and the prisoners.</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector of the Beading police. On 17th Oct I received information, went to the Oxford Arms, Silver-street, Reading, which is about forty miles from Hounslow-heath, and found the prisoners the back yard—I asked them if the horse and chaise at the public house above belonged to them—Hawkes said, "Yes"—I said that I should take them into custody on suspicion of stealing them—Hawkes said, "It does not belong to me, it belongs to the other," pointing to Riley—I asked Hawkes where he brought them from—he said, "From Oxford"—I went to the Hare and Hounds, which is kept by the last witness, and took posses<lb></lb>sion of the horse and gig; the horse appeared to have been driven very hard—the prosecutor came and saw them the next day—the mare's tail had been cut off—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), I found it at a public house about three miles from Beading, on the Hounslow-road—I have matched it, and it exactly corresponds.</p>

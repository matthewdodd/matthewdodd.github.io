                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>, 360). I am often employed in plain clothes—I have known Humphreys some years, and I knew Ward before this matter—in consequence of information, I watched Humphreys to Pleydell-street, which turns out of Bouverie-street, Fleet-street—I saw him come out of a house there about 5 o'clock on Monday morning, 2d December; he went down Fleet-street, Ludgate-hill and St Paul's church-yard, into Cheapside, where he joined Willis at the end of King-street—they both went to the end of Iron monger-lane, remained in conversation a few minutes; Willis then left Humphreys, and went down the lane, to the back entrance in Iron<lb></lb>monger-lane, of Mr. Bannister's premises, 2, King-street—he remained two or three minutes, then left, joined Humphreys, and went to King-street, where he took some coffee of a man who stood there, and I left him in St Paul's churchyard—next morning, about 5 o'clock, I saw Willis and Hum<lb></lb>phreys come out of Pleydell-street, from the direction of Humphre's house; they went to Cheapside, stopped at the corner of Ironmonger-lane, and con<lb></lb>versed</p>

He said, "Come in." I went in, the gas was alight; he gave me two baskets. Coming out, at the top of Ironmonger-lane, I saw Willis, and a little further on I saw Humphreys, who said, "Have you got them?" I said, "Yes." He said, "Go on ahead, I will catch you." I went on, turned round, and saw Humphreys and Willis together; Willis had the hind-quarter of a sheep on his back; he said to Humphreys, "Are you tired of them? if you are, give them to me," I went with Willis to Fleet-street; the policeman stopped me; I told him what it was, and who employed me. The young man never gave me anything. I know nothing more about it.</p>

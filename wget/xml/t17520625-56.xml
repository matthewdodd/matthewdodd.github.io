            . I met with the prisoner on the outside of Temple bar. June 15, as I was going to my lodgings; I had seen her before. She said she could bring me to a place where she was acquainted. I went with her to the house of

I was a little in liquor. I agreed for a bed, and paid 2 shillings for it; we had two pints of wine afterwards; after which I took the key of the waiter and locked myself and her in, and put the key in my fob and went to bed with her. When I awaked, which was between four and five o'clock. I looked about and saw my breeches on the floor, the prisoner was gone; I stretched out my hand for my breeches, then I missed my ring off my finger, it was a gold one with a stone in it. I searched my breeches and found nothing but two farthings left.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you before?</p>
               <p>Jenkins. I had ten guineas and a half in gold when I went with her, but I had changed the half guinea to pay my landlord. I had then ten guineas in my fob, and the key of the door upon them when I went to bed.</p>
               <p>John Hill. The prosecutor and prisoner came into the Salutation tavern near Temple bar (I am a waiter there) they called for a room a little before twelve at night the fifteenth of June, I shewed them one, there was a bed in it; they called for liquor, I carried it them; they had 1 s. 6 d. in punch, and two pints of wine, he paid me for that and the bed, in all 5 s. 6 d. and giving me half a guinea I carried it to my mistress to change, and returned him five shillings out of it. In the morning he called me up a little before six o'clock, and told me he had lost ten guineas in gold, and 4 s. 6 d. in silver, and three gold rings. We went in search of her, and looked in every room about the house, but could not find her. We have a pair of folding doors, which go into a yard; these I fastened before I went to bed, and found them open when I was called up in the morning, as I did likewise the inner door, and there were marks on the wall about six feet high, where she had got over; it goes into Sheer lane. We found her in Peter's street near Saffron hill. After we found her, and I had charged her with taking three rings from the prosecutor he then recollected but one. She confessed before justice Fielding she took the ring and 4 s. 6 d. in silver, but denied that she either saw or knew of any guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the Salutation in London or Middlesex?</p>
               <p>Hill. The front is in London, but that room where they lay is in Middlesex.</p>

               <p>The man met me on the other side Temple bar, and asked me if I would go with him, I said I did not chuse it; he said I should go to the Salutation Tavern ; we went and had a negus, and two pints of wine. He gave me the ring and 4 s. 6 d. before we went to bed. I saw no gold about him. <rs id="t17520625-56-verdict249" type="verdictDescription">

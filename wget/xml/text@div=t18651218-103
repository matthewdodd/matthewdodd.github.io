I am a detective of the Metropolitan police, but employed by the War-office at Woolwich—on 2d November, from information I received, I went to the Alexandra Theatre at Islington, and saw Duncan join Garrett, who was standing at the entrance—I said to Duncan, "You have been stealing cheques or money from your employers"—he said, "Yes, I have"—I told him I was a police-officer, and should take him in custody—Garrett was close by and could hear the conversation—I said to Duncan, What have you done with the money you got for the cheques you passed at the bank?—he said, "I have bought things with it; I also bought two watches, one I gave to Garrett, and one I have now, "nodding towards Garrett, who said, "Yes, he did give me a watch and guard"—Duncan said, "I gave him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. several things I bought with the money are at home"—he also said that he gave Garrett two gold rings-Garrett was not in military costume—Duncan also said, "I gave money to two other men at Woolwich at different times"—I said to Garrett, "The case looks very suspicious against you, receiving watches and money from this boy"—he made no reply—I said, "You must consider yourself in custody for receiving from</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Duncan, who was in the service, but now has a pension—Duncan is our son—he has nothing from us but his board and lodging—he went to Gibraltar, and there made Garrett's acquaintance—I opened a letter in October which came by post, directed to James Marville, with "J. O." in the corner of it—I read it, and showed it to the boy at night, and he tore it up—I believe it was from Buckley—I only just read it—I cannot tell exactly the contents of it, but I gathered from it that he had been to Greenwich with Buckley—there was nothing about money—I intercepted another letter from Garrett, and the boy burned that—it said that he was to bring him a watch, that be (Garrett) was on full pay, and would pay it at 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—I said to my boy, "I do not wish you to have anything to do with Garrett; how have you got money to pur<lb></lb>chase a watch?"—he said, "Garrett was in London, and I brought him the watch, "that is, took it down to him—I cautioned him—I made a communi<lb></lb>cation to Mr. Conte—my husband wrote a letter to Garrett at Woolwich, and I told him what to put in it—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—Garrett returned the letter to me, and told me to send it to the proper owner—I think the children made away with the letter; I cannot find it—this is a copy of it—(<hi rend="italic">Letters read</hi>: "Bombardier Garrett—I received your letter this morning, telling my boy to bring you a watch. You must remember we are only poor people, and the boy has no money to buy watches, or yet to spend in going after you, and you writing after him may only prompt him to rob his master. I wish you to have nothing more to do with him; if you do, I will certainly bring you before your commanding officer, and I know Colonel Maberly will see me justified in doing so; you are a young soldier, with good prospects in front of you, and I don't wish to injure you if it can be avoided. W. Duncan."—"Woolwich, 11/10/65. Mrs. Duncan,—I re<lb></lb>ceived this morning (Wednesday), a letter from you, accusing me of writing begging letters to your son, requesting him to purchase me a watch. Now, I see how the mistake has been; I shall take it in that light; you must look again at the letters you received from Woolwich, and you will then see that I have only written you one, which, as I got the address from a friend of mine, I accordingly addressed it there, as what I wrote to your son, whom I know no more about than your husband does of me, although the manner in which you inquired after Bombardier Garrett on Sunday, was as much as to say that I was the means of your son remaining from home; certainly, when he said he should like to stop, and he told me he had paid for a telegram to you, I made him as comfortable as our accommodation would permit. I have enclosed your threatening letter, hoping you will change the name, and forward it to the proper quarter. I wrote a letter for my friend one day, as he was on duty, that he had not time to do it; but I signed his name at the bottom of it, therefore, hoping you will correct the error, and inform me of the result, you will greatly oblige H. Garrett, bombardier.")—I went to Woolwich after the receipt of Garrett's letter, and I think the Sunday morning before—I found my boy in Garrett's room—he came out, but said nothing—I brought him up to London—I did not stop to speak to Garrett.</p>

               <p>because it was sent back, and I read it over and over, and Garrett's writing is so saucy, I thought it was very impudent—I can write a little, and can read plain writing—when I spoke to my son I thought there was something wrong—he did not say that he had a good master, and that he sometimes got half-a-sovereign at a time from gentlemen—he said that he got a shil<lb></lb>ling sometimes, and sometimes sixpence, when he went out to the wine-merchants—I was not satisfied—I had been to Mr. Conte before I received the letter—I began to suspect as soon as I saw him with any money—I then went to Mr. Conte, and he told me it was all right, there was nothing wrong.</p>

On the 4th of April the prisoner came to my house and produced this paper—I knew Mr. Godfrey, of No. 86, Bankside—I deal with him—the prisoner said he was sent by Mr. Godfrey for a gallon of gin, and half a gallon of brandy—he had a leather apron on, such as Mr. Godfrey's men wear—I supposed him his servant, and I delivered to him a gallon of gin and half a gallon of brandy, which he took away—I have known the prisoner for a long time, which removed my suspicion.</p>

            . I am carman to Southwood. On the 14th of August between ten and eleven o'clock, I went with the prisoner and cart to South Moulton-lane, there was a black horse in the cart, it was loaded with stones, which were piled up there; the prisoner and I loaded it, there was another man there, I do not know who he was or where he came from, we found him there. The prisoner acted as my master in the business, and took me to my master's; the other man went with us as far as Moore-street, about one hundred yards from the yard. I know nobody in the transaction but the prisoner, he took the money, the man was not present then; the same man went part of the way on the second day also. He was a labouring man.</p>
               <p>JUROR. Q.Was he tall or short - A.Tall, about five feet eleven inches high. I did not conceive that he had any thing to do with them; he talked to the prisoner and the other man while they were loading.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181809090011"></xptr>On the 28th of July, the prisoner came to my house, about ten o'clock in the morning, to look at some apartments which I had to let: my servant shewed them to him - He said they suited very well; but if he took them, he must come in that evening. I was to let him know in an hour. I said, if he would give me a proper reference, I would let him know; he referred me to Mr. Nevin, No. 27, Bishopsgate-street. I went there, but could find no such person. I found my house had been robbed. On the 31st I was near Worship-street Office, and saw the prisoner coming with a bundle under his arm. I was going towards him, when he ran away. I think he saw me. I called out Stop thief! and he was taken immediately,</p>
               <p>JANE BURLING. I am the wife of the last witness. On the 28th of July, the prisoner came to see about the apartments. I saw him through the door, while my husband was agreeing with him; he called for a pen and ink, to write a reference. He came again in about a quarter of an hour-my husband was not at home at the time - I did not see him, but heard him in conversation with the servant in the passage. I saw him go out of the door, went to look after him, and saw him running very fast. I went up to the room, and missed some plate off the sideboard - I was in the room a few minutes before the prisoner came the first time-it was then safe. I missed the articles stated in the indictment. The silk scarfs, dress, and shawl, were taken from the bookcase drawer.</p>
               <p>HANNAH KING. I am servant to Mr. Burling. On the 28th of July, the prisoner came; I shewed him up to the apartments-my master went to him; in about five minutes he went away-my master went to him; in about five minutes he went away-my master went out. The prisoner returned in about a quarter of an hour after, said he had met my master in Finsbury-square, and that he desired him to wait till he returned. I shewed him up into the same room; he asked if I was the mistress of the house. I told him I was the servant-my mistress was engaged. He said when he came to live with us, if I was attentive he would reward me. I thanked him, and went down stairs; I did not quite shut the door; he remained in the room about five minutes. I then heard him coming down stairs, I went and asked him what he wanted; he said he wanted some snuff - I asked him to allow me to get it for him - He said he would go himself. He went out - I held the door in my hand - I saw him run the moment he got out. He ran very fast towards Chiswell-street. I went up stairs, and missed the plate off the sideboard - I saw it there when I shewed him into the room the second time-nobody else had been there. He spoke to me in English - I understood him, and he understood me.</p>
               <p>JOSHUA ARMSTRONG. I am an officer. On the 31st of July, I apprehended the prisoner in the Curtain-road, and found several duplicates on him. I asked him to whom the property belonged, that they referred to; he said it was all his own; one was for the wine-strainer, and the other for the sugar-tongs, pledged at Peart's.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM CLARK. I am servant to Mr. Peart, pawnbroker, who lives in Whitechapel. On the 28th of July, a woman pledged the wine-strainer, milk-pot, sugar-tongs and table-spoon, in the name of Franks,</p>
               <p>GEORGE BURLING re-examined. I did not meet him, nor tell him to wait at the house. The property is worth 5l.</p>

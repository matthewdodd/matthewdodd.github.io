                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable R</hi> 178.) In consequence of in<lb></lb>formation, I went, on the 5th of April, about a quarter-past six o'clock in the morning, and placed myself near Mr. Nelson's house—I stood at the top of New King-street, Deptford—I saw the prisoner Moore come down Broomfield-place with a basket in his hand—he turned down Old Kings street, and stopped at the back door of Mr. Nelson's premises—he re<lb></lb>mained there about a minute or two—I saw the gate opened, and he went into the yard—I went and stood two or three yards below the gate—I could not see into the yard—I remained two or three minutes, when I saw the gate opened—Moore came out with a basket in one band, and a small bundle in the other—(the front of Mr. Nelson's shop was not open at that time)—Moore saw me, and appeared very much confused—he turned round, and walked into the yard again quickly—I followed, and about t yard inside the gate I took him by the arm, and told him, from informa<lb></lb>tion I had received, I should take him into custody on suspicion of rob<lb></lb>bing Mr. Nelson—the female prisoner was standing about a yard from him at the time—they both appeared very much confused—on the way to the station-house, Moore repeatedly begged me to let him <hi rend="italic">go,</hi> if not, it would ruin him—he said the things were given him by a female—the bas<lb></lb>ket contained twelve pounds and a half of butter, and the bundle a Dutch cheese, a piece of Gloucester cheese about half a pound, a piece of bacon weighing about a pound and a half, and in his great-coat pocket were nine eggs, which he took out—I went to Mr. Nelson's house—Mr. Nelson and and I went to Moore's lodgings, and, in a cupboard in a room occupied by Moore, I found a small piece of Cheshire cheese, which Mr. Nelson identified—about nine o'clock the same morning I took Carr in Pleasant-row—she told me she had given the things to Moore.</p>

Carr is my wife's sister, and was in my service—on the morn<lb></lb>ing of the 5th of April the policeman came to my house before I was up—in consequence of what he said I went to Moore's house, and found some eggs in the cupboard, twelve in a basin and two in a dish; three small pieces of cheese weighing about half a pound, and nearly a pound of butter in a plate—I had cheese resembling what I found, but I could not swear</p>

               <p>it was mine—there is a door between my shop and the parlour, which has no lock on it, but it is always shut at night—my butter was kept in the shop—I believe the butter found on the prisoner Moore to be mine, and I have more Dutch cheese similar to this one found on Moore—I cannot say that I missed butter, as my stock is large, and I have a son who ma<lb></lb>nages my business—I am sometimes out for two or three hours—Carr had been with me sixteen years—I never saw Moore in my house—he has been to the door to inquire for Carr—I understood he paid his addresses to her.</p>

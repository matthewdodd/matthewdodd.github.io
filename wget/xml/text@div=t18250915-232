            . I am servant to Mr. Brown. On the 6th of July I went to the house of Mrs. Chicks - the child was with me; she had a necklace on, which I believe to be this. The prisoner was there. I saw the necklace round the child's neck; she took the child, and went out for a bottle of water - she staid about ten minutes, and then returned without the child; I asked where the child was, and she said she had not been with her - I looked out at the door, and saw the child without her beads; I said, "Oh! good God, Sarah, where's the child's beads?" she said she knew nothing about them. I then went about the neighbourhood - she went with me, and asked if any one had seen them, and she told me when I went home that I had better not say anything about them.</p>

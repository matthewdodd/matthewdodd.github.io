             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am foreman to Mr. Lucas, who is a supervisor, and contractor for lamps; on Thursday, the 9th of August, as I was in St. Martin's-street, Leicester-fields, looking at my boy at work, I saw the prisoner coming up the street on the other side of the way, with something wrapped up in his apron; I says to him, what have you got there?</p>
               <p>How long have you known him? - Two years.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120171"></xptr>What is he? - He is what you call a cadoee, that is, a helper; I asked him what he had got there, his reply was nothing; I put my hand towards his apron, and he drawed it away, and would not let me see; I told him I insisted on seeing, and he said if I would step on one side, he would tell me what was there.</p>
               <p>Did you tell him it would better for him to confess? - No, I says to him, I shall not go any where, and then he opened his apron, and there was the patent lamp in his apron.</p>
               <p>What may be the worth of it? - Seventeen or eighteen shillings.</p>
               <p>Whose lamp was it, did you know? - I did not find out till afterwards; I asked him how he came by it, and he said he had taken it from Mr. Haling.</p>
               <p>Did you understand by that that he had stole it, or that Mr. Haling had given it to him? - When I saw the lamp, I took him by the collar, and took him back to Mr. Haling's; he begged I would not take him to Mr. Haling's, and said, you have a family of your own, and I hope you will not hurt me, but before that, I asked him if he worked for Mr. Haling, and he said, yes; then says I, are not you a bad fellow to rob the gentleman that employs you? then I took him to Mr. Haling, and he was taken before Mr. Justice Hyde, and committed.</p>
               <p>- SMITH sworn.</p>
               <p>I am foreman to Mr. Haling; I took this lamp from the prisoner, on the 9th of August; he had it inside his apron; I have had the care of it ever since under lock and key; he owned it to be Mr. Haling's at the Justice's, and that he took it.</p>
               <p>Hollyar. This is Mr. Haling's property; I know it by the No. 1582 upon it.</p>
               <p>When that was brought to you, did you look to see if there was any such number missing? - No, my Lord, but afterwards I found there was one wanting; I know that by the stock; there were twelve of that sort exactly; the prisoner was at work for Mr. Haling at the time, cleaning and preparing lanthorns for the Prince of Wales's birth day.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I found the lamp in the back yard, under the water tub, and only picked it up to take care of it.</p>

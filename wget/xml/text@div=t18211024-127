            . I am a watchman of Piccadilly. About eight o'clock on the night of the 13th of October, I saw the prisoner come out of <placeName id="t18211024-127-crimeloc736">St. James's church-yard</placeName>

I saw him again in about twenty minutes come out of the churchyard with another bundle, we took him into custody, and asked him what he had got; he said "Nothing to you, mind your own business;" I said that was my business, he must go with me to the watch-house - he said "No;" and turned back to go into the church-yard again - I collared him, and Sutty assisted in taking him to the watch-house.</p>

            . I am the watch-house keeper. Wyatt brought the prisoner in, and took the bundle from under his left arm. I asked what it was, he answered "Nothing"; I asked him two or three times where he got it, he made no answer; the watchman said he had seen another bundle go before that, I asked what he had done with that one, and where he had sold it; he hesitated some time, and said at Forder's, an old iron shop. I asked what was in it, he did not answer, I said, "Was it the same as this bundle," he said "Yes;" he said he sold it for three halfpence per pound, and that there was not quite so much as in this bundle - I ran over to Forder's, and found him in the shop, and two or three people stood round the door talking about the matter - he refused to let me search, as I had no warrant; I went and brought the prisoner over there, and by that time Forder was gone - I examined the scale and counter, there was dust on them similar to what came from these plates; they are coffin-plates, and are dated 1817, 1798, and 1808; there are a great number of them. On the following Thursday, I went into the vault of the church, and in the first vault, I found eleven inscription plates taken off the coffins, three appeared distinctly to be forced off - In another vault, a great many were gone; Messrs.

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Is the vault under the chancel, or where - A. On the north side of the church. Wyatt, the sexton, came to the watch-house and asked why the prisoner was detained, and said he would answer for his appearance - the prisoner assisted him in the vaults. Some of the coffins are placed one on another, and some are much decayed - the lead weighed fifty-eight pounds and three-quarters.</p>

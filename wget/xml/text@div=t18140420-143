            . My husband's name is Saville Lewis.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you lose these articles - A. Last Saturday week I was in my bed room when these things were taken from my person.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to bed where was your money and notes - A. In my pocket-book. The pocket-book was in my pocket, and my pocket between two beds, at the bottom of the bed. I had forty-five pounds in my pocket when I went to bed. I missed it in the morning as soon as I came down stairs. I missed a ten pound and a two pound note. I missed a dollar first, that gave me suspicion, and caused me to look if I had lost any notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether you had any three-shilling tokens - A. That I cannot say, nor did I know that the prisoner had the snuff box until the officer brought it from her. The prisoner was the only female servant in the house. I saw the prisoner searched on Sunday morning; I saw my notes taken out of her bosom, a ten pound and a two pound note, a dollar, and three three-shilling tokens. I lost a little silver, what sort of coin I do not know.</p>

               <p>SAVILLE LEWIS. I live at the Queen's Head, St. Martin's-le-grand.</p>
               <p>
            
                  <persName id="t18140420-143-person1254">Q. </persName>
            Do you know that your wife had this ten pound and a two pound note - A. Yes, we counted it before we went to bed. I had written on the ten pound note the name of Clements, the name of the person of where I took it. I saw the name of Clements on the ten pound note when it was taken out of the prisoner's bosom.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH BRANT. I am a constable. I took charge of the prisoner about seven o'clock in the morning. I asked the prisoner where the property was. She ran down into the kitchen, and took up this snuff box. Mrs. Lewis said, that is my husband's snuff box. This handkerchief was in her bosom; it contained a ten pound note and a two pound note, and a dollar. Mr. Lewis said on the ten pound note was the name of Clements. This is the ten pound note.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. That is my writing on the ten pound note.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went into Mr. Lewis's house first as a lodger; the servant went away; Mrs. Lewis asked me to do the work. On Saturday Mrs. Lewis gave me two or three glasses of gin; she had one glass of gin and I another. I went up stairs with her; she sent me down for a glass of brandy for her; I got it for her. When I went up she had the pocket-book in her hand; she turned sick; she was very much intoxicated; this silver dropped on the floor, and the notes like wise. I picked them up, and put them in my pocket. Mrs. Lewis said if I would give them her she would say no more about it. I am a poor distressed woman. My husband has been a soldier in the Guards seventeen years.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Spottiswoode, at Westminster. The prisoner was cook there, and slept with me—I had been there nine days when she was taken—I was not aware that she was in the family way—on 29th April, in the afternoon, I saw her in the first larder, putting some clothes into the ice box—she appeared to be unwell, and I assisted her up stairs to bed—a doctor saw her in the evening, and I sat up with her all night—she had got up that Saturday morning about 5 o'clock, and had complained of being unwell all day.</p>

                  </hi>. I am lady's maid, in Mr. Spottiswoode's family. I had only been three weeks when this happened—I found the prisoner there when I went—I recollect her going up to bed on 29th April; I assisted her up stairs—I went up to her in the evening, and she said she wanted to go to the ice box, as she had something there which she wanted to put into water; but I advised her not—she said she must go—I said she had better not, and then she gave me the key of the ice box, and said she had a baby there—I did not go to the ice box myself.</p>

I went to the doctor's residence; and in con<lb></lb>sequence of information from him, went to Mr. Spottiswoode's, and found the ice box locked and sealed—I broke the seal, and found the body of a male child there, with its head downwards—I afterwards took the prisoner into custody.</p>

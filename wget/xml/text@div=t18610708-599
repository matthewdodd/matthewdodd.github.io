               <p>at a quarter to 8 in the evening, the prisoners came to my surgery—Williams asked for a pennyworth of sal volatile—I asked for a bottle, and he said, "We will drink it here"—I gave it him and he drank it—the prisoner Stone then tendered me a 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece in payment—I immediately tried it, and found it was bad—I went round, locked the door, and put the key in my pocket—as I turned round from locking the door, I saw Stone withdraw his hand from a shelf or small frame which is in my surgery—they both asked for change—I said, "I will send for a policeman, he will give you the proper change"—I then sent for a constable and gave him the bad florin—when they had been taken away, I looked behind this frame where Stone's hand went, and found five other florins in a paper parcel—I took them down to the station when I charged the prisoners, marked them all, and gave them to the same policeman who had the first piece.</p>

I took the prisoners from Mr. Cox on 22d June, and he gave me a counterfeit florin at the same time, and he afterwards gave me five others at the station—I was obliged to get assistance to take the prisoners to the station—they were very violent and made great resistance—I searched Stone, and found on him a half-crown, a sixpence, and a halfpenny good money,—he refused his address—I took Stone, and another constable took Williams—I saw Williams during that time, he was kicking all the way to the station—several constables were there—another constable searched Williams.</p>

On the 20th of December, about three o'clock, I missed a jacket, which at one o'clock I had put into a small box under some other things, on the forecastle - I went to the dockgate, the officer came with me to the ship; I afterwards saw the prisoner behind a shed, on the south side of the docks - he saw me, and began to pull the jacket off directly; the officer then took him - this was about four o'clock.</p>

            . I am a Thames Police-officer. I went with Steel to look for his jacket; there is a baggage warehouse shed - I saw the prisoner by the side of that shed; he pulled off this jacket - I asked him how he came to take it; he said it was an old one kicking about, and he did not think there was any harm in it - I then asked him about another article, which the prosecutor had lost; he said if I would go with him, he would show me - he showed me a red shirt, but the prosecutor said that was not his; there were six or seven other persons about the prisoner when he was taken; I have known him nine or ten years - he has been a hard working industrious man.</p>

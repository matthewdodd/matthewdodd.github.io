                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at the Hive in Middlesex. On the 13th of October, about half-past five o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner on a mare, which I knew to be my uncle's, George Mather—he was not a quarter of a mile from Mather's—I had seen the mare in his field on Saturday night—I asked where he was going—he said about two miles on the road—I took him to custody—he had a blind on the marc, and a handkerchief on the top, and no saddle nor bridle—he did not live in the neighbourhood—he said came from Hastings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. I hired the horse. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. He said he hired it of a man down the road, in a flannel jacket, but where he could not tell.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable of Kingsbury. I was in the village, and met my son and the prisoner coming along—he said he had caught him on a mare, and I took him in to custody—he had a pitchfork his hand—I know the mare, it belongs to George Mather—he does not let it out—he is a farmer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. I hired her of two old men with flannel jackets on. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi> he was the King, that he had married the Queen, and had a right to take a horse wherever he liked, out of any body's field—he said he had come from Hastings' Union.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi> I am king of this country. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi> There were the marks of the Union on his clothes—I really do not think he is in his senses I told the committing Magistrate so, but he said there was so much trickery in horse-stealing, that he might have men concerned with him who got him to steal it, and then would take it away, when it got two three miles.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. I gave a man a sovereign for the use of it for two hours-joe Mansell is the man who paid the sovereign for Mr. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. He gave the same story when I took him—I found nothing hut a handkerchief in his pocket—the pitchfork belonged to a man in the neighbourhood who the prisoner had worked for three days—the horse had a blind on in the field, as it was in the habit of breaking out—I thought him not right his mind, as T thought it a wild thing to steal a horse in the middle of the day, opposite houses—it was on a Sunday, just before church-time, the Edgware-road—he said he got on a gate to get on the horse—he was going at a jog-trot—there was no bit to the horse.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a blacksmith, and live in Mason-street, West<lb></lb>minster-road—the prisoner has lodged in my house four years—I was paid 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week by him, and had to allow him 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. out of it, 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., in the week and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on Sundays—it was paid through his solicitor in the city—during these four years I have remarked some eccentricity in his conduct, sometimes consider<lb></lb>ing himself to be the Duke of Gloucester and sometimes Oliver Cromwell—he always behaved very quietly up to the day he gave me the blow—on 15th December, in the afternoon, I was sitting in my kitchen, nursing the child—the prisoner came down stairs—I was just in the act of saying, "Good morning, Sir," and before I could get my eyes up he came across with this weapon (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), hit me on the head, and then returned back and said, "Knight, those d—d theatricals have made you have a design against me"—my wife then came in and said, "What have you done?" and the prisoner said, "If you don't stand aside I might serve you the same"—I then ran across to a public-house—he was not pursuing me at that time—I then went to Mr. Goffs, the chemist's, and they would not touch the wound; they said it was too serious—I then went to the Westminster-hospital, and became an in<lb></lb>patient there—when the prisoner used those words I could not attach any meaning to them—I never had anything to do with theatricals—he used to go to theatres; he generally was fond of them—he had not been for the last two years—I cannot attach any origin to those words which the prisoner used when he struck me, except these eccentricities I have spoken of—he appeared rational in every sense of the word—he had an excellent memory, and if you asked him any question you could always get a correct account of any thing relating to history, or any thing bygone—he was always rational in his dealings with persons—he seemed to know what he was about; he would buy any thing, or do any thing, and go errands—he went after our dinner and supper beer, and always behaved in a rational straight-forward way, till the very moment he struck me—as far as my judgment goes he was rational and like other persons in every respect, except these delusions which he some<lb></lb>times</p>

I am the wife of the last witness—I remember this afternoon of 15th December when my husband was struck by the prisoner—I went into the kitchen immediately after—I observed that my husband was wounded; I went after him to see the consequences—when I first went in I said to the prisoner, "What have you done?" he said, "If you don't get out of the way I will serve you the same"—my husband ran over to the Mason's Arms; I followed, but they had then taken him to the chemist's shop, and taken him to the hospital in a cab, and I returned and found the prisoner sitting in the kitchen—nobody had called a constable then—there were men that had come across from the house—I said to the prisoner, "You have murdered my husband you had better get out of the house before the police come"—he said, "Mop up the blood before they come, and tell them I have done it from authority"—there was no more said; he went away—I did not observe that he carried the steel bar away with him.</p>

               <p>remember the prosecutor being brought in on 15th December—he was bleeding very profusely from a wound on the left temple, about an inch and a half to an inch and three-quarters in length, that it had cut down to the bone, but the bone itself was not injured; the temporal artery was divided—I had to apply two ligatures; I dressed the wound and sent him home telling him to come the next morning—then inflammatory action had set in in consequence of the injury, and I thought it right to take him into the hospital—he was in a dangerous state, not exactly of his life; he has nearly recovered—it was such a wound as might have been inflicted by one of the edges of this steel bar.</p>

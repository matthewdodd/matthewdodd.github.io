            . I am an apprentice to the prosecutor. On the 21st of July, about half past eight in the morning, I was sweeping the shop, I saw the prisoner putting his arms over the goods.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were the goods laying - A. The cloth was laying in the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he take it away - A. Yes; I made an outcry and pursued the prisoner, he was taken.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. The goods are here.</p>
               <p>Q.Who gave them to you - A. I was called into the shop on the 21st of July, between eight and nine o'clock, my apprentice brought the goods into the shop, he picked them up after the prisoner dropped them. It is my property, there is my hand writing upon them. I value them at about twenty pound.</p>
               <p>MR. BRANDON. I keep a coalshed opposite of Mr. Clarke; I heard the word, stop thief, the prisoner was stopped, when I came up to him, by Goddard.</p>
               <p>MR. GODDARD. Q. You stopped the prisoner, did not you - A. Yes, he was running.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any thing with him - A. Not when I stopped him; he wished me to let him go, I collared him and took him back to the shop.</p>

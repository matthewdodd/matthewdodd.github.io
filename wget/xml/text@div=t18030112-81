               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You knew his wife was ill? - A. Yes; she had just lain-in.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before the prisoner came to buy the pattens, had you seen that particular pair of shoes? - A. I cannot say; several pair of such shoes had been sold in the course of the day; nobody serves but myself and my wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you cannot say but the shoes were sold in the former part of the day? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. He readily told you where he lived, and his right name? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the shoes concealed? - A. No.(The shoes were produced by the constable, and identified by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I bought the shoes of the prosecutor in his shop at six o'clock that evening; he served me himself.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.(To Elliott.) Is that true? - A. I cannot say; I don't take such notice of every customer, who perhaps I never saw before, to say I should know them again; I enquired about the prisoner's character in the neighbourhood, and received a most undeniable one.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character. <rs id="t18030112-81-verdict447" type="verdictDescription">

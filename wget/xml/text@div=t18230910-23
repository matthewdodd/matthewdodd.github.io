On the 25th of August, about a quarter before twelve o'clock at night, I went to bed - I was the last person up; I fastened the house; the windows were fastened by the springs. I got up about twenty minutes before seven o'clock in the morning, and found a pane of glass cut, over the spring of the window, and the spring pulled back - the sash had been opened, and the sliding shutters pushed down, which enabled persons to get in. My till, which was safe overnight, was taken, and left in the summer-house in the garden, and its contents gone. I found the prisoners at the watch-house, and 4 s. or 5 s. worth of half-pence, a shilling, a sixpence and four twopenny pieces found on them, which money I had lost. I know the two-penny pieces. Williams had three of them, and Smith the other - Ford had 18 d. in copper.</p>

Last Thursday night I was down in the cellar with three of our men - we heard some one in the shop; I went up, and found the prisoner, who was a stranger; he had got the roll of floor cloth from the place where it was, and removed it about half a yard - he was endeavouring to put it on his shoulder; I closed the gate which had been left open, and asked what he was going to do; he then begged hard for mercy, and said he had come from Birmingham, and left his parents.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Might he not as well have thought of putting St. Paul's upon his shoulder. A. I should think not quite; he said, before the Magistrate, that he came by the desire of a friend, to make a purchase of some floor cloth; the roll consisted of twenty-seven yards - he was endeavouring very hard to get it on his shoulder; it is a load for any person, it weighs about one hundred pounds - it would have been madness for him to have attempted to carry it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been in the cellar? A. About a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes - it was safe when I went down, and when I came up, he was attempting to put it on his shoulder.</p>

            . I am one of the City police. I have had this cloth in my care.</p>
               <p>JEREMIAH MITCHELL. I am in partnership with Mr. Joseph Webb, Southgate. This is our property - there is eighty-one feet of it; it is worth four guineas and a half.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is it not very heavy? A. Yes, it is not likely, that a lad in a week state of health, could carry it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I went into the shop, and when the man asked me what I was going to do, it confused me very much.</p>
               <p>THOMAS BARKER re-examined. Q. Did not the prisoner state, when the charge was made, that he wished to be taken to a friend, for whom he had looked at this oilcloth? A. No, at that shop, he said nothing, but when we got to Mr. Mitchell's, he said he hoped he would forgive him, and he wished to speak to him in private, but Mr. Mitchell said, "What you have to say, say;" he then said, I have been obliged to abscond from my friends at Birmingham, through having a bad disorder, and I wanted to get something that I might go home to them."</p>

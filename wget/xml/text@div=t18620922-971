                  </hi>. I am a labourer, living at 5, Sydney-street, Blackwall—on Tuesday, 9th of this month, between 12 and 1 at night, I was in the Commercial-road, taking a drink of water out of a fountain there—I had my watch in my waistcoat pocket, attached to this watch-guard—the prisoner came up to my side and made a grasp at the watch—I sung out, "Oh! I have lost my watch"—the ring gave way from this chain, and the watch went—I sung out, "Police, police! stop thief, stop thief!"—I was then within two doors from the fountain, at the corner of Lucas-street—the prisoner turned round the corner—there was another man as well, a shorter man, but he went off—one of the two, I don't know which it was, cut me across the temple—I hate the mark now—I cried out, and fell from the blow I got—I got up as well as I could, and, of coarse, lost some time, but the policeman on duty was coining up another street, and he captured the man—I did not see him taken—I saw the direction in which the prisoner went—he went towards the railroad in Lucas-street—I saw him in custody about two or three minutes afterwards—I am sure the person I then saw in custody was the person who seized my watch; he was as white as possible.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 1, Garden-street, Stepney—I was in Lucas-street between 12 and 1 on the morning of Tuesday, the 9th, and saw a man run post me—I got a little further on and saw the prisoner leaving the prosecutor, and the prosecutor getting up off the ground—the prisoner was about six yards from him when I saw him first; he ran away and I ran after him—I saw him stopped by a policeman—I am sure the prisoner is the must that I saw coming from the prosecutor, and running—the other man that I saw running was a shorter man.</p>

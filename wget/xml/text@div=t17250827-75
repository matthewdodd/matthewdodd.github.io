Mr. Norris and Mr. Goddard being just come into my House, were walking together in the Kitchen. I heard Mr. Goddard say, Sirrah, your Father would not have serv'd me so, nor shall you. Then they whisper'd and went out. Mr. Norris return'd in 7 or 8 Minutes, with his Finger upon his Wound, and asked for a Surgeon for himself and the Deceased; for (says he) I believe I have done his business.</p>
               <p>The Surgeon deposed, that the Sword entred in the Left Side of the lower Belly, cut the Guts in two Places, and was mortal.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner in his Defence said, The Deceased was to have done a little Business for me, but had neglected it. I spoke to him about it; he return'd me abusive Language, at which I only smiled. This happen'd to enrage him more, than if I had answer'd in his own manner. He walk'd out a-doors, came to the Back-Window, and call'd me to him. I went round, saw him before me, and follow'd. When I came to him, he drew upon me, and said. If I would not draw too, he'd kill me. Mr. Westcomb thus deposed: Some Words passing betwixt the Deceased and Mr. Norris, the Deceased went out and call'd him to the Window. They whisper'd, and Mr. Norris went to him.

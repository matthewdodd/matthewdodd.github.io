The barmaid picked it up with her right hand and went in the parlour, where she was with the other barmaid four or five minutes. She came back, went to a cupboard in front of the bar and opened it with her right hand, then put her left hand in, shuffled some money, and shut the door again with her right hand; then she came to me and said 'This is a bad two-shilling piece young man,' I said 'Why didn't you tell me so in the first place? She made no answer. I said 'If I have taken it it was in a mistake either out of half-a-sovereign or half-a-crown, you must not think I get my living at it;' she said 'I don't say you do.' Upon this I took out my pocket-book and showed her pawn tickets for my watch and rings which I had pawned to keep myself while out of employment. Then she went to the parlour door again and sent for a police constable, and I remained in the bar ten or twelve minutes before he came."</p>

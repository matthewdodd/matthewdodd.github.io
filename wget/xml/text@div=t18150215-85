When he was brought back, I said Barnard, you have taken a pair of boots; he said he had the boots in his hand. This was on the Tuesday evening; I examined the drawer further; I found another pair was gone; I missed but one pair first; the prisoner had one pair in his hand, it was one of the pairs that I had put in the drawers marked. The next morning I went to the watchhouse, and asked him what he had done with the sixteen pair he had taken on the 16th of January.</p>

            . I am servant to the prosecutor. I was in the shop the night the prisoner took the boots; I did not see him take the boots. Mr. Brand desired me to go after him; he went into a leather-cutters shop; I told him Mr. Brand wanted to speak to him; he came back with me, and when he came back Mr. Brand upbraided him with taking a pair of boots; he said yes, he had, and took them out of his coat pocket, and gave them to him. I was then sent for Mr. Jackson, the beadle; he took him into custody, Mr. Jackson searched him, and found a pair of boots in his pocket.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. to Prosecutor. What is the price of the two pair of boots - A. The two pair of boots cost me four shillings and two-pence. There are other boots that he took at different times, and pledged them at different times.</p>

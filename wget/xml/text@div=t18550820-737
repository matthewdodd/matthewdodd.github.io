               <p>On Thursday morning, 5th July, I was passing through Earl-street, about ten minutes before 7 o'clock—I know Messrs. Smith and Son's carts; they are all painted with their name, and are well known—I saw one of their carts; it obstructed the pavement I was going to cross; it ran on the path—Pascoe was driving it—when I came up he was not on the box, he was behind the cart, and some <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> newspapers were sliding out—I saw Russell there—both the prisoners had got hold of the papers—Russell took two doubles, and doubled them short, and ran down Earl-street—Pascoe got on the box and drove off—I had business in Paternoster-row; I went there, and in about five minutes I saw Russell again, and he had no <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>—I felt it my duty to make a communication to Messrs. Smith—I saw the bag that Russell had; it was an ordinary book bag or collecting bag—I could not swear to it—there are plenty in the trade like it.</p>

In consequence of instructions, I went on Saturday morning, 7th July, in plain clothes to William-street, Union-street, Blackfriars—about half past 6 o'clock, I saw Pascoe at the corner of Earl-street; he was driving one of Messrs. Smith's carts, with the door opening behind—as he was driving it through Earl-street I saw Russell, and Pascoe raised himself up in the cart and beckoned with his head two or three times to Russell—Russell followed the cart down Bridge-street as far as Tudor-street—the cart turned down Tudor-street; Russell crossed to go after it—I lost sight of the cart—in a minute or two, I saw Russell sit<lb></lb>ting on the step of a door in Bridge-street, close to William-street; he was sitting on a bundle of papers—he sat so as to conceal them—you could not see it was a bundle of papers, unless you were aware there was something—continued to sit there—I watched him for twenty minutes or half an hour; I then went up to him, and said, "You have got the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> up early this morning"—he said he was always employed in that way every morning, and he had 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for doing so—I asked him what he meant by being employed in that way—he said he was employed by the person who drove the cart to take care of the papers till another person came and fetched them away—I took him to the station house, and went on to Messrs. Smith's—I there apprehended Pascoe, who had just come in when I got there—I said I took him into custody for robbing his master—he said he knew nothing about it, I had better wait to see his master—I told him Mr. Smith was aware of it—I found on him a purse containing 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and the regular key of the cart.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a blacksmith, of Red Lion Market; Whitecross Street, and am the owner of a plot of ground in Benlah Road, Walthamstow, which I got in a Freehold Land Society, about a year ago. I erected a fence on the left hand side of it, dividing a piece of land, which the prisoner</p>

               <p>had, from mine—that fence was constructed of wood, and strong posts, and palings—I dug a hole, set the posts in the ground, and then rammed the earth in around them—on 31st March, I went down and found the fence had been pulled down, and the best portion of it was removed into the prisoner's ground—a portion was remaining on my land, but it was all down—I saw the prisoner, and said, "Why you have made quite a ruin of it"—he said, "If you will give my men some beer, they shall look it up together again," and away he went—I began to look around, and saw a great portion of the wood on the scaffold of the house which he was building, and even over the doors and windows inside his building—I am able to say that it was my wood—I knew it—I saw the prisoner next day, and asked him why he had taken my wood; (there was a constable with me) that it had cost me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to put up, and it was very hard to see it all pulled down, and used on his ground—he said, "I have a lawyer in my family"—he repeated that half a dozen times, and then went to the top of the scaffold, telling me that I might sue him in the County Court—the prisoner put his hand on some wood, and said, "Whose are these?"—I said, "They are mine, I can swear to them!'—the prisoner said, "No, they are mind"—this is some of the wood (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—these pieces were over the windows, forming the support for the arches—some of my wood he has put into his walls, built into the brick work.</p>

               <p>hold up the scaffold—you could hardly get that out which was in the walls to put it back again—it is used to build an arch, with a piece of wood over to support it; I do not know whether they take it away afterwards—these are the pieces of wood which were supporting this arch—he sent his man to knock them out, when he was in the station house—it was the last day of March when I went down; I had not then, been down for about a month—I missed as much of the fence as would cost me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sawyer and dealer in timber, at Walthamstow. I know the prisoner and the prosecutor, and know that Million had put up a fence to mark his boundary—towards the end of March I saw the prisoner on Mr. Million's land, taking down the fence with his own hands; he laid a portion of it on one side and a portion on the other; he spread it about—I did not see him take any of it away—I spoke to him about my own business and left him at work—a portion of the posts were bought of me; they are not here—I last saw them lying on the ground; I did not see them in the build<lb></lb>ing—theyhave been removed from Mr. Millions premise—after the day I saw him pulling it down, I saw some of it on Mr. Million's part of the land.</p>

               <p>Are not these very fine clothes for a carpenter, very fine things with silk linings? - I do not know, they were given to me to put by.</p>
               <p>You are quite sure as to them? - Quite sure.</p>
               <p>How lately had you seen them before the prisoner was taken up? - I had not seen them a great while before, I put them in the chest, not locked, but my door was always locked, and I always found it locked.</p>
               <p>You lodge in the house of the prisoner's mother? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Do you occupy six rooms; - Yes, I could not get a licence, because it was reported it was such a bad house; it is not a public house now.</p>
               <p>Was it licensed before? - Yes, for many years.</p>
               <p>But when you and your husband, people of the first morality and virtue, went there, you could not get a licence? - Upon the account of the people that lives in it, the justices would not licence it.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Where did you apprehend the prisoner? - At his mother's, at his lodgings, where these things were taken out.</p>
               <p>Why, you are a very ready witness, how do you know where they were taken out; why it was only last Tuesday you was informed of this? - I do not know what you want me to say.</p>
               <p>I asked you a plain question, I only wanted an answer to it; you went to the pawnbroker's? - I found the duplicate in the prisoner's purse.</p>
               <p>Yes, and you took the purse? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When you took the purse out, the man wanted his duplicate back again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He liked it a good deal better in his own hands than in your's? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How far is it to the justice's? - A mile.</p>
               <p>How did you go there? - Upon my legs.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I live at Mr. Birne's a pawnbroker, that duplicate is my hand writing, on the 27th of January, the prisoner brought the clothes to me.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you ever seen the man before that brought them? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>You have a great many people I dare say come to you in the course of business? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I wish you would look at the prisoner, and tell the Jury whether you are satisfied that he is the man? - I am quite clear, I have no doubt about it, I saw him since at the Justice's.</p>
               <p>(The coat and waistcoat produced.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. How many more gentlemen of your description does Mr. Birne retain? - His son and a boy.</p>
               <p>After you had this coat and waistcoat in, what did you do with it? - It was put in the warehouse, I billed it and booked it.</p>
               <p>Will you swear you put it into the warehouse? - I will not.</p>
               <p>Then I am right in supposing that for ought you know you left it on the counter? - Perhaps I might.</p>
               <p>Perhaps then it might have been removed by somebody in the house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The duplicate itself contains no description of the coat or waistcoat? - It does not.</p>
               <p>By what do you affect to identify the prisoner? - When he came I objected to taking<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250135"></xptr> them, I thought the coat too fine with a silk ining, I asked him whose coat and waistcoat it was, he said it was his own, he said, he was a bricklayer by trade, and had been out of work some time, and if I doubted it, he would try them on, but they appeared to be his size; and I knew him again at the Justice's.</p>
               <p>My question is, by what do you pretend to swear that that is the man that gave you the coat and waistcoat? -By his being some time in the shop, and my saying these things to him; we have a vast number of people.</p>
               <p>What size is your shop? - Rather a large shop and a pretty large window.</p>
               <p>And something hung up in it that obscures it a little? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is your shop cupboarded off n the old style? - You mean those places that people come in that do not chuse to be exposed.</p>
               <p>Yes, how many of those places have you? - Three.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner come into one of those places? - Yes, but there was light enough, I suppose he was in the shop ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Do not suppose, but swear something about it, will you swear he was there five minutes? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Will you swear to ten? - No.</p>
               <p>You never saw the man before in the whole course of your life? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>And you first saw him afterwards at the Justice's in the character of a felon, charged with this offence, and were told a duplicate had been found upon him? - I immediately recollected the prisoner.</p>
               <p>If you had met that man in Fleet-market on the day you saw him at the Justice's, should you have known him? - I should have recollected he was one of my customers.</p>
               <p>Court. The moment they applied for these things did you immediately fetch this coat and waistcoat? - I sent the boy for them.</p>
               <p>Did you at that time recollect that these were the things that were pawned by the prisoner? - I did not then immediately.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You do not universally give duplicates? - No.</p>
               <p>They pay you for them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do people that pledge things that are stolen take duplicates? - Sometimes.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shipwright, and live in Thomas-street, Commercial-road. On the 20th of June, I was at the Three Mariners—I was not very sober, and put my head on the table, and went to sleep—I had seen the prisoner and another person in the room—by and bye some person came and said. "Wood let me take care of your watch for you"—I lifted my head and said, "Do," but I never opened my eyes to look at the person—I then went to sleep again—the master and the tap-boy came to take me to bed, and I said to the pot-boy "Jack, where did you put my watch?"—he said, "I have not got it, put I know who has"—It has never been found.</p>

                  </hi>. I am pot-boy at the Three Mariners—I have known the prisoner about two months—the prosecutor came there that night, about twenty minutes past eleven—he was very tipay—In a few minutes the prisoner and Alexander Clark came in—they had a pint of half-and-half—there were several others there, but we put them all out—we took the lights out, and left the prosecutor and another man there, both asleep—the prisoner and another man then came to the bar and had some gin, and another pint of half-and-half—I then saw the prisoner coming out of the room in which the prosecutor was asleep—he went and spoke to his companion, who was waiting outside—I went out and said to the prisoner, "<hi rend="italic">Bill</hi>, what did you do in there?"—he said, "Nothing"—I said, "Don't tell lies, you have"—he then put his hand into his pocket, and pulled out two farthings and a halfpenny, and said, "Oh. oh. here is two farthings and a halfpenny; I thought it was two shillings and a halfpenny"—I said, "It is of no use your telling lies, it will be found out"—he then said, "I got his watch out of his pocket, but I could not get the guard off his neck"—my master to go in with me, and we got him to the bar—we found he had lost master to go in with me, and we got him to the bar—we found he had lost his watch.</p>

               <p>again on the Sunday, (the next day,) the prosecutor and two gentlemen went to him with me, but I had seen him in the morning before they went—a girl named Caroline Williams, who lives in the Match-walk, was with me, and a man, but neither of them are here—I did not say unless he shared the plunder with me, I would come it on him, even if I should be lagged for it—I do not remember that any one was with the prisoner—he was standing by the post at the Barley Mow door—I have been pot-boy for six months, but I am not regularly there—I know Christopher Lizzard—I do not know whether he was with the prisoner when I charged him with stealing the watch—no one made any observation, to my knowledge—the prisoner swore he had not done it—I did not tell my master that night what he had said to me—Mr. Wood said he did not know who took his watch—but he had given it to somebody—I did not tell my master of it that night—I can give no reason for it—I mentioned it on Sunday afternoon, when Mr. Wood asked me what I had done with his watch—I said "I have not got it—I did not have it, but I think I know who did have it"—he said, "I thought it was your voice asked me for it, or I should not have given it up"—I did not tell my master of it—Mr. Wood did.</p>

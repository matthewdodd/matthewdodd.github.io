               <p>Q. When you got into the coach, had you senses enough about you to know what you had in your pocket-book. - A. I know I had four dollars in it.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to know you had four dollars. - A. I went to a woman that I had left money with before and got the four dollars, I knew I had four dollars, but whether there was a shilling or so in the pocket book I will not say.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you miss these dollars. - A. When I came to Mile-end, I says to Joe, d - n my eyes I have lost my pocket-book; the gentleman of the house suspected the coachman, hearing me say so.</p>
               <p>Q.Had the coachman been drinking with you on the road. - A. Yes, we were treating him at different public houses; I had the pocket-book when I was in the coach, I missed it when I came to Mile-end, coming out of the coach. The landlord at the public-house, he stepped back and saw him taking the money out of the pocket-book, and putting it in his breeches-pocket, and the pocket book was found in the privy.</p>
               <p>Q. What opportunity had he of taking your pocket-book. - A. As I was stepping out of the coach, the pocket-book was in this jacket pocket that I have on now, and the dollars were in the pocket-book; the landlord charged him directly with it. I saw the dollars again, it was all found.</p>

             sworn. I keep the Plough at Mile End. The hackney coachman stopped with these two sailors at my house, I saw they were groggy; as soon as I went into this parlour I heard this young man say to his messmate, he had lost his pocket book, he swore pretty roundly, as sailors mostly do. Upon hearing this I went to the coach, which was standing at the door, I looked in the straw, I could not find the pocket book; somebody said the coachman was in the necessary, I went and found him shut up in the necessary, he was sitting in the necessary, he did not see me look over the door, I saw him take the pocket book from under his great coat, and empty the dollars out of the pocket book; dollars are a thing that make a great noise when they are disturbed; I put my head over the door and said Holloo, he said, Master, it is only the coachman doing a little business for himself, I says, it is a very wet day, I have been taking a little physic; he came out and I went in, I looked down the necessary, and there I saw this man's pocket book and protection, I put my hand down and took it up from the soil; when I got hold of the pocket book I saw the sailor's protection, he was discharged at the Nore; I shewed him the pocket book, he says there is my protection in it, I will take my oath it is mine. I called the coachman, I asked him if he knew any thing of that pocket book and protection, he said no; I said you are a great rascal, I saw you take the pocket book and protection and throw it down the necessary, and you took the man's dollars; I says for this business I will take you in custody, he said I was a great rascal for accusing him; I took him to a constable myself; he denied it to the very last push.</p>
               <p>- MORGAN sworn. I am the officer that took the prisoner. Mr. Rant and two men brought the prisoner down to me, I searched him, I found four dollars upon him, he took them out of his left hand pocket.</p>
               <p>(The property identified by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel, and called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

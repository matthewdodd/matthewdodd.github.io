                  </hi>. I am booking clerk at the main line, Stratford station, of the Great Eastern Railway—on the morning of 1st May, about 6.15, I was inside the booking office—there was some money lying a little on one side of the window—I saw a man's hand and arm come through the opening, I ran towards it and it was instantly with<lb></lb>drawn with some silver in it, and I could see the prisoner in the act of walking sharply from the window—I shouted out and ran out of the office as quickly as possible and caught him outside the station—there was no one else in the outer office—I stopped him and accused him of taking some money from the booking window—he said he had done no such thing, he was a respectable man, and he knew what money he had in his possession—I brought him back into the office—he then said that he had a pound in his pocket—he took his hand out of his left-hand pocket with a purse and emptied the contents into his right hand, which already had some coins in it—a constable was sent for and he was given in charge—18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. altogether was found, with the money in his purse and in his hand—I missed 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from my cash.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>, I could see the man's side face through the aperture as he was going round the corner—there was no train for 20 minutes—there is a public-house some distance off.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. I saw the coin in his hand when the hand was with<lb></lb>drawn. I am quite sure there was no one else in the office but the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am office porter at the Stratford station—at a little past six in the morning of 1st May I saw the prisoner come to the Booking office—he asked me the next train to London—I said we had no train till 25 minutes to seven, and I advised him to go to Stratford Bridge to catch the 6.15 train—he went out, as I thought, to go there</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187805060112"></xptr>
               <p>about 6.15 he came in again and went and stood against the London window—he then shifted a little towards the Cambridge window, where the money was taken from—I had occasion to go into the cloak room, and as soon as I had unlocked the door and got inside I heard the booking clerk call out very sharply—I was at the door instantly and saw the prisoner making towards the door out of the station, from the booking office window—when he saw me he stopped—the booking clerk came up at the same time, caught hold of him, and accused him of taking money from the window—I saw some coins in his right hand—he put his hand in his left-hand pocket, pulled out a purse, and emptied the contents into his right hand, where I had already seen the coins—he said he knew what money he had got—we asked him what—he said "A pound"—it was counted and there was 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—at the time I saw him walking away from the window there was no one else there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I could not see what coins they were in his hand—I could see they were silver and rather large coin, whether half-crowns or two-shilling pieces I could not say—he said he was a respectable man, that he did not do it, that he had a wife at home; he had come out to buy some fish; he was a fish dealer, and he went up to London most every morning—Stratford Bridge station is about a quarter of a mile from ours, it could easily be walked in 10 minutes—there is a public-house at Stratford called the Railway Hotel—I believe it was open at six o'clock.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. On the 30th of June I met the prisoner in Bainbridge-street, St. Giles' - he had one plane under his arm, another in his hand, and the other things were in his pocket; he said they were his own property - I asked if they had any<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183106300140"></xptr>mark on them; he said, No - I asked if the maker's name was on them; he said Yes, but he did not know what it was - I said he must go to the station; he sent me to a man who he said would state that he worked with him; I went there - the man said he knew an old man of that name, but not a young man.</p>

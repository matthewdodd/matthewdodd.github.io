On Monday last was three weeks I went out in the morning, towards Hackney, with my two boxes, and returned about seven in the evening. I went through Petticoat-lane in order to get to my own house; Moses, I observed, dogged me to Ebenezer-square, where I live; I did not take much notice of him at that time. I went home and eat my supper; afterwards I took my boxes up stairs, and then went to a publick house, the Gentleman and Porter. At about eight o'clock my wife went out, during my absence, so that I cannot say exactly what was the situation of the house when it was left empty. My wife and I met together, and returned about ten in the evening, which was about two hours after I left her; the door was locked in the same manner as when we go out. When I came up stairs I found one of the windows of the chamber, with the shutter broken, the bar broken, and the sash thrown up; it is a very suspicious window, for it is near a wall, to which any person could get, and might have thrown up the sash, and therefore it is the custom of my house never to open that window, for fear somebody should get in at it. When I came up stairs I missed the two boxes of things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them) the box had certainly been opened in the room, for there were two watch chains found upon the wall; the box must have been broke open, for I locked them up when I left them.</p>

On Monday was three weeks, between nine and ten o'clock at night, I saw, near Woolpack-alley, three fellows, one of whom had a box upon his head; that man is the prisoner Moses. Isaacs, the other prisoner, had a box under his arm; there was another man, who appeared to be an Englishman. I looked at them; one had a cutlass, the other had a club-stick in his hand; one said to the other d - n your eyes, why don't you bear a hand along? the other made answer, I cannot come faster it is so heavy. I was going to follow them to see where they were going to. I followed them a little way; Moses turned round and saw me; he said, d - n your eyes! if you follow me any farther I will cut your head in halves; upon which I desisted and went home.</p>

            . I live in Paradise-street, St. Luke's, and am a labourer. On the 22nd of February I was coming up Paradise-place, about three o'clock; I saw three lads; the prisoners were two of them; they were standing altogether - Heath had some shoes in the bosom of his coat; I saw the heels of them sticking out; I went to the prosecutor's shop, which is in <placeName id="t18310407-290-crimeloc1539">Tabernacle-walk</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You did not see Heath do any thing? A. No - the boy who is not in custody was the oldest; Heath did not say the other gave them to him to hold - he seemed frightened; we lost sight of the other all at once.</p>

            . I was servant to Mr. Woodward, a cabinet-maker, who lives in Old-street-road. On the 22nd of February I was standing at his door, and saw the two prisoners run by - Heath threw three pairs of shoes and a bottle-brush at me; they were running by as fast as they could - I took the shoes and brush to the back of the shop, placed them under one of the tables, and the Police-officer came and had them.</p>

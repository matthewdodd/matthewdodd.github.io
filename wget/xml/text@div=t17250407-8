             thus depos'd: My Wife Martha having lately miscarried, I was laying on the Bed by her between and 8 on Sunday Night, when her Brother, the Deceased, (who was fitting by the Fire) called me to supper. I awaked and got off the Bed and saw my sister, the Prisoner who was very drunk, walking about the Room with a Knife in her Hand. If there's any Victuals in the House, says she, I'll have it. Molly, says the Deceased base but Patience, and here's enough for as all. But she continuing to be very troublesome, he added, If you wont be quiet, go out of the Room, or I'll turn you out. She answered, If Right took place, you ought to go out first. He perceiving that she resolved to make a Disturbance, went to her, and endeavour'd to put her out and she immediately stab'd him with the Knife: He fell down, and died in about half an Hour. There had been no former Quarrel betwixt them.

             thus depos'd: After my Husband got up, the Prisoner came to my Bed-side and I said to her, Molly, I wonder you'll make yourself so drunk? - Are you troubled at it? says she. Yes, I am, says I. Why then, D - ye, says she, I think it's no Sin to cut your Throat; and with that, she struck me in the Face with her Hand, and went out; But presently came in again, and said, I will have Meat as long as any is to be had. Molly, says the Deceased, Consider that my Sister is not well, and therefore I'll have no Noise. Some other Words passing, he rose up and strove to put her out. His Wife endeavour'd to part them; and as they were struggling together, the Prisoner stab'd him over his Wife's Arm: He sunk his Knees, and died.

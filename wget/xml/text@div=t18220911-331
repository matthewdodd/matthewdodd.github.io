I fell in company with the prisoner on the 12th of August, about twelve o'clock, in Holborn. I stopped up in a door way out of the rain; she asked me to go home, and said I need not be afraid, for she had a decent room of her own.

I had 16 s. in silver, a watch and seals, and a handkerchief in my hat, which was on the table; she fastened the door herself - she got up about six o'clock in the morning, and went out of the room; she returned As soon as I got up, I missed 8 s. out of 16 s., and enquired for an officer - I got one at last, and Ballard produced my handkerchief. I had given her no money - I drank nothing but a glass of gin and water. I had been out with a friend - I was not intoxicated - I supposed her to be a girl of the town. I told her I only wanted a place of shelter. I did not go to bed till three o'clock in the morning; the rain began about twelve o'clock.</p>

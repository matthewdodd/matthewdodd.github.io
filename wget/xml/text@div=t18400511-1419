                  </hi>. I am a police-sergeant. On the 1st of January I was on duty in Rosemary-lane, about ten o'clock in the morning, and saw the prisoner with another man standing at a clothes-shop door—in conse<lb></lb>quence of information I had received, I wished to take them both into cus<lb></lb>tody—I pushed the other man into the shop, and the prisoner ran away—I overtook him about thirty yards off—I took off his hat, and found this crape shawl in it—I told him I must take him to the station-house—he said, "I have a wife and family, and I will not be transported for any body; I did not steal it; my brother Charles, George Duffey, and Samuel Harmer, brought a bundle to my house last night about eight o'clock, con<lb></lb>taining a silver watch, some silver spoons, and some clothes; they went away, and came hack in about a quarter of an hour; they gave me the shawl, and took the bundle away with them; my brother Charles has left some skeleton-keys at my house, and if you will go with me I will give them to you"—I went with him to his house, and he took off the window-ledge a bag containing four double-headed skeleton-keys, one of which will open the prosecutor's bed-room door—I took him to Lambeth-street—he was examined there four times, and discharged about the end of January—on the 4th of April he was given into my custody again, and I took him to Worship-street Before Mr. Broughton, and he was committed on the 20th.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was he examined as a witness against his brother? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—he was fully committed on the 20th of April—Flowers was in cus<lb></lb>tody at Lambeth-street, and underwent four examinations—I did not know Harmer, nor Charles, nor Duffey, until the prisoner took me to his house, and pointed him out to me—I then took him—he was the means of my getting Duffey, who was transported for another burglary.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there any intention to make use of the prisoner as a witness? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was kept separate from the other prisoners—he was sent to the House of Correction, while the others were at the New Prison—that was when he was at Lambeth-street—Duffey and Flowers, and the one who was with the prisoner when I pushed him into the shop, were in custody—Flowers is now at large.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's wife. He had a good deal of money and Bank notes at the end of July; he gave the money into my hands to take care of - I put the notes into a pocket-book, and the cash into two different bags; there were three 50l., notes among the rest - I remember the name of "Shaw, Paddington," being written on the back of one of the 50l. notes; there were, I should think, five, or perhaps more 5l. notes - I saw the money and notes safe on the Saturday, I think; I left them in the drawer in the pocket-book on Saturday afternoon, when I had occasion to go to the drawer - the notes were in one drawer and the cash in another; I saw them both, and all safe that afternoon about three or four o'clock - I had the key of the drawers in my possession, and it was never out of my possession; I left the drawers safely locked up; I went out with my husband at three o'clock on Sunday afternoon, and returned between seven and eight - I found the bar of the back window broken, and the house broken into; I am quite certain the whole house was safe when I went out - a stranger must get over the wall to get to the back window; my husband's brother had a key - I found the Bank notes, cash, and three handkerchiefs gone; two of the handkerchiefs were yellow, and the other yellow mixed with red - they were down stairs, in a bureau drawer.</p>

            . I am a milkman On the 29th of July I lived at No. 1, Market-street, Edgware-road, about three minutes' walk from Clarke's - I was passing by his house on Sunday, the 29th of July, as near as I can judge, about a quarter after twelve o'clock in the day; I know the passage near Clarke's house leading to the public-house - I saw some men in the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. Are the prisoners the persons you saw there? A. I certainly did swear to Wood, but I was persuaded at the time at the station-house, when I was brought tlex, by one or two men - that was some time after the Sunday; I was persuaded to swear to Wood.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Then you did it from persuasion, and not from your own conviction? A. No, not from my own conviction - I saw three persons in the passage near to Clarke's house.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Turn round, and tell us if you see any person who you saw on that occasion? A. I cannot exactly swear I saw that man (Jepson) because their heads were turned towards the gate; I was examined at Bow-street - I believe Jepson was one of the men, and I believe the other man is innocent; I believe he was not there at the time - I was examined at Bow-street three or four times; I should not know the third man, because he was kneeling down - I just saw the glimpse of the other two faces; I was standing there two or three minutes - they were six or eight yards from Clarke's premises, and I was ten or twelve yards from them - I saw a bundle by the side of the one who was kneeling down, and I really think it was a silk handkerchief - it was yellow; I went away, and returned to the same place half an hour or three-quarters of an hour afterwards, and saw two men there.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they two of the three you had seen half an hour before? A. I think they were - I cannot say; one was, and that was the one I had seen kneeling down, but the other I do not think I had seen before; that man was neither of the prisoners - I only just passed by at that time; they were in the passage, in the same place as the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183210180010"></xptr>three were - I passed again about a quarter after four o'clock, when I was going round with my milk, and saw Jepson, the tall prisoner, walking by; he was within three yards of Clarke's house.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times had you seen him before that day? A. None: he was doing nothing but walking about - he had nothing; I did not speak to him, nor he to me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When was you examined at the station-house, and persuaded to swear to Wood? A. I suppose about a week after.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not tell the Magistrate you had been persuaded to swear to him, but not from your own conviction? A. I might not think any thing about it; I swore postively to Wood at Bow-street: I did not know him before - I have not seen any of his friends since, nor his attorney, nor been examined by him.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you again, why not, when on your oath before the Magistrate, state that you had been persuaded to swear to him? A. Because I was not asked - I swore to him positively before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. How dare you, before the Magistrate, swear Wood was the man, when now you swear he was not? A. I never thought of it, hardly; I was examined at Bow-street about five weeks after the robbery, as near as I can guess; I swore to Wood when I was persuaded to do it - I cannot tell on what day I was examined.</p>

            . I married the prosecutor's brother, and we live opposite his house. On Sunday, the 29th of July, between three and four o'clock, I was at my window, and while there the prisoner Jepson spoke to me - he was alone; he asked me if Mr. and Mrs. Clarke were gone to Harrow - I said I did not know where they were gone, but they had gone out for a ride, but I said he might speak to my husband; he said, "Oh, no, I will call to-morrow" - he did not say what he wanted; he did not call next day, to my knowledge; about half an hour afterwards I saw two men walking past, one in the road, and one under my window - they had a handkerchief, with something long rolled up in it: I believe Wood was one of the men, but cannot swear to him - Jepson was not one of those two; there are three or four houses in the passage leading to the public-house; the public-house goes into the Harrow-road, but there are no houses on the passage to the public-house - it joins a great shed; my husband's house is at the bottom of the passage, and the prosecutor's house joins the passage - when the passage is stopped, you cannot get to any house but ours and Clarke's; there is a gate at the end of the passage; my husband had the key of the prosecutor's outside shed door - it was in his possession; a person having that key could get into the premises, but nobody had it but him - it was the key of the shed alone.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Point out Wood? A. That is him; I did not tell the Magistrate I never saw Wood till I saw him there (at the office) I said I saw him pass my window, but could not swear to person - I do not remember swearing that I never saw him till he was at the office; I swear I did not say so- Jepson was alone under the window.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q. It was between three and four o'clock that Jepson asked if the prosecutor was gone to Harrow? A. Yes; he might be wo minutes speaking to me - he went away when he got his answer; I saw nothing more of him that day - I never saw him before, and did not see him again till he was in Newgate; I went down to Newgate, and picked him out in the yard among all the prisoners, before I swore to him.</p>

            . I am an inspector of the Police. I first heard of this robbery on Thursday, the 13th of September - on that day I had some business to do with Jepson: I had apprehended him on the 5th of September, for something else, in Scotland-yard, and took him to Gardener's-lane station, and told him I must search him - he immediately put his right hand into his trousers pocket, and pulled out a wire purse, and took something from it - he said, "I must look what property I have got before you search me;" he took something out of the purse, and crumpled it up in his hand - I then seized hold of his hand, and got possession of what he crumpled up; it was a 50l. Bank of England note; I took from him a 20l. Bank note, and two fives - I was compelled to give them up last Session, to Mr. Wood, the under Sheriff; I took the numbers of them - the two fives were Nos. 23,560 and 23,563, both dated the 9th of June, 1832; Jepson was committed on the charge I apprehended him on, and was tried here; the Session commenced on the 5th of September, and on the Thursday, the 13th, while Jepson was waiting for his trial, I saw the prisoner Wood at the New inn, Old Bailey, and apprehended him there, in the passage of the New Inn - I took him into the coffee-room, down to a small box, to search him; he pulled out his watch, and I was in the act of taking his watch-guard off his neck, when Mr. Wooler, who I believe is the solicitor's clerk, came across to the table, put his left hand out, pushed me on one side, and seized the watch and guard with his right hand, took possession of it, and desired the prisoner not to give any part of his property up to me, but to give it to him; Mr. Wooler was then standing on the other side of the table, near the end, opposite the prisoner; he came round the end of the table, got between the prisoner and me, and took possession of the whole of his property; he took from him a purse - I asked Mr. Wooler what it contained, and told him he was acting very improperly in interfering with me in my duty; he said, "It is no matter, I shall be answerable for all this property - don't give it up to that fellow, it won't be safe in his hands," and that it was a pity the public paid for such men as me, and it would he safe with him - I requested him to give me the numbers of the notes, which he did; there were two 5l. notes in the purse, with three sovereigns and a half in gold - I got a scrap of paper and pencil, and put the numbers down; he gave them to me: they were 23,561 and 23,564, both dated the 9th of June, 1832; while I was taking the numbers of the notes, the prisoner pulled off his hat, took out a yellow silk handkerchief, and threw it towards Mr. Wooler; Mrs. Wood (as I believe her to be,) who was in the room, picked it up - I said to Mr. Wooler, "Did you see that?" he said, "Oh, I will be answerable for all this property<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183210180011"></xptr>being produced when it is wanted;" there was nothing in the handkerchief.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the property produced at any of the examinations? A. I saw the watch and two 5l. notes at Bow-street, and they are in my possession now; the handkerchief was never produced, nor yet the purse or sovereigns - I went to Wood's house, No. 12, Lambeth-walk, Vauxhall-road, on the following day; I knew it to be his house from information I received - I was at Bow-street when Wood told the clerk he resided there, and in consequence of that I went there next morning; I saw the woman there who had taken the handkerchief - I searched the house, and found three phosphorus-boxes with matches in a drawer in the back kitchen, and this chisel in the same drawer; I have since been to the prosecutor's house, and find this chisel very accurately fits a great many places which were broken open, drawers and bureau drawers; I saw Wood in this Court on Jepson's trial - he was examined in Jepson's behalf, to prove an alibi - he said he knew him, and had been out with him pleasuring at Windsor and Hampton; that he had recently been at his house, and spent his evening with him- I have the 5l. notes and the watch; Mr. Wooler produced them at Bow-street, and Mr. Minshull ordered him to give them to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. When you took Wood into custody, I believe you knew Jepson was about to be tried? A. I did; I was a witness - he was on the list for trial that day: Mr. Wooler never told me Wood was a witness for Jepson till I got to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not request of you to send him in custody before the Court, to be examined, when you were at the Compter, before you took him before a Justice? A. No, he did not - I recollect when we got to the Compter Mr. Wooler stated to the person who took the charge, that he was a very material witness to prove an alibi for Jepson; I do not recollect his requiring that he should be brought in custody before the Court; the person sitting there refused to take the charge, in consequence of what Wooler said, but I stopped him, and took hold of his arm in the street, and he requested me not to take him further: he did not at any time request me to send him to the Court to be examined for Jepson - I desired to examine the Bank notes at the Compter, to see if Mr. Wooler had told a falsehood, and I saw them; Mr. Wooler produced the same notes before the Justice - I have been told the purse lost was a clasp one; the one found on Wood was a long one with a slide; I remember when Mack was first examined before the Justice - it was on the 13th, and on the 27th, when you came, the depositions were taken a fresh.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, did Mack attempt to swear to Wood before the Justice till you had rode home in a coach with him, after the 27th? A. I never rode home in a coach with him at all - I put Wood into a cab, and sent him off to the station-house, and when I got to Bow-street the prisoner was brought in - Mack was brought in, and identified him that evening - that I swear; the Magistrate's clerk was there, and is here now - it was on Thursday, the 13th: I was not at the station-house at all with the prisoner, nor with Mack, and do not know what took place there; I appeared at the next examination, on the 20th, and then Mack swore to him - I was there on the 27th; I never saw Mack at the station-house at any time - I heard Mack examined on the 27th- what was said was taken down in writing; I was asked before the Justice if I could not have taken the yellow handkerchief from Wood's wife if I pleased; I said I could, but the prisoner might have escaped while I was doing it: there was nobody with me - there were many persons there; Morgan came up when I first apprehended Wood - there might very possibly be an officer in the room when she received the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, was there not, and have you not sworn it? A. I have sworn I went to Forester, a City officer, and asked him to take him into custody, it being in the City; I was not accompained by a brother officer, and had not one in the room at the time I took him; I never swore so- when I went to the house next day I applied for the handkerchief, and searched the woman to find it; I did not take her into custody - Mr. Wooler told me the numbers of the notes, and promised to produce them before the Magistrate, but he did not till he was compelled; he did not bring them the first time: I have not been offered any reward in this case - nobody has ever said any thing to me about it; I never asked Mr. Clarke for any thing, nor had any conversation with him about it - I have been at a very great expence in it - I think I have spent nearly 2l.; I was obliged to come from Croydon at my own expence, and never had a farthing, nor asked for any thing; Gosling, the publican, is here - Mr. Wooler had the watch in his hand, and held it by the chain; Clarke was behind me, and I said, "Is that your watch?" he said, "No, mine was silver - that appears to be a gold one;" I know nothing about a ride in a coach from Bow-street to the station-house - I call the instrument produced a turn-screw; I have not inquired whether there is a more common instrument in London.</p>

            . These are the notes; I marked them, and gave them to Mr. Wood - one 5l. note is not here; I gave it up for Jepson's defence, by direction of Mr. Minshull - it was No. 23,560.</p>

               <p>MR. CLARKE. This 50l. note is one of mine - it has on it, in my own hand-writing, "Shaw, 19th of June, 1831;" I received it from him, and had had it by me a good while; here is G. C., my initials, under the name, in my hand-writing.</p>
               <p>The 5l. notes produced were Nos. 23,561, 23,563, and 23,564.</p>

             (chief clerk of Bow-street.) The parish in question is Paddington; it has been described as Paddington only for the last twenty years - it is some times called St. Mary, but I never use that name.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Is not the proper name of the parish St. Mary? A. Not to my knowledge; it is only within a few years that I have heard it called St. Mary.</p>

            . I am a tailor and cap maker, and live at No. 34, King-street, Borough, and am a house-keeper. I know Wood; he came to my house on the 29th of July, about three o'clock, as near as possible, to ask me to go to Gravesend on the following day - I know it was the 29th, because I had an order to get in on the 30th, and told him I could not go on that account; he remained at my house till half-past eleven o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long has he been acquainted with you? A. Fifteen or sixteen years - he lived in Vauxhall-walk, Lambeth; he was brought up a tallow-chandler, and sells candles by commission; he did not dine with me; I am sure it was as late as three that he came, because I was just going to church - nobody has applied to me about this; I did not attend at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first tellany body what you could prove? A. About a fortnight ago - I believe I told my wife; she had seen him there - I mentioned it to the prisoner's mother; I did not tell Mr. Wooler of it - I never mentioned it to any body till a fortnight ago: I then heard he was in trouble, and in reading the newspaper I saw it was on the 29th of July; my wife was at home on the 29th, and another young woman; the young woman is now in Court: my wife was there first, and saw him come in - he drank tea and supped with us - I did not go to church, as he came in: I did not go to Gravesend with him; I was not here last Session, when Wood was examined - I did not go with him or Jepson to Hampton or Windsor; I never saw Jepson before - I have not been to Woods' house more than once for the last six months; he never sent for me to come forward.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did a female call on you to know what you could say in Woods' behalf? A. Yes, his mother called about a fortnight ago - I told her what I could recollect about the 29th of July.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carver and gilder, and live in High-street, Whitechapel—the prisoner was my housemaid for about four months—last Monday she had a holiday to go out, but before she went my wife's daughter, Sarah Myers, spoke to me, and in consequence of what she said, I went into the prisoner's bed-room, and found, under the bed, a pocket, made of some stuff belonging to me, and in it I found these two looking-glasses, which are silvered, but not in frames—also this drinking-glass,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184503030116"></xptr>
               <p>and other property named, and some envelopes, which are not named in this indictment—I let the things remain—about one o'clock the prisoner was going out, and asked for her wages—I said, "I will go and get change and pay you"—I got a policeman—after I had given her in charge, I went into her room, and the property was then gone—these two looking-glasses had been in the silvering-room, which is adjoining her bed-room—none of them had any business in her pocket—it is impossible to swear to these glasses—I can swear positively to this handkerchief as being mine, and to this flannel, because it was used in our business.</p>

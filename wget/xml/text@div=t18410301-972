                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Ravenhouse, of Queen's-build<lb></lb>ings, Brompton. This glass was pawned for 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the 19th of February, between six o'clock and half-past by the prisoner, in the name of Adam.</p>
               <p>

               <p>— <hi rend="smallCaps">KAY</hi>. I am a policeman. I took him in charge at the pawn<lb></lb>broker's—he at first denied having pawned it, but before he left the shop he said he bought it of a man in Brompton for 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and pawned it half an hour afterwards, as he was distressed.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Has there been any other person indicted about this glass? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—a policeman of the V division came to Queen-square to identify a person there, and he said he saw a person coming with a glass similar to this in the direction from the prosecutor's on the evening it was lost.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's sister. I was with him on Friday evening, the 19th of February, when he bought the glass of a man near the Red Lion public-house at Brompton—the man had on a long dark coat, that is all I recollect of him—my married sister, Harriet Sherwood, was with me at the time—I do not know what became of it after he bought it—we left him, and went to my sister's house at Kennington-street, Knightsbridge—he went away with the glass.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Tell us the exact time this happened? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was about six o'clock in the evening—it happened opposite the Crown and Sceptre public-house, not a quarter of a mile from Mr. Ravenhouse's, the pawn-broker—my brother works for Mr. Bigley, a market-gardener—he was in place there at the time—he does not deal in glass—this did not take long—the man who had the glass spoke first—he asked 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—my brother would not buy it for a considerable time, at last he gave him 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and then the man went away—the man was coming from towards Knights-bridge—my brother did not past by the name of Adam, I never heard him called by that name—he pawned the glass for 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I heard that from him—he did not inquire how the man got it, or why he was selling glass in a public street—he had the appearance of a hawker—I cannot tell why my brother should pawn it in the name of Adam—I did not know he had pawned it in that name.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where was it you asked him if he bad any body with him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The inspector at the station told him he might say any thing he thought proper, but what he said would be given in evidence against him—he then asked whether he objected to say whether any body was with him when he bought it—he said no, there was not, and he told me in the station afterwards that nobody was with him—he said he had bought it in the street at Brompton for 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

Witness. No; I alarmed another lodger and his wife when I missed these things, and they came into the room; my husband opened my bed-room door when the prisoner came in; and he put his head into the bed-room for me to see him - and I said, he was the man who came that morning.</p>

            . I am thirteen years old; I know the nature of an oath - I am the daughter of the prosecutor; I was in bed with my brother that night; I awoke when the prisoner came into the room with the noise he made; he said to my brother, "Halloo, my brave fellow, what time do you get up in the morning?" my brother said,"Seven o'clock;" he said, "I shall be up and at work by six o'clock;" there was a light in the room - my brother went to sleep, but I did not; I do not think the prisoner knew that I was awake; the prisoner took off his jacket and waistcoat, and his shoes, and seemed to be doing something to his shoes for about a quarter of an hour; he then took a nail from behind a box; he then looked into my mother's band-box, and then in a hat-box; he then opened the other box and took out her gown, two pieces of linen, and some silk handkerchiefs, and stuffed them partly into his hat - I was afraid to speak; he then got another box, but the candle dropped and went out; he tried to light it, but could not; he then opened the other box, but what he took out of that I could not see, but he took something out; he then went to bed - I laid still till I heard the knock at the door at one o'clock; that put me in better spirits and I got up; I thought the prisoner had taken the key out of the door, but he had not, and I opened the door, and came down and told my mother while she was striking a light.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Your father came into the room and stopped for five minutes. Witness. He came into the room and you said, as you were coming up stairs that you and he would have a gallon of porter to morrow night, as you had been out so late.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are you able to swear that these things were in the boxes that night? A. Yes.</p>

             (police-constable S 73). I was on duty at half-past one o'clock that Friday morning; Mr. Smith called me and I went to the house - I found the prisoner in bed and these things about the room - these things were in his hat, and these were under his head - he was perfectly sober - he said at the watch-house that he was in liquor, but he was not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When I got to the watch-house, this woman said she could not swear I was the man, as there were plenty more in the house. Witness. When I got to the house first, there was no one in the room but the prisoner and the two children; the other persons from the house came in afterwards,</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The prosecutrix was not willing to press the charge.</p>
               <p>MARY SMITH. I said, I did wish to press the charge, but I am confident he is the man that committed the robbery.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Could any other man have gone into the room, from the time of your children going to bed and the prisoner coming in? A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She said she could not prove I was the man, and the sergeant said he would put it down on suspicion; and the officer came back and said to the sergeant, "I have made all right, I have told the girl what to say."</p>
               <p>ROBERT ECCLES, I did not say any thing of the kind, I left her to her own free will; the wife was unwilling to press the charge, but I fetched the husband and he pressed it.</p>
               <p>COURT to ANN SMITH. Q. Are you sure the prisoner is the man who came and undid the boxes? A. Yes, quite sure; what I have said is all the truth; neither the policeman, nor my mother, nor any one, has told me what to say.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

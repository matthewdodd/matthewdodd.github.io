                  </hi>. I am a draper, and live in Broadway, Deptford. On the 7th of February, between six and eight o'clock, the prisoner came to my shop, and requested to take some shawls to show Mrs. Collins, of King-street, Deptford—I asked if she came from Mrs. Collins—she said, "Yes," and I gave her two shawls—I think the price was marked on them—on the following day I sent Arthur Osborne to Mrs. Collins, and on his return I gave information at the police station-house—MRS. Collins had been a customer of mine for some time—I had seen the prisoner at my shop once or twice before—I gave credit to her representation that she came from Mrs. Collins, and parted with them for no other purpose than for her to show Mrs. Collins.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Collins, a traveller, and live at No. 5, King-street, Deptford. I have known the prisoner four years—I did not send her on any message on the 29th of November last—I know Mr. Watts—I did send her there for some linen on the 25th, which was the first time she came to work in my house—I had a child dying on the 29th—I did not send her for any thing on the 7th of February—I never saw her between November last and the 7th of February—she did not bring any shawls to me—I never authorised her in any way to apply for them.</p>

Q.</hi> What are you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A married woman I think—the prisoner was with me four days, from the 25th of November to the 29th—she came at ten o'clock in the morning, and left at night—she left earlier on the 29th, because my baby died that night—I did not see her again till I saw her before the Magistrate at Greenwich, when the duplicate of my watch, chain, and seals, was found on her—I was never before a Magistrate in my life—I keep a lodging-house.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is it a house of such description that young men and women come without your knowledge and sleep there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A gentleman may come—I do not allow strangers to sleep there—I consider it a proper moral house—I do not consider it an immoral house, unless I am taken before a Magistrate—I was brought here to prosecute the prisoner last Sessions, and gave evidence against her—perhaps I might have said on that occasion that I did not consider mine a proper moral house—I have come to state the truth—I may very likely let lodgings in this way when my husband is at home—I did not say last time that I had eleven children—I said I was the mother of eleven—I have eight now—I married a gentleman, but misfortunes may overtake you as well as me—the prisoner is a straw-bonnet and dress-maker—I knew she was a gay and unfortunate girl—she was frequently at my house, because her mother was committed to Maidstone gaol for starving a child to death, and she had nowhere to go—that was not the reason why I let her live in my house, but she had nobody to take care of her at home—I swore to the property at the last trial, and here is part of it round my neck now—I was shamefully treated last trial—I had not a <hi rend="italic">vestige</hi> in me, I had not a feeling about me but what was numbed.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You did not get the watch, did you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Oh, but she got it—I could bring forward the man that put my initials on it—I got the chain, and she got the watch—I take in married women and their husbands, and perhaps single girls and their husbands.</p>

               <p>on the 12th or 13th of February, in High-street, Woolwich, three or four miles from High-street, Deptford—I met her with another female, named Thurley—I told her I wanted her—she asked what for—she had this shawl on—MR. Watts, who was with me, laid hold of the shawl, and said, "That is one of my shawls"—I told her she had better come to Mrs. Thurley's house—we went there, and I said she must go to the station-house—she said, "Mr. Watts, I hope you will forgive me; I know I have done wrong; I intended to pay you, and will pay you now"—I asked if she had any du<lb></lb>plicate—she said, "No"—MRS. Thurley said, "Yes, you have"—I found she had sent the duplicate to her mother's—I went there, and found the duplicate of the other shawl—she said she had sent 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to redeem the shawl—she said she met a female, who over-persuaded her to pawn the shawl, and she gave her the 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., as she was distressed, and she would suffer any thing sooner than tell who the female was.</p>

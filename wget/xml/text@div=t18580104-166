                  </hi>. I am pay sergeant of the Royal Elthorne Militia; it is my duty to look round the stores. On 11th Dec, I went to make an in<lb></lb>spection of the sergeant's cottages, and saw a pane of glass broken in Charles Clements' cottage; the glass was on the floor, and the catch was undone—I missed two counterpanes, and some cups and saucers, a tea pot and a sugar basin—I had seen them safe the day before—I am certain that the counter<lb></lb>panes belong to Charles Clements—he has gone to Ireland—the prisoner was left to look after the stores which were left behind—I received these cups and saucers, and dimity (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), from a boy who Mrs. Archer sent—I gave them to Thomas Smith, a policeman—they are the same pattern as those lost, and part of them are left now in the sergeant's room.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Longman, and keep a beer shop at Hillingdon. The prisoner has been billeted at our house—after he left, a man named Cripps came; that was last Friday three weeks—very near a week before the prisoner was taken, Cripps brought some crockery—I did not take much notice of it, but this is very like it—after that the prisoner came and asked me if I would have the china—I said, "I do not want it, I have got more than I want"—he took it away, and came back without it—Crippsleft it, and the prisoner took it away tied in a bit of dimity.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a beer shop at Uxbridge. The prisoner came there four weeks ago next Thursday—I was out at the time—when I came home he asked for the master of the house; I said that I was the master, and he asked me if I would buy two counterpanes—I said, "Yes, if I can"—he showed them to me, and told me he had bought them in London when he was recruiting—I gave them to Smith the policeman—I believe these are them.</p>

               <p>I bought them out of my recruiting money; I was out three weeks, and between three or four of us, we got between 300 and 400 recruits; I bought these articles thinking they would do for my sister whose husband was drowned, but finding that she had gone into the union I sold them; I knew the man well, for he was billeted in the same house as I was; he deals in crockery; I met him with the crockery, he asked me to fetch it out for him, and I said that I would; I have been many years a soldier in the East India Company, and in the Sikh wars, and was in eight general engagements.</p>

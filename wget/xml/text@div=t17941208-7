               <p>Q. What are you? - I am a <rs id="t17941208-7-viclabel40" type="occupation">man that is employed by merchants in London, to go on board the ships, and see them safe discharged at the Custom house</rs>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - I have seen him; it is hard for me to recollect him now; it is about a year ago; but really I cannot positively swear to him; it is the man in black clothes, the middle man, to the best of my knowledge he was the man.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him first? - It was in July last, it was the latter end about the 25th or 26th of July.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see him? - In the <placeName id="t17941208-7-crimeloc41">Bengal coffee house, just off Tower-hill</placeName>

               <p>Q. Had you known him before? - I had not known him before.</p>
               <p>Q. In what part of the house did you see him? - There was one that he called Mr. Clark with him, and there was another man came in that said he was a country man, and said he came from coventry, an ancient man, he had had a grandmother died and left him eighteen hundred pounds; and this countryman he wanted to be introduced to the people, and he said, gentlemen, I hope I have not offended you; he called for some rum and water.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was there before he came in? - Me and this man, and Clarke. And after he had been in a little while, he said, you are a parcel of ignorant fellows, you have no money, I came to sport money among you, I came to London to spend money, I bet you fifty pounds that you altogether cannot produce four hundred pounds in three hours; one of the gentlemen said, I can produce upwards of two hundred pounds myself; and another man, who's name was Mills, said, he could produce near two hundred pounds; and he asked me what I could produce? I said, I have no money at all, only thirteen or fourteen guineas; well, says he, fetch it and we can make it up.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there was another person in the room of the name of Mills? - Yes. Says he, Mills, you shall have the third of that fifty pounds, the man has too much money. I went to Ratcliffe-cross where I lived, I went on foot, and came back in a coach and this Clarke he went ready to meet me.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went home what did you do? - My money was in a purse, I put it in my pocket and came away.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came back who paid for the coach? - I paid for it myself.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came back who did you find there? - I found these three men. Clarke was waiting there for me.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were these three gentlemen; was the prisoner one? - That he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the country gentleman one of the others? - Yes, and Clarke.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do? - I went in and put the money on the table.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing at the time? - I went out to make water.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you put it there for? - Not for their use, for the account of getting part of fifty pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Pretty good interest. When you put it on the table did you say any thing? - I said there is the money I went for; I went to go down stairs to make water, Mills followed me down, and said, come over along with me to my counting house, and we will be back in five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. What was you to go to his counting house for? - To give directions to his clerks. I went with him to the corner of the street, and then he said, you had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080047"></xptr>better go back to the gentlemen, I will be back with you in five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had you left in the room? - The prisoner and Clarke; when I went back they were all gone.</p>
               <p>Q. You found all the money there again? - No money, they took care to take the money with them that night.</p>
               <p>Q. You never see your money again? - Never a farthing of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell the landlord of the house this? - I told the landlord what happened, and he seemed to be sorry.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you saw the prisoner at the bar again? - Six or seven months it was.</p>
               <p>Q. And then you gave that information to the officer about it? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go, to Worship-street? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of that information after six or seven months the prisoner was apprehended? - He was.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt, or had you any doubt when he was apprehended, that he was one of the three men? - I was certain of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt now? - None at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any intention of parting with your money, unless for the share of this fifty pounds? - I thought a trifle of that money would be a kind of service to me, an old man and my wife.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You never saw the prisoner at the bar till six or seven months after the wrong was done you? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you six on that gentleman first of all, that he was the man? - A man may be mistaken, I thought he had a great likeness of the man, it is a particular thing, and I have not swore positive to any man.</p>
               <p>Q. And when you came here to be asked who has done you that injury, you pointed to that man? - I am an old man, upwards of seventy years of age, I would not deprive him nor any soul of any thing in the world.</p>
               <p>Q. I dare say you do not wish to do any thing that was wrong.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He wanted to swear to the person that belonged to the office where I was committed from.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. That is the very man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You know any body may be mistaken; did not you say first of all at the office that some other man had done you the wrong? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Did you give information soon after this happened to the office? - Directly.</p>

               <p>Q.

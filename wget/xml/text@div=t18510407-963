                  </hi>. On 8th April, a little after ten o'clock, I went to see Mr. Longworthy, the butler at Mr. Hoare's—I was about to leave the house—the prisoner said he was going my way, and we left together—he bad a bundle with him, done up in a blue handkerchief, which I thought was dirty linen—I went with him to the corner of Bury-street, St. James's, where he said he was going to make a call, and would be back directly—I waited for him about a quarter of an hour—he came back with a police<lb></lb>man—we went back to Mr. Hoare's, and on the way he said he had got into a bit of a scrape through his <hi rend="italic">ends</hi>—we went back to the servants' hall, and he went up-stairs.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. Greenhill, of Bury-street, St. James's. On 8th April the prisoner came to the shop with two bundles, one containing scrapings and the other, as he said, pieces—he said he was going out of town and had brought some ends to sell—I weighed the scrapings, they were 7lbs.—I was weighing the other bundle, when the policeman came in and asked him what he had, he said, "Pieces, perquisites I am allowed at Mr. Hoare's"—the policeman pulled over the bundle and found some whole candles—I called my employer, and he told the policeman to take him to Mr. Hoare, as he was sure he would not allow it—we are in the habit of buying wax ends, we weigh, them and</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long ago is it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Some long time back, if there had been any long pieces I should have objected to take them—sometimes the candle ends are taken off the account, and sometimes allowed to the under butler.</p>

I was on duty in Waterloo-place, and followed the prisoner and another person to Mr. Greenhill's, wax<lb></lb>chandlers, in Bury-street—I waited a minute, then went into the shop, and saw a bundle on the counter and another blue one in the scales, I asked the prisoner to let me see what the bundles contained; he said they were his perquisites—I requested to see them, and he said, "It is no matter they are my perquisites"—I told him I must see them, and took the bundle out of the scales, opened it and found it contained a quantity of scrapings, some long pieces, and several whole candles (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I found in the other bundle several whole candles—Mr. Greenhill was called to the shop, and I told the prisoner he must tie them up and come with me to his master's, he did so and we went—when we got to Mr. Hoare's, the prisoner went up-stairs, and I waited in the servants' hall with the candles—in three or four minutes I was called up; Mr. Longworthy ex<lb></lb>amined the bundle with the long pieces, and said to the prisoner, "Oh, Thomas, these are not your property, they belong to Mr. Hoare—I have had my suspicion a long time"—the prisoner said, "I am sorry for it"—the butler gave him into my custody—I weighed the bundles at the station, and found them to be 131bs.</p>

                  </hi>. I am butler to Mr. Hoare, of Spring-gardens, and have been in the service of the family forty years—the prisoner was under-butler thirteen months—on 8th April, about half-past ten, he asked me to allow him to go out; I told him it was very inconvenient as the family were just leaving town, and he was to be back in ten minutes—he went out, returned shortly afterwards and said to me, "I have been out for the purpose of selling my wax pieces and ends, and a policeman has stopped me, if you will say they are my perquisites the policeman will let me go"—I said I should do no such thing; "If you have taken anything improper you must stand the consequences"—I called up the policeman, he brought the things, and I took up a large piece (I think this is it), and said, "Thomas this can't be right;" and he said, "I took that out of the dining-room"—all pieces above an inch long I should consider to be Mr. Hoare's property, and I never sanctioned the prisoner taking any away above that—I picked out what I considered to be Mr. Hoare's, and there were about 13lbs. there were 31bs. of whole candles worth 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound—I gave the candles out to the prisoner; and I have asked him if the candles were burnt, and he has told me they were; I suspected they were not and told him to be careful, and that they were to be burned within an inch, as my bill for wax was greater than it had been for years—I keep the candles in the wine-cellar; on 24th March, I left the cellar door open; when I returned I found my drawer open and missed some candles.</p>

               <p>evening for half an ounce of common tobacco, which came to three farthings—he gave me a sixpence—I gave him five pence farthing—he went away—I put the six pence into a basin in which there was only two four-penny pieces beside—I am quite certain of that—my daughter came in about two minutes after, and from what she said I went to the basin—I found in it only the two four-penny pieces and the sixpence—no one had been in the shop—on Sun<lb></lb>day, the 6th of April, the prisoner came again—I was in the shop alone—I remembered him again—he asked for a quartern loaf and some other things, which came to sixpence—he put his hand into his pocket and took out a shil<lb></lb>ling—my daughter had then come into the shop and she took up the shil<lb></lb>ling and said, "You gave my mother a bad sixpence last evening"—he said he did not, and he had not been in the shop, but I have no doubt of him whatever.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Mrs. Elliott's daughter. About seven o'clock on Saturday evening, the 5th of April, I was in the parlour—there is a window between that and the shop—I saw the prisoner come in, and took notice enough of him to know him again—about two minutes after he was gone I looked at the sixpence in the basin and found it was bad—I put it apart from other money till next day, when the prisoner came again—I knew him to be the same person—I am confident of him—he bought some things of my mother, which came to sixpence, and put down a shilling—I took it up and found it was bad—I told him so, and I told him he had been there the day before—he said he had not, that he had taken the shilling of a young man for some work, and would fetch him—I told him to go and he left the shop—I went a short distance after him—he turned up Booth-street—I saw a constable and directed him to take him—I gave the constable the bad shilling and sixpence.</p>

She sometimes did not bring it all home; I did not sell a milk-walk to her, nor to any one altogether - we had had some talk about it, and the price was settled; she had began to sell milk on her own account - she got some of my customers, but I did not much mind that; she got but two or three houses - she has never said she had collected this money for me.</p>

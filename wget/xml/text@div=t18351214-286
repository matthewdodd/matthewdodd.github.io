                  </hi>. I am a wholesale jeweller, and live in Nassau-street, Soho, The prisoner Taylor was in my service till within the last few days—he was a setter, but did other work occasionally—Abba was in my service—he worked in the shop, as Taylor did, but not in the same line of busi<lb></lb>ness—he ceased to work in the shop about August, but was afterwards, employed to work for me at his own house—he had not access to my property after that—I missed property before be left, and afterwards, and I had suspicion of Taylor, who lodged with Abba, at No, 49, Great Queen-street, Lincoln's-inn-fields—I had given Taylor notice, and he should have left on the Saturday, but he left the Wednesday before—he did not give me any notice of going at the time; he absconded, and that induced me to get a search warrant—I saw a Mr. Amery on Saturday—on Monday last, I went to Abba's premises, and found some duplicates, and among others, one for a gold ring, set with chrysolites—I had not seen if for a length of time.</p>

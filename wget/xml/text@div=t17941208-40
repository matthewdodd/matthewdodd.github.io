               <p>Q. What have you to say, concerning the loss of these things? - After the discharge of the man, by the justice, on the 25th of October; on the intercession of the magistrate, I agreed with him to delay the prosecution, till I could make up my mind about it, we were before the justice on the property lately mentioned; after I had given my testimony, and the other people theirs, the prisoner being there at the time, after the evidence was heard, the clerk demanded if I was determined to prosecute; I said unquestionably, upon that the prisoner said, what, prosecute an old man with three children! yes, said, I certainly, for you will only bring them up as bad as yourself.</p>
               <p>Court. Permit the counsel to put the questions; and you give the answers; let us all know our places.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Now come to Sunday the 26th, when you got the search warrant? - On Sunday afternoon, I obtained a warrant to search the house, No. 47; and I proceeded to the house No. 47, Armitage-street, Wapping; the house was kept by a woman, whom I understand, goes sometimes by the name of Young, and sometimes by the name of Bolton. After the first discovery of the things being lost. I took what pains I could to inform myself what things were lost; I proceeded, and went to the house, of one Dunbar, and got into the parlour where the prisoner was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to the prisoner? - I said very little to him at first, I did not wish to have any conversation with him; he began to cry, and begged for mercy, and his wife went down on her knees.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you find there? - The constable must produce them (the goods produced) I was going to tell you, I have an inventory of the things that were on board the vessel, and many of the things were missing.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. I know the Equipage case to be mine; I cannot swear to the blanket, but you will know by the witness,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080161"></xptr>how it was proved, he said it was mine before the justice; and he asked me if I had not given him this? I told him no, never; he said then I should have it again; I said that I would, but it should be by legal means. He however, admitted that the blanket and the tin case was mine.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I have the same character to give the gentlemen of the jury of this man, that I gave before.</p>
               <p>Court To Dunbar. Was you present at finding all these things? - I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find these things? - At a house No. 47, Armitage-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts in the house? - In the one pair of stairs room forward, some, and some of the articles were found in the two pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were they? - Laying about in the room, I did not find the whole of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they open? - Yes, I don't think that any of them were locked up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they appear to you, that they were visible to persons that happened to come in? - I think they were.</p>
               <p>Q. For instance, if Mr. Fitzgerald had happened to come into the house, whether he would have seen the things? - Yes, I believe he might.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I found this lawn handkerchief among some hair that was under the bed, I found the tea pot with a quantity of fish hooks in it, behind a bowl in the closet, on the left side of the fire place. I found all these articles that were put into the possession of Dunbar. The file drooped from a bed, from two blankets, which I was informed Smith claimed, these are dishes (taking them up) I found in the same bed-room, they were in the fire place, in which there was no grate.</p>
               <p>Q. Open? - Yes, it may be said to be open. I left about two dozen of plates and a wash-hand bason, and some other things; but I lost so many,</p>

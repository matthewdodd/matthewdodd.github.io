                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, R</hi> 250). On Monday, 8th December, in consequence of information I received from Mr. Sparrow, I went to 5, Rebecca-place, New-cross, and found the prisoner there, at her father's house—I said to her, "Mr. Sparrow has given me information that he gave you permission to go to the play, and that you went out with Mrs. Sparrow's jacket and page"—she admitted doing so, and commenced crying—I went to the prisoner's sister's house—I got the jacket and page from there—I took the prisoner to the station-house—I asked her if her box was looked, and said I hoped there was nothing in it—she said she did not think it was locked; if so, the key was on the mantel-piece; and if there was anything in her box, it must have been put in by some one else; she did not put them in—I went to the house, and examined the mantel-piece, and then came back to the station—the prisoner was searched by the female searcher, and the key</p>

               <p>of her box found in her pocket—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—she said she was not aware the key was in her pocket—I then went back to her mistress's house, and unlocked the box with this key, in the presence of Mrs. Sparrow and the other servants—I found in the box this black lace shawl, two pairs of gloves, a pair of cuffs, a sash of ribbon, and a pocket handkerchief (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the handkerchief was in the prisoner's dress, hanging up behind the door—everything but that was found in the box—I also found a key at the bottom of the box, which locked and unlocked her box, as well as the other one.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Bodychan Sparrow, of No. 1, Melville-place, Lee-road—the prisoner has been in my service four months—on Saturday, 6th December, I obtained leave from my husband to let her go to the theatre—she promised to return that night by the 11 o'clock train—she did not do so—her sister called the following evening, at 5 o'clock—my husband went to church in the morning, and while he was gone I missed the jacket—my husband went to the police-station, and a policeman called the same evening—we did not wish anything done on Sunday evening, and in the meantime her sister came, at 5 o'clock—the policeman went up stairs on Sunday evening with the under nurse, and brought me down word that the box was locked—on Monday he returned with the key—I saw him open the box, and saw some of my property in it—tips is my shawl—I had mined it for quite six weeks before—I have had it two or three years—I have no doubt about its being mine—this ribbon is also mine—I cannot say about these gloves; they might, or might not, be mine—I had spoken to the pri<lb></lb>soner and the other servants when I missed this shawl—I asked about it several times—the prisoner had no authority whatever from me to take these things and put them in her box—the shawl was hanging up in a dressing-room, behind the door, before I missed it—the first night the prisoner came to my house there was some difficulty in getting her box open, and I lent her a great many loose keys—I afterwards allowed her to keep one of them—I have never seen it since—she came down, and said she was much obliged to me; she had found one; and I said she might keep it.</p>

Q.</hi> Who had the care of your wardrobe? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Nobody but myself—the duty of my under nurse is to attend to me and my bed-room, and to put up my things after me—she has somewhat the duties of a lady's maid; she is learning to be a lady's maid—I did not hear from her that the Garibaldi jacket had been lent, certainly not—I heard about the jacket first from Mockford—that was in the course of the Sunday, while my husband was at church—she told me because I said I should send her back to her father if she did not tell me everything she knew about Caro<lb></lb>line—her sister came for the purpose of asking me to receive her back—she might have come to ask me to excuse her no return on the Saturday night—she told me she was in bed, which was not true—I told her it was too late; that my husband had already been at the police-office—I have given</p>

I am under nurse to Mrs. Sparrow—on 6th December I saw the prisoner leave my master's house—she had on her brown dress, her mistress's Garibaldi jacket, a black page, and a black jacket—she did not come back that night—the next morning, after my mistress questioning me, I told her what I had seen.</p>

My fellow—servant told me not to take the red jacket, as my mistress would want it in the evening. The policeman asked for the key of my box. I told him he would find it on the mantel—piece, and if not he might break the box. I afterwards gave the key up to the constable, not being aware that it was in my pocket."</p>

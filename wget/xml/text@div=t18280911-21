            . I know the prosecutors' warehouse - it is in the parish of St. Mary the Virgin. I have the box - I took it from the prisoner in Little Moorfields, about one hundred and fifty yards from their house; I stopped him with it - he said it was his own; I saw people coming out of the prosecutor's house in search of something, and took him in there - Mr. Gottheimer claimed it, and the property in it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When the officer took me, I turned round to see the person who employed me to carry it.</p>

               <p>SAMUEL FRANKLAND. He said at first that it was his own, but when he found I was an officer, he said a gentleman gave it to him to carry.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He came across, and asked where I got the box; I immediately replied, "The person employed me to carry it."</p>
               <p>SAMUEL FRANKLAND. I saw another man standing at the corner of Aldermanbury, a few doors from the prosecutor's house - the prisoner was standing still; the man came up to the prisoner, and then he came back: I went into a house almost opposite, and saw that man come out of the prosecutor's house with this box - he met the prisoner, who took it from him and ran off with it directly; when I first saw them they were about twenty yards from the prosecutor's.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was never near the place it came from, and did not know it was stolen; I left my father's house about ten o'clock in the morning, going towards Bishopsgate-street - in London-wall a young man came up and asked me to carry a box; I said I would - he said he would follow me and pay me for my trouble: I carried it for him a short distance - an officer took me, and asked where I got it; I stated as I have told you.</p>
               <p>JURY to SAMUEL FRANKLAND. Q. Did the prisoner converse with the man before he went into the house? A. He did; I saw them together previous to the box being brought out: there was a direction on it to the prosecutor's brother, at Davenport; I saw them walking about, looking in at the door for half an hour before; I watched them from ten till almost eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>One witness gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

               <p>Upon the 27th of May the prisoner came into our shop and asked to look at some black and white ribbon; I shewed her some. Then she asked for some mourning gauze. I saw her take the gauze off the counter and put it into her pocket; but I did not see her take it out of her pocket. I informed Mr. Cathero of it.</p>
               <p>Should you know that piece again? - Yes. (looks at it) I am sure this is the piece.</p>
               <p>Had she bought any gauze and paid for it? - No.</p>

               <p>Do you know this gauze of your own knowledge to be your property? - I am very sure of it; there are several particular marks in the gauze by which I know it.</p>
               <p>Frank. It is cut in a particular manner.</p>
               <p>What is the value of it?</p>
               <p>Cathero. The gauze cost me about seven shillings and sixpence.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner called three witnesses who gave her a good character.)</p>

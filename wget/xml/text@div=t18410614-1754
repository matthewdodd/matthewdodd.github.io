It is my duty to call the labourers in the morning, and when called, their names are entered in the book—there are different parties calling at the same time for different departments in the docks, and after they are hired the men are stationed off by different foremen to where they are to work, and the men under me should see they are doing that work—there is No. I and No. 2 warehouses in the docks, but I do not belong to either—a little before eight o'clock the prisoner came to the dock gates to be hired—I had seen him one day before—he was called by name and answered to it—the warehouse-keeper entered his name in the book in my presence to work at the south quay—the No. 2 warehouse is on the north quay—be<lb></lb>tween three and four o'clock I saw the prisoner at work on the south quay—that is not No. 1 warehouse—I asked him why he did not help into the warehouse with a packet—about half-past four it is usual to pay the men—I was present when the men were paid—the prisoner's name was called</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman of No. 1 warehouse, London Docks, which is opposite the south quay—the labourers' names are called over in the morning, and they are hired for the south and north quays—No, 1 warehouse is in the north quay—I called the labourers myself on this Fri-day, for the No. 1 warehouse—I called the prisoner—no person had a right to hire himself for two warehouses at the same time—he could not work in both.</p>

            . I am a widow. The female prisoner has lived sixteen or seventeen years with me. I missed my property in October last, from a room adjoining my bed-room, and communicating with a room where she and her husband slept - she has been married to the other prisoner six years, and he lived in the house with my permission; I gave him leave to occupy one of the parlours, and he always kept it locked, which I thought a great liberty. I do not think that I saw him above four or five times. When I left town for my health, I put my jewels into a small deal box, which I put in my portfolio, and when I was in town, they were kept in a drawer in the middle room. I saw them last about July twelve months - I had seen the box often after that. When I missed them, which was in October last, I called the female prisoner up, and interrogated her - I asked her how they could be taken, and said I supposed somebody must have false keys; but I had such confidence in her, I did not suspect her. I then thought proper to look after my plate, which was kept in the same room - I opened the closet and the plate drawer, and found the paper it had been in, but all the plate was gone - she said she wished she had her health, for she would go and seek after them. She remained in the house a very few days after this; I had given them warning to leave, but they left suddenly before the notice expired, and without giving me any intimation.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. The communication you made for them to leave, was by writing the man a note - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not expect that they were going, in consequence<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182404070004"></xptr>of some communication made to you - A. No; on the contrary, when I was going to bed I sent to enquire for her. I had not seen my jewels for a year and a quarter - I had seen the plate frequently, whenever I went to the drawer, but never opened it; I might not have gone to the drawer for three or four months. I have no butler. I keep the key of the plate myself, and the female prisoner went for it when I wanted it. I very seldom saw the man, but can speak positively to his person. I spoke to the female prisoner about the parlour door being locked, and remonstrated with her about it from the very first of his coming, and continually afterwards, but not latterly. I cannot say when I last remonstrated about it, I did it so frequently.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. The female prisoner has been many years in your service - A. Yes, and deserved the character of a very honest person. I missed nothing previous to her marriage. The property was deposited in a room, next to that they occupied, and they had to pass through it. I believe the male prisoner was scarcely ever out of the house. She was particularly under his influence and controul; there were dreadful disturbances in the house. I have begged him to leave the house frequently - his usage to her was barbarous. I missed my keys on one occasion, and they were found in the parlour, which he kept locked; they were the keys which I had occasionally entrusted the female prisoner with - I used to put them in my couch, and in the morning when I came down, they were missing - she was in that room every morning.</p>

            . In October last. I was employed as washerwoman in the prosecutrix's house; my daughter Margaret was servant there at the time. I can read but very little. I was making the prisoner Elizabeth's bed one day (they sometimes slept separate,) in the front attic, not on the same floor as the prosecutrix; it was when she slept alone. As I made the bed, I saw a dirty petticoat between the bed and mattress, and as I was going to wash, I threw it out, and as I threw it down, I heard papers rattle - curiosity induced me to see what it was; I found the petticoat had a pocket in it, and in it I found two duplicates of property pawned at Dobree's - I took them to my daughter, and gave them to her. The male prisoner never made his appearance in the kitchen till between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, when I was there. On the morning after the duplicates were found, I saw him come down into the kitchen in a flannel jacket, a little after six o'clock. I saw him again on the following morning, at the same time; I was washing, and had some linen of his, and missed it on the third day after I found the duplicates. I had washed it on Tuesday, hung it up on Wednesday and Thursday, and missed it on Friday morning - he had gone away on the Thursday, and on that day he wanted a pair of stockings to put on; I said I had none of his; he said,</p>
               <p>"It does not matter, I will take these," which were the prosecutrix's; he took them out of my hand - this was about ten or eleven o'clock in the morning. I said they were Mrs. Keighly's; he said it did not matter; he dined at home that day, and I did not see him after. He gave me no reason to suppose that he was going away. He and the female prisoner dined with us that day, which was not usual; the female prisoner seemed very ill; she was quite frightened and was crying, and was almost in steric fits and said, Oh! Thomas, what have you brought me to" - he said,</p>
               <p>"Why do you fret, don't mind Mrs. Keighly, she won't fret for you." About half-past five o'clock, she had her tea, and went out, saying she would not be gone ten minutes, and told my daughter that if she was asked for, to say she was gone to lay down - she never returned.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you heard anything from them about any foreign country - A. On the Wednesday night she said to my daughter,</p>
               <p>"I must go out, for Thomas has gone and left me;" my daughter said,</p>
               <p>"Don't go out to night, it is so wet" - she said,</p>
               <p>"I must go, for I miss his passport, he is gone and left me;" she went out, and wanted me to go with her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. They were both at dinner on Thursday, so that he had not left her - A. No. When I found the duplicates, I told my daughter; there was no other servant in the house. My daughter gave them to the female prisoner on Wednesday morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. The room the duplicates were found in was more apart from the prosecutrix's bed-room than where they slept - A. Yes.</p>

            . I am in the service of Mr. Baxter, pawnbroker, Norfolk-street, Middlesex Hospital. I produce two diamond rings, pawned by the prisoner Elizabeth, on the 25th of June, 1823; also a pair of diamond ear-rings, pawned on the 7th of October, 1822, by a female, in the name of Creed, but I do not know who. I have a diamond cross; I do not know who pawned it, but it was renewed by the female prisoner - 31 l. 12 s. 6 d., was lent on it. I produce a diamond ring, necklace, and sprig, pawned for 25 l.; I do not know who by, but the female prisoner renewed them - also a muslin dress and shawl; I cannot say who pawned them; they were not renewed. I have also a diamond locket, ear-rings, and sprig, pawned by a female, but I do not know who.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Why did you receive these things without enquiring about them - A. They were pawned before I came into Mr. Baxter's service, all except two of them, but were renewed afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. You only speak to two articles - A. I speak of others being renewed. I have been in the service nearly three years. The two articles I took in, were pawned in June, 1823; it was two rings for 7 l. - the other was a pledge for 17 l. I am positive of the woman's person; I have not seen her for the last eight or nine months. I swear positively to her pawning the two rings for 7 l. I know her by a scar in her face. I have seen her at the shop several times in June, and before, but not since.</p>

            . I went into the prosecutrix's service the beginning of September last. The male prisoner used to lock himself in the back parlour. I was never in the parlour but once, and then I waited at the door while he opened it; he took his meals down stairs, but by himself, except dinner, which he took with us. When I first went there, he used to come down stairs between ten and eleven o'clock, for a fortnight or three weeks, but afterwards sooner, and sometimes later. I remember my mother bringing me some duplicates, and next morning I saw the female prisoner, and gave them to her, and she seemed very much confused - she put them into her pocket, and said they were some which she had by her; she did not ask how I got them, but a few hours after she asked if I had told my mother that I had the duplicates; I said not, and she told me not to tell her. My mother was washing there on the Tuesday morning. I did not see the male prisoner take anything away, but saw him drying some stockings by the kitchen fire. I dined with them on the day they left; the female prisoner could eat nothing; she was in tears the whole of the time - my mother and myself were at the table with them; she went off into hysterics, and when she came to, the man said how foolish she was to cry - she turned to him, and said she could not help it, that she had to thank him for the whole of it; he said,</p>
               <p>"Never mind;" she clapped her hands together, and said,</p>
               <p>"What have you brought me to;" he said,</p>
               <p>"Why do you fret about Mrs. Keighly, if anything ailed you, she would not fret about you." About four o'clock, while I was taking up dinner, she came and asked if I had seen her husband since dinner - I said I had not; he was not in the house; I had seen him but once after dinner; she was then in conversation with him in the back parlour. She went out about half-past six o'clock; it rained hard - she said a gentleman in High-street owed her some money; that she wanted money very bad, and she would not be gone above ten minutes, and would go to the doctor's in Great Mary-le-bone-street, to get something for her eyes, which were very bad - I begged of her not to go; she said she would, and if mistress asked for her, I was to say she was gone to lay down, and I did so when my mistress asked for her. I was present when the rooms they occupied were opened; there was nothing in them, and nothing in their boxes of any value. There was something wrapped in a letter in the box, with</p>
               <p>"Sugar of lead" written on it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. It was on Wednesday morning you made the communication to her about the duplicate - A. Yes. They did not leave till Thursday evening. I have heard the man say that he was educated at Brussells, but born in England. I know nothing about his endeavouring to get pupils. He was not in my mistress's service.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the woman complain at dinner that she had had some dispute with her mistress about a turban - A. No; she said she was sorry that she was going, and her husband said, never mind. I cannot swear that she did not say her mistress had found fault with her, but I have no recollection of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Was the male prisoner in the habit of keeping in-doors - A. Yes. While I was there I do not think he went out above twice.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did he go out the day before he went away - A. I hear that he was out a good deal.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street officer. In consequence of this transaction, I was employed to go to Mrs. Keighly's house. I found nothing in the parlour, and only papers and rubbish in the prisoners' boxes. I had a common warrant, and went to the Hague, but finding my warrant of no use, I returned, and went again in a few days with a Judges' warrant; it was about the middle of February. I went to the Hague, and then to Brussells, and found the female prisoner at a lodging, washing; she seemed very poor indeed; the Commissariat of the Police was there with an interpreter - she asked him what was the matter; they gave no answer, but searched, and found nothing except a book, which was in a box in the room - this was on the 28th of February. She was put into gaol at Brussells; she was brought to Ostend - I then took her to an English Hotel there, and at night I found the male prisoner there, in bed; I asked his name - he said it was Stevens; I asked where he came from; he said from Brussells; I asked if he knew any one at Brussells; he said he knew Simmons, a coach-maker there. I said,</p>

               <p>"I am inclined to think your name is Crees;" he said, No, it was Stevens. I desired him to dress, and come down, which he did; it was nearly one o'clock in the morning - I remained with him till daylight, about seven o'clock, and then sent Smith for the woman - he brought her; she went up to him, and said,</p>
               <p>"Oh! Thomas;" he then said to me,</p>
               <p>"My name is Crees, I am the person you are looking for." I found nothing but his own property. He had a five-franc piece.</p>
               <p>The prisoners made no Defence.</p>

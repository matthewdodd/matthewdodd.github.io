            . I am the wife of James White. On the 4th of June, at seven o'clock in the morning, I was at home, with my two children and my son William: we all slept in the front room on the ground floor. I awoke at seven in the morning, and saw my window open - the shutter was torn quite down, and the sash thrown up - the prisoner Pray stood at my bed-side, with my pocket and needle-case in her hand, and my money in the other hand - she had silver and halfpence; she lodged on our second floor - Walker was standing against the window in the room. When I went to bed I had placed my pocket between two pillows, with four half-crowns, three sixpences, and 3s. in copper, in it, and a needle-case; Pray had slept in the house that night. I said "Oh, dear me, I am robbed;" Pray answered "You bl-y old wh-e, if you speak another word I will knock your bl-y eye out;" they must have got in at the window for the room door was double locked; I found it so afterwards - the window is three or four feet from the ground. Pray threw the pocket on the pillow again - Walker then went to the window and got out - Pray followed her out immediately; I took up my pocket and all the money was gone; I am sure the money and needle-case were in it when I went to bed; Pray lodged in the house that night, but I heard her go out at four o'clock - before my husband - she has lodged there seven or eight months. I immediately dressed myself - I saw them outside the window, and saw Pray give some money to Walker; Walker said, "Have mercy on your fellow creature;" Pray said "B-r you, take it;" I got out of the window - they both went up the court - I went in pursuit, and found them in a public-house in White-cross-street - Banks, the landlord, was there - I asked him to take charge of them till I could get an officer - I sent for Lock, who came and took them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BARRY. Q. Had not Pray lodged with you ten or eleven months? A. No - seven or eight; I did not know her before she lodged there - I had not quarrelled with my husband - we live very happy.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not awoke at two o'clock in the morning by a cry of murder? A. No; I was with a person who was ill, and did not come home till one o'clock. I have seen Walker backward and forward with Pray but never knew she slept there; I came home very tired - there was no drinking in my room that night, nor had my husband locked me out - when he went out at four o'clock I told him to lock the room door, and take the key, as I did not want to go out till he returned; I expected him back about six o'clock; Pray had a key of the street door, and could go in and out when she liked.</p>
               <p>Q. When they got into your room did you not say"Don't be angry with me, my husband locked the door, and he is like a madman when drunk? A. I said nothing of the sort - we were both quite sober - I did not tell my son to open the window and let them in, or hear the watchman tell them to get in - I found them in the room when I awoke.</p>

            . Q. Had you no dispute with you wife that night? A. None at all; there had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182606220026"></xptr>been a disturbance, about two o'clock, up in Pray's room- I went on the stairs and demanded peace - my wife was in bed, and had been so for three-quarters of an hour - the disturbance was dancing and singing on the second floor - I called for peace, but it still kept on - I did not go into the room, and cannot say who was there; I returned to bed after calling out to them, and did not put them out of the house; I said if there was not peace in the house I would send for an officer.</p>
               <p>WALKER's Defence. Mr. White had never been in bed at all; we went out, and the moment we got out he said"You will not go in again now, Mrs. Pray - I will lay a trap for you, and make you pay for all." I had slept there three weeks: he had been abusing his wife, and there was a cry of murder - he locked us out - Mrs. White opened the shutter - he insisted on it being shut again - the shutter was taken down by a witness for us to get in. Mrs. White asked us to treat her with something to drink - I said I did not mind, and we had no sooner got into the public-house than she came in, and said she was robbed. I insisted on an officer being sent for.</p>
               <p>PRAY's Defence. Mrs. White has known me twenty-four years. On this night I was distressed about my husband's watch, which I had pawned, and the time had expired; I had 6s. in my pocket; the needle-case belonged to my mother, who is dead; I have a witness who took it out of her pocket when she was a corpse: there was nothing in his house but fiddling and dancing till four and five o'clock in the morning. The prosecutrix has sent to me, several times in prison, to say she would hang me if possible, and if not would banish me; she sent to Sir Richard Taylor, who allowed me money, and got it stopped; she said it would be a charity to my husband to convict me.</p>

            . My husband is a carman, but does not live with me. I live in this court - my window fronts White's door. About half-past three or four o'clock on this morning I heard Pray wanting to go into her own apartment; she was in the court; Mr. White vowed she should never go into the house any more; he was in the court with her - he was dressed. She said while she paid her rent she had a right to go in, and kept knocking at the door till about a quarter past five o'clock; I was mangling at the time. At a quarter past five she had a bottle in her hand, and went to get some liquor; a tall man in the court said, "You shall not lay here any longer exposed," and he shut the shutter where White slept.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the window was open at half-past five o'clock? A. Yes; the man shut one shutter, and the other broke off in his hand; he went away. The prisoners were not in the court at that time; I did not see them at seven o'clock- I was mangling then with my door shut.</p>
               <p>JAMES WHITE. I went to bed at half-past one o'clock- I laid on the bed without undressing, as there was such a disturbance in the house; I called out about two o'clock for peace; I was not in the court till ten minutes past four, when I met the prisoner with a bottle of gin in her hand - she used a very bad word, and said she could not get in; I said, "You have got a key of the street door as well as me, and can let yourself in;" I went on, as I was going out; I was not awake when she went out myself, but met her when I went out; I left the shutters bolted inside, and quite secure; no part of them was broken. They broke two squares of glass in the sash to get in. When I returned the door was locked, as I had left it; Pray was in the house till nearly four o'clock, and was not shut out. The outer shutter was broken off when I returned.</p>

            . I am a cabinet-maker, and live next door to the parties. I was awoke between three and four o'clock in the morning, by what I call almost a riot, from the proceedings between the prosecutor and prisoners - I was not out of the house. I saw Pray and three other persons requesting to get in; they were denied admittance.</p>
               <p>Q. Who by? A. The worthy landlord - he said he should not admit her - but I believe it principally proceeded from drunkenness. I heard her repeatedly beg to get in.</p>

            . I take in mangling, and live at No. 9, in this court; my window looks into White's house. I went to bed at one o'clock in the morning, and was awoke about three by Mrs. White's children screaming Murder! this poor boy, who, I believe is not in his senses, and two children were sitting at the door; Mr. and Mrs. White were not at home then; I heard the children begging the father not to beat their mother; I got into bed, and shortly after heard Pray making a noise, and begging to be let into her room.</p>
               <p>JAMES WHITE. I deny the whole of this - nothing of the kind passed.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH WHITE. I was not beaten on my oath - nothing of the sort passed; the children did not cry Murder! they were in our own room when I came home at a quarter to one o'clock - they were not in bed.</p>

            . I took that needle-case out of Pray's mother's pocket, after her death at the work-house - I know it by a string round it; I gave it to Pray - this was in February last.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH WHITE. There was a bent needle in the case, and here it is now; I bent it myself on the Saturday - this case was in my pocket that night.</p>

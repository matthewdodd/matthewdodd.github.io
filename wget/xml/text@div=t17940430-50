               <p>Q. What time did you go to bed the over night? - About eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you happen to see whether every thing was fast before you went to bed? - I believe it was fast, I was last up, and I always look round to see that every thing is fast.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you do it that night? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you alarmed in the night? - I was alarmed in the morning about half past three, one of my lodgers that had occasion to get up and do his work, he went down stairs, and found the wash-house door open, I was alarmed by him, and got up immediately; and when I came down stairs I observed that the two doors were standing open, the door of the room, and the washhouse door.</p>
               <p>Q. Are either of these an outer door? - Yes, the wash-house door is an outer door.</p>
               <p>Q. Had that wash-house door been shut at night? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it broke at all, or only standing open? - Only standing open, not broke.</p>
               <p>Q. From any thing that you see, could you tell how the door was opened? - No.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179404300084"></xptr>Q. What property did you lose? - About ten guineas, and some silver, the room behind the shop, from out of the bureau.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you no more than one room on that floor? - No, only the shop and that room. I had seen the bag there on Sunday, and this was done on Monday morning, or Sunday night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find any part of it again? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it loose money or in a bag? - It was in a bag, a kind of a little canvas bag.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever get it again? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. How high was you up in this house? - Up one pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it your house, or do you only lodge there? - It is my house, and I let lodgings.</p>
               <p>- HARPER sworn.</p>
               <p>On Monday morning last, the 28th of April, a young man came from the prosecutrix, to tell me that there had been a robbery done, and I went to the prosecutrix's house, there were several of her friends there, the house had been broke open, and as the lodgers being there, I begged it as a favour that they had better go up to the justice's together, I got them altogether at the justice's and the justice thought the most blame laid with this man, and he postponed it till the evening, in bringing the man out of the office, one of his brother workmen was there, and I heard the prisoner say to him, it was hid (he did not say what) between the rafters and the tiles.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you said to this man before he said that? - Nothing at all; when he told his brother workman that, I took that man to the justice, and told him that he should mention to the justice what that man said to him. However, I went with him to his workshop, and got on the top of this workshop, and went to the end, and the prisoner at the bar was there, in the workshop at the same time, and he said, you are too far to the left; and I looked about a little while, and then I came a little farther to the right, and then he said, now it is right over your head; I put my hand up there, and there I found this purse with this money, there is nine guineas, three half guineas, two half crown pieces and six shillings and eleven-pence. I came down from that place, came down to the workshop; the two witnesses that are here now, see me with the money, and I shew it before the prisoner's face; I shew the woman the money when he was examined before the justice. This shop is where the prisoner works, it is not in Mr. Shaw's house.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Shaw. The prisoner lodges with you? - He has, about eight months.</p>
               <p>Q. That morning that you was alarmed, was he in the house then? - Yes, he was in the house at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you said that you had not seen your money since, it turns out that you have seen your money since? - I see it at the second examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any part of the money or bag that you can swear to? - No, I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect enough to say whether you had so many guineas, so many half guineas, so many half crowns, and so many shillings? - I cannot be certain to the sum.</p>
               <p>Q. How was your bureau? - It was not broke at all, the lock seemed to me as if it had been put back with something, the lock is not broke.</p>
               <p>Harper. I asked him afterwards how he came to do such a thing to a poor widow woman? - he said he did not know how he did it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp to Harper. Let us have a little of the truth of the matter, if we can. First of all when you went to the house,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179404300085"></xptr>the prisoner was at home at his master's? - He was.</p>
               <p>Q. You told him that you suspected him or some people in the house, and that he must go with you to the justice's? - I told him I would be glad if he would go to the justice's, along with the rest.</p>

               <p>Q. And he was so good, in the hearing of a public officer, to say that it was hid, and he was so good to say where it was hid? - He did indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. You had said nothing to the prisoner to induce him to confess? - No, God forbid.</p>
               <p>Q. You never say any thing of that sort; a shocking piece of business this? - I did, after I got the money.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you say about saying it before? - I did not indeed, he had told me truth, or I had not found the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good as to recollect a little whether he did not say that this money was his own? - No, never, at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, did not he at any time say that that money was his own? - Yes, after he was committed, after he had been to gaol, and come up again.</p>
               <p>Q. If it was his own he was the best person to tell where it was? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe this young man was a good deal alarmed at first, when you came to take him, and charge him with the offence? - I did not charge him with any offence.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the young man, at the time you apprehended him, alarmed? - I did nothing to alarm him.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that he was not frightened? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he tell you it was his own that day? - He told me after he was committed that it was his own.</p>
               <p>Q. Do recollect again, before you stand down, whether he did not say that it was his own before? - On my oath he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he appear in such a fright that he did not know what he said? - He might be for what I know, he looked very pale and comical.</p>

               <p>Q. What part of the house did the prisoner sleep in? - Up one pair of stairs room, the even room with Mrs. Shaw. The prisoner went all about with us, to see if we could see where any body had broke in, and we could not see where any body got in or got out of the place.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. Is this shop a part of Mrs. Shaw's house? - No, it is by the side of it.</p>
               <p>Q. You differ from the rest of the witnesses, because they think the house was not broke at all. You have not been talking to any body in the yard just now, as you came in? - Nobody at all; as to the young man, I never suspected him.</p>

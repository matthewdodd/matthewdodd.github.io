Mrs. Bull lives in Hollis-street, Cavendish-square. I sleep in this house whenever it is empty, and slept there on Sunday, the 7th of September. About a quarter to eleven o'clock, I left the house to go to church - I locked the area gate, and the housekeeper's room window was fastened down and the door locked - I doubled locked the street door; both doors were fastened. I returned a little before one o'clock, and found the street door open, also the housekeeper's room window, and the area gate open. I went up stairs, and missed a bed, bolster, pillow, three blankets, and a piece of calico from the drawing-room floor, and from the second floor front room two large pillows in white cases, and two blankets, and out of the drawers four clean counterpanes, and a blue and white curtain, and from the back room two blankets, and a piece of calico, and from the dining-room a piece of baize, seventeen wine glasses, five rummers, a pepper and mustard glass, and four cut salts, My own boxes, and another servant's were broken open and stripped. I had left nobody in the house. An old woman who lived there with me went to church before me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. When would that woman return from church - A. She dined out, and did not return that day. Nobody but me had the key; she could not get in without my letting her in.</p>

            . I know Farmer. On the 7th of September, near half-past ten o'clock, I saw him in Wellbeck-street, passing the end of Bentick-street, towards Cavendish-square - he was then alone. I saw him again, standing with Leddington, at the corner of Queen Ann-street, Wellbeck-street, by a shoemaker's shop; this was a few minutes after; they stood opposite the prosecutrix's house - I am sure of them both. I spoke to Farmer, and asked if he had got a situation or not. About the 16th of September, I saw them go into a public-house together, and gave information to Westcoat, but they were gone. I was with the officers next day, when they were apprehended.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What are you - A. A servant out of place. I did not know Leddington before, but knew Farmer very well; they were both together when I spoke to him, but while I was talking, Leddington walked too and fro. I was five or ten minutes talking with Farmer, but did not speak to him. Leddington had corded breeches, dirty stockings, and a short jacket on.</p>
               <p>Prisoner FARMER. Q. Where did you see me first - A. Crossing the end of Bentick-street.</p>
               <p>Q. You get your living by swindling and playing bagatelle - A. No. I lived last with the Reverend Mr. Jeffries, of Barnes, and left him last January.</p>

I saw the prisoner Leddington with another man, in Mary-le-bone-lane, at the corner of Bentick-mews, which leads into James-street, about twelve o'clock in the morning of the 7th of September; they had two very large bundles, tied in blankets. I thought he was a servant, moving bedding from one stable to another - I saw them go down the mews, and in the afternoon heard of this robbery.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you observe the face of the man - A. No, I could not see his face. I observed his small clothes, shoes, and stockings - he has the same coloured clothes on to day.</p>

            . I live at No. 25, James-street; Farmer lodged in the same house. On the 7th of September, between eleven and twelve o'clock in the morning, he came to his lodging - Bentick-mews has steps leading up to James-street. Another man came with him. I did not see either of their faces when they came, but Leddington is the man who came down stairs from the room about an hour after - he had knee breeches on; I did not see Farmer afterwards. When they came in they brought two large parcels, wrapped in blankets; they were large enough to contain beds, and went up stairs. Farmer's room is on the second floor - his wife lives there with him. The bundles were so large they concealed their faces.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had Leddington anything on his head when he came down - A. He had a bundle on his shoulder, not so large as those which went up; I only saw him as I entered my room door, for a second or two. I saw that he wore breeches, but I had seen him come backwards and forwards to the house before, and knew his face, and saw his face when he came down; he is pock-marked.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are there any other lodgers up stairs - A. A man and his wife have the front attic, and a gentleman has the back attic.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You cannot say Leddington did not come from the attic - A. He always came to visit Farmer. I have seen them in company before.</p>

             sworn. - I am a watchman: Close by my box I heard this man crying out watch, I went where he was, and he gave me charge of her; I found nothing in her pocket but a counterfeit dollar, and two bad halfpence; there was a woman that followed us best part of the way to the watch-house, they were close together. I drove her off.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. About five o'clock in the morning, I was going for some raisin wine for a poor woman who had been poorly for some time, and as I was going into the house for it, the prosecutor came out with three other women, and he asked me if he should go home with me; I told him, no, and then he called the watch, and said I had robbed him; I told him, how can you say that you have been robbed, when you know the women said you had hardly money enough to pay for the last liquor you called for; he said, I had robbed him of three shillings, and he pulled me about a good deal.</p>

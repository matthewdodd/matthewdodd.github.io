            . I was with Mr. Green going out of Eastcheap towards Fish-street-hill - a great many coaches and carts were passing, and some were drawn up by the pathway; I let my friend go rather before me, and saw something passing from his pocket - it struck me it was his handkerchief; I immediately asked if he had lost it - he felt and said he had; at the time I saw it occur I turned round, and saw the prisoner - I knew him by his dress, and finding my friend had lost his handkerchief, I pointed him out; I am sure he took hold of the same person who I thought was drawing his handkerchief out - he denied all knowledge of it, but the action was very quick, and there were others behind him; he could not escape, because there were carts on one side, and houses on the other - I never lost sight of him till he was secured.</p>

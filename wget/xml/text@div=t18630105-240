                  </hi>. I am a potman at the Folly public-house, kept by Mrs. Blamire—on Saturday, 8th December, about half-past 11, I fastened up the house as usual—it was quite safe when I went to bed—about half-past 1 in the morning I heard a knocking, which induced me to get up—I let in Burgess, a policeman, who found the prisoner in the tap-room—f saw Bur<lb></lb>gess bring him out, search him, and find on him three shillings, four six<lb></lb>pences, a threepenny piece, and copper money, a knife, and a key—when I came down the three tap-room windows, and the one leading into the bar, were open; they had all been shut at night—any person by getting over could get in—the shutter draws up—the door was still bolted; the winder</p>

                  </hi>. I am the landlady of the Folly public-house—it was safe on the night of the 8th, at half-past 11—at half-past I next morning there was a knocking—I got up and went down stain with the potman—when I went to bed overnight there were in the till five shil<lb></lb>lings, five sixpences, some coppers, and, I believe, two or three threepenny pieces—I merely shut the till, without locking it—in the rooming it was wide open, and I missed three shillings, four sixpences, and some coppers, out of it—I saw some money taken from the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you make a note on paper of the money in the till? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I looked in the till the very last thing at night—I served some watermen that night with something which came to 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I did not give them too much in change—after they went I arranged the till again, taking out the shilling they had given me—I did not give them fourpence too much in change—there were two shillings left outside the till when I came down in the morning, and one sixpence left—any one opening the till could have teen them—I never saw the prisoner before—I do not wait at the bar—I did not see him when I came down until the policeman brought him out—he did not seem as though he had been drink<lb></lb>ing, nor did he seem stupid and heavy, because he said, "You need not hold me so tight, I will not run away.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, K</hi> 256). About ten minutes past 1 on the morning of the 9th, I saw some man, not the prisoner, near the Folly public-house—he asked me a question—I then looked at the Folly public-house, and saw a window disturbed, which had been all right half an hour before—the top sash was pulled down below the shutters—I jumped on to the window-till, looked in with my light, and saw the prisoner come out from the bar into the tap-room—I asked him what ho was doing there, and he gave a vulgar answer—I kicked at the window, and saw him come out of the bar again—I threw up the window, and made the landlady hear me—I went in and found the prisoner lying on the sofa in the tap-room—he appeared quite sober—I took him, searched him, and found four shillings, three sixpences, a threepenny piece, and some coppers—I saw the till wide open.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You saw a man near there first, I believe? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I did not catch hold of him—I did not then see all the four windows open, I did afterwards, when that man ran away—I thought it extraordinary to see four windows open—if he had got in at either of the other three windows, he could not have got into the bar without forcing the door—the prisoner did not tell me how long he had been there—I asked him his name, and he refused to tell me—I know now that his parents are respectable, and well off—as for as I know he bears a character of respectability and honesty—I know that every person who knows him would give him an excellent character.</p>

               <p>people had gone out, is there any place where ho might have gone, so that those in the tap-room could not have seen him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; unless he had hid underneath the settle, and if there had been a light in the tap-room I do not see that he could have hid there—he could if the lights were all out, but then he could not have opened all those four windows—they were opened from the outside.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi> to <hi rend="smallCaps">JAMES MITCHELL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Could people open the windows as you saw them, from the inside? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not if the shutters were up—considering how I left them the night before, I do not think that any one could have opened them from the inside only, in the way in which I found them opened in the morning, because there is nothing to get hold of to get the sash down—there is an ordinary meeting-bar in the middle, but it is very shallow—there is no cross bar—there is a good hold outside—the sash projects more outside than inside—I open the shutters from the inside—if I want to open the sash I go outside—they all four open in the same way.</p>

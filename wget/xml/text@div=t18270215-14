I followed the boy, crying Stop thief! five or six men joined in the pursuit - they said the boy had ran that way, which was up a parcel of courts - I ran too, about thirty yards, I suppose, and when I could get no further, as the court was no thoroughfare, one of the men said, "Are you sure you have got your watch safe- you had better see if you have;" I was in the act of putting my hand into my fob, to see if it was safe, and while I was lifting up my waistcoat some of them seized me behind, held my arm, tore open my waistcoat, and snatched the watch out of my fob, by the watch-guard which was round my neck; I cannot say who that man was, as he came behind me; they all ran away, and I pursued them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner one of the five men? A. He is one of the men who ran away with them, but it was almost dark in the court; I am sure he is one of the men who ran away; I followed them, and somebody attempted to trip me up; I pushed that man down - they were all round me; I was between them; I called Stop thief! and the prisoner fell down; some of them pushed by me, but I kept close to the prisoner; the man who pushed past me went and took something out of the prisoner's hand, which I believe to be my watch - the man ran away, and got off. The prisoner got up - several people assisted me, and he was taken into the public-house - I am sure he is the man.</p>

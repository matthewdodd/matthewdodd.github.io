                  </hi>. I live in the house. I remember the petticoat being hung up to dry—I missed it between eight and nine o'clock—I saw the prisoner out in the back alley, and asked her if she knew any thing of it—she said she did not, and I took it from between her knees—she was standing up at the time—I am quite sure she denied having it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> She came down to my place on the Friday, and asked me if she could wash the things in my place—on Saturday night, because we had no rent, she locked my husband up—I went down to my place, and was so vexed that I took all the things off my line in the kitchen, and said, "They sha'nt be there," and I hung them in my yard, and this girl came down and said I wanted to steal the petticoat—Donovan and her man knocked me down, and gave me two black eyes.</p>

At ten o'clock, on the 3rd of July, Saturday night, I met the prisoner with a pair of black eyes, and in a shameful situation—I was moving, and I came and took her things away from the prosecutrix; and when I came down I saw Crawley with the petticoat in her hands—she thanked the prisoner for it, and said, if it had been lost she should have been blamed—when the prosecutrix came home, she said the prisoner had been robbing her, and took a pot and threw it over her.</p>

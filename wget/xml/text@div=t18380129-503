                  </hi>. I live with my father, at No. 12, Ashby-street, Battlebridge. On Saturday, the 6th of January, I was coming up Well's court with a bundle under my arm, and saw the prisoner there—he col lard me and demanded my money or my life—I thought it was done seriously—there was another boy behind me who came and tripped me up, and the prisoner put his hands into my pocket—I had nothing in my pocket but a turnip—he stole my cap and handkerchief—my handkerchif was in my cap—he pulled my cap off—I do not know what he did with it—I have not found it since—I did not see him run away with it—I knew him by being called <hi rend="italic">Catchall,</hi> which is his nickname—I did not know where he lived, but had seen him before, and heard his name called—be is rather less than me—the other boy was bigger than me—I am in the habit of having money in my pocket on a Saturday night—sometime I have a sovereign, and sometimes only 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to go to Somers-town on errands—I thought the assault was with intent to rob me—what became of my cap and handkerchief I do not know.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. He was coming up Weller's-court—I had just come from work—I and two or three more were at play there—another shoved me against him, it knocked his cap off, and he ran away without it—I waited for him, and saw him on Sunday, and said to him, "Will you come down and fetch your cap, it is oh the dunghill." <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. He did not tell me so.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. I did not see him run away, and do not think he did run away—I pointed him out to my father on the Saturday night, and my father went home to his tea, and then went to the station-house.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. He said to me, "You will catch it for it." <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. I did not—I had never played with the prisoner, and never spoke to him.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police constable S</hi> 140.) I took the prisoner into cus<lb></lb>tody in Weller's-court, between three and four o'clock on Wednesday, the 10th of January—I told him it was for stealing a cap and handkechief from James Terry on the Saturday night—he said he was <hi rend="italic">larking with</hi> lot more of them, and took his cap off, but did not search his pockets—he said at the station-house that he threw the cap on the dunghill—I went there, but could not find it—it is a place where there is a regular gang of these lads, reputed thieves—I have seen the prisoner about there before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I say now the same as I said at the station, house—I was merely playing—I knew the boy, and have often played with him in Ashby-street—I only did it out of a joke—he did not fall at all, and I called him back to have his cap.</p>

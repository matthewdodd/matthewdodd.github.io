I am a bookbinder at 7, York Place, Hoxton—On the 25th March last, in the afternoon, I was in a public-house in Quicksand Street—between 4 and 5 o'clock the prisoners and three or four other men were there, and a sailor—I didn't notice them particularly—they were ordered out of the house—I went out afterwards and watched them out of the street—they were ordered out because they were trying to pick the sailor's pocket—I <hi rend="italic">followed</hi> them into Finch Street—they saw me watching them, and they came up and hustled against me—I was struck by Moss on the mouth and fell to the ground, and while on the ground I was kicked; I cannot say by whom—there were more than the four men—I went to the hospital, and when I came <hi rend="italic">to</hi>, I saw the constable, who asked me if I had lost a purse, and I said yes, and I then identified it as my own—this (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>) is my purse—nothing was in it when I lost it, except a key and a ring.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It was holiday time when this occurred—it was Whit<lb></lb>sun Monday—I had been in the public-house about five minutes—I had had drink during the day—not such a great deal—I was not to say drunk, but comfortable—I did not speak to either of these four men in the public-house—I did not to my knowledge say, "Leave that sailor alone"—I was ahead of them when I followed them—I did not speak to them at all—Smith was not drunk.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I didn't interfere with them at all till I was injured. <hi rend="italic">By the Court.</hi> When they saw me watching them there was a man with them who jostled up against me—I. mean one of the four, and then I was struck by him first, and afterwards by Moss.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bookbinder, living at 38, Quicksand Street—on the afternoon of 21th May, between 4 and 5 o'clock, I was in this public house—I saw the prisoners there, there were about five altogether—I noticed the two prisoners, they had got a man in the corner, he looked like a seafaring man—they were trying to rob him, for which they were ordered out of the house—I went out and watched them go down the street—I saw they had got hold of this sailor, arm in arm, I watched them turn Finch Street, and I looked for a constable, but could not see one—I saw Davis walking along, ahead of the prisoners—I went for a policeman, on returning I saw Davis had got his nose all cut and smothered in blood—I went to the station and identified the two men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There was a great noise in the house—it was pretty full—there was no quarrelling—me and Davis were drinking together.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187406080067"></xptr>
               <p>bleeding very much from the mouth and nose, and the two prisoners were in a stooping position—I distinctly saw one of their hands coming out of his pocket—I was 50 yards off—I will not swear whose hand it was—as soon as they saw me they ran away to Prospect Place—I ran after them and caught Moss in Prospect Place, and Smith ran to the end of the court—as soon as Smith saw me lay hold of Moss, he ran back again, using very bad expressions, and said "God blind me, Jim, don't you go with him"—I took Moss into custody, and charged him with assaulting and robbing a man that was lying on the ground, in Finch Street, he said nothing, except that be would go quietly—Smith followed on until such time as other constables came up, and I had him taken in charge, took Moss to the station, and went back to look after the prosecutor, and found he had been to the hospital, where also I went and found he had had his nose and mouth dressed, and on my way back I overtook the prosecutor, and took him to the station, when he identified the two prisoners as being the men—Moss did not resist in any way, he went quietly to the station.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There was not a large crowd—there was only the two prisoners and the prosecutor on the ground—no one else was in the street.</p>

I live at 2, Prospect Place, Whitechapel—On this afternoon 25th May, I saw a man run into our court—he laid a purse on our window-ledge a key, and a ring, and ran back—I picked the purse up and gave it to my mother, who gave it to the policeman—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the purse I found.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">Police Constable H.</hi> 135). On the 25th May last—I gave Moss in charge of another constable, and I followed with Smith—Smith never said anything when he was taken—he was rather the worse for drink.</p>

I live at 3, King Street, Brick Lane—On this afternoon I saw the prisoners and two or three other men, walking towards my house—the prosecutor was the last, and two of them walked down Prospect Place, and the remaining two were left with the prosecutor—Moss struck the prosecutor on the nose with his right hand and then again with the left, I walked away, Smith was doing something with the prosecutor's pocket—the prosecutor was on the ground—I could not see what Smith did with, his pocket—I called out "Oh you have killed the man," the constable came up and they ran away.</p>

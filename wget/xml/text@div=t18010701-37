               <p>JOHN DUMPHY sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am a private in the London Militia; I know the prisoner; I did not know him till the day he was taken up; I met him on the 28th of May, at the Three Mariners, in fore street.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you before that acquainted any persons with your expectation of meeting this man? - A. I did; Armstrong, Ray, Clarke, and Vickery.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you see Mr. Powell before you went? - A. Yes, I was authorized by him to go there; Mr. Powell gave me a half-guinea, a seven shilling-piece, two half-crowns, a shillings, and a sixpence, which he marked, on the 27th; I saw him mark them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Patrick Macneal? - A. Yes, he introduced me to the house; I went in about two o'clock; after I had been there a little while, Macneal came in and sat down in the box where I was; then he called the prisoner out from the back parlour, and then Macneal called me out into the yard, where he was; Macneal told the prisoner I was the man that wanted to buy the money; Macneal said, he thinks I impose upon him in the price.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you and Macneal any conversation as to the price which those things might be purchased? - A. No; Macneal said to the prisoner he had told me of the price of the half-guineas and seven shilling-pieces; the prisoner then said, how much did you tell him; Macneal said, three shillings for each of the half-guineas, and two shillings each for the seven shilling-pieces; then the prisoner said I should have them for that; I pulled out my pocketbook and gave him a seven shilling-piece, a half-crown, and a sixpence, for which I received two half-guineas and two seven shilling-pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the same money that Mr. Powell had furnished you with? - A. Yes; then the prisoner and I returned back into the tap-room; the prisoner was going towards the parlour, and Macneal called for a quartern of rum; I called for half-a-pint; a woman in the tap-room had a signal when I called for the rum to go and fetch the officers; the officers then came in and laid hold of the prisoner; Mr. Armstrong asked me, in the presence of the prisoner, what I had been doing; I told him I had been buying bad gold from the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180107010042"></xptr>prisoner; he asked me how much was it, and I told him I had bought two half-guineas and two seven shilling-pieces; Mr. Armstrong asked me to produce the money, I produced it in the presence of the prisoner, and gave it to Armstrong.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Who introduced you to Wife when you first went to the prisoner? - A. Mr. Mahony.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mahony and Wife appear to be the friends of each other? - A. Yes; they went and had a bottle of wine in the wine-room.</p>

               <p>JOHN ARMSTRONG sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am a Police-officer belonging to Worship-street: On the 27th of May I was at Mr. Powell's chambers, and saw a half-guinea, a seven shilling-piece, two half-crowns, and a sixpence delivered to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the money marked? - A. I do not think I did: On the 28th I went to the Three Mariners with Clarke, the Marshalman, Ray, and Mason; we waited at the Golden Lion, and Mrs. Sullivan was to bring us a signal; before Dumphy went I searched him, and found upon him the money I have mentioned, but I cannot say whether it was marked or not; upon the signal being given I went into the public-house; I saw Dumphy and Wife at the bar; I caught hold of Wife by the collar on one side, and Clarke on the other; we then got Wife into a passage that leads to a parlour, his back was then against a partition, and I observed a motion of his hand, upon which I immediately said there is something gone; I then gave him into the hands of Clark and Ray, and went towards the cellar stairs; we were close by a door that went into the cellar, and I called for a candle, and at the bottom of the cellar stairs, I found this paper, containing four half-guineas, eight seven-shilling pieces, and two shillings, all counterfeit, (produces them;) I brought that up, and then we took him into another parlour, and in that room, Dumphy produced two half-guineas, and two seven-shilling pieces, which he said he had bought of Wife, and which Wise denied, Wife said, he had sold him nothing; I went again to the stairs, and on the third stair I found a good seven-shilling piece, which I believe to be one of the same that I saw in Dumphy's possession, before he went there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You did not search Macneal? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never hear Macneal say, he was indebted to the prisoner three shillings? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q.Did you ever tell them; that they were to receive five shillings a day? - A.Never.</p>

I am one of the offices of Worship-street; I was with Armstrong, on the 28th of May; I saw Dumphy at the Golden-lion; before we went to the Three-Mariners, I searched him, and he had no money about him but what Armstrong then gave him, a seven-shilling-piece, a half-crown, and a sixpence; I am not positive exactly what it was; his shoes were pulled off, and every part of him searched; we went to the Three-Mariners; Mr. Armstrong and Clarke laid hold of Wife, and a scuffle ensued; I observed a motion of the prisoner's arm when he was close to the cellar-stairs; Armstrong immediately said, there is something gone, and called for a light: I took the prisoner into the kitchen, we proceeded to search him, and Mr. Clarke took some money from him, which he will speak to; we then took him into a back parlour; Armstrong asked Dumphy what he had been about, and he said, in the presence of the prisoner, that he had been buying bad money of him; to the best of my knowledge, the prisoner said, he had bought none of him.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the seven-shilling piece that Armstrong found, produced? - A. I took no particular notice of it.</p>

               <p>Q.Did he submit quietly to be apprehended? - A. No, he behaved rather obstreporous to Armstrong and myself; I had hold of his other arm, when he threw something down the cellar stairs; Armstrong immediately said, there goes something; the prisoner did not say any thing to that; I took him into another room, with Ray; we searched him in the back parlour, and I found upon him a half-crown and a sixpence marked; they were marked in the same way with those that I saw given to Dumphy, at the Golden Lion, we secured him, and took him into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You had no hand in the marking of this money? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you seen the money before it was given by Armstrong to Dumphy, after it was marked? - A. I do not think I had.</p>

               <p>Q. How long have you been in that office? - A.Eleven or twelve years: On the 27th of May I sent for Ray and Armstrong; they met Dumphy; the money was marked by me, given to Armstrong, and delivered by him to Dumphy.</p>
               <p>Q.Look at this halt crown and sixpence, produced by Clarke? - A.This is one of the marked half-crowns that I gave to Armstrong the day before, and this is the sixpence.</p>
               <p>Q.Look at that seven-shilling-piece, the one found on the stairs? - A.This is the same that I delivered to Armstrong, and which he delivered to Dumphy.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Macneal receive a 2l. note from you? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. For what? - A. I gave it him on account or some general informations that were then going on.</p>
               <p>Q.Were those informations relative to the coin of the country? - A. They were; and among when the present was one.</p>
               <p>Q. We have heard of two persons, O'Brian and Mahony, being indicted for a conspiracy, and Dumphy being a witness against them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. By whole direction and advice was that indictment for a conspiracy preserred? - A. By the direction of myself.</p>
               <p>Q. What sanction had you for preferring that indictment? - A. It was not under any body's particular sanction; I thought it necessary, and I conferred with those whom I thought proper; if it had been a felony, I should have consulted the Attorney-General.</p>
               <p>Q.Was it done at the desire of Dumphy? - A. No; we do not consult witnesses.</p>
               <p>Q.At the time that indictment was prepared, was it then known that either of them was to be a witness for Wife? - A.Certainly; I did not know till last night that Mahony was to be a witness.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Do you mean, upon your oath, to swear you did not know till last night that O'Brian and Mahony were to be witness for this man? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q.Perhaps you had not an intuitive knowledge, but had you not been told so? - A. No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Has there been any certiorari lodged in this case? - A. There has.</p>
               <p>Q.Upon an indictment for a conspiracy? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.When was that done? - A. To-day.</p>
               <p>Q. That was to remove it into the King's Bench, after you knew that these people were to be witnesses? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.You know, that in that case these men cannot be bailed before a common Magistrate? - A.Certainly they cannot.</p>
               <p>Q.Therefore the effect of lodging the certiorari to-day, has prevented their getting bailed to come here as witnesses? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. As we are now upon law, I would ask, does it prevent a babeas corpus being obtained? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. I wish to ask, whether you, acting as Solicitor for the Mint, employ men, and pay them to hunt out informations in this sort of way against your fellow-subjects?</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys objected to the question.</p>

               <p>Mr. Alley. Q.Are you, acting for the Solicitor of the Mint, in the habit of employing that man, Macneal, and paying him, for the purpose of hunting out felonies against your fellow-subjects? - A.Whenever he has had any informations, which he has been put to any expence in obtaining, I have given him money to reimburse those expences; at I never gave any thing to any purpose, with a view of inducing them to do that which is wrong.</p>

               <p>My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury - Painful as it is for me to stand in my present embarrassed situation, it is equally as painful to me to delay the time of this Honourable Court, by entering so minutely as I shall into my defence; but I trust I shall be excused for so doing, when it is considered that not only my liberty is at stake, but that by developing the diabolical plan that has been entered into to deprive me of my liberty, the public may be upon its guard against similar attempts; for, Gentlemen, if this plan succeeds against me, not even you are sale, for the instant you may offend persons of as bad a description as those who have combined against me, you will be indicted for any crime they may choose to forge against you, and your lives or liberties endangered. Gentlemen, the present is not the first attempt of those persons to whom I allude; at the very last sessions they prosecuted one

             for a capital offence, and it is merely because I frustrated them in that prosecution, and prevented an innocent man whom becoming a victim to their infamous machinations, that I am now the marked object of their resentment.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, this Brown, to whom I allude, having offended the very people who have conspired against me, was indicted last October, by one Mary Cook, for a street robbery, and not having been taken before a Justice, he had no idea such a charge was exhibited against him until the latter end of April last, when I informed him; and as I had learnt, that the man who had prevailed on this Mary Cook to prefer the indictment against Brown, intended to obtain a certificate of the indictment, and take him into custody upon a Judge's warrant the day after the present session, and thereby keep him confined during the long vacation, I advised him (to prevent such a proceeding) to surrender and take his trial, which he did, and the Court and Jury saw so clearly through the persidy of the prosecution, and that the whole was a fabrication, that they would not permit the prosecutrix to go through her evidence, and recommended that she and her accomplices should be indicted for a conspiracy.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, No sooner did the man, who advised Mary Cook, through the whole of her infamous prosecution, learn, that it was I who had prevented him from carrying his designs into execution against Brown, than he instantly swore he would, by some stratagem, revenge himself on me.</p>

            , a publican, on Saffron-hill, and so determined was he to carry his malignant purpose into execution, that, in the presence of his wife, and a person whom I shall call as a witness, he deliberetely rose from his seat, went on his knees, and after blessing himself, according to Catholic custom, took an oath that he would put a plan, which he had formed, into execution against me; and his wife, in the same manner, swore to assist him.</p>
               <p>The plan was the present prosecution, which has hither to been successful; but I hope I shall be able to explain to your satisfaction, the circumstances which have been given in evidence against me, by the police-officers, and to shew that the testimony of Dumphy is (as to the material parts of it) a fabrication, that he is the engine of Gibbons, hired by him to give evidence against me, and that he is the instrument by which Gibbons hopes to inflict that revenge he has sworn to obtain.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I shall now briefly relate the means adopted by Gibbons to give a colour to this prosecution, which were as follows: He prevailed upon one Macneal to assist him in his project, who came to me, and requested me to lend him three shillings for a sew days; this I was easily prevailed upon to do, as I had known him for some time, and been frequently in his company, and having no suspicion of any design upon me; when they had proceeded thus far, Macneal being a soldier, obtained the witness, Dumphy, who is also a soldier, to join them, and they immediately went to the solicitor for the Mint, and informed him they knew where they could purchase had money. In consequence of which, a half-guinea, a seven-shilling piece, a half-crown, and a sixpence were marked, and given by Mr. Powell and the officers to Dumphy to make the purchase with, and in the forenoon of the 28th of May last, Macneal and Dumphy came to the Three Mariners in Fore-Street; I was in the kitchen, Macneal opened the kitchen door and called me into the tap-room, and said, he was come to pay me the three shillings he had borrowed, and gave me a half-crown and a sixpence, which I put into my waistcoat-pocket, and was about to return into the kitchen, when Macneal asked me if I would not drink with him, I answered no, for I had not dined; and the first time I ever saw Dumphy, was at this moment, who rose from one of the tap-room boxes, and called for a quartern of rum, saying, don't Jet the gentleman go till he drinks with us; at this instant, the officers came in, Mr. Armstrong and Mr. Clark, seized my arms, and Ray my collar, and in that position I was forced into the kitchen, where I was handcuffed and searched, and amongst my silver was found the half-crown and sixpence Macneal had paid me, and which turned out to be a part of the marked money which had been given to Dumphy to purchase bad money with; Mr. Armstrong then asked Dumphy what brought him there? he answered, to buybise money for me; I then, for the first time, had an insight into the plot laid against me; Mr. Arm<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180107010049"></xptr>strong, on going into the cellar, found a paper containing a quantity of bad money; and some time after; on a second search, found a seven-shilling piece which was marked, and had also been given to Dumphy, but neither of these were ever in my possession, they must have been placed (where they were found) by Macneal, for how could it be prossible for me, seized as I was, without the least previous intimation, to have put my hands in my pocket, and to have thrown to the bottom of a winding staircase the counterfeit-money found there by the officers, and which being wrapped in a white paper, would have been very easily perceived if it had come from me, but the officers candidly stated on my examination, that they saw nothing go from my hands, though they saw my arm go as if something did; but, - Gentlemen, does it appear at all reasonable, that being firmly held by four persons, I could get my hands near my pockets, or throw any thing away from me, particularly without their seeing it. I was taken to the Compter, and closely confined till the next day, when, on my examination, Dumphy swore that he purchased from me two counterfeit half-guineas, and two counter. seit seven shilling-pieces for ten shillings, and that he paid me for them by giving me the half-crown and the sixpence (which I had received as beforementioned from Macneal), and the seven shilling-piece which was found on the cellar stairs.</p>

               <p>Gentlemen, I understand Dumphy was searched by the officers, previous to his coming into the Three Mariners public-house, to see that he had no base money about him, or any thing but the marked money; but was the same precaution used with respect to Munceal, who accompanied him? I am certain it was not, for if it had, I should not have been here before you taking my trial, for on him would have been found the base money pretended to have been purchased by Dumphy from me, and also that found in the cellar by the officers,</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, Gibbons furnished Macneal with this base coin, according to the plan they had agreed upon, and that Gibbons was in a way to obtain it no doubt can be entertained, as his house has for some time past been the haunt of the utterers of base money, insomuch that it has become a common nuisance, and is now indicted as such, and there is scarcely a lodger in his house who has not been convicted of selling or utterring bad money.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, if my case rested here I should feel myself confident of having your verdict of acquittal; but I have still stronger facts, the declarations of Dumphy, who, either from remorse, or from not being satisfied by those who employed him, has been frequently with me, acknowledged his villainy, and wished me to furnish him with money that he might leave me countly, and not be under the necessity either of publicly confessing the infamy of his conduct, or of abiding by his former false story to avoid punishment.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, Dumphy has confessed that Gibbons is the contriver of the plan against me, that Macneal acknowledged to him that Gibbons gave him the bad money found in the cellar, and also that stated to have been purchased from me; and that he, Dumphy, directly he came into the Three Mariners with Macneal, gave him the seven shilling-piece and the half-crown and sixpence which he had received from the officers, and that it was previously agreed upon between them that Macneal should pay me the three shillings he had borrowed, with a part of the marked money, and likewise that I never was in the yard with him.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I must again apologize for the great portion of your time I have occupied, but I hope my former apology will be a sufficient excuse, as I am not a great deal more interested than yourselves in the verdict which you shall pass upon this occasion; but if, unfortunately, you should pass a verdict of guilty, I should thereby be prevented the possibility of endeavouring honestly to maintain a virtuous wife and three small children, which I have hitherto done by industriously working at my trade of a shoe-maker, and was never before a Judge or Jury in my life until the present occasion.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I am extremely sorry to be under the necessity of stating, that two persons were yesterday taken into custody, while attending at this place under their supoenas to give evidence on my behalf, upon a bill of indictment preferred against them for a conspiracy on the prosecution of Dumphy; and the prosecutors having obtained an order of Court to receive forty-eight hours notice of bail, I cannot now have the benefit of their testimony, which Dumphy well knew would satisfy the Court and Jury of my innocence and expose his villainy, as they would have proved his acknowledgement to them that he had false sworn himself at Guildhall, that he was sorry for it, and that he had done it at the instance of Macneal and Gibbons. Gentlemen, Mr. Powell, the Solicitor for the prosecution, on those witnesses being taken into custody, observed, that if I wanted their evidence I might get it how I could; but he well knew I could not obtain their attendance, as they must remain in custody for forty-eight hours after their being taken up.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Whitehead, we live in Summer-street, Leather-lane. On the 27th of June, the glass-cutters had their annual dinner at Chalk-farm—I did not go to the dinner, but went up about a quarter to seven o'clock in the evening by myself—I there joined my husband and his family—I had a shawl—we went into the ball-room about nine—the shawls were put on a window-seat, and tome hats and bonnets put upon them—about a quarter-past one the next morning, I went to put my shawl on, and it was gone—I then missed the prisoner, who had been in the room—I went out, and followed her down stairs—she was talking to two young lads, and said she must go home—she had a bundle under her arm—I said, "Excuse me, I think you have my shawl"—she denied having it—I lifted up her shawl, and took mine from under her arm—the policeman took my sister's shawl and a parasol from her at the station—they had been lying with my shawl—the prisoner had been in our party in the room in the evening.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a groom, and living at 38, Mint Street—on 24th March I was out of place and saw the prisoner at the corner of Mint Street, about 7.15 p.m.—I knew him before to speak to, but did not know his name; I had seen him coming out of a lodging-house—he came up and said, "Would you mind passing some bad shillings for me?"—I said, "Yes!" he showed me a packet containing some in brown paper—I told him I would do it in a few minutes and left him, and went to the Duke of York public-house, where I met a detective in plain clothes, who I had known for some days previously—I made a statement to him, returned to the prisoner and said, "I will pass them for you now"—I walked about two paces in front of him, and at the top of Queen Street he said, "Come on down this way"—I said, "No, I shall go this way"—we walked to the Duke of York; he gave me a bad shilling and said, "Here is one shilling for you, take this and I shall give you another"—I went in and he remained outside—I spoke to the person serving there, but did not offer the shilling—I kept it in my hand and rejoined the prisoner, who was waiting about 50 yards off, and said,</p>

               <p>"This is not good enough for that shop," and I returned it to him; we walked about 20 yards together, and the detective came up and said, "I shall apprehend you for being a deserter from the 1st Surrey"—the prisoner said, "I am no deserter"—he said, "I have to take you," and took hold of him by the right arm—he had something in his left hand which appeared to be the brown paper packet which I had seen before—he clenched his hand, and I saw him throw it over his left shoulder—I saw where it fell and picked it up and gave it to the detective outside the station—I afterwards saw it opened, it contained some shillings.</p>

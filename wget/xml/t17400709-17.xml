            . My House was broke open the last Day of May, and I lost off my Bed,3 Blankets, a Pair of Sheets, and a Quilt, about the Middle of the Day, between 10 and 12 o'Clock. When I went into the Room, I was surprised to see the Bed naked, knowing how I had left it, about an Hour, or an Hour and Half before. Lord bless me says I,- I have lost all my Bedding! And looking about, I saw a Pane of Glass broke, and the Bolt of the Window had been open'd. I was in the House the same Time, and wonder'd how it could be. When I found my Goods, they were in the next Witness's Possession.</p>
               <p>A Witness. The last Day of May, the Prisoner brought me 2 Blankets, for which I gave her 6 Shillings. In less than 2 Hours I heard they were Part of Mrs Green's Goods: upon which I went after the Prisoner, and detain'd her; and sent for Mrs Green, and deliver'd the Goods to her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have sold China, and old Cloaths these 24 or 25 Years, and never sold any Thing yet, in my Life, which was not honestly come by.</p>
               <p>Three Witnesses gave the Prisoner the Character of an honest, industrious, Pains-taking Woman. <rs id="t17400709-17-verdict93" type="verdictDescription">

On the 26th of September, I met the prisoner at the corner of Marybone-lane, about eight o'clock. She enticed me home to her lodging. I gave her two shillings; a shilling in silver, and a shilling in copper. I took the shilling out of my pocket-book. I stopped about a quarter of an hour in her room, and then came down stairs, and when I had gone about five yards from the door I missed my pocket-book. I returned back to the door, and the door was locked.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been drinking - A. Only one pint of beer, and a glass of gin. When I returned to the door, and found the door shut. I did not wish to make any alarm, because I was known in the neighbourhood. On my finding the door shut I went away, and did not return till the next morning, which was Sunday morning. I then went into her lodging. She was not there. I did not find her till the Friday following. I then met her, about eight o'clock, at the corner of Gee's-court, Oxford-road. I then gave her in charge of the watchman. She was searched in my presence, and nothing found on her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I never saw the man before he charged the watchman with me.</p>

               <p>CHARLES HOPEWELL. On the 5th of March, I was in <placeName id="t18280410-170-crimeloc912">White Horse-street, Stepney</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Were you quite sober? A. I had been drinking, but had not lost my senses - I had two glasses of gin and water - my watch was brought into the watch-house without the case; I had not seen him throw it away; I saw nobody else near me.</p>

            . I am a headborough. I saw the prisoner on the ground, on the top of the prosecutor; when they got up, the prosecutor said, "I charge this man with taking my watch; take him into custody:" the prisoner said nothing - I took him to the watch-house. Clark found the watch about six yards from where I took the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was he sober? A. He was neither drunk nor sober - he gave a full description of the watch.</p>

            . I was with Groom; we heard a noise in the street; ran out of the watch-house, and saw the prosecutor flat on his back, and the prisoner on him - I took hold of the prisoner - Groom helped the prosecutor up; he was without his hat - I went out with a candle, and found the watch in the same line as I had brought the prisoner - the prosecutor described it - the case has not been found.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not the prisoner say he knew nothing about the watch? A. No, he never said a word.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a good character.</p>

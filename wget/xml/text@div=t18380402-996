About three o'clock, on the 28th of March, I landed from a steam-packet—I bad twenty-five or twenty-six trunks at the Custom-house—I was informed that some of them had been taken from the cart in which they had been deposited to go down to Rumford—four or five packages of different kinds were gone—one of them contained the card-plate, spectacles, and all these things—this order of the Bath, and this gold medal, are mine; and this box full of things are all mine—(<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>.)</p>

Wilson's with the cart with twenty-six packages of various sorts in it—I saw them all put in—there was a tilt over the cart—I rode before—when I got to the Rising Sun public-house, in Bow-road—I heard something fall from the hind part—I stopped, jumped down, and found the cord cut, and some parcels gone—I turned, and saw a man—I made up to him, and said, "What have you taken out of my cart—he said, "Nothing," but two men have run by—I said, "I with stop you"—he got away from me, ran to the path, jumped over into Mr. Gregory's field—I was afraid to go from my cart—I went to the Rising</p>

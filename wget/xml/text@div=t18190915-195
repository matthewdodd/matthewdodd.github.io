            . On the 10th of September, about half-past twelve o'clock, I was going home - I was about half way down Rosemary-lane. The prisoner accosted me, and said,</p>
               <p>"My dear, where are you going?" I said I was going home and did not want her; she still kept hold of my arm, and would walk by my side. I took her into a public-house, and gave her some gin, in order to get rid of her - she would insist upon seeing me home. I told her to go about her business, and wrenched myself from her - at that moment she took my watch. I did not miss it till I got home, then ran immediately to the watchman, and described her to him; he took me to another watchman, who found her, and produced my watch.</p>

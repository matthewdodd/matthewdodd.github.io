On the 3rd of September I was informed that the prisoner, who was in my employ, had been selling some lead; I went to examine under the attic windows of my house, which he had been cleaning, and missed lead - I went to the house of Mrs. Ridley, a dealer in marine-stores; she said she had taken some lead to a Mr. Jay, next door, a plumber - we went there, and got this lead; I matched it to my house, and it corresponded exactly - it is a piece that went under the window, and overhung the window; there are nail marks in it which exactly correspond - I had seen it safe the week before.</p>

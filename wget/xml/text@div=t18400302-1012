                  </hi>. I am the wife of Robert Stevens, a chinaman, in the New Cot, Lambeth. On the 20th of February the prisoner came for a three-halfpenny basin—(I had seen her about for a long time)—my young man got the basin—I took a shilling from the prisoner—I put it into my pocket, where I had no other shillings or sixpences—soon afterwards Mr. Stevens wanted a shilling, he asked me if I had one—I said "Yes, you know I have"—I gave him the shilling, and he said it was bad—I found it was bad—I took it out of his hand, and put it into a piece of paper—it remained there till the 28th—on the 28th she came again in the evening—I knew her the moment she came in—I said, "What is your pleasure?"—she said, "Have you got a cracked basin?"—I said I had not—she then took up a basin, and said, "What shall I give you for this?"—I said, "2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—she offered me 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I said I could not take it—she then gave me a shilling—I did not look at it, but sent for a policeman—she then said, could I not give her change?—I said my young man would be in in a minute—she then said, "Never mind," and walked out—I followed her, and took hold of her gown—the officer then came up and took her—I gave him both the shillings—I marked them.</p>

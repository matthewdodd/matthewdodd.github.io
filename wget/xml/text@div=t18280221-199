On the 11th of December the prisoner came and asked if Mrs. Thompson lived there; I said Yes, as that was my mother's former name; she asked me to show her the privy, which I did - she said she did not like to go there, and asked to go up stairs - I took her up; I stood on the landing-place - she pointed to my room, and asked if I slept there; she was scratching her leg, and said it itched, and I think she was then taking my mother's gown, for there was nobody there but her - it was a chocolate colour, with a chintz flower; she was gone before I missed it; I told Mr.Willis, when he came home, and in about two months I saw the prisoner in the street, and told my mother that was the woman - she sent for an officer, and he took her; I had seen the gown about an hour before she came.</p>

            . On the 11th of December I was standing at my mother's door, No. 2, Stingo-yard. The prisoner came and asked if I knew Mrs. Thompson, who kept a mangle - I said No, but a neighbour directed her to Willis' - the prisoner knocked at their door, and went in, and in about half an hour my mother sent me to Mr. Jenks', a pawnbroker, and while I was there the prisoner came in with Mrs. Willis' gown, which she laid on the counter, and asked 3s. on it - they would only lend 2s. 6d. - I said to her, "You found it out?" she said Yes - I said, "But she did not keep a mangle?" she said No, it was her mistake; that it was all right, and thanked me - I had seen Mrs. Willis wear the gown.</p>

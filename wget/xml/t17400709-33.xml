               <p>Rich. Booth. My young Master sent me to Highgate, to see how my old Master did, who was not well there, and it was late before I returned to Town. It was 12 o'Clock at Night as I came along <placeName id="t17400709-33-crimeloc171">Cheapside</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17400709-33-crimeloc171" type="placeName" value="Cheapside"></interp>

I said no, I never drank any. But they held me very close, and asked me for some Half-pence; for they said they could drink if I could not. And while they held me so fast, they picked my Pocket of 11 s. They held my Arms down while they did it, and I could not get loose from them, I am sure I had my Money in my Pocket not half an Hour before; for I called at a House as I came along, and had a Pint of Beer, and changed some Money for my Beer, and my Money was then right in my Pocket; but I missed it in a Minute after they had been with me. It was in this Breeches Pocket, and while they held down my Arms, I perceived the Prisoner drawing it from me, and I caught hold of her Arm, while she had it in her Hand. I know she had it right well.- I knew her before this Day. She had it all in her Right-hand,- eleven Shillings, and I had hold of her Arm all the Time; and I saw her deliver it to the other Woman who was with her, and then I called the Watch; and as soon as the Watch came nigh us, then the Prisoner let the other Woman go away with my Money, down Honey Lane Market, and I never saw her since; but I kept fast hold of the Prisoner, and took her before the Constable, and he sent us both to the Compter,- the Constable at Ludgate sent us thither, and we were there from 3 o'Clock on Sunday Morning, to Monday Noon, and then we went to Guildhall, where I charged her with the Fact, and took my Oath on't too. She had nothing to say for herself,- she could not; but she denied it, and could not say any thing for crying. When they took my Money, they held me so close, that I was afraid of my Cloaths, as well as my Money; for I thought they would have tore them off my Back,- one pulled one Way, and the other pulled t'other Way so.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What Time was it you met me? and what did I say to you?</p>
               <p>Booth. Lord, forgive you,- you asked me to drink a Dram, and I said, I did not drink 3 Drams in a 12 Month.</p>
               <p>Defence. I had been at Billingsgate to buy Mackarel, and having sold them all but 5, I carried those 5 to my Grandmother ; and as I was coming from thence up Cheapside, the Man met me, and asked me to drink a Dram; he tore me about, and at last I drank a Dram, and then I went away; but he followed me, and swore this against me, because I would not do as he would have me.</p>
               <p>Booth. What she says is false, for I did not drink a Dram all that Day; I don't drink 3 in a twelvemonth,- I can't drink Gin. The Constable who took Charge of her, lives in Butcher-Hall Lane, he knows me and my Master, but I did not think of bringing him here.</p>

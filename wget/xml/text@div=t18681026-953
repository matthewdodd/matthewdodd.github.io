                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's wife—he is a horse-keeper, at 21, Bell Street, Marylebone—on the evening of the 7th September I went out with a female friend—I returned home a few minutes before 10—my husband had not come home then—he had gone out with all the little money that I had—I went to bed—he came home about 2.30—I was lying down—he kicked me two or three times—I got up and he knocked me down several times—he went across the room and got the poker, and I ran under the table—he knocked the table to pieces over my head—he then went to the mantelpiece and struck down everything that was there—I rushed to the door—he ran after me and brought me back, and put me outside the window—the window is 25 feet from the ground—I held on round his neck, by his collar—I screamed "Murder!" and the witness Oliver came to my assistance—he lodges in the first floor front—I was bruised very much—my arms and legs were black.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and lodge in the next room to the prisoner and his wife—I heard the prisoner come home on the morning of the 8th September, about 2.15—he began using dreadful language to his wife—he then began knocking the things about—the landlady was going to fetch a policeman, but I persuaded her not to—I asked the prisoner to keep quiet, and he said he would smash me if I did not go out of the room—I went out and he began his violence again—I heard the window go up, and I heard screams of "Murder!"—I put on my trousers and went and burst the door open—I found the prisoner's wife half out of window—she was in a sitting position—she had hold of his collar—he said he would stab the first b——man that entered his room—he left go of her, and came towards me—I fought in my own defence—I struck him in the face with my fist—he got me down—I called out for assistance, and they came and pulled him off—he had me by the throat—I got my foot hurt in the struggle.</p>

I heard screams of "Murder!" from 21, Bell Street—I went up stairs to the first floor and met the prosecutrix, who said she would give her husband in charge for attempting to murder her—he was close to the door—I told him he would have to go to the station, and he said, "I will stab the first b——man that comes into the room"—I got the assistance of another constable and broke open the door—the prisoner was in the middle of the room with the poker in his hand—the furniture was broken to pieces and covered with blood—I struck him with my truncheon, and he said he would go quiet.</p>

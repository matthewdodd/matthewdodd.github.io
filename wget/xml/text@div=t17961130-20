               <p>EDWARD ROGERS sworn. - I am a police officer at Shadwell; on the 2d of this month, in the evening, I went with Hill, who is a Trinity officer, by direction of the Magistrates, to look after lumpers who plunder shipping; we saw a number of lumpers come out of a ship into a lighter, near Stone stairs; the ship was moored on the Middlesex side of the River; one of the lumpers called for a boat, and Smith, the waterman, rowed us close, under pretence of taking them, and immediately Hill jumped on board the lighter, and I staid in the boat; Hill took off the hat of the prisoner, in which he found a quantity of sugar, which is here (producing it;) we took him into custody, and when we came on shore at Stone stairs, I searched him, and in the inside of his trowsers, on the left leg, I found this bag of sugar concealed; I brought him to the office; he said he had been working on board the Bushy Park, and he found it on the deck; it is clean sugar, there is about 6lb.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You don't know yourself that this man worked on board the Bushy Park? - A. He came out of the ship.</p>
               <p>Q. The ships lie close together? - A. Yes, in the tier.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't know then whether he came from on board that ship or the others? - A. He said he came from the Bushy Park; I asked him if he came from that ship; he said he did.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not search him till you came on shore? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Might he not have disposed of the sugar if he had stole it, before he got on shore? - A. We watched him.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the oath you have taken, did you ask him if he was working on board the Bushy-Park? - A. Upon my oath, I did; I said, that is the Bushy Park, were you working on board that ship; he said he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the mate say, that he did not know that any plunder had been committed on board that ship? - A. He said he did not know; we went on board afterwards, and he said there was some sugar taken.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you, upon your oath, did not the mate, in the presence of the men, and before the Magistrate, say, he did not know there was any sugar stole? - A. He said something to that effect.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not some of the Customs-house officers examined? - A. Not in my presence.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether the prisoner did not say, that he came through the Bushy Park from the other ships? - A. I did not hear him say any such thing; there was the name on the stern of the ship; I said, have you been working on board the Bushy Park; he said he had.</p>

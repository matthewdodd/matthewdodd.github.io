                  </hi>. I am a wharfinger and contractor, and live at Greenwich. In Dec. last I had a contract for laying down some pavement in a public street there—Bush and Downs were employed by me to lay down some stones for that pavement—Downs was a mason, and Bush was his labourer—I inspected the work that was going on there every day—I remem<lb></lb>ber going there when they came to a turning, on Friday, the 4th of Dec.—I set out a certain part of the stones at that corner—I noticed on that day two particular stones, what are called Rock-hill stones—the stones which I set out were between eight and nine feet superficial, that is, eight feet long and one foot wide; that would be eight superficial feet—I went there again on Saturday, the 5th—the stones were not there then; no, I am wrong in the time, it was on Thursday, the 4th, I went and saw the stones, and on Friday, the 5th, I missed them about half-past ten o'clock in the morning—I found Bush and Downes there at the work—I was endeavouring to bring in another stone to the spot which I had selected a particular stone to go into on the Thursday, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184601050109"></xptr>
               <p>when I found I could not do so I went to the spot where I had seen the particular stone on the Thursday, and found it was gone—I asked Dowries where the stone was gone—he made use of a very vulgar expression, and wished to know if I thought he had eaten the stone—I then said, "I will see if there is any more missing," and in the result I missed two stones—I made some inquiries, and missed them—I mentioned that to both Downes and Bush—Downes said, God Almighty knew where the stones were, he did not—Bush did not say anything at that time—in less than two minutes I had a note put into my hand, and in consequence of what I learnt from that, I said to them, "How came you to put the stone into a cart this morn<lb></lb>ing?"—I asked them if they put the stone into a cart that morning—Bush said he had put some stone into the cart that morning, and he was very sorry for it—they did not mention any time in the morning when they had put it into the cart—I then asked them whose cart it was—he said he did not know, neither did he know the party driving the cart, nor the party the stone was for—Downes said he was not there when the stone was put into the cart, but Bush said to him, "You know all about it; you know I told you this morn<lb></lb>ing; for the party that received it, you know, agreed with us last night for the stone"—I then asked Downes how he came to let that particular stone go, when he was aware there was no other stone on the spot that would come into that individual place, and that I had appointed the stones to be laid there—I did not say anything more to them, but I gave them in charge to a policeman, who took them to the Police-court directly, at Greenwich—Downes was the mason; but neither he, nor Bush, his labourer, had any authority to sell this stone to Bond, or to any one else, only to work it in that work, and he perfectly well knew that I was in want of 2500 feet of stone beside, to do that work with—after the hearing, the case was remanded for a week—on Wednes<lb></lb>day, the 10th of Dec., Bond called on me—he spoke to me first, and said he had called to see me about the stone—I had never seen him till that day—I directly called my foreman, and said, "Now, what you have to say to me you will say in presence of my foreman"—I then asked Bond if I had ever, pre<lb></lb>vious to that moment, spoken to him, or had any dealings with him, or any transactions of any kind with him—he answered no, but that he wanted some stone, and he went to the men and agreed for some stone and that he was anxious to settle for it—I then asked him why he did not come to me instead of going to my men—he said he did not know—I then asked him whose cart it was that took the stone away—he said he did not know—I then told him that, as the men were remanded for a week, he had better go to the inspector, and give him what information he could upon it, as I considered it a bad case, and I thought it would be better for him if he could find out whose cart took the stone away, as he wished to appear so innocent about it—I heard him say afterwards at the Police-court that it was his son's cart that took the stone—he was then in the witness-box—some one connected with the Court put him there—I afterwards saw the stone, and it was mine.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you ever been tried yourself? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know what you allude to—I never stood in the dock charged with felony—I have for a mis<lb></lb>demeanour—how can I tell what became of the girl who made the charge against me?—I do not know that any one took care that she should not go before the Grand Jury—I am perfectly aware that if I had given 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the malicious case never would have been brought on—it was heard before the Magistrates at Lewisham, and I was held to bail to answer it—I never saw the young woman appear—Mr. Whittle, of No. 7, Parliament-street, was my attorney—I suppose the young woman made a charge before the Magistrates, but I was not present when she made the charge—she charged me with attempting to ravish her—she was a servant of mine, and she had notice to leave, and, by what I understand since, she wanted to go to Lee races, and her mistress would not let her go, and then she brought this charge against me—it was all false, and I believe it was considered so gross that the Grand Jury threw it out—I did not see the girl in this Court or before the Grand Jury—my solicitor told me that 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would settle it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The girl never appeared before the Grand Jury, and the bill was ignored? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know, sir—the bill was thrown out, I believe—I do not know—I cannot tax my memory so far as to say whether it was in Aug., 1838.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, I ask you whether you do not know that the bill was not found, and that after your attorney told you that 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would settle it, the girl did not appear, and you came here to take your acquittal? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I never came here and pleaded—I was living at that time at Sydenham—I staid at Syden<lb></lb>ham six years after that charge—I have now left Sydenham four years, and reside at Greenwich—I did not quit Sydenham almost immediately after that charge—I staid there about six years afterwards—I left there to reside at Greenwich—I have lived nowhere else.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did anybody call at your premises on the following morning after this stone was stolen, with the measure of the stone, offering to pay you the amount of the stone, before any charge was preferred against anybody? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, sir, certainly not—the first I heard of anybody calling at my premises was on the evening after the men were charged—that was on the Friday evening—I gave them in charge on the Friday morning, the 5th of Dec., about eleven o'clock—that was the morning on which the cart came and took the stones.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On that same evening did Bond, or Bond's son, come to your house, with the measure of the stone, offering to pay for it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was reported to me to have come on Friday evening—I was not at home—I am quite sure I was not at home—I saw him on Wednesday morning, the 10th—he had not been to my house at all, to my knowledge, between the 5th and the 10th—I heard he had been two or three times—I do not know Charles Bond—I had not seen any one connected with Bond before the Wednesday—I did not see Bond on Monday morning, the 8th of Dec., nor on the morn<lb></lb>ing of the 5th or the 6th—I learned, when I returned home on the Friday evening, that he had been to my house—I do not know that he is a respect<lb></lb>able tradesman at Greenwich—my father has not been in the habit of dealing with him, to my knowledge—my father employed a great number of men.</p>
               <p>

I remember on Friday, the 5th of Dec., seeing Mr. Bond at my master's house—he came, I should think, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon—my master was gone to Gravesend—Mr. Bond asked me for Mr. Tuckwell—I said he was gone to Gravesend—I did not see any one near Mr. Bond then, but soon after I saw Bush, the labourer—I did not know him, but he was close by Mr. Bond on the left hand—Mr. Bond said he wanted to see Mr. Tuckwell—I asked him what his business was—he said he came to settle concerning some stone—Mrs. Tuckwell was at home, and I told Mr. Bond I knew nothing at all about it, but I would call Mrs. Tuckwell, if he would give me his name—he then gave me his name Bond—when Mrs. Tuckwell came down she asked him what his business was—he said he wanted to see Mr. Tuckwell—she told him he was gone to Gravesend—he said he was sorry, he wanted to settle for some stones—she said, "Do you know what it came to?"—he said, "No"—she said, "Do you know what it measured?"—he said, "No, that is what I want to know"—he said it was a very unpleasant business, for the men had been taken into custody—she then asked him his name, and he said, "Bond"—she said she could not have anything to do with it unless Mr. Tuckwell was at home, and he said he was very sorry, for he thought if Mr. Tuckwell had been at home it might have been settled amicably—Mrs. Tuck<lb></lb>well said, "I know nothing at all about it," and she then asked him concern<lb></lb>ing the stone—he said, "It was sent to my premises, but I have not seen it, for I have not been at home"—she then asked him how it was conveyed there—he said he did not know, for he kept no cart of his own, nor did he know how it was conveyed there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an accountant—I was in the prosecutor's service on Saturday, the 6th of Dec.—Bush came to me to the counting-house that evening—he said he came for his wages—I did not pay him—I was in<lb></lb>structed not—that was the day after he had been charged before the Magis<lb></lb>trate—I told him I could not think of paying him his wages till this matter was cleared up—he told me he knew nothing at all about it, he had nothing at all to do with it—I said, "That appears very strange, I understood you were one of the principal men connected with it, and you denied it"—he said, "I did," and he said, "Mr. Tuckwell never asked me about it, or I should have told him at first"—he said he hoped Mr. Tuckwell would not be hard with him.</p>

               <p>Q. Where was the prisoner then?</p>
               <p>Answer. He was gone out, I had sent him of an errand.</p>
               <p>Q. What book is that?</p>
               <p>Answer. We set all the watches down as they come in to be mended, and scratch them out as they go out again; I went after the prisoner through Bishopsgate, and turning down old Bedlam I saw him come out of a watch-maker's shop, I called to him, and then accused him with taking a watch, he soon owned he had stole it, and that he had sold it in that shop; I took him with me, and went in and there found it; he had sold it for 27 s. he returned the money and I took the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had the prisoner been with your master?</p>
               <p>Answer. He had been with us a month the very day that he committed the crime.</p>

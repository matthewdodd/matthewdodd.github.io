            . I live with Mr. Syren, a refiner; the prisoner came to the shop, on the 16th of November - I had seen him before; he brought some silver-cuttings to sell; I suspected him, and told him to call again, which he did. I had informed my master of it, and when he called, I asked his address; he said "Smith, No. 17, Mary-le-bone-street," and said he was a silver spoon maker; I detained the silver, and said I should inquire - he wished to take it away; he never came for it again. I inquired through the trade, and he was taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Are you certain he is the man? A. Yes; it was in the evening, but we had a gas-light.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You say you know nobody who cuts their silver with a file? A. I know nearly all the trade; if any other did so, it would be like this; but here is one piece, which I scolded him for cutting off so large - I know that piece; I expressed no doubt of it before the Magistrate - I did not suspect him before; I am an out-door workman to Mr. Henly. I never said I would not have prosecuted him if it had not been for Mr. Henly.</p>

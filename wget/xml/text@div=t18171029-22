            . On the 27th of October, about five o'clock in the afternoon, I was at the lower end of <placeName id="t18171029-22-crimeloc121">Carey-street, near Chancery-lane</placeName>

A man with a wooden leg shoved me against the post, and squeezed me very hard; I asked him what he was about? he put me in a flurry. I felt his hand pulling my watch out, and immediately caught hold of him; he handed it over to two young men who were by his side - I had noticed them before. I kept hold of him till the officer came; I held him against the post.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Are you sure he shoved you against the post before the watch was taken from you, or after - A. Before.</p>
               <p>THOMAS KIERNEY. I am beadle of the Liberty of the Rolls; which is in Middlesex, not in the City. I was called out of my house in Bell-yard, and went to Carey-street, by the posts. The prosecutor had hold of the prisoner - He told me he was one of the men who had robbed him, I took him in charge. I found nothing on him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was in Carey-street; some drays came by-three or four men rushed against him, and ran away, he turned round, laid hold of me, and charged me with the robbery. The people said I had given the watch to somebody.</p>

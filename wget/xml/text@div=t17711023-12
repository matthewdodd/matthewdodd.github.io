            . The two prisoners and I and Fotterel, not yet taken, went out on Friday night the 11th of this month; we met at the Eagle in Eagle-street, Red Lyon-square, we went there about four or five o'clock in the evening; Murray and Freel and I went there, and Fotterel met us there: we staid till near six o'clock; we committed two robberies before we had done this Frenchman; we went up towards Marybone, we committed a robbery there; we went then to Oxford-road, and from thence to Hanover-square; we met a gentleman and robbed him there; then we went to another square I don't know the name of; as we were walking along we saw this gentleman, we resolved to attack him; this was about eight o'clock, or might be a little after; he was walking along; there was but one pistol, Freel had it; he walked before him, (we were behind him at first) and he stopped him; he held the pistol to him, and bid him stand and deliver; the old gentleman made a sort of a tussle, and Murray laid hold of him behind and pinioned his arms; he bid him whist, that is hold his tongue, or he would kill him; we could not get the money out of his pockets cleverly, and Fotterel cut the watch out of his pocket with a knife; Freel took hold of his little finger, put it in his mouth, and bit the ring off his finger; when he could get no more, Freel struck him with the pistol in his mouth. I can't tell, whether they took any money, if they got any they did not let me have any share of it. I helped to hold him, I had hold of him by the breast; then we left him and went towards our lodging in Spitalfields. I am a carver by trade; we went to a lodging-house there; we lay there till the next morning. Freel kept the watch till the Sunday morning following and the ring; Freel and I sold the watch on Sunday, with a gold one, to one Saunders a Jew, we got eight guineas for them both together; we divided it between us, two guineas a-piece; I had the ring because they esteemed me the genteelest among them; they asked me to go and sell it, which I agreed to do; Freel gave it me on the Monday, it was a gold ring with a stone with the impression of a head, it was broke in two or three pieces, the stone was out of the socket, I broke it into another piece I think, I went and sold it to a goldsmith in the Borough, I sold it the day he gave it me, on Monday.</p>

               <p>- Gallaway. I was at the ng of the prisoners and Delaney, at the Eagle in Eagle-street; I found them all together; Freel had two pistols in his pocket, one of them was charged, and Murray had one; I don't remember that Delaney had any thing in his pocket; there were some false keys taken out of one of their pockets, I don't remember whose.</p>

               <p>Murray's Defence.</p>
               <p>The gentleman swares that this watch was taken out of his pocket, the evidence swares it was cut out of his pocket. I was never acquainted with Delaney in my life; I am a silk-weaver by trade, I was just come to town to seek for business.</p>

               <p>I know nothing about the matter. Delaney owned before the justice that, the picklocks were found upon him; I have worked as a labourer to a bricklayer, and his business is of such a sort that he is obliged to be running about all day, so that he could not come here</p>

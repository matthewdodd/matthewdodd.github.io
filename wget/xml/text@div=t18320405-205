             on the 20th of March - I hung it in the yard, where there were some other things; I have known the prisoner more than twelve months - be kept company with my sister; he was there the whole of that day, and he went into the yard - be then came up and finished tea; I sent my mother down for the shirt to iron it, and it was not there - I then went down and asked one of the lodgers if she had taken it in mistake; she said, No - the prisoner then closed his hands, and said, might his hands never unclose any more if he did not see her take it down, and he would go for a Policeman - he went, and was gone an hour and a half - he then returned, and said, he could not find one; I said, "You are the person who told me of it, and I will send for a Policeman, and have you searched" - he said, "You may search me yourself;" he pulled off his right stocking, and there was nothing there, but in his left stocking was the duplicate and the money - I said, "You good for nothing man, go about your business;" he said he would not, he would have my life, and then he would go to prison like a man - he then said, he had done that which would transport him, and I might do it and be d - d; I sent for the officer, and gave him in charge - I do not know what the prisoner is; my sister and I scarcely ever speak, but she came that morning and he came with her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not ask me to take a shawl and pawn it for you - I brought you the money, and you said, "Get a quartern of gin?" A. No, I did not know of it till you brought the money, and laid down 9d., and said you wanted 3d. to spend - I took the duplicate, and forgave you that, because I did not like an exposure - I never said I would do for you some time or other; I get my living honestly - I do not know whether you lived with my sister or not.</p>

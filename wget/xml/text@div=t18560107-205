I was on duty at Deptford, on the morning of 20th Dec.—the prisoner was given into my custody by the last witness—while he was away, the prisoner asked me to let him go to the water closet—I let him go to the water closet in the Fountain public house yard—after he was taken to the station, I went with Chapman to that water closet, and he got this lead out of the soil, and this key; and I found this one piece of lead behind the door—I returned to the station, told the prisoner what I had found, and asked if he knew anything about this piece—he said, "Yes, I put it behind the door."</p>

I am foreman to Mr. Frank Clark Hills, a manufac<lb></lb>turing chemist and druggist The prisoner has been employed at Mr. Hill's upwards of two years—I know this piece of lead—it is Mr. Hill's—it is what we call a socket syphon—I did not miss it—I might have seen it a fortnight before the 20th Dec.—I cannot say exactly, because we have more of them—we perhaps should not have missed it at all, because such a quantity as is taken into the warehouse, it would be almost impossible to tell—I have seen this other lead, part of it has been melted out of lead we had—some parts I could not positively swear to—the value of this one article</p>

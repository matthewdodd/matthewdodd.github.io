                  </hi>. I am a police constable attached to the Post Office in St. Martin's-Grand—on the morning of the 15th April I saw Blackburn, the plumber, clear out a water closet on the basement floor of the General Post Office—it was the second one on the left, coming out of the London District Office—I believe it is one of the closets appropriated to the letter carriers—Blackburn cleared out the pan, and stopped it, by putting in some brown paper—after he had done this, I watched that closet—I went to the back of it, to what is called an air shaft, and looked through a grating—there is a gas light in the closet, which is burning all day; it was burning then—I watched therefrom about half-past 6 o'clock till about half-past 6—Smee, my brother officer, then came and relieved me—up to that time</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185605140275"></xptr>
               <p>nobody had entered the closet—I still continued to watch—I was away for a short time, but about half-past 7 o'clock I heard the door leading from the office shut, and I went back, looked through the grating, and saw the prisoner enter the closet—the grating is at the back of the closet, at the right hand of a person on the seat, it forms part of the wall—the prisoner sat down on the seat—I heard some paper tearing when he was sitting down—I then saw his hand go behind him—he got up in a minute or so, and went out—as soon as he had left, I went and fetched Blackburn, and instructed him to search the closet—I left Smee at the grating—Smee had a better view of the closet than I had, because he was more at the front—I saw Blackburn search the pan, and take out some pieces of paper which appeared to be portions of a letter—I have it here—after the pieces were taken out Blackburn washed them and pot them together, and then they were given to me by Mr. Sculthorpe, and have been in my possession ever since—after the papers had been examined, I went to look after the prisoner in the Sorting Office—that was about half-past 7 o'clock—I could not find him there—I gave information to Mr. Gapes, the inspector of letter carriers, of what I had seen—I afterwards went into the Sorting Office again, about 8 o'clock, and picked out the prisoner, and he was taken into Mr. Sculthorpe's room.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable attached to the Post Office. On the morning of the 15th April I was watching this water closet—I relieved Peak about half-past 6 o'clock—it was one of the letter carriers' closets, the second from the corner, next the iron gate—I remained there until a quarter past 7 o'clock—I could see the entire of the closet through the grating—there is a gas light in the closet—up to that time nobody had entered the closet—at a quarter past 7 o'clock the prisoner came in—he turned himself round, and fastened the door—he then arranged his clothes and sat down on the seat—I then saw him put his left hand into his left coat pocket at the side of him (it was a shooting coat with two pockets)—he took something out, of the appearance of a letter, and brought it in front of him—he tore something with his hand of the appearance of a letter, but he sat in such a stooping position that I could not exactly see whether it was a letter or not—the paper was torn up in small pieces—I then saw him put his right hand behind him to the pan, and drop pieces of paper of the appearance of a letter—I saw a post stamp on part of it as it was felling—it was a red stamp—I directly turned off the water, to prevent them being washed away—after about a minute or so, the prisoner got up, arranged his clothes, and went out, and directly afterwards Blackburn came in—Peak and I were both together all the time—he left me for about a minute, and returned directly—he had the opportunity on his return of seeing into the water closet—he had not so good a position as I had—he could see the person in the closet—he had a better sight of his face when he came in than I had—when Peak went for Blackburn I remained watching, to see that no one else came in—no one but the prisoner came to that closet up to the time of Blackburn's coming—when he came he commenced taking out the fragments of a letter—I saw writing on them—it looked like a letter—it was all in small pieces—I went with him into his shop, which is in the vaults, and there he put them into a bucket of water, and washed them—we then put them together, and saw the address on them—I afterwards delivered them to Mr. Sculthorpe, after Blackburn had put his initials on some portions of them—I have here on this piece of tissue paper the papers I saw Blackburn take out of the pan, and also a portion of two cards—they are the same pieces that I received from Black-burn—one of the cards bears the name of "Mr. G. T. Attwater," and the other "Mrs. Frederick Davidge"—they had been torn up, but have since been put together—I afterwards gave information to Mr. Gapes, the inspector of letter carriers, and was in the office when he took the prisoner into Mr. Sculthorpe's private room—I heard Peak say to him, "You have been down to the water closets this morning"—the prisoner said, "Yes, I have"—Peak said, "The second one on the right from the door, in the letter carriers' closets?"—he said, "Yes"—Peak then said, "We saw you tear up a letter this morning"—the prisoner made no answer to that—I then searched him—in his left trousers pocket I found a purse containing a sovereign, half a crown, and a sixpence, and in his right trousers pocket</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185605140277"></xptr>
               <p>two sixpences, and three halfpence in copper—Peak then took up the purse and the sovereign, and asked the prisoner where he got this sovereign from, holding it in his hand at the time—the prisoner said, "I received it last week for my wages"—I then went and fetched Mr. Sculthorpe, and he was told all the circumstances in the prisoner's presence—we told him that we had been watching this certain closet in the basement, and that we saw the prisoner come in and tear up a letter—I then said, "I have searched the prisoner, and found a purse on him containing a sovereign, half a crown, and a sixpence, and two sixpences and three halfpence in the other pocket"—I then handed Mr. Sculthorpe the sovereign, which he closely examined—he held it up in his hand, and said to the prisoner, "Where did you get this sovereign from? I mean this particular sovereign, it is a George and Dragon sovereign of 1824"—the prisoner hesitated for a few seconds, and then said, "I received it from the bank with other money"—Mr. Sculthorpe asked him what bank, and he said, "The Provident Bank, St Martin's-lane"—Mr. Sculthorpe said, "When?"—he said, "About three or four months ago"—he was then given into custody—I took possession of the sovereign—I have had it ever since, and now produce it—from half-past 6 o'clock, when I went to relieve Peak, down to the time when Blackburn, brought these papers from the closet, no one had been to that closet but the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was not what the prisoner said, that he got the sovereign from the bank last month? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I did not try to ascertain from the Provident Bank, in St Martin's-lane, whether he had drawn out any money the month before, I am not aware that any one has done so—I had no instruction to go—there is a savings bank there, called the Provi<lb></lb>dent Institution—he did not say he got it out of the savings bank last March—he said "three or four months ago," he never mentioned any month—my deposition was read over to me before I signed it—this is my signature (<hi rend="italic">The witness's deposition being ready stated</hi>: "The prisoner than stated he received it from the bank in March last")—it is my impression that he said "three or four months ago"—I will not say that what I said before the Magistrate was not true—I think he did say "March last)" I cannot say positively, it is some time ago—when Peak first spoke to him about the sovereign he said, "I received it last week for my wages"—he did not say he had saved it from his wages and drawn it out from the bank in March last—he said nothing about the bank at that time—I did not hear him mention the fact of having received it for his wages more than once, and that was to Peak: nor yet about the bank—the first of these conversations was about a little after 8 o'clock, and the other, I suppose, about 9 o'clock—it was in answer to Mr. Sculthorpe that he mentioned about drawing it from the bank—he did not use the word <hi rend="italic">saved</hi> to Peak—that I swear—I heard Peak examined—I was not in the sorters' room about half-past 7 o'clock, I was at the door, and Peak had been in and said he could not see him—I looked through the door—I did not see him—he was not sitting in the same place as he was when I saw Mr. Gapes go in, and took him to the comptrollers' room—he might have been in some other seat—there might have been a dozen sorters there when I looked in, they were just returning from their breakfast—I believe they breakfast down stairs in the kitchen—I cannot say which water closet would be nearest to a person coming up from the kitchin—in order to get from the front of the water closet to the air shaft where Peak and I were, you must come up stairs into the office, go into the hall of the Boat Office and through a door, and down into the vaults—it would take about a minute or a</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185605140278"></xptr>
               <p>minute and a half to do that—I continued at the air shaft while Peak went for Blackburn—I saw Blackburn take out the fragments of a letter it was as light there with the gas, as it is here—I could not see right down into the hole, I saw him put an instrument down and bring them up, it was a wooden instrument about three or four feet long, I could not see how far down it went.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a plumber employed at the General Post Office. On the morning of 15th April I was directed to go to the water closets on the basement—I went there about a quarter past 6 o'clock—Peak was not with me, he was in the air shaft; he could see me—I washed out the closet and stopped it, I put a sheet of brown paper into the trap; it is a self acting closet, the seat is on a spring, and when a person rises the water flows in—there is a trap below the pan—I washed that trap out—it is a ten inch trap, made of lead, and contains a gallon of water—the contents of the pan go into that trap in the ordinary way, and when the person rises the fall of water washes out the trap—I put the brown paper in the trap for the purpose of preventing anything from passing down it without my knowledge—after doing that I left the closet, leaving nothing but water and the brown paper in the trap—Peak was then at the grating; about a quarter past 7 o'clock Peak came and fetched me, and I went to the same closet—I examined the pan, I found that it had been used in the usual way—I cleared out the trap—I had an instrument made of two pieces of wood like a pair of tweezers, and with that I pulled up the contents of the trap with the sheet of brown paper—there was soil in the trap—I took out some torn pieces of paper and pieces of card, I picked out the pieces, put them into a sheet of brown paper, took them into my shop and washed them in Smee's presence—these are them—Smee wished me to mark one or two of them, which I did, and gave them to him—here are my marks—my attention had been called to this water closet the day before, and I took out seven letters from it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What did you take out of the water closet when you went at a quarter past 7 o'clock, with your wooden tweezers? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I took out the torn pieces of paper and some fragments of printed paper besides these—some parties had been to the closet, I cannot say who—I have no doubt it had been used in the ordinary way, I merely picked out the letter, I did not want those, I put the pieces of printed paper into the trap again, with the brown paper—the rushing of the water into the pan makes a noise, and can be seen by the person using the closet, about a gallon and a half of water flows in—when the water is turned off, there would, of course, not be that noise, the seat would rattle, but there would be no noise of gushing water—I washed out the four letter carriers' closets that morning—there are ten closets in a row, there is a wide space between the clerks' and the sorters', and an iron gate; that gate divides the two closets belonging to the sorters from the four belonging to the letter carriers—a person coming up from the sorters' kitchen would be nearest the sorters' closets—I cannot say whether the prisoner was in the habit of eating his breakfast in the letter carriers' kitchen, they take their breakfast as they can get the</p>

               <p>chance—the place is very small, and they are tied for room, and they go where they can—the sheet of brown paper which I put in the trap I doubled up and pushed down—it would be supported simply by its own pressure against the sides of the trap—I found a great many fragments—I washed them and gave them all to Smee.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the assistant comptrollers of the London District Office. I have been in the Post Office thirty-two years. On the morning of 15th April, Smee came to me at my chambers, and in consequence of what he said, I went to the Post Office—I got there about 9 o'clock—I there found the prisoner in my private room with Peak and Smee—Peak informed me that the prisoner had been seen to destroy a letter in the water closet, and Smee handed me the fragments of a letter, and likewise a sovereign, which he stated he had found in the prisoner's pocket—I closely examined the sovereign, and asked the prisoner where he got it from—he hesitated and then said, "I received it from the bank in St. Martin's-lane"—Peak then said, "Why, you stated you received it for your wages"—I do not recollect that he made any reply to that—he was asked, I think, by Peak, what bank he had received it of, and he replied, "The Provident Bonk, or savings bank in St Martin's-lane"—I did not notice that he said at what time he had received it—I believe he has been in the Post Office about twenty years—I think his wages were 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a week—I received these fragments of a letter, envelope, and cards, from Smee—I put them together, and gave them to Peak—I find a General Post mark on one of the pieces, of 15th April—that denotes that it arrived at the Post Office in London on the 15th—that impression is pat on before the sorting—I also find the county post mark, "Gloucester"—the portion of the letter containing the date is destroyed—the first despatch to Hackney is at 7 o'clock, and the second at half-past 7.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was that the only time you saw him there that morning? <hi rend="italic">A. No</hi>; I saw him at 25 minutes past 7 o'clock in the morning—he left then—he was there from 5 o'clock till 25 minutes past 7 o'clock—he was then taken out of the room by the officers—I only remember Peak coming to the room once, that was when he pointed him out—he might have come in without my seeing him, if I was engaged—I know I am accurate about the time—I know how the duty progresses every minute—the prisoner could not have been absent without my knowledge—I cannot say he was there every minute, or every five minutes.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Attwater, of Brockworth Gonrt, about four miles from Gloucester. Our letters are left at the house of Mr. Watts, a tailor in the village, where they are called for by the postman—on the 14th of April I wrote a letter to my father, enclosing a sovereign in two cards, one of Mr. G. T. Attwater's and one of Mrs. Frederick Davidge—I put it in an envelope, and addressed it, "Mr. Woolbert, No. 2, Palace-cottages, Wells-street, South Hackney, near London"—the papers on this first piece of tissue paper form part of that envelope—I find here Mr. Attwater's card entire, and a portion of Mrs. Davidge's—I believe these to be the cards in which I enclosed the sovereign—I put two stamps on the letter, because I thought it might be over weight—this other piece of tissue paper contains nearly all the letter I wrote to my father—the sovereign I sent was a George and Dragon—I did not notice the date of it—my father is a great invalid—a person named Lizzy attends on him.</p>

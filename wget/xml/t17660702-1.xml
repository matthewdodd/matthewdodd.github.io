On the 7th of June at about eleven at night, I was called to by a neighbour, and told a man had robbed me; the prisoner was brought in, in about five minutes after, with my ironing-cloth under his coat: he then said he had been into the shop to ask for a halfpennyworth of yellow basilicon, but that he bought the cloth of a woman for 2 s. in the street. I had seen it about a quarter of an hour before in a basket, on the ironing-board in the shop.</p>

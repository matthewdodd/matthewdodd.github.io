On 14th March, the prisoner came to the shop about half-past one o'clock, for two halfpenny Queencakes—he gave me a bad half-crown—I saw it was bad, and asked where he got it—he said a gentleman outside the door gave it him, and he would go and fetch him—he went out, and ran away as fast as he could—my husband followed, and brought him back, and he was given into custody—I bent the half-crown in the detector, and marked it with my scissors, and gave it to my husband.</p>

I received the prisoner in custody from Mr. Allen, who gave me this bad half-crown—I saw some papers in the prisoner's hand—I asked him what he had got—he put his hand in his pocket, and took it out, and put it in his bosom—I took his hand, and found in it six half-crowns wrapped in tissue paper, and at the station I found one bad half-crown in his right hand pocket—I found on him one good shilling, one sixpence, and fourpence-halfpenny in copper.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, living in Queen-street, Golden-square. I was in St. Giles's between three and four o'clock in the morning of the 19th of October—I was sober—I am married—I fell in with the prisoner in St. Giles's, and went to a house with her—we did not go of stairs, but remained in the passage—I gave her 10 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which I had in my waistcoat pocket—she then went out at the back of the pre<lb></lb>mises, for a necessary purpose—I remained in the passage—the prisoner then went up stairs—I then had suspicion, and missed my purse, con<lb></lb>taining a sovereign, five shillings, and two half-crowns, which had been all safe in the purse in my coat-pocket two minutes before I went into the passage—I went out and got a policeman—we went to the house—the prisoner was then coming down stairs—the policeman went to the back of the house, where I bad seen the prisoner go, and found my purse in the yard of the next house.</p>

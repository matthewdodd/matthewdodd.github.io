                  </hi>. I am landlord of the Hallway Tavern at Pinner. I know the prisoner by seeing him there on the evening of 24th May, when I returned home about 8 o'clock—he was standing in front of the bar—he appeared to me to be like a man half and half—I requested him to be seated, as we were very busy about that time and there were several people there—after some persuasion he went into the parlour and I saw him no more till everybody had left the place, which was about a quarter to 11 o'clock—he was then in the parlour and appeared to be sleeping or dozing—I shook him and tried to persuade him to go home—he said he should go when he pleased, or something of that sort—I found I could not get rid of him, and as it was time to close the house I sent a boy for a policeman, and he came back with Goddard—he tried to get him away and told him that if he did not go away he must take him, as it was time to close the house—the prisoner took off his jacket and struck Goddard in the jaw and knocked him across the room—he would have fallen if it had not been for the table—Goddard persuaded him to go outside—he told him he had struck him, and in doing his duty he should take him—the prisoner struck him and attempted to strike him again, I should say, a violent blow—on that, Goddard took out his staff to protect himself—they appeared to close, and Goddard told me I must go with him to the station—I went to the door to get my hat and came out immediately—they were then on the ground together—I went to Goddard's assistance, thinking I could assist him by holding one of the prisoner's hands while he had the other—I felt myself scratched or cut, and I said to Goddard, "Leave the man; he has got a knife; come in doors and save yourself"—I went in the house and called Goddard after me—he followed me—when he came in he said he was stabbed—I undressed him and sent for a surgeon instantly—I found nine wounds on him—he remained in my house till the next morning.</p>

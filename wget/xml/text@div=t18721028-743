I live at 360, Gray's Inn Road—on 17<hi rend="italic">th</hi> September, at 12 o'clock, I was turning the corner of Ampton Street into Gray's Inn Road, when three persons pushed against me—they made some remark, "Old boy, I see you have got a watch," or something of that sort—they offered to fight, but I declined—Jones took his coat off—a friend advised me to put my watch in my trousers pocket—I stepped back to do so, and was knocked down—I don't remember any more—my coat was buttoned, but my chain could be seen—I recognise Jones—when I regained my faculties I was asked if I would charge the prisoners, and I said I would—I do not recognise Collins.</p>

I am the wife of David Crutchley, and live at 13, Caledonia Crescent—on the evening of 17th September, about 12 o'clock, I was walking along the Gray's Inn Road behind the prosecutor—my husband and the prosecutor and the other witness were met by these prisoners, and the third one is here as a witness for the prisoners—Collins</p>

               <p>pushed very rudely against Gunston, and Gunston said "Mind what you're doing of, mate"—Jones turned round and used very bad language, and took off his coat to fight—he then rushed at Gunston, and made a snatch at his watch—he followed him across the road and knocked him down—when he was down I saw Collins kick him in the ear—I heard my husband gay to Gunston "Take your watch out and put it into your trousers pocket," and he was stepping backwards and Jones followed him, and knocked him down.</p>

This was not a quarrel at all—the others would not quarrel with the prisoners—Henry Read has been called as a witness—he was with us—we had been to have a pint of ale—my husband had been to Shoreditch Station to see a friend of his off with Read, and he called for me at a friend's house—this was about 11.50—these men were perfectly sober—they were all on the same side of the road—they tried to get across out of the way, but the prisoners followed them—Gunston took off his watch and chain and put it in his pocket—he did not then put up his hands for the purpose of fighting—I swear he never struck any one—we did not all four take up the pathway as we were walking along—Collins did not complain of any one pushing against him till we were at Clerken-well—he did then—I did net hear Jones say anything about the watch—I said at the Police Court that Collins kicked him in the ear.</p>

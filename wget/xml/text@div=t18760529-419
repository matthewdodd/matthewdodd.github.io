                  </hi>. I am a farm labourer to Mr. John Golb, of Barking Side—there is an office where I clean the shoes, and on 27th April a pair of old boots were lying about there, and had been up in a corner some time—the prisoner came and picked them up, and said "Here is a pair of old shoes; if they fit me I should think I might have them"—he took them out of the office—I said nothing to him, nor did he to me—Mr. Golb's father was there.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman K</hi> 23). On 14th May, from information I re<lb></lb>ceived, I went to the prisoner's house about 6 p.m., and told him I had come to take him in charge for stealing a pair of boots, the property of Mr. Golb—he said "Can I see Mr. Golb?"—I said "I am going to take you to the station, where you can see him"—he said to his wife "You go and see Mr. Golb, and pay him for the boots, or tell him I will pay him on Satur<lb></lb>day night"—I said "I suppose I can look round the house for the boots?"—he said "Here they are, on my feet. I took one from the office and one from off the ground outside; they were mildewy; I thought they were old ones, and no good to the master, and I took them openly"—on the way to the station he said "I haven't hurt them much, I only wore them last Sun<lb></lb>day"—I took him to the station, and George Golb came and identified them—the prisoner then offered to pay Mr. Golb for them.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my father at Barking Side, we are farmers—these boots are his property—I cannot say how long it was I saw them before seeing them at the police<lb></lb>station—the prisoner had been in my father's employ about two months, during which time he had been a respectable, hard working man—he offered to pay me for the boots at the police-station.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I did not steal them. I went round to the office and six or seven boys were playing about there. I said "What are you up to here? I picked up two brushes and brooms and another old pair of shoes and put them in the office. One of the boys said "Oh!" and I said "What arc you going to do with thatshoe?"—he said "<hi rend="italic">Churl:</hi> it out."Up came the foreman and I said "If he comes here and catches you I should think you would catch it."The foreman said" "Oh, they arc nothing, you can have them if you like." I fitted them on and said."They fit me as well as if they were made forme." I didn't take them, so help me God.</p>

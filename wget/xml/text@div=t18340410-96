            . I am a policeman. The prisoner was given into my charge.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. After the witness stopped me, we went and had a pint of porter together in York-street, St. James's, and passed several policemen - I had the carpet on my shoulder - we went to Jermyn-street - I was carrying it to the hotel, and he turned suddenly round and gave me into custody.</p>
               <p>JAMES BARROW re-examined. I met him in Church-passage with it, and stopped him, telling him to come back with me to where he took it from - he said, "There is a person over at the public-house in York-street; and as we are both at work together at the hotel, I will go there with you" - we went in, and he dropped the carpet outside the door - he was going a contrary road when I stopped him - he dropped the carpet before he went into the public-house - I took it up, and put it on my shoulder, because I thought he would make his escape - he called for a pint of beer, and I went into the tap-room with him - I certainly put my lips to the pot - he paid for it - we passed three policemen before I went into the public-house - but as he saw the other persons at the public-house, I did not mention it to them - I did not think it necessary to state this - I told the policeman there were three pieces of carpet stolen - I suspected so at first.(John Andrews, boot-maker, Monument-street; Thomas Andrews Barnsley, coachman, No. 8, Bird-street; James Avery, broker, 41, Great Wild-street; Isaac Rayner, Jeweller, 48, Wych-street, gave the prisoner a good character.)</p>

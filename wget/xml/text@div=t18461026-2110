                  </hi>. I am wife of William Lane; we live in Vauxhall-bridge-road—I am a laundress—I have employed the prisoner to wash for me—on the evening of the 12th of Oct., between seven and eight o'clock, I found her basket which she takes her victuals in, and in it a pocket-handkerchief be-longing to my forewoman—it was worth nothing—I asked her to allow me to search her lodging—she consented, and I went with her—I found there a cambric handkerchief, which is marked, and a towel with the mark cut off, and several other articles—the towel belonged to the Carlton Club-house, and this handkerchief to the housekeeper at the Wyndham Club—they were sent to me to wash—the prisoner was given into custody—I went again with the officer to her lodging, and found the piece that had been cut off the towel with the mark on it—I found a piece had been cut off the towel, and it had been newly hemmed and not washed afterwards—I also found a chopper belonging to me.</p>

            . I am servant to Messrs. Todd and Co., who are haberdashers, and live in Fore-street. I know Hurst - I believe he is a weaver in Spitalfields. On the 27th of April I bought a piece of blue and a piece of white satin of him. I gave him 3 s. a yard for the blue, and 3 s. 3 d. for the other; they came to 22 l. together.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not that an under price - A. It is a fair trader's price - I buy them for that every day. After I had bought them, on seeing the marks, I knew them to be Mr. Wilson's, and informed him of it - I told him who I bought them of. I have known Hurst some years.</p>

            . On the 28th of April I went to Messrs. Todds', and saw the two pieces of satin, which are mine. I find by my books that they were never sold. The prisoner was in the habit of coming to our house during the whole of April, to collect cotton to dye, for Mr. Summers. The satins cost me 31 l. - I should not sell them for that. My brother Stephen is my partner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. They might have been sold, and not entered - A. It is possible. This book is a copy from the waste-book.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What is the blue piece worth a yard - A. I should not sell it under 5 s., and the white at 5 s. 6 d. There would be a discount of 10 or 12 1/2 per cent. taken from that, which would make the blue 4 s. 6 d. and the white 4 s. 11 d.</p>

            . I am a ribbon-weaver - I manufacture for myself, and sell goods. On the 23d of April the prisoner came, and asked me if I could find him a purchaser for a piece of blue satin? I told him to leave it, as I was going into the City next day, and would take it with me. On the 27th he brought me a piece of white satin, and that afternoon I sold them both to Crow for 22 l. Inquiry was afterwards made about them, and I immediately said the prisoner brought them to me. I went with Armstrong and pointed him out. He said he knew nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you been a ribbon-weaver - A. Thirty-four years. Crow fixed the price of the satin. The prisoner told me not to take less than 3 s.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not you yourself been tried here - A. Yes. I have been at Messrs. Wilson's once.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Crow knew you was a ribbon-weaver - A. Yes. I never made satin.</p>

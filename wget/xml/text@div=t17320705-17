            . The Prisoner and I, and Plumridge committed this Robbery: The Prisoner and I din'd at Mr. Winniat's in Fleet-Lane, on Sunday was a Fortnight; we had a Leg of Mutton and Turnips for Dinner, and 3 Bowls of Punch after, in Company with Winniat and his Man, and a Countryman; but Winniat is since absconded. Between 9 and o at Night Plumridge came in, and ask'd us to drink a Dram; we had half a Pint of Caraway, and then went all together to Whitechappel-Fields ; there we overtook the Prosecutor: Plumridge seiz'd him, and cut him across the Throat, and gave him 2 Stabs in the Back with a great Case-knife, which he brought from Winniat's : I did not see him give the Stabs, but he told me afterwards that he did it. Then the Prisoner struck him on the Head with a Broomstick, and the Prosecutor being 10 th to come along, we dragg'd him to a Bankside; Plumridge got upon the Bank to pull him over, but did not; I search'd his Pocket, and took out 19 s. and the Prisoner examin'd farther, and found the Pocket-Piece, 'twas a little bit of Silver like a Sixpence: I took his Hat, and gave him mine.</p>
               <p>Lumm. I know of no Hat that was given me.</p>
               <p>Buck. He was senseless with the Blows and Wounds: This is the Hat, and Plumridge took his Wig to the best of my Remembrance, tho' the Prisoner since told me, that he took it himself. We stript his Coat off, and the Prisoner bid me put it on and wear it, which I did; but first they knock'd him down, and would have murder'd him if I had not begg'd<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173207050013"></xptr> his Life. How can ye serve a Man so villainously? says I, sure you will not be such vile Men as to kill him! For God's Sake spare his Life. And so as they were going I listed him up, and bid him run for his Life; upon which Plumridge and the Prisoner turn'd back to kill me, but I made 'em easy. This is the Coat, and here are the 2 Cuts in the Back. Then we came on foot to Newgate-street, and there we took Coach between 12 and 1 in the Morning, and drove to Mr. Pember's, at the Pindar of Wake-field, where we all three went to bed together. Pember married one of my Sisters. Next Day we went to the Two Brewers by the Church in Old Bedlam, where we spent most of the Money, and at Night I and Plumridge went to Cow-Cross, where we pawn'd the Coat for 7 s. and from thence to

I went about it as soon as ever I could get out of the Prisoner's Company without his suspecting me; I left him under Pretence of going to have my Wig powder'd, and I told Mr. Pointing and some other Men of this Robbery, and desired them to go with me to a Justice to surrender myself.

            . I lately kept the B Tree Alehouse at the Pindar of Wakefield, but have since left it. On Monday the 19th of April, about one in the Morning, Buck, and Plumridge, and the Prisoner came in a Coach to my Door, and knock'd me up; I told 'em I had no Fire, nor Candle in the House; they said they were very dry; says I to Buck, You know the way into the Cellar, fetch up some bottle Ale; so he went down, and brought up 3 Bottles. I groped about for a Mug, but not finding it readily, they drank out of the Bottle; then they all 3 went to the Pump to wash themselves; I went up to Bed, and they follow'd me; my Wife was not with me, and so we lay all together, for it was a very large Bed. I got up at 5, and opening the Window-shutter, saw their Cloaths which lay on the Bed, and their Linen were very bloody: Plumridge call'd for some Water, and a Towel, which I fetch'd, and he began to wash one of the Coats, which was more bloody than the rest; says I you'll spoil your Coat, you had better do it with a dry Brush; he desir'd me to help him to one, which I did, and then he began to rub the Blood off his own Coat, for he said the other was Buck's, and when he had done, the Prisoner took the Brush, and clean'd his Coat. Says the Prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173207050014"></xptr> to Buck, You can't go to London in that Coat, in such a pickle: No, says he, I'll go in my Waistcoat, and leave the Coat here till dry. I ask'd 'em how they came in that bloody Condition, and how the Coat came to be cut Why, says the Prisoner, I was playing Rogue with a Penknife, and cut it myself last Night, and afterwards we all got drunk, and fell to fighting. They went to London, Buck being in his Waistcoat, and about 9 at Night they return'd, and ask'd for the Coat; I gave it 'em, and went out my self, and left them there, so that I don't know how long they staid. On Tuesday the Prisoner and Buck came to my House again, and ask'd me if I knew that Fellow Plumridge: I told them no, I had never seen him before. Why, said they, he's taken up, and put into the Compter, and we have been fighting with the Watch to rescue him, but we could not manage it; for at last we were glad to get away overselves. Now we are afraid that he should take himself an Evidence, and wish you would go to London, and enquire whether it is so, or not.</p>
               <p>Court. Did they name any particular Fact, concerning which they were afraid he should turn Evidence?</p>
               <p>Pember. No. I went to London and heard that a Man had been robb'd in Stepney Fields of a Coat, and Hat and Wig, and had been very much abused. This made me suspicious of these three Men; and so that Night I went to look for Buck and the Prisoner at a House in Drury-Lane, which I knew they frequented. They both came in drunk between 12 and 1 in the Morning. They stay'd some Time, and then I went away with them towards my House. When we came into the Fields, they quarrel'd about the Coat that Buck and Plumridge had pawn'd at Cow-Cross ; they swore and curs'd, and called Names; you're as great a Rogne as I, says one, and you have no Heart, says th'other; and at last they drew their Knives, but the Prisoner wrested Buck's Knife out of his Hand, and threw it away; Buck sell into a dry Ditch, and there we left him without a Coat. As the Prisoner and I went home together, he told me. that himself and Buck and Plumridge had robb'd a Man, and stabb'd him in the Back, because he was resolute, and wou'd not agree to their Compliance. When we came to my House, I turned my Wife and another out of Bed, and I and the Prisoner went in. Buck came Home soon after, tho' he would not come to Bed because of the Quarrel, but he sat up with his Sister.</p>
               <p>Court. Was she your Wife?</p>
               <p>Pember. Yes, and a good one too she wou'd be, if she was but hang'd. I got up in the Morning, and Buck then went to Bed. I went to London, and consulted with Mr. Brock, Mr. James and Mr. Pointing, and they spoke to Mr. Taylor about apprehending the Prisoner and Buck. We all came for that Purpose to my House; but my Wife suspecting my Design, had given her Brother and the Prisoner timely Notice, so that they got off. Then I appointed to meet Mr. Taylor and Mr. James in London at 6 that Afternoon, and to go to Sir

I and Pointing waited at several House in the Fields, in hopes of catching Buck and the Prisoner, if they came that Way; but we mist of them, tho' we stay'd till 8 a Clock; and so when we came to London. Mr. Taylor was gone, and Plumridge was discharged. Then we went to Drury lane, to enquire after the other two, and hearing that two Street Robbers had been taken up, and sent to the Round-house; we went thither, but found two other Men there, who had endeavour'd to take the Prisoner and Buck ; but a Mob being rais'd by that Attempt, those 2 were committed for breeding a Riot.</p>

I went that Way again, and happening to see Buck's eldest Sister, who lodg'd in Drury-lane, I dog'd her to the White-Hart in * Baldwin's Gardens in Drury-lane, and there I found the Prisoner drinking; I sat down and talk'd, and play'd at Cards with him. He express'd some uneasiness that Buck stay'd so long; for Buck was gone out under Pretence to get his Wig powder'd. At last the Prisoner got up to go away. But one Mr. How stopp'd him. The Prisoner asked the Reason. Why, says Mr. How, I have got a Writ against you for 9 l. which you owe your Father-in-Law Thorowton Bocklingson for Board. O, says the Prisoner, if that's all, I don't mind that, and so he sat down again, and sung us a Song or two; after which a Coach was call'd, under Pretence of driving him to his Father-in-Law's in Rose-street ; but by the Way we was met by

            . Pointing told me, that Buck had informed against the Prisoner, and that the Prisoner would be at the White-Horse in Short's Gardens (not Ba'dwin's Gardens) in Drury lane : I went thither, and found him and Buck and Pember with Buck's Sister. I went and sat in another Box at first, and took no Notice of them. Buck made an Excuse to go out and get his Wig powder'd, and his Sister said. she was a hungry, and would go out and get a Pigeon Pye, or some such Thing; and so Pember and the Prisoner were left together, and they play'd a Game or 2 at Cards. After which the Prisoner got up and went to the Door, and wondred that Buck stay'd so long; he sat down again, but seem'd very uneasy. and got up a second time; upon which I took hold of him; he appeared much concern'd at it, and asked me what was the Matter? I told him, I had a Warrant against him for 9 l. due to his Father-in-Law for Board. He desired me to stay till Buck came back. I stay'd some Time; for I did not then know where Buck was gone to; but not coming I call'd a Coach, under Pretence of carrying the Prisoner to his Father's, for we were afraid of raising a Mob if it had been known that he was taken for a Street Robber. We had gone but a little Way before I saw Pointing following the Coach, and came to us in 3 or 4 Minutes.</p>

               <p>Court. How do you know it was the Day after? Hudson. Because then I heard Buck say, We robb'd Man yesterday of his Hat and Coat, and this Wig. C. Why, was Buck mad to speak of such a Thing publickly? H. He spoke it in a vapoueing way. C. Did the Prisoner hear him? H. I believe the Prisoner was not there then. Did not the Prisoner and Buck dine there on the Sunday? H. Yes, I think they came in about 2 a Clock, but I cannot be very positive, for I had lived at Mr. Winniat's but 3 or 4 Days at that Time. C. Did you carry in any Punch after Dinner? H. Yes, 2 Bowls. C. Did they eat together? H. Yes, c. And drink together? H. They were in the same Room. C. That's not the Question. H. I don't know that the Prisoner drank, I was to and again in the Shop. C. You shuffle! did they belong to one Company? H. To my thinking they did. C. Was any other Person in their Company? H. Another came in after Dinner, and I believe drank with them. C. How long did they stay? H. Till between 10 and 11 at Night. c. Did they go away both together? H. I think so. c. Do you know Plumridge ? Did the third Man drink Punch with them? H. They two went away about 9 and came again between 10 and 11, and another Man was with them; our Shop was then shut up, and they desired me to let them have half a Pint of Carraway, and said they would stay no longer than just to drink it; for they were going to take a Walk out. C. And could not you have said this at first, without shuffling? Where is your Master? H. Gone into the Country. C. When did he go? H. Last Sunday Night. C. And when do you expect him again? H. His Sister told me she had a Letter from him, and expected him next Monday Night.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I own I have been so unfortunate as to drink in Buck's Company, but I was not with him that Night the Robbery was committed. Buck and Pember both are Persons of the vilest Character.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jones, the City-Marshal. I have frequently found Buck in ill House, such as Debson's in the Old-Bailey, and I have often warn'd him to keep away, if he did not intend to come to the Gallows. Pember's Wife is as bad as can be; she's now in Newgate, and at present Pember himself has no visible Way of Livelihood. Brock and James make it their Business to take Rogues.</p>

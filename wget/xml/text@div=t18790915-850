                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Interpreted</hi>). I am an ordinary seaman on board the steamship Minora now in the docks—I know Palmer, and saw him on Wednesday, 6th August, about 12 o'clock, on board the Minora between decks with a little bottle like this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he put it down and went below when he saw me—he was a few yards from the store-room—I went and told the butler, and found in another place this bottle covered up new some cloths—the second mate came and then the steward—Mr. Graham and I went with them into the hold and there they saw 10 or 12 men, and among them Palmer—I said, "That is the man that took the little bottle'—it was dinner time when I came up on deck, and I saw the other two men—Baldock was intoxicated.</p>

                  </hi>. I am late steward of the Minora belonging to the British Steam Navigation Company—she arrived on Sunday, 3rd August, tod on the 6th, between 12 and 1, with the Custom House Officer, I went through the stock in the store closet for Customs purposes, and the Customs Officer afterwards sealed the door—the closet contained claret and spirits and ginger cordial—I identify this bottle of claret as being from my stores, and the whole of these other bottles (<hi rend="italic">Also produced</hi>) as the property of the British India Company—they were all perfectly safe between 12 and 1 on the 5th, and the door was locked—they commenced to discharge cargo on the 5th, and on the 6th 1 received this information between 11 and 12—I then examined the store-room, and found that two planks had been forced open—I sent to the Customs officer and he broke the seal, and on examin<lb></lb>ing the stock about 50 bottles were missing, and about 40 bottles were found hidden round the hold, about 10 full and the rest empty—the three capsules produced correspond with the bottles of ginger cordial, and this stopper fits an empty bottle found in the hold—I saw Palmer in the lower hold.</p>

I did not go down afterwards—I do not know that Baldock was not there on Tuesday—at the time the doer was sealed we could have seen if the planks had been started on the outside—they were started in the after part of the store-room bulkhead, far away from the door—the bulkhead was safe when We counted the bottles—the planks were forced with a crowbar—there were 13 workmen in the gang—during Tuesday night One of the officers and the whole of the native crew were on board, but they do not have access to between decks, the hatches are put on at night—I left the ship about 3.30 or 4 p.m.—the chief officer has the key of the hatches, and it takes two or three men to lift them—the men come to work at 8.30—I know nothing about their duties except Palmer.</p>

I am a warehouse keeper at B and K Jetty, Victoria Docks—the prisoners are employed as labourers for the dock company—only Palmer and Stratton were employed on 5th August, but on Wednesday, the 6th, all three were employed, and about 11.30 Baldock came to my office on the quay to ask for leave for the remainder of the day—he was under the influence of liquor—he said he had had some trouble the day before, and was rather excited—seeing his condi<lb></lb>tion I took him to the chief constable and gave him in charge, and saw</p>

               <p>him searched, and this glass stopper taken out of his pocket—we then called all the men out—I saw Palmer was under the influence of liquor—another stopper was found in Stratton's pocket—there were 13 men in cluding the prisoners.</p>

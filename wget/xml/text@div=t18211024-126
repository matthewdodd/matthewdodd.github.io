               <p>"What do you want?" he said "I have dropped some money down your area, I do not know whether it was silver or halfpence, for I had both in my pocket" - I told her to let him knock at the private door, she said she would go and look for his money - the young man went out of the shop door,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182110240059"></xptr>and my wife went down the area with a candle, to look for the money - she was gone in a few minutes - I got up myself to see what was the matter, as I had suspicion - I had no light except what came from the fire; I went to the shop window, listened, and heard some voices outside; the young man was saying "What is that, Ma'am, and what is this, what is that which looks white?" I thought something was going on not right - I waited a moment, and heard the asp of the door wriggle, as if somebody was coming in - in about a moment, the door opened, and a man came walking softly along - I let him pass half across the shop, he appeared to be going very gently into the parlour; I made a dart at him, and collared him, he tried to get from me, but I held him tight on the floor, and sung out for a light; he begged of me to let him get up, I said he should, and in the mean time, my wife came up with a light - I pushed him down and said "What have you come here for, you rascal," he said "I have come to buy a second-hand hat." I said, "You know I don't sell any such thing." I secured him, I am sure the door was shut, and on the latch, it was not left a-jar - his companion ran off when he heard the scuffle in the house - I went to the watch-house with him.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 28th of September, about a quarter past nine o'clock, I heard Watch! called near Seymour-place; I went, and saw a number of people in front of Mill's shop, I went in and found Mills holding the prisoner; he said he came in to rob the shop - I sprung my rattle; the prisoner said he came there to buy a second-hand hat, I asked what money he had to buy it, he said nine pence halfpenny, I found nine pence or nine pence halfpenny on him.</p>

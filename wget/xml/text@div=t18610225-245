                  </hi>. I am a commission agent, of 10, Trump-street, Cheap<lb></lb>side—in June last, I was agent to Joseph Marshall and Co. of Leeds, cloth merchants, and went to the premises of Gandell and Co. in Greenwich-street, which is in a line with the water—it is the premises marked C on this plan (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the under part, I believe, belongs to the copper company—I had never been there before—this gateway is the entrance to the premises—I think the entrance is in Greenwich-street, and not by a door in the gateway—the packing business was being carried on there—I did not see the prisoner on my first call, and I do not think I left any patterns—I called again, perhaps two or three days after, and saw the prisoner in his counting-house at the end of the warehouse—it looked out on the water—I took some patterns of blue cloth with me—I said that I had the pleasure of representing Joseph Marshall and Co., of Leeds, in the cloth trade, and showed him some patterns of blue cloth which I then had in my warehouse—I left them with him, and he asked me to come again in a day or two—I did not know his name at that time—I only knew him as Mr. Gandell—I had applied for Mr. Gandell, and I. was shown into the counting-house to him—that was the second time—the person I asked took me forward into the counting-house, and said, "There is Mr. Gandell"—I saw no other Mr. Gandell—the prisoner was the only party I saw at any time to have any conversation with—I called again in two or three days, and went into the counting-house—I never spoke to him in any place but the counting-house, and I do not think I ever went without asking for Mr. Gandell—he said on that occasion, "You can send in those pieces that you have"—I agreed to do so—I do not remember arranging at that time how they were to be paid for—when I sent them in he told roe he could buy a lot of goods for the market, such as black, and Oxford mixture, and brown. medley, and that he could do a large business for me—perhaps that was a day or two after I had agreed to send in the cloth—I told him the nature of the goods, and I think at that time he said he would buy the other goods of me if I could get up patterns of them—I got patterns up from Leeds, from Joseph Marshall and Co., and saw the prisoner about them in his counting-house—some of them were purchased, and he told me that he could buy a lot of goods for the China market, a class of goods we call Spanish stripes—I said that at present I had nothing in that way, except a small lot of eight and a quarter coloured cloths which I had, representing Thomas Conyers and Co., of Leeds, whose agent I was—I pulled the patterns out of my pocket, showed them to him, and I think I left him ten or twelve of them, and promised to call again—I saw him again a few days afterwards, and he said that he would take them—that was I should imagine, in the early part of June—I asked him for a reference, as I like to have a reference with any new customer—he gave me a reference to a house at Bradford, by word of mouth, and I think I wrote it in my</p>

               <p>pocket-book at the time; but will not swear to that—I then wrote to Marshall's, giving the reference—that was before I went about Conyers' goods—the reference the prisoner gave me when Coyners' goods were ordered, was at a house in Halifax—will you allow me to say that he may have written it on a small slip of paper, and given to me, but if so it was verbally as well—if it was given me merely by word of mouth, I should make a memorandum of it—whatever it was I communicated it to my principal—I said to the prisoner, when Conyers' goods were ordered, that my men were little men and preferred cash—he said that he could not pay cash, but he would accept a bill at four months from the date of the invoice—I agreed to that—we had agreed upon the price—I communicated the order to Conyers, and the goods were afterwards sent in direct from Leeds; not through me—it was after I got the reference and sent it into the country, that Marshall's goods were sent in; not many days after, but time enough to make inquiry—I recollect Mr. Conyers coming up to London—I do not think that was on 18th June, but it was on a Monday—the bill was drawn on the 18th—I went with him to the premises in Greenwich-street, and introduced him to the prisoner—I said, "Mr. Gandell, I have the pleasure of introducing Mr. Conyers, of Leeds, to you"—Mr. Conyers then said that he had brought up the bill for his acceptance, producing this bill—(an invoice had been sent in; that would go from Leeds, it was not produced at this interview)—the bill bore date 14th June, and was addressed "Messrs. Thomas Gandell and Co. 79, Thames-street, London"—the prisoner looked at it, and drew his pen through the word Thomas, saying, "We always accept as Gandell and Co.," but turning round to Mr. Conyers, he said, "It makes no difference, the firm is the same"—he made other alterations, but I only noticed his striking the pen through "Thomas"—the address is altered—he has introduced the words "Joiner's Hall-building, Upper Thames-street"—I know Mr. Conyers' writing—it is not his, and it is not mine—the prisoner then said he wished the bill re-drawn, and he would accept it—I did not notice whether anything was said about the date, but I see that the date is altered from the 14th to the 18th—Mr. Conyen then returned to ray warehouse, taking this with him.</p>

               <p>affair were Peeles of Bradford—I have known the firm of Gandell and Co. a long time, and I believed it to be the firm of Thomas Gandell and Co. when I first sent in the reference to Marshall's—I always knew the firm as Thomas Gandell and Co.—I never asked the prisoner what position he held in the firm—I had only known the firm as hot pressers and packers, never as merchants or consignees of goods—I had not known them to be carrying on the trade of exporters for more than three weeks or a month before I called on the prisoner—that was the first time in all these years that I heard that they were exporting goods—it did not strike me to ask the prisoner how long the firm had been engaged in exporting, or to ask whether it really was the firm of Thomas Gandell and Co. which was exporting—when I use the word "export," I mean selling as well as exporting—I have known other packers; there is Perrett and Watts—I never knew men engaged in the business of packing, ship goods on their own account, but perhaps, my Lord, you will allow me to make a remark; my first reason in calling on Gandell and Co. was that they had been concerned in packing goods to Hudson's Bay, and on that occasion they were trying to do a little business on the quiet—I should say it is not a common thing for packers to ship goods on their own account, but many people profess one trade and carry on another—whether light or wrong, I supposed that by carrying on the business of packers they were shipping on their own account, and that led me to apply to them—I think it was on the quiet something; out of their ordinary course of business—I should say Mr. Conyers came up to town a week or a fortnight after I had received the order for him—I cannot say exactly—the arrangement was that the bill was to be drawn from the date of the invoice—Mr. Conyers did not know the firm of Gandell and Co., my clients are not supposed to know all the firms I call on—I did not tell Conyers that they were doing a little shipping on the quiet—I do not know that I told him they were packers—I did not tell him that they were shippers—I gave him the reference—when he came to town I told him something, and took him to Thomas Gandell and Co. of Thames-street—I did not tell him who they were, I took him to see for himself, and I think he saw that they were packers—he must have known the nature of the order at that time, because he executed it—he was present at the presentation of the bill—there was only one conversation in reference to the bill—there is no drawer's name on this bill, but it is not a bill, it is a stamped piece of paper—I do not know that Thomas Gandell and Co. banked at the Bank of England—I saw a piece of paper on the prisoner's desk, with "Messrs. Price" on it, and I imagined that Messrs. Gandell banked at Sir Charles Price's, and I do not know whether he did not give me that reference—my impression is that he did bank at Price's—I cannot say that he gave a reference to Sir Charles Price—I never went to Sir Charles Price—I cannot say whether Mr. Conyers or myself presented this piece of paper, we were both together—we were both in the room when he scratched out the "Thomas"—I made no observation to the prisoner then—it was a momentary transaction—I will swear that the form of expression was," We do not accept as Thomas Gandell and Co."—I did not notice that he laid any emphasis on the word "we"—I did not hear at the time how long the firm had been shipping goods—I do not know since, that bills to the extent of about 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. have been met at Sir Charles Price's, certainly not; how am I to know t—I could not go into his private business—it is not likely that I could go to a person and find out what bills had been met—I know nothing of Thomas Gandell and Co.'s bankers—the prisoner on one occasion spoke to me about black cloth mixture, which, I understood</p>

               <p>him, was for the India market—I do not know that those goods are suitable for the India market, but shippers send out strange things sometimes—I believe that stripes are especially suited for the China market—it is a very light fabric of cloth—at the time when the "Thomas" was erased, the prisoner did not say that he had no authority to accept as Thomas Gandell, certainly not; you may take that down.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the bank of Sir Charles Price and Co.—the prisoner kept an account there—the signature to this affidavit is his, to the best of my belief—I have constantly seen his signatures, and acted on them—the acceptance to this bill "Gandell and Co." is in the prisoner's writing.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">The affidavit was here read: it was signed by the prisoner, and stated that his father, Thomas Gandell, for many years carried on business at Joiners' Hall, as "Thomas Gandell and Co." in whose name bills were usually accepted down to the present time; that he never represented him<lb></lb>self as the partner of Thomas Gandell, lately deceased, or that the goods purchased by him were purchased on the joint account, though it was possible</hi>

                  </hi>. I am in the employment of Messrs. Fresh field and New<lb></lb>man, solicitors to Messrs. Smith, Payne, and Smith—I attended at the ex<lb></lb>amination and examined the prisoner myself—I received this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from Smith, Payne, and Smith—it purports to come from George and Down<lb></lb>ing—I showed it to the prisoner when he was under his examination—it is not marked by the Commissioner. (<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LEWIS</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">contended that the prisoner was no party whatever to this letter, and therefore that it was not admissible. The Court was of opinion that as the prisoner interpreted that letter in his ex<lb></lb>amination, it was evidence against him. The letter was from Messrs. George and Downing to Messrs. Smith, Payne, and Smith: it stated that Edward Gandell was not a partner in the house of Gandell and Co., and had nothing to do with it; that Thomas Gandell was a gentleman of 87 years of age, and had for seven years carried on alone his business of a packer, his son, Edward Gandell, having been for years in his father's service at a weekly salary of 51 and that they were never in partnership.—Bills read: "London, June, 1860. Drawn on Messrs. Gandell and Co., Joiners' Hall-buildings, Upper Thames street, for </hi>109<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.,<hi rend="italic"> four months after date, payable at Sir Charles Price's and Co., bankers, London.

Thomas Gandell and Co., 79, Thames-street, London," altered to "Messrs. Gandell and Co., Joineri Hall-buildings, 79, Upper Thames-street."—<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi> contended that there was no forgery proved, forgery being either the false making of an instrument or the altering a genuine instrument with a view to prejudice another party, and that there was no evidence that this bill was a genuine instrument of the person whose name it bore</hi>. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LEWIS</hi> contended that the name of Gandell and Co. had been used for two years, and not for the purpose of fraud. <hi rend="smallCaps">THE COURT</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">considered that it was a question for the jury whether the prisoner led Mr. Conyers to believe that the new bill accepted by him was the acceptance of Thoman Gandell and Co., though they would not accept in that name, or of a firm who had no existence at all, but if he did it with the intention ta defraud, the offence was complete.</hi>

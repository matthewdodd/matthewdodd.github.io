On the morning of the 11th of April I was on duty; and as I went my rounds, my attention was directed to the shop of Mr. Richardson, a fishmonger, nearly at the top of Fleet-market, I found the door open, and, upon going in, I found two young men there. I went in, and asked what they did there - one ran away, and the other who was the prisoner, remained: as soon as I got inside, he shut the door, and struck me with his fist - I returned the blow, and was knocked down - I got up, and he took up a crow-bar which laid on the ground, and struck me with it; but before that, he said he would serve me out, and would do for me; he took this crow-bar (producing it,) and struck me with it on the head and arm - he struck me with it as I was against the wall; I happened to have a thick hat on, which stopped a good many of the blows, but I received one on the head about two inches long - my hat was off at that time. I received a blow on my arm by putting it up to defend my head; he used but one hand, and struck in this way (beating with it.) I received a wound on my arm, not quite an inch long - I was obliged to go to the hospital, and remained there a month and three days; my head was entirely all over blood.</p>
               <p>Q. On recovering yourself, what did you do - A. I asked him for mercy - he told me to sit on the block, and if I moved, it would be worse for me. He ran away - I followed his out, and sprung my rattle, and kept him in sight till he turned the corner of Stonecutter-street. Four or five more watchmen came to my assistance, and in four or five minutes he was brought to me - I knew him again - I caught sight of him as soon as I turned the corner of Stonecutter-street - nobody but him was running before me - he was stopped just by Robin-hood-court, Shoe-lane, by a watchman of St. Andrew's. I examined the fishmonger's shop, and found the crow-bar there. I felt the effects of my wound in about an hour, and went to the hospital about six o'clock that morning. I was ordered to bed, and my head dressed - I felt great inconvenience from it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ANDREWS. Q. At what time did it happen - 
               <persName id="t18240603-197-person1695">A. </persName>
            At a quarter or twenty minutes before five o'clock - he shut the door upon me - they were both in the shop when the door was shut - I was alarmed very much, but did not lose my recollection - there was no light there - it was daylight; the back door was open, and I had plenty of light; I saw him take the crow-bar off the floor.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to state that you were possessed of your senses sufficiently to know the manner in which he struck you - A. Yes; he struck me with one hand, and the sharp end of the crow-bar turned towards my head - the dresser of the hospital saw me about five minutes after I got there; I attended before the Alderman the second day after it happened.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. We understood you to say that you saw two men, one ran away and the other stopped in - A. Yes, my Lord - he went away directly after the door was shut; I and the prisoner were then left alone; I saw no marks of violence on the door; the lock had been sprung; the crow-bar did not appear to me to have been used to get in with.</p>

             - I am shopman to Mr. Richardson, fishmonger, Fleet-market. On Saturday the 10th of April, I locked up the shop, and left 13 s. and some odd halfpence in the drawer, and on Monday I found a large hole in the wall - the plaster was knocked off - the wall communicated with the linendraper's shop next door - I found a dark lantern, and a small crow-bar, in the shop, and gave them to my master - these are them (looking at them) - I looked into the drawer, and the money was gone - the shop-door had been locked, but not the drawer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Does any body sleep in the shop - A. No; I left about ten o'clock at night, and did not hear of this till Monday.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was the hole made through the wall - A. Not quite, my Lord; there were one or two bricks out.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see him several times? - A. Yes; in the course of the day, pretty late, I went to the Bank; my landlord lives at the Bank; his name is Banks; I suppose I staid half an hour talking to Mr. Banks; afterwards I came out, and there I saw the prisoner in my way; I then was going home; there is a piece of ground, where there has been an old brewhouse; since it has been pulled down, it is a ruinous place; now I happened to cross out of <placeName id="t18040912-9-crimeloc53">Long-lane</placeName>

               <p>Q. You gave him the very same? - A. Yes; the next morning I went down to Lambeth-street, and laid an information that I had lost so and so; they said they would apprehend the man, and send for me at Frogwell-court, where I lived, and that week they did not find the man; then I went to Shadwell office, and saw Mr. Brown; he told me he knew the man very well, and it was very likely he should find him in a few days; I never saw the prisoner from that time till Mr. Brown came and told me.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he is the man? - A. I am very positive; I have known him five years back; I I cannot be mistaken in him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was it night or day when I robbed you? - A. Night.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the night? - A. It might be after ten o'clock or near ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you coming from the Bank at that time? - A. Let me be coming from wherever I might, you robbed me of that money, or notes however.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. At what time of night was it? - A. It was between nine and ten o'clock; I cannot say to a minute; after I got into my own place, and had lost these notes, I heard the clock strike ten; a little after I came out of the Bank, I stopped about an hour with an acquaintance I happened to meet.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I must ask you whether you were sober? - A. I was as perfectly sober as I am now.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not been drinking? - A. No.</p>

             sworn. - Q. Are you the person that took up the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you take him? - A. On the 20th of July, in Ratcliff-highway; I and Oliver; I said to Oliver, there is a man that I want for a foot-pad robbery; we immediately went after him till such time as I lost sight of him; he ran down an alley; the other officer perceived that he got into a public-house; he went after him another way, and just as he got into the public-house he nodded his head to me; when I got to the public-house, the prisoner ran away; I crossed to the other side of the way, and there I saw him go into a pawnbroker's shop; I followed him and then he went into another pawnbroker's shop; I immediately followed, and looked through the window, and knew it was the man; I have known him several years; I called to him; he answered to the name of Slater; I said, Slater, you must go with me; then I told him what I wanted him for; I secured him between eight and nine o'clock at night; I told him it was for robbing Mr. Briant, about nine or ten months ago; I took down a sketch of what Mr. Briant said when he came to me; it was for a 5 l. note and six 1 l. notes, by a person of the name of Slater; I told the prosecutor to make himself easy; when he came to inform me, I said, I shall<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180409120016"></xptr>get him, he works at coal-heaving or ballast-heaving; after I apprehended him, Briant came down and swore he was the man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. You have known me for a hard-working man? - A. You have been taken up for having two wives.</p>
               <p>Q. I never was taken before a Magistrate in my life? - A. I know you, and I have heard you were gone to Ireland.</p>
               <p>JOHN OLIVER sworn. - I was along with Mr. Brown at the time the prisoner was apprehended.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord, my prosecutor I know by sight; I have been always a hard working man, he is a false-swearing dangerous man; he asked me if I belonged to a press-gang; I said I did not; I said to him, what do you ask me such a question for; said he, I have got such a house since the death of my wife (he was a publican), there is a dangerous set of men that use my house, I am afraid I shall lose it; and he said to me, you know Pat Dunn, the press-master, I will send them all to sea, and by that means I shall gain the cause. I have nobody to speak for me, I leave myself to the mercy of the Court.</p>
               <p>Jury. (To the prosecutor.) Q. Was it dark or light? - A. It was a star-light night.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>The prisoner brought this hat to pledge with me, on the 8th of last November, I believe; I have no memorandum; he had four shillings in pledge.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It is my hat I believe, to the best of my knowledge, by the buckle; I cannot positively swear it is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp, Prisoner's Counsel, to Prosecutor. When did you first lose those hats? - The goods were moved the 14th of November; and I went before the magistrate fourteen days after.</p>
               <p>Had the prisoner done work for you before? - He had.</p>
               <p>Was there any account subsisting between him and you, for work done? - There was; we had not settled our account; I think if the balance was properly settled, I should owe him nothing; I objected to his bill, and would not pay it.</p>
               <p>Was you served with a subpoena? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was that before he was taken up? - Yes, I believe it was.</p>
               <p>How long after this, did you charge the prisoner with this offence? - Two or three days after this subpoena was served.</p>
               <p>What time was there between the time that these goods were removed, and the time you received this subpoena? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Was it a week? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Was it two days? - It might be.</p>
               <p>Was it more or less? - It might; I cannot say; the prisoner told me he had taken the hats out of the cart, and he could not deny it.</p>
               <p>Did you get the duplicates from him? - I did.</p>
               <p>How long after that, did you charge this man? - Two or three days.</p>
               <p>Court. When was it that this conversation passed, that you talk of? - It might be ten or twelve days; Carter said he took the hats, and the prisoner said the man has got his hats again.</p>
               <p>Have not you offered if he would give<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179001130079"></xptr>you a release from the debt, to give him a release? - I have not; I do not know what a release means.</p>
               <p>Have not you promised to forgive him, if he would forgive you? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you not know now, that there is a release preparing? - I have heard such a talk not half an hour ago.</p>

               <p>I removed the things for Mr. Baillie, and I had the hats, and I pawned them: Mr. Baillie promised never to trouble me; then several days after, I could get no settlement, and I served him with a writ; then he served me with a warrant, and took me to the justice.</p>

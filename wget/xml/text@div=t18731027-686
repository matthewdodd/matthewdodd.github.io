I am Superintendent of the Telegraph Construction and Maintenance Company, Limited, at Enderely's Wharf, Greenwich—the prisoner was employed by Messrs.

I reside in Greenwich, and am a labourer—I was in the service of the contractors on Tuesday and Wednesday, the 16th and 17th September last—I saw the prisoner every hour of the day, I was working with him—the dinner hour was at 1 o'clock—I saw him on those days about that time—he was near the tanks where we have our dinner, about 100 yards from the erection shop—I then saw him fetch out a bundle aud walk away from the tanks—it was wrapped up in a white cloth—it looked like brass bearings, but I did not see them—he had the parcel under his jacket—he took it off the premises and took it up the bank at the back of the river at the front entrance of the premises—the gate porter is stationed right against the gate at the little office—the prisoner went out there—on the Wednesday he left me at dinner time and said he was going to get a can of water—about 5 o'clock he went against the tanks and fetched out a bundle, and there was a piece of wood there, and he laid his coat and the bundle down to the aide of it—I did not see what it was that day—on the Friday I watched him—he left meand went and got a can of water, and after he got it he went straight towards the stony building, and I saw him go into it, and when he came back he brought out a parcel with him and went behind the tanks—I went in to see what it was, and it was a brass bearing—I saw him go into the same place at night when we knocked off, about 6 o'clock, I followed him in, and when he was coming out I said "Barlow, you had better turn that game up, if you do not you will get some of us transported," and he told me it was a bit of wood, and I said "I know what it is, I have been watching you."</p>

            . I have known the prisoner ever since he was born. The prosecutrix beat, cut, and haggled him; then he took a copy of a writ against her. I told him she would get the better of him; then she took a warrant for him, my husband and other neighbours bailed him. In less than seven days after that, she got another man to take another warrant against him, but he had no money to see a lawyer. When he was in gaol, a poor man went with a bit of victuals to him; she took that man up, and swore a robbery against him. I believe the prisoner is as honest a lad as ever was; he lodged with me three weeks, I have trusted him with pounds; he has been come from Ireland but about three years.</p>

            . I have known him going on two years. I was present at the time this affair happened; he came home a little in liquor; I do not know the time exactly, but it is better than a quarter of a year ago; he was not capable of talking, he has an impediment in his speech. There was a great company of lodgers there, they made game of him; he laid hold of the fire-shovel, and was running after some of them; and some of them took hold of the shovel, and took it out of his hand. The prosecutrix desired him to go about his business, and not to make a disturbance. He took up the scraping shovel, and a man took it out of his hand, he did not take it out of the house; I do not think Ann<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176201140008"></xptr> Hardy was present at the time. I saw nothing of the tea ken. Mrs. Carrene struck him three or four times. Then he resisted, and struck her again. She staggered, and fell.</p>

At half-past one o'clock on Saturday, the 28th of August, I was at dinner—Mosely came into the shop with the two pri<lb></lb>soners, and said, in their presence, that they had taken a piece of bacon—I believe this produced to be the bacon—it is my master's—I had put it in the window where they took it from—it was broken in the leg—I cut it out myself—I had seen it safe at twelve o'clock.</p>

                  <hi rend="largeCaps">DANIEL MOSELY</hi>. I saw the prisoners in Goswell-street—Hill went to the shop, and took a piece of bacon from the inner shelf, he put it on some fowls, and went away then—in two or three minutes they both came back together—Chelsea then tried to put the bacon under her cloak, but by doing so she knocked down a duck—she then put the duck and bacon in the place where Hill had put it—they went away—I went to dinner, came out again, and saw Hill again go up to the window, and then the bacon had been put back again on the shelf—Hill removed it, and put it on the fowls —Chelsea took it, put it under her cloak, and walked a few yards—Hill was still at the shop, looking at other things—Chelsea turned back and went to her—I took them and the bacon into the shop.</p>

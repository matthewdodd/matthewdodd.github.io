On Friday, the 19th of March, I suspected him, and when he was going home, about half-past six or seven o'clock. I challenged him with having taken away some brass work, and asked where he had sold the brass work which he took on the Friday before - it was merely by accident I mentioned Friday; I had no particular knowledge of Friday; he appeared at first a little confused - I said, "I desire to know to whom you sold them;" I repeated the question two or three times very rapidly, and he said to Mr. Everard, or some such name, in the New-cut: I then asked where he had sold the brass work on the Tuesday before - he said he did not take anyon the Tuesday before; I said, "I mean the Tuesday before that" - he replied, "I sold them in Whitecross-street;" he named the shop, but I do not think he named the person - I then took him up stairs to the warehouse, to a chair which had the castors taken off, and said, "Where did you sell the castors off this chair?" he said, "I sold them to Lambert, (and somebody) in the New-cut" - I then took him to another chair, a sofa, and a set of dining-tables, which had had castors fixed to them; we lost a variety of articles of the description in the indictment, worth more than 4l. or 5l.; he had a private examination before Sir John Perring next day, at Guildhall - I found some castors and brass fork-fastenings at a house in the New-cut, by means of a search-warrant, and brought them away: I fitted them on the legs of a table - they corresponded with the screws, which were left on the table.</p>


               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARRSON. Q. Did it not strike you that the people who bought them were the worst of the two? A. No, it did not - our foreman, Richardson, was present at the conversation; I certainly said to the prisoner, "I know all about it - tell me where you sold them;" I did not say it was of no use to deny it - I put down what I meant to say to him before I went in; he is an orphan, and was brought to our house by his uncle; who had served us with great propriety.</p>

            . I am shopman to Messrs. Everet and Lambert, of the New-cut and Charles-street, Long-acre. -The prisoner brought some old brass to sell two or three times; he used to bring about 3lbs. at a time - we allowed 4d. a lb.; it was old brass.</p>
               <p>Q. That had been injured by wear? A. Yes, injured by wear, and broken likewise; I did not ask how he came by it, as persons frequently bring in brass. and have articles in exchange - we paid him for this; I do not think I have dealt with him more than three or four times - I never asked what he was, or were he came from - Mr. Wilkinson and an officer went into our foundry, with a search-warrant, and brought out some fork-fastenings and old castors: I told him a lad brought them - he asked if I knew the lad; I said Yes, by his coming to the shop - the brass could not be used till re-melted; I swear that - the castors were broken.</p>
               <p>Q. They did not appear as if they had been just taken off good furniture? A. No - some of the table - fork fastenings were correct, two or three of them, but those were not brought altogether.</p>
               <p>Q. You observed at the time that they were correct? A. No; when they were put on the desk I went to them, and was surprised to see it; they must be lacquered again before they are fit for use - I have not been in the business more than three months, not with Everet and Lambert -I have been with brass-founders; some of the castors were not broken, they were not fresh - they must be lacquered again.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. I think I heard you drop that your master keeps a foundry? A. Yes; we melt the brass over again - we do not keep a marine-store shop, but are brass-founders; we do not buy for lacquering, but for melting.</p>
               <p>Q. From boys like the prisoner? A. Yes; I do not suppose more than three castors would go to 1 lb. - they were broken: they might be compared with the tables, by the screw holes.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose Mr. Wilkinson was to tell us they were bran new, and of the best character, would that be true? A. No, they were broken - none of the articles delivered to Mr. Wilkinson were new; they were dirty - I own two or three were new, but they were brought with other old brass; the castors appear to have been worn - they are broken at the screw-hole; it did not strike me that they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183004150035"></xptr>had been torn from a chair - I thought they had been worn off; they could have new ones for the price it would take to do them up - we sell some new ones at 11d. a set of four, but I do not know what these claw castors are worth; I did not hear Mr. Wilkinson threaten to take me or my masters into custody as receivers.</p>

            . I am an officer of Union-hall I went with Mr. Wilkinson to Lambert and Co.'s, Newcut, and found some articles which he claimed; I saw Clark - he said be bought them of the prisoner, who was then in custody; I found about 3lbs. - there was a great deal of old brass, which Mr. Wilkinson could not swear to, but Clark said he bought them of the prisoner; Mr. Wilkinson claimed more, but only desired me to bring these away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you left the best behind? A. No; they are bent, just as if prepared for the forge, but are quite new brass - there is no doubt some are quite new, and not bent at all; nobody could doubt about their being new brass, if he saw it by itself.</p>
               <p>MR. WILKINSON. I have no doubt of this being our brass work; we should not send fastenings of this description to be melted as old brass, but these which are bent we should; I dare say we had some bent in our possession, but that is always locked up; these have been taken off furniture in our ware-room - we lost all the fastenings from every table we have in the house; I must say that Everet and Co., as soon as I went there, said there was no need for a search-warrant, I might search every where I liked.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were all the castors on your chairs quite new? A. Some chairs had been made three or four years - they had never been worn, except moving about the warehouse; the brass forks could not he bent, or they would not go into the tables - when these were bent I cannot tell: we lost some castors worth 15s. or 16s. a set, and some at about 2s. 6d. or 2s. - none of them would be worth only 4d. a pound as new, but very few except three or four sets would be of use till new lacquered.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Must not the prisoner have been many hours taking these castors off the furniture? A. He must have been several; we have a variety of rooms, where he rubbed the furniture - all the castors were taken from a room where we keep furniture which we lend for parties.</p>
               <p>Two witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

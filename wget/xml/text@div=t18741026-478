                  </hi>. I am superintendent of labour at Poplar workhouse—the prisoner was an inmate there and liable to do stone breaking duty—he had been an inmate on four or five other occasions and was perfectly aware what was necessary to be done—on 1st October, about 12.45, I was in the stone yard and the prisoner was breaking stones with this hammer (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he asked me how it was that I had ordered him that work to do—I told him that he was able to do it, and he had better get on with it; and turned round to walk away—after walking a few steps I received a blow on the back of my head—I staggered 4 or 5 yards, fell heavily on my face and rolled over on my side—the prisoner then ran up to me with the hammer uplifted in both hands and said "I shall settle you"—I called out "Help!" and "Murder!" and McAuliff seized the prisoner who said to me "You b——I will murder you yet"—I got up and called Merrick and he and McAuliff brought the prisoner across the yard—I followed and the prisoner again said that he would murder me; that was two or three minutes after the first observation.</p>

                  </hi>. I was inmate of the Poplar Union—it was the prisoner's duty to scrub the rooms on 30th September, but he refused—he said to me at 8 o'clock "I shall do no work and if I have to break ten bushels of stones to-morrow, I shall settle Bannon"—on the next morning October 1st I saw the prisoner in the stone shed speaking to Bannon who turned and walked away, and the prisoner came out of the shed took his hammer in both hands and struck Bannon on the head with it—he swung it round like this (<hi rend="italic">from his left shoulder</hi>)—I am not left handed. (<hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I <hi rend="italic">done</hi> it with my right hand.) Bannon staggered and called "Help!"—I ran to him as he was reeling and he fell—when the prisoner got up to him he had the hammer raised in his hand to give him another blow on the head, but I wrested it from him—Bannon had fallen and got up quickly and was reeling again—the prisoner turned round to Bannon and said "I will do for you yet"—I went across with the prisoner to Merrick the porter, and then saw the prisoner in the shed with the handle of another hammer in his hand, I don't know how the top came off of it—Merrick said "Put that down"—he did so, and Merrick and I took him to the Master's office, and as Bannon followed some distance behind the prisoner turned round and said to him "I will murder you yet."</p>

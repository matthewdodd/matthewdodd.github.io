               <p>Q. Had you seen the knife before he got outside the door? A. Yes, my Lord - when I saw the knife coming I drew back, and it only scratched me down the cheek; when I drew back, the knife fell again outside the door -I put my hand to the left side of my face, and found a great quantity of blood flowing from the side of my face; he then instantly picked up the knife, and ran away down Great George-street - our house is at the Park end of Great George-street; when the knife fell outside the door I retreated back two or three yards, and said to my mistress, "I am stabbed" - while I was saying that, he was in the act of picking up the knife; mistress said, "Go and call the watchman" - I instantly went out, and he had got round the corner by Princes-court; he had turned short to the right from Prince-court into Princes-street - the back door which he had gone out of is in Princes-court; I first saw him crossing the road in George-street - that was within a minute of the time I had lost sight of him; he was walking very deliberately - I had to pass Allen, the watchman; I caught hold of him by the arm, and said, "That man has stabbed me," and pointed him out to Allen - his box is against Storey's-gate; I said, "That is the man, come along with me" - I ran on, and Allen followed me, springing his rattle all the way; I pursued him till he got to the corner of Little George-street, and there he slipped down over some orange peel, or something - I then told the watchman to make haste; he took him into custody - I said, "Take care, he has got a knife - mind he don't stab you;" the watchman took him to the watch-house: some gentlemen told me to come and have my wounds dressed before I went to the warehouse, which I did - I then went to St. Margaret's watch-house, and found him; my wounds have been healed only two days ago - I was not attended by a surgeon.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you stabbed before you took hold of him to do any thing? A.

               <p>GENERAL TONIJOS. In 1823 I was in command of part of the Constitutional Army, near Spain; the prisoner was in the first regiment - I have seen him several times in this country: I knew him in Spain - he was then of sound mind; the officer of his regiment wrote to me, giving him a good character; I saw him a few months after in England, and then thought his mind very much altered - about a month ago he called on me to offer his services as a shoemaker; I concluded from his manner and way of speaking that he was a very different man to what I had known him before, from his actions and general manner, and the impression on my mind at the time was that he was not sound in mind, as such I did not employ him</p>

            . I am a Spanish refugee. I have known the prisoner in this country since 1824 - in my judgment he was of sound mind when I first knew him, which was at Gibraltar, but his mind as been very different since; I believe sometimes he does not know right from wrong -I have known him sleep in the fields for more than fifty nights, when I have offered him my own lodging, but he refused it; I have ordered him to make me a pair of boots, and on going to him I have not got an answer for ten or fourteen weeks - he has got into a violent passion on my going for them, and told me to leave his room in a violent manner and said all the Spaniards wanted to murder him -I have procured him work, and found him the materials; he has afterwards returned both the materials and money, saying he would not work - he bore the character of a mild humane man.</p>

               <p>V. NOGUES. I have known the prisoner since he arrived in this country, in 1825. In my judgment he has not been of sound mind for about the last year; my landlord has invited him to dine and sleep at his house - instead of that he has gone and slept in the fields; I know that myself, and six or seven months ago he hired a lodging and did not sleep at it for two nights - I saw him almost every day; he has come to dine with me and my landlord, and before dinner was over he has left the room, gone out, and not returned - he has done this frequently; the last time was three or four days before he was taken into custody: I believe he was not of sound mind then, for he left in an abrupt manner, when we were eating - two days before that my landlord offered him a shirt and a handkerchief - after looking at them he went away without them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. These were acts of kindness to him? A. Yes, on account of his poverty; no offence was given to him - he left without any cause.</p>

            . I live in Phoenix-street. The prisoner lodged with me for twelve months four or five years ago - I believe at times he was not of sound mind; after he had been at our house two or three months, he brought down his pot of shoemakers' paste, and said to my wife,"I imagine, Madam, this has offended you;" she asked him why, he said he did not know in what manner, and immediately threw it over the house; my wife had said nothing to him about it - I have got many people to order shoes of him; he has bought the leather, kept it a week, then took it back to the person not touched, though he has paid for the leather out of his own pocket - a person lent him 30s. for the materials to make a pair of boots - he kept the money a fortnight, then brought it to me, and told me the Spaniards would not allow him to make boots for the English - at other times he has appeared rational; he then appeared humane and gentle.</p>

            . I am a Spaniard, and a merchant of this City. I have seen the prisoner at my house at times - I know he has been much distressed in circumstances lately; I have not known him long, but think occasionally he was not of sound mind - he has begged of me in a manner, which no one in his senses would have done; this impression was made on my mind long before this charge.</p>

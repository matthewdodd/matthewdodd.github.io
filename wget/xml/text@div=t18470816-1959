                  </hi> I am a perfumer, and live at Bristol—I deal with Mr. Burton, of Greek-street, Soho—on the 19th of Jan. I paid the prisoner 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., on his account.</p>

                  </hi> I am a perfumer and live in Greek-street—the prisoner was my traveller—it was part of his duty to receive money, and account for it on his return—Mr. Cridiford and Mr. Alder were my customers—the prisoner never accounted to me for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. received from Mr. Cridiford—he brought me a bill of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there is nobody but me to whom he could have accounted—there was 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. due from Mr. Alder to me—the prisoner paid me 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is it usual to allow 10 per cent. on perfumery? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He had a discretionary power to sell, at 5 per cent. or 10 per cent., or to sell at net cash, but all he received he was to account to me for—he was not</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184708160222"></xptr>

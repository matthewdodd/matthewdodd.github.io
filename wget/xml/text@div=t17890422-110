            ? - Not particularly.</p>
               <p>Do you know there is such a person? - When I was in Holland, he was at the Hague.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing where he is now, or what he is now? - No.</p>
               <p>Then you speak of only what you know when you was in Holland; where did you buy that sword? - I bought this sword at Mr. Yorke's in Cavendish-street, facing Mansfield-street, going out of Portman-Place up towards Marybone, next to a General's.</p>
               <p>Can you recollect the General's name, if you hear it? was it Mansfield or Brown? - No, neither of those names.</p>
               <p>What did you give for that sword? - I gave 14 s. for that sword, and a pair of buckles, but I reckoned the sword worth 17 s.</p>
               <p>What became of the sword? - I went into Mr. Alexander's house, and had a glass of gin; it was a publick-house, so when I came in, and paid for my gin, the man of the house said to them, this is the man that took up Jem Poles; I went along the tap-room, says he, you Jew thief,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178904220103"></xptr>get out of the tap-room; through this, as there was a great many Irish people there, I thought to myself it was time for me to go, because there was bad words there, and I went out, and forgot my sword; as I had been used to have the sword under my arm, from Mansfield-street, I had not been above six minutes, or at the most ten minutes, before I missed the sword; I went back to the house.</p>

               <p>Where is Alexander's house? - Almost the middle of Monmouth-street, the Spread Eagle; I went back again, says I, Gentlemen, you may make a joke of it, but I do not mind paying a gallon, or half a gallon of beer if they would return me my sword; the landlord says, did not I say he would come back to lay it on some one or other? the prisoner was in the room, but I cannot swear he took the sword; I was used very ill in the house; I was glad to get out of the neighbourhood, if the sword had been worth 100 l.; the prisoner was in the room, but I cannot swear who took the sword.</p>
               <p>What day was this you lost the sword? - The first or second of April, I cannot tell very well.</p>
               <p>What time of the day? - It was in the evening, about six or seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>What sort of a sword was it? - It was mounted with steel, outside and inside, twisted with silver; it was very handsome before they broke it.</p>
               <p>Should you know the sword again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>(The sword produced.)</p>
               <p>This is the sword.</p>
               <p>What do you know it by? - This here was out, and I thought to have something put in, and sell it at a shop.</p>
               <p>Are you sure this is the sword? - I am.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I know nothing of the man; I was that day looking for a job, I called at this publick-house, there were two men sitting in the box; I sat down, and drank a pint of beer, one man calls me out; he says, Bellamy, here is a pawnbroker's ticket, I will be glad if you will take care of it; I never saw the Jew nor the sword 'till I saw him at the office.</p>
               <p>Where did you get the sword you pawned at Davis's? - I never pawned any.</p>

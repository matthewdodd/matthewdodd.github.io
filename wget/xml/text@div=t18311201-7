On the 15th of November, about half past eleven o'clock, I left my house - I was the last person there, and locked the door; I returned about a quarter-past twelve, and found the door as I had left it, but before I entered I observed the ground floor window open - I had left it fastened with a little button inside; I am sure it was fastened - it could be opened by putting a knife through the casement; it consists of one large pane, sufficient to admit the body of a man: when I entered my room, which is on the ground floor, I missed from my bed, two blankets, two sheets, a counterpane, two pillows and cases, a pair of stays, an apron, a cap and a night-jacket; I take in washing, and am single - I locked my door, and fetched a constable, who took me to the watch-house, where I found the prisoner; he took me to the prisoner's house, No. 33. Gardener's-lane, and there we found the whole of the property - this was an hour or an hour and a half after it happened; the counterpane and one sheet were under the bed - the other sheet, two pillows and two blankets on the bed, and the prisoner's wife had got my night-jacket on; the property is worth 1l.; I have seen the prisoner come to and fro to a house in Queen-street, but only knew him by sight.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. Mrs. Hutton came to me on the night in question; before that I had seen the prisoner at the corner of York-street, about two hundred yards from her house - he had a bundle of things, which he carried loose in his arms; he was going in a direction from Tothill-street; I soon afterwards saw Mrs. Hutton, and from what she said I gave information to a constable, and saw the prisoner in custody in about an hour or an hour and a half - I went to his house in Gardener's-lane, York-street, and found under the bed a sheet and counterpane, and on the bed two blankets, a sheet, and two pillows and cases - on the prisoner's wife I found a night jacket, a pair of stays, and an apron; she was in bed - Mrs. Hutton claimed them; the prisoner's wife said, in his presence, that she did not know how the things came there, but that they were there; the bundle I saw him with appeared to be things of this description - he dropped something in York-street, and stopped to take it up.</p>

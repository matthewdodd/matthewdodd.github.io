            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in Long-acre. All these things were pawned by the prisoner, on Monday, between one and two o'clock; I asked if they were her own - she said they were, and told me what they cost. I have known her three or four years.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). The prosecutrix was in the habit of lending me things to pawn. I went on this night, and as she did not come in, finding her box open, I took them to pawn, meaning to return them on Saturday night, as usual.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH CROPPER re-examined. I once let her pawn two articles, but she did not, last Monday, say any thing about it, nor did I give her leave to take them.</p>

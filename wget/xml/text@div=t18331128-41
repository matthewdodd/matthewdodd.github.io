On the 24th of October, the prisoner came to the shop alone; she asked to see some kerseymere, which my fellow shopman showed her; I did not see her come in, but I saw her in the shop, and I saw her take the remnant of kerseymere while my fellow shopman was gone to the till; the prisoner did not see me; I went behind another counter; I waited about a minute; I then jumped over the counter; I took hold of her arms, and held them tight; I believe the kerseymere was under her left arm; I took her into the middle of the shop; I then released her arm, and the kerseymere fell from under her cloak; I called my employer and got the officer - she at first denied that she had it, but afterwards she acknowledged it, and begged my employer to forgive her.</p>

             (police-constable C 130). I was called in; the prisoner was charged with stealing this<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183311280038"></xptr>article; she begged for mercy; here is the other piece which she had bought.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). I confess I did go to the prosecutor's shop, and purchase half a yard of brown cloth, and paid 2s. 9d. for the same, and was only waiting for 3d. out of 3s., when I was charged with taking the kerseymere. I declare before God, and you, gentlemen, I did not see it, until it was found upon the floor, near the spot I then stood; how it came there I cannot account for.</p>

I had a clock in my bake-house, which I saw safe between eleven and twelve o'clock on Saturday night, the 30th of September, after my bake-house was shut up- I missed it the next day; the prisoner was my servant, but I discharged him about three weeks before; I went and took the clock from his lodgings on the Monday - he was not at home; I took him about two hours afterwards - I made him no promise or threat, but he said he would tell me the truth, that he did not take it, but he had received it.</p>

            . I lived with Johnson. I went down into the bake-house on Saturday night, the 30th of September, about twelve o'clock - I saw the doors safe, and returned to bed; in the morning I missed the clock. I saw the prisoner standing near the bake-house-door, about half-past eleven o'clock on the Saturday night, in conversation with one of the lodgers.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Are you a servant of Johnson's now? A. No - I am in the same shop, but another person keeps it. I went to the prisoner's lodging with Ross.</p>

            . I was occasionally employed by Mr. Johnson. The prisoner came to me on the Sunday morning, and said he had been to Johnson, and taken the ticker - he said he wanted some other persons to go with him, but they had got drunk; he came to me in the clubroom the same afternoon, and showed me the bisuit-dockers; he was then drunk, but he was sober in the morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you ever discharged by Mr. Johnson? A. No; I only went there for an occasional job - there was no dispute about any claim. I gave the information on the Monday; the biscuit-dockers were there till the Tuesday morning - I am now out of a situation; I had worked for Johnson on the Saturday, and left his house about half-past four o'clock; I did not work there that night, nor did I see May.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the Friday, May, the foreman, came to me, and said he wanted to take the clock, as Mr. Johnson would not pay his wages; we were then drinking together, and he wanted me to take it; I said I did not like to do so; he then said he would go and shove the door open, but I did not like to go in - May then said,"Go stand at the post," and I did; some person brought me the clock - May tried to sell it, but could not. I then took it to my own room.</p>

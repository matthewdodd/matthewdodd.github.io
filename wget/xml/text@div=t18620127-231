                  </hi>. I am a grocer, of Chiswick—on 21st December, about half-past 9 in the evening, Hefferan, to the best of my belief, came there for half an ounce of tobacco, which came to three-halfpence—he tendered me a half-crown—I noticed that it was bad before I took it up—I told him so—I marked it—he said that he did not know that it was bad, and asked me for it—I refused to give it up—he asked me whether I would give it up to his father—I said, "No"—I would not give him the tobacco—I gave the half-crown to the constable.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a beer-shop at Chiswick, near to Mr. Florey's—on Saturday, 21st December, Hefferan came as near half-past 9 as possible, with Harrington and a man he called his father—they had some beer, and paid for it with a good half-crown, and went away—on Christmas eve Smith and Harrington came, and Harrington called for a pint of ale—she threw down half-a-crown—I gave it to my little boy John to go and get change, as I doubted it—while the boy was absent, Harrington ordered a second pint—she asked the boy when he came back for her change—he said he could not get it as it was bad, but he did not bring it back—Mr. Wright, the beadle, then came—Hefferan came and looked in, and I told Wright that that was the man who was with them on Saturday night—Hefferan was then brought in, and they were all kept till a policeman came, and then given into custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Smith. Q.</hi> What made you have suspicions? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because I had had word sent to me, and I had taken a bad florin that evening—I suspected it directly, as it was thrown down in the shade of a quart pot—she came into the dark corner—you were not with her on the Saturday night.</p>

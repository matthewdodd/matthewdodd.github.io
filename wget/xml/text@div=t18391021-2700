                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Henry Muggeridge a corn-dealer, in Doctor's Commons; Holyhead was his foreman, Arber deals with Mr. Muggeridge. On the 15th of October, Arber came with his cart—he 'came into the warehouse—Holyhead was standing close by me—he said, "I suppose you want a sack of oats? "—he said he did—Holyhead went into a cellar below to get the sack of oats—Arber went to his cart, and got an empty sack—Holyhead shot the oats into the sack, and they both assisted in putting the sack into the cart—they then came and went to the desk, and Holyhead asked him if he would sign the book, which was usual—they both went to the desk, but did nothing of the kind—there is a book on purpose to be signed—when they came from the desk, Arber asked Holyhead if he would have some gin—he said, he did not care if he did, and they went to a public-house—I went to the desk to see if the book was signed, and it was not—it is here—things are always entered in this book before they go out of the warehouse.</p>

                  </hi>. Henry Muggeridge is my brother. The oats be<lb></lb>long to him—Holyhead was his foreman—Arber dealt with us—when any thing is purchased, a ticket is given, and the book is signed by the ven<lb></lb>dor, and the vendee too—Holyhead was cautioned never to let a gram go without getting a signature—no account has been returned to us abort the oats—they have never been paid for—I never saw Arber on the 154 of October—he never had credit—he always paid ready money.</p>

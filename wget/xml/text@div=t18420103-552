                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, and carry on business in Great James-street, Bedford-row. I had a communication with the prisoner on the subject of some varnish which belonged to Mr. William Montgomery—I had no authority from Mr. Montgomery to part with the varnish—I ultimately sold the prisoner 197 gallons of it, on a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill drawn by one John Carr on a person named Barnes, accepted by Barnes, endorsed by Carr, to one Gabriel, from Gabriel to the prisoner, and from the prisoner to Mr. William Montgomery, and the sum of 28<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on his own promis<lb></lb>sory note, and 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to be paid in cash—that was the final arrangement—what took place between the prisoner and me was before that—I gave a delivery order for the goods on the second communication on that day—the prisoner was to have the goods on the morning of the 8th, if he paid 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in money on the evening of the 7th, and on that I directed Mr. Scott Montgomery to deliver him the varnish—the order to deliver was not in writing, but verbal—there was no order in writing delivered to Mr. Scott Montgomery—I delivered a list of the goods to him, and told him to deli<lb></lb>ver those goods that were put in the list—that passed in the prisoner's presence—the prisoner did not pay me the 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the evening of the 7th—I have got a 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque here.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184201030122"></xptr>
               <p>is his varnish, and only his—I know his handwriting—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a paper</hi>)—this is his writing—it begins, "Mr. Price Humphreys bought of Field and Montgomery."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you, then, mean to represent that this is Mr. William Montgo<lb></lb>mery's property? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; not Field and Montgomery's—Field was a former partner of Mr. Montgomery's—this purports to be a bill of parcels of 197 gallons of varnish, making Price Humphreys debtor, and Field and Montgomery creditors—that is not the price of the goods I have men<lb></lb>tioned—this is 114lbs. at 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the amount here is 123<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I have seen this paper before—these are my figures on it—I saw this for the first time on the morning of the 7th—I saw Mr. William Montgomery on this subject about ten days or a fortnight before the 7th—I saw him in my own office—I believe Mr. Field was in London at that time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Pray, in case you should not recover the value of these goods, do you hold yourself personally liable? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I do not consider myself liable, from any act of mine, for the value of these goods, or any part of them—I do not consider that Mr. William Montgomery would have a claim on me for parting with the goods without his authority—I under<lb></lb>stand Mr. Scott Montgomery is a distant relation of Mr. William Mont<lb></lb>gomery's—I did not, on the prisoner's promise to pay the cash that night, draw out an order and deliver it to Mr. Scott Montgomery—I drew up a list, but not an order.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. I am using your own words. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> Then this is the way to take it, for this is the fact; I gave Mr. Scott Montgomery the list of the goods, and at the same time directed him to deliver those goods, and I suppose that is what is called making up the order, or draw<lb></lb>ing it—if they have put it down too short I am very sorry for it—when the prisoner came to me on the 7th, he produced the bill endorsed by Mr. Gabriel—Mr. William Montgomery told me that the prisoner had given references to three persons before this transaction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the prisoner offer to give you his bill for 73<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. as well as the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill endorsed by Gabriel? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If that makes up the 123<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., he did offer me that, and that I declined—I offered, on that occasion, to take his promissory-note for 28<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and to deliver him 125 gallons of varnish out of the 197—I sent him to Mr. Scott Montgomery to get it—Mr. William Montgomery was a starch manufacturer at Belfast before he came to London, and entered into partnership with Mr. Field, who was a varnish manufacturer—that partnership terminated on the 28th of October—this varnish had been partnership property—it became otherwise by Mr. William Montgomery's appropriating it to his own use, under what he considered the terms of the old partnership deed—legally it must be consi<lb></lb>dered partnership property up to the day of the severance—I cannot point out any particular portion of the deed which entitled Mr. William Mont<lb></lb>gomery to appropriate it to himself—all the deed must be taken, and a legal construction put upon it—I should say it was almost an intricate question—when the partnership terminated, the accounts were to be made up in a certain way; and Mr. Montgomery, who supplied all the capital, was to take his capital out first, and therefore he took this—I think it may be called a question of construction of some nicety, because there is no par<lb></lb>ticularity in the deed—in no construction could it be said to belong to Mr. Field—this varnish was kept in the loft of an unused stable in Mr. Em<lb></lb>merson Tennent's mews—Mr. William Montgomery is a voter of Belfast;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184201030123"></xptr>
               <p>and I believe it is very commonly the case for all Members of Parliament to grant any favours their constituents ask—I took the prisoner's promis<lb></lb>sory-note to Mr. William Montgomery, for 28<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and have got it now—it is not due yet—I also took the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill endorsed by Gabriel, and have got that—that is not yet due—I took no other instrument from him—I have produced the cheque for 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that is the whole of the security I held or have held—on his giving me the bill for 28<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., I sent him to Mr. Scott Montgomery to get the goods—he returned with Mr. Scott Montgomery, who said that Mr. Emmerson Tennent would not be teased with it, and he would not let part go without the whole—I had no direc<lb></lb>tions from Mr. William Montgomery to deliver the goods to him on receiv<lb></lb>ing his promissory-note for 73<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill—not at any time—on his leaving town he told me to act as I thought best—when the pri<lb></lb>soner came on the second occasion he left roe the 28<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill till the morning—I kept it for the purpose of his getting the goods—I did not keep it ex<lb></lb>actly on finding that he could not get the goods, it made part of the con<lb></lb>tinued bargain—when he came the second time I negociated for the whole, when I found Mr. Tennent would not part with part.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the prisoner at any time agree to take the whole of you, and pay it by giving the difference in money, or a cheque post-dated two or three days? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He offered me a cheque, not post-dated two or three days, I think—I never agreed to such terms—he offered me a cheque, which I re<lb></lb>fused—I forget whether he proposed that it should be dated two or three days in advance—I cannot undertake to swear he did not—he did not pro<lb></lb>mise me a cheque dated two or three days in advance, nor did I on that endorse another order, on the order I had given him to Mr. Scott Mont<lb></lb>gomery for the 125 gallons—I gave Scott Montgomery the list because he asked me for it, for the purpose of attending with Mr. Humphreys next morning to deliver to him the things according to the list—he would not have got it just the same without receiving the list from me, because there was no one to deliver it to him—Mr. Tennent would not give the key to anybody but Scott Montgomery—he asked me for the list—I do not know why he wanted it</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was the good of copying out a list of the different articles, if he was to have the whole? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I really cannot tell what the good was—I suppose he wanted to be particular to deliver the goods that were to be delivered—I did not send word to Mr. Scott Montgomery not to deliver the goods, upon finding I did not receive the money over-night, because I did not expect he would deliver them till I sent him word that I had received the money.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then why give him authority to deliver them next morning? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was already a cavil about it—the prisoner promised me solemnly that he would send me the money, and, to save the time of running back<lb></lb>wards and forwards such a distance, I thought it would be as well to give Mr. Scott Montgomery authority to deliver the goods—he ought not to have delivered them till he knew I had received the money—I did not tell him so, but he heard the conversation that took place, which was quite sufficient for him to understand that he was not to deliver the goods unless he knew I had received the money—I did not give him any directions, but the conversation he heard between the prisoner and myself amounted to the whole of that, and very much more—it was, that the goods were not to be passed into the prisoner's possession unless he paid to me, that night</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184201030124"></xptr>
               <p>36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash—the prisoner obtained the goods on the 8th of December, and I applied for a warrant against him, I think on the 14th—not for felony—it was rather curious; I attended at Queen-square for the purpose of get<lb></lb>ting a warrant against him for having got these things by false pretences; after urging the charge for some time with the Magistrate, the clerk said to me, "Sir, you need not wait; all the witnesses have given evidence, and I will give you the warrant"—and, to my great surprise, I found it was a warrant for larceny; and on speaking to the clerk about it, he said, "It is my opinion that it is a larceny, and not a false pretence"—I never had the warrant for larceny in my possession—I did not know that it was a warrant for larceny till I saw it un the Magistrate's table after the prisoner was committed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you, after you had applied for the warrant, take any steps of any kind to compromise the matter with the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I did not, but I took steps apparently of a compromise for the purpose of catching the prisoner, by writing a letter that I thought would bring him to my office, or bring him into my power somehow, so as to catch him in some way or other—I had previously had an interview with Mr. Scott Montgomery about a proposition made by him to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did Mr. Scott Montgomery tell you that he had arranged that the prisoner should give an acceptance of a Mr. Richards for 73<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., making with the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the 123<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He did not tell me he had made an arrangement—he told me what the prisoner had said to him about such offers—he said a Mr. Richards, who kept the Fox public-house in Oxford-street, had been proposed as a security by the prisoner, and he himself had been there to make inquiry, and had learnt that this person kept a sort of gambling kind of house; therefore his license was not likely to be granted again, that he was about to get 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for his house, and go abroad—he told me that, when he told me of the interview which had taken place between the prisoner and himself with a view to a compromise—after this I offered to accept Richards as one of the prisoner's bail at Queen-square, because I, in fact, wanted only the one respectable man who was offered—I certainly offered to accept Richards as the other, and my reason for so doing was this, finding one a very respectable man I was unwilling to keep the prisoner in prison—I was not willing at that time to accept any portion of the varnish that was undisposed of, nor to exchange wine for the varnish—that was part of my proposition, but it never entered my head except as a bait—this letter is my handwriting.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long was it after the prisoner got the varnish away that you wrote the letter to him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A great many days after.</p>

Q.</hi> You declined the account on the 13th? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On the 14th, I think, I wrote to him, declining the account, but I cannot re<lb></lb>member the day—above 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of his passed through our hands from the 3rd of November to the 20th.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there a payment of 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to begin the account? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—he paid in by different sums, and drew out—it was not one amount, and then drawn down.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was the largest balance you had? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> For part of a day we may have had 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the largest balance at the close of a day was 89<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there was an arrangement between him and the Bank about not overdrawing the account.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARRSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you enter into the arrangement with him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He made a promise on opening the account that he would not overdraw it—those promises are not very religiously kept at times—we took him as a customer, because he had kept an account at Wright's—we allow interest on a balance, in deposit accounts—the account was opened on the 3rd of November—it is not closed yet—there is a balance now.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARK SON</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">put in the document, purporting to be a bill of parcels, of Field and Montgomery, referred to in the evidence; and read the letter from Mr. Loaden to the prisoner, as follows</hi>:—"Sir, your conduct has been of that character, relative to the purchase of the varnish, that I have as yet contemplated no other course than proceeding against you criminally; but Mr. Scott Montgomery has at last induced me to listen to a proposition made by you to him. I will, on the part of Mr. William Montgomery, accept the acceptance of Mr. Richards for 73<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., making, with the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill I now have, the original sum of 123<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., on which I will return your own promissory note; or I will take whatever varnish is unsold, or I will take wine. After giving you these facilities for settling the matter, I shall expect an immediate reply. In a failure of a satisfactory one, I shall adopt the measures which the law affords.")</p>

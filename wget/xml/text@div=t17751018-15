I expected she was killed, though she was very forward in calf. I made enquiry after her, but I heard nothing of her till Saturday morning; then I heard there was a carcase to be sold at one Mr. Massey's in Whitechappel, which had been killed at the slaughter-house of the widow Hunt, in George-street, Spittal-fields. I went to the slaughter-house, there I saw the hyde of my cow; it was a black cow, with grissle hairs; it had a mark upon the horn, which was in part rased off.</p>

            . I keep a slaughter-house: the prisoner came to me on the tenth of August, about three o'clock in the afternoon, and asked me to let him kill a cow at my slaughter-house. I said he might; and asked him what time he should bring it; whether he would bring it at dusk. He said no; it was very wild; that the weavers would be just done work, and it would be fine sport for the boys for three or four hours. Then I asked him what time he would bring it. He said at eleven at night, and then all would be still. I went to bed between ten and eleven, and my daughter sat up for him. I heard him come in at five in the morning. I got up at six. He had killed it, and was then taking the hide off. It was a cow very forward in calf. I did not take<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177510180016"></xptr> notice of the colour of the hide. At about four o'clock on Saturday morning, he came with a porter, a horse, two hampers, and a basket; and took away all the carcase but the hide and the feet. He took away only the offal on Friday morning. When I went to market on Saturday morning, Massey asked me if a cow had been killed at my house; and said, Mr. Stapp had lost one. I told him there had, and that the hide was at my house.</p>

             the Younger. Did the skin that Stapp owned belong to the cow that was brought by the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Hunt. It did. The cow appeared to be very same.</p>

               <p>I was coming from the country; I met a farmer with some beasts; I helped him on. I bought the cow of him for five pounds; the farmer's name is May. There were two men present at the time; I advertised for the two men; they did appear, and promised to be here.</p>

               <p>Benjamine Cross. I am a butcher, and live at Shoreditch: the prisoner is a butcher: he lived with me as a servant fourteen months; there could not be a better servant for sobriety and honesty.</p>
               <p>Q. How long ago did he leave your service?</p>
               <p>Cross. About thirteen months; he lived with a person in the same street.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it usual to kill cows when they are with calf?</p>
               <p>Cross. Yes, the very day before they would calve.</p>

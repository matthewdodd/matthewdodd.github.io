                  </hi>. I am a warehouseman in the employment of Mr. William Tegg, of Pancras-lane—on Friday night, 13th November, I looked over the warehouse—I kept the key in my possession—everything was safe—on the following morning I found everything in the warehouse as usual—the lacks were unaffected; but on opening the door and going into the counting-house, I found that four of the desks were thrown back; one desk had been forced—the contents were strewn all about the place—in the inner counting-house, Mr. Tegg's, I there discovered that the drawers had been opened, and also the private case in his counting-house, and some books had been brought into the inner counting-house—there was a skylight in the general counting-house; from that sky-light were suspended two cords the night before—the skylight was not opened the night before—there is one window opened to let the air in, but this was fastened the night before—the window had been up, and the cord put through the open window.</p>

You sold a book in the Waterloo-road," and he said, "I did not"—I said, "Well, I shall take you for breaking the premises of Messrs. Tegg. You perfectly understand the charge I make against you? You did sell that book," and he said, "I did"—I said, "Well, which am I to believe I did you, or did you not?"—he said, "I did not"—at the station the charge was read over to him, and he said, "I did not sell the book."</p>

I thought of going back again, but fell down in the Court, for I was a little in for't. The Prisoner came to me, and took my Watch out of my Fob. I resisted what I could, and got up, but she threw me down again, and took a Buckle out of my Shoe, and then ran away. I lost 5 s. and 6 d. but I won't swear that she took that.</p>

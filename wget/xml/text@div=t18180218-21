On the morning of the 2d of February, about half-past eight o'clock, I remember taking some plate into the kitchen, and leaving it on a table near the window, which was shut and fastened - I missed the articles stated in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181802180009"></xptr>indictment about twelve-the window was still fastened as I had left it. The kitchen door leads into the garden, it was latched, I tried it not two minutes before I left the kitchen. My husband was out from ten until four o'clock, and the servant was up stairs all the while with me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. MARSHAM. I have only one servant. There is only one kitchen window and one door, which communicates with the passage - You pass through another kitchen into the garden-there is a kitchen on each side of the passage. I have no children. The kitchen door, leading into the garden, was latched, but it could be opened on the outside.</p>
               <p>THOMAS ADKINS. I am headborough of Hackney, in the parish of Stoke Newington. On the 2d of February, about eleven o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner coming over a gate, with something coacealed under his coat - He was coming in a direction from the prosecutor's house, and going towards Shacklewell - I followed him, and asked him what he had there? he said, "what do you want?" and ran off; I called out, stop thief! and pursued him. When I first saw him, there was a man waiting at the gate near him-the man said nothing to me; the prisoner ran until he came to Hobson's brick-field, when Newell stopped him. I took him into custody, he had not then got any thing about him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far is the gate from the house - A. About fifty yards, and about 150 or 200 from the brick-field-it is by the road side; the brick-fields are by Shacklewell, there are two or there turnings to them. The prisoner was talking to the man, and they both went away together. I did not pursue the other man.</p>
               <p>JOHN NEWELL. I am a brickmaker. I was working in Hobson's brick-field, a little after eleven o'clock, and heard the cry of stop thief, I saw several persons running, the prisoner was the foremost - I was before him, and pursued towards him; when I got within five yards of him I saw him pull his hand from under his coat, and throw several things into the cesspool, they looked like silver they only had two or three feet to fall-there were several different things; I caught him immediately, close to the cesspool, and told Strutton, who came up, what he had done; I held the prisoner while he searched the cesspool, and saw him pull the silver table and other spoons, and sugar-tongs, out. The prosecutor's house is in the parish of St. Mary, Stoke Newington.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I am sure he is the man. I assisted in taking him to the office; as we went he said, I could not say that he stole the spoons.</p>
               <p>THOMAS STRUTTON. I am a brickmaker. I joined in pursuit of the prisoner, and saw Newell take him; I came up just as he took him - He was not in my sight when he threw the spoons away. Newell said, in the prisoner's presence, that he had thrown the spoons into the cesspool; I searched, and found five tea, two table, and two salt-spoons, and a pair of sugar-tongs, all silver, which I gave to Rutterforth.</p>

               <p>JAMES TIMMS. I am a brickmaker. I saw Strutton find the things in the cesspool; after he was gone I found a silver tea-spoon in it of the same pattern as the others.</p>
               <p>GEORGE RUTTERFORTH. I am a constable. The property was delivered me. The prosecutor's house is in the parish of St. Mary, Stoke Newington.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I ran with the mob, and they took me. I am innocent.</p>

I had the keeping of my husband's money; I kept it in the top chest of drawers, in my bed-room, locked up; I put it in the drawer between one and two o'clock on Monday the 28th of December, the day it was lost. I did not miss it till the Saturday following; I had no occasion to go to the drawer for money before; I have never seen the money since.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason have you to charge the prisoner? - A. By the manner of her going away. She left the house the Monday night, the same day that the money was missed; she wanted to go very much, and I asked it of her as a favour to stay, if it was only for a fortnight, and I would handsomely reward her; at last, she said she would stay till tomorrow. Just after, she went up stairs and fetched her bundle down, and insisted on going that night. She confessed it afterwards before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell her it would be better for her if she confessed? - A. Yes, I did.</p>

               <p>Mr. Justice Heath. There is no legal evidence to affect the prisoner; it is a very suspicious case certainly; there are some very strange circumstances.</p>

               <p>Hutcherson. I have went with him, and staid at the door 'till he has came out, and he has told me that he had sold it; I know he told me he had received two shillings for work, of this man, and he has 2 s. due to him still.</p>

            . On Tuesday the 24th of April, my master came into the shop where I and the evidence work; he said he would turn the prisoner out of doors, and then said to the evidence, he would give him a new suit of cloaths, and some other things, if he would swear against him. I am an apprentice to my master, and have been eighteen months: master said he had nothing to alledge against the prisoner, he always gave Wyre a good character. My master and mistress have often said, there was not a viler rogue ever lived than Hutcherson.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This last evidence is a very careless, saucy, impudent fellow.</p>
               <p>Q. to Horn. How much could the prisoner earn a week ?</p>
               <p>Horn. He was talk'd at 18 s. a week, and he has got 3 s. over.</p>

               <p>Upon the trial, the substance of the case as far as it relates to the prisoner, was that he applied to the prosecutor, a pawnbroker, and bargained for a watch of the price of eighteen guineas, and then produced this Bill of Exchange, alledging it to be a Bath Bank Bill; there appeared upon it an indorsement in the name of B. M'Carty; upon the prosecutor's enquiring who he was, he said he was

                  Barnard

            , he said that he had indorsed that Bill, and that the letter B. and names M'Carty was his indorsement; and he likewise sent to Beaty and Co. to know whether this was a good Bill or not, they said it is a very good Bill, and will be paid when it comes due; when that was transacted, the prosecutor took this Bill for the watch, that was for the eighteen guineas he paid, besides the eleven pound two shillings which was the difference supposing this Bill of Exchange had been a good and genuine Bill, and the prosecutor gave him a receipt in the name of M'Carty.</p>
               <p>Upon his defence, divers witnesses were called, who proved that there was really such a man M'Carty, and that this indorsement was the handwriting of that M'Carty. It was referred to the Jury to consider, whether they believed that the fact was so or not, and the Jury, were satisfied, whatever opinion they might have of the transaction itself, however dishonest that might be, they were of opinion, that in fact there was such a man as

            , and that the name B. M'Carty upon this Bill, was of the handwriting of that M'Carty; therefore it came to a consideration if they found the prisoner guilty under these circumstances, but with reference to the opinion of the Judges, whether this amounted to the crime of forgery, or to the crime of uttering a forged Bill knowing it to be forged.</p>
               <p>Upon the first day of the last term there were eleven Judges present, who took this matter into their consideration, and they were of opinion, that in point of law the prisoner was not guilty of the offence charged upon him, for they were of opinion that there must be a forgery. The Act of Parliament, of the 2d of George I. says, that if any person shall falsely make a forge or counterfeit, or cause to be made, forged or counterfeited any indorsement upon any Bill of Exchange, or shall utter any forged indorsment upon such Bill of Exchange, that it shall be felony without benefit of clergy. Then they were of opinion, the foundation of the whole must be a forgery, whereas in this case, there was really such a person in existence as B. M'Carty, and that B. M'Carty in his own hand, writing made the indorsement upon the Bill Therefore however corrupt and wicked this combination might have been (it perhaps may come before the Jury in a different mode sometime or other) they were of opinion they could not find it felony, they must take the matter as it stood; so this being the hand writing of a real M'Carty in whose favour the Bill was drawn they were of opinion there was no forgery and consequently that the prisoner <rs id="t17820220-32-verdict158" type="verdictDescription">

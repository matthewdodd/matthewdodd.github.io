               <p>Inform the Jury what injury was done to your house in the night of Wednesday the 7th of June? - I left both my houses, a publick-house an d flop-shop. When I saw them again the next day they were like a ship that is cast away upon a rock. The doors, windows, wainscoting, the bar, and every thing, were all torn to pieces.</p>
               <p>When you left your house was it entire? - Yes; I left them between ten and eleven o'clock on Wednesday night, both houses were then entire.</p>

               <p>I have been these six months under an affliction, for which I was discharged from the third regiment of guards. Since I have been in Clerkenwell, nobody has been admitted to see me there; therefore I could not so much as send to my regiment for my character. I have lost the use of my arm; it is so bad that I cannot bear to do any thing; I am obliged to hold my hand before me as I walk the streets, for fear any body should touch it, for if any thing touches it, it goes to my heart.</p>

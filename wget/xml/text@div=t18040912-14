               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Had you said any thing to induce him to say how he came by it - that it would be better for him if he would tell? - A. I do not recollect any such conversation; I have no doubt where it came from; it came out of one of the chests in our warehouse, which the prisoner had been fastening up; he had been just doing that as the officer came in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine that chest to see if any thing had been missed there? - A. I did; there did appear to be a deficiency.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at all weigh the bark to see whether there was the quantity or not? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. He had lived with you three or four years? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He came into the house with a good character? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - Mr. Pistor applied to me about five o'clock on the 20th of July, and I went to his house; the prisoner at the bar opened the door, and I went into the accompting-house; Mr. Pistor called him in; I observed his handkerchief in his waistcoat; I said, that is an awkward place to put an handkerchief; upon which he pulled his coat off, and threw it on a chair; I examined the coat, and found the bark in one of the pockets; I produce the coat as well as the bark; I was ordered to keep the coat and the bark too.</p>
               <p>Q.(To the prosecutor.) Is that the same kind of bark you had in the warehouse? - A. Yes, it is red Peruvian bark; it is very scarce; it is worth about twelve shillings a pound.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his Counsel, and called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

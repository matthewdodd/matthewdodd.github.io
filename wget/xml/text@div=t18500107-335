On 29th Dec, about half-past six o'clock, I was on duty in St. Petersburg-place, Bayswater—I saw a boy carrying a bundle on his shoulder—he was coming in a direction from Mr. Churchill's, and going towards the Bayswater-road—he gave me some account as to how he became possessed of the bundle—I saw that it con<lb></lb>tained two half-quartern loaves, and about three pounds of cooked and uncooked mutton, half a pound of butter, about six ounces of bacon, six pieces</p>

                  </hi>. I am a medical publisher. The prisoner lived in my service, as cook, about two months—her wages were 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—on the evening of 19th Dec. I saw the policeman, who gave me some information in the prisoner's presence—she and the boy and the policeman were all standing together—I said to the policeman, "You must take them off"—the prisoner then said she hoped I would be merciful to her—I could not undertake to swear to these articles—I had such articles in my house—the prisoner had no authority to give any of these things away—the loaves were not cut.</p>

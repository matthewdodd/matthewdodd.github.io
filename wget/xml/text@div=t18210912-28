On the 7th of September I employed the prisoner for a day's work - I had a brown paper parcel in the back-parlour, on the bureau, containing 17 l. About seven o'clock in the evening he was there, having his tea; I opened it, and took out 15 s. while I was having my own tea, and left it open on the bureau - I was attending the customers in the shop, and he was alone in the back-parlour - I went in, and was going to put the parcel away, and missed a 5 s. piece, and upon counting it, I missed a sovereign and a half sovereign; I sent for a constable, privately, before he came, the prisoner went down stairs into the area - I watched him, and heard him rattling money, as if he was moving it from one pocket to the other. I kept him employed till the constable came. The constable searched, and found the money - one sovereign, a half sovereign, and a 5 s. piece, in his pocket - there was a mark on the half sovereign, by which I knew it; nobody but him could take it. The servant went into the parlour to fetch the tea up, I stood at the parlour door at the time - she could not have taken it.</p>

            . I am a constable. I searched him, and found a sovereign, a half sovereign, and a 5 s. piece, and about 10 s. besides. Knapp identified the half sovereign, and claimed the sovereign and 5 s. piece. The prisoner said he changed a sovereign, and that was part of the change.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a brush-maker, and live in Mark-lane. The prisoner was my clerk—he had been so nearly three years and a-half—in August last I left town on business, and returned about the 3rd of December—I left the prisoner in charge of my business—he was authorized to receive money—it was his duty to keep my books, and enter the accounts—before I left him, I discovered some little irregularity, which I spoke about—he said it was an oversight, and it was passed over in cones<lb></lb>quence of his saying he would keep the books better in future—I had a customer of the name of William Frederick Smith, a mealman, at Uxbridge, and another named Palmer, at Hertford—on my return I looked at my books—I found they were all in confusion—there were no accounts kept at all—the prisoner had not accounted to me for 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. received from Mr. Smith before I left town, and he has never accounted for it since; nor for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. received of Mr. Palmer, of Hertford, or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. received from Mr. House.</p>

               <p>—was for sums received from me, and some other small items—I said I would take 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I had no idea of this embezzlement then—I received a letter from a person offering an acceptance of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I answered that letter—a person came and offered to be security for the prisoner but I found my accounts so confused—he brought this person, who asked what the amount would be—I said, "20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he said, would I accept the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said I would, little dreaming there would be any embezzlement found—I did not offer to take the acceptance at six months—I agreed to take the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the 23rd of December.</p>

            . The prisoner came to my shop, on the 7th of September, and asked to see a gold ring. I shewed her one, and while I was reaching for my scales, she snatched one from the card. I stopped her, and took it out of her hand: then she said she was going to shew it to her sister, that was over the way. I said, hussey, you came in with a pretence to buy a ring, and instead of that, you have stole one. She told me her sister lived in Spittal-fields, and her sister's name: (The ring produced in court). I have enquired after the prisoner's character, and find she bears a very good one; and her friends believe it to be her first fact.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she seem to be going to run off?</p>
               <p>Wood. No.</p>

               <p>My sister was over the way, at a public-house, and said she wanted to buy a ring; I did not go into the shop with intent to rob him of a pin.</p>

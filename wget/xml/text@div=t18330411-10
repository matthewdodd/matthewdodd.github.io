            . I am a silversmith, and lodge at the prosecutor's house. On the night of the 6th of March, about half-past eight o'clock, as I came home, I saw a young man walk from the window, and put these articles very carefully under his arm; he had received the articles from the window - I had suspicion, went to the parlour window, which was wide open, and saw the prisoner in the parlour; I said, "Pray what do you do there?" he made no answer, but jumped out - I grasped at him, but missed him; he ran into the next street; I never lost sight of him - I called the Policeman, and saw him catch him; the other got away with the things - he turned two corners, and I might have lost sight of him for a moment, but not more - the gas threw a light on him in the parlour, and I know his features also.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.What distance was I from the Policeman when he caught me? A. At the end of Britannia-street - you was taken about one hundred and fifty yards from the house; I cannot say the exact distance.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I was on duty between eight and nine o'clock on the evening of the 6th of March, in Britannia-street - I heard the cry of Stop thief! I saw the prisoner running, and the last witness running after him; I caught him in my arms, took him back to the house, searched him, and found one shilling and sixpence on him; the window was open, and violence had been used to it by a crow-bar or chisel.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. How far did you take me back to the witness? A. I held you in Britannia-street till he came up.</p>

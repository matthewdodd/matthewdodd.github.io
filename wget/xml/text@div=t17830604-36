               <p>I am a man that deals in harnesses, what you call a broker.</p>
               <p>How did you come by the two harnesses that were found in your house? - I generally go out of mornings, I had been out that morning at Lord Paget's and Lord Grosvenor's; the prisoner came to my wife when I was out to sell these harnesses, but I came in before he went away, and he asked me to buy them; I said, if they are honestly come by, he said they were, and he had more; I said, if they are not, come no more here; he went away, I took the harnesses up stairs and took out the ornament piece, which is Tibbs and Davis; says I, I will go to Mr. Mountain, and find out who they are; in the mean time came in these two men to enquire about them; I told them, I had a pair of harnesses just come in that I believed were them.</p>
               <p>Court to Spreadbury. Did he tell you so? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Riley. My intention was to take and seek among my customers; before I set down to dinner these two men came in, and I shewed them to them, and went to the Red Hart, and the prisoner went by, and we pursued him down to my house, and there he was taken.</p>
               <p>You are sure the prisoner was the man that brought them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. You have justified yourself very fully? - I have my Lord, I can tell a thousand stories, and tell them upright; an<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178306040050"></xptr> honest man need not mind how he tells his stories; have you done with me.</p>
               <p>Court. Yes.</p>
               <p>(The harnesses deposed to.)</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I was in the yard, it was full of people at the same time I went there, and I went home the next morning; in Fleet-market I met the man with these harnesses, he asked me fourteen shillings for them, I bade him nine and gave him ten; I went and fetched the remainder, and they took me up, I did not know they were stolen, I was in the yard.</p>
               <p>Court. Is the man here that you bought them of? - I have people to my character, I am just come from sea.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner called two witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

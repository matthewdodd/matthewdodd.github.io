               <p>How old are the children? - The eldest is a boy of eight years old, and goes to a boarding-school, and comes home at night; I had the care of the plate, it was in the drawer in Mr. Payne's bed-room, there was all the plate mentioned in the indictment (repeating them) in the drawer, and a silver milk-pot, which was not inserted in the indictment, because it was found in the garden we thought it not necessary. I was in the garden with my master and found the cream pot; I did not know the cream-pot to be his property; I know all the other plate; the cream-pot had not been used while I was there, all the rest of the plate had. My mistress came down the next afternoon to enquire after the plate, it was all gone.</p>
               <p>When was the last time you saw it? - The whole of it I saw on the 13th of September, 1778. On the 19th of March, 1779, my mistress came and dined at the house, on which I used the table-spoons and put them in the drawer again. The prisoner used to wash at our house; there are two pair of stairs to the house; the stairs leading to my mistress's room open into the garden; she might step over the pales and come in there; that room is kept for my mistress's use; there is no one else lies in that part of the house. The last time the prisoner washed for us was on the eighth of February; we found half a dozen tea-spoons and a pair of salts at a pawnbroker's. The prisoner acknowledged at Sir

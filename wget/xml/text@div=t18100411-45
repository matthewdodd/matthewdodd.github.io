            . I am a patrol. On the 17th of March, about three o'clock, I was going down Greenwood-court, Nightingale-lane; I thought I heard a voice; I went to Mary Burton's door, and being dark, I was dubious of going in; I ran to the end of the court, and called the watchman to bring me his light and directly I entered the door I saw Mary

I saw the prisoner, I asked her if that was the man, she said, yes, take him away, he will murder me; I took him in custody after he had dressed himself. The prisoner was meared with blood partly, as much as she was; I had no opportunity of seeing whether he was wounded or not. This is the fork, as it is supposed, this is the corner of her mouth, and this is the corner of her ear; I took it off the bed; it is in spirits.</p>

            . I am a surgeon and man-midwife. About three o'clock in the morning, in the middle of last month, I was called to attend Mary Burton; I went to her house, I saw her all over blood; I found she had received several wounds on the face, and on the side of her neck they were most of them superficial wounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe the wounds upon her face first of all - A. Both the lips, the right side of the mouth was partly gone, it appeared to have been torn off, the cheek was very much lacerated and, confused, the integument on the left there were marks of teeth; on the right it had not penetrated at all. The margin of the left ear had been very much torn. On the right side of the neck she seemed to have a wound made, I judged from a fork, one of the prongs had penetrated a little better than an inch; there were no wounds of any importance on the right side; there was a wound which might have been done with a fork, or it might have been done with a pointed instrument, it had penetrated about an inch.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there two punctures or only one - A. There were two punctures, they were so near together they appeared to have been done with a fork. She was scratched as if he had been using his nails. There were two or three other punctures, the depth of them were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181004110033"></xptr>about the tenth part of an inch.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the worst wound that I understand from you was this wound that had penetrated about an inch - A. Yes. It was in a mascular part of the neck; I did not perceive it of any great danger.</p>
               <p>Q. You say there were two punctures there, were they of equal depth - A. No, one was very trifling; I found a difficulty in introducing the probe.</p>
               <p>Q. Then none of the wounds arising from this pointed instrument were dangerous - A. No, not at that time; I could not foresee what inflammation might arise.</p>
               <p>Q. From where did this hemorrage arise - A. From the lip, I think.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The prosecutrix had lived with me fourteen days, and on this night we were both half intoxicated, we went home together, and afterwards went out again to other public houses, and had more drink; I was very much intoxicated; we went to bed together; she bit my finger, here is the mark; she catched hold of me in a tender part, and I, feeling great pain, did bite her; she scratched me, and we fought together. I do not know any thing about the fork. I, being intoxicated, did not know what I was about.</p>

            . I keep the Seven Stars. On the 17th of March the prisoner and the prosecutrix were together in my house the best part of the evening, they were neither of them sober; she came in again at twelve o'clock, she was very much intoxicated, she fell down in the tap-room; and last Saturday she said she could not tell whether she took the fork first or he, or how it happened.</p>
               <p>MR. GARSTONEY. I am an Italian I went to see the prisoner in Newgate, the prosecutrix was there, they ate and drank together, both of them seemed very sorry, and they kissed each other.</p>

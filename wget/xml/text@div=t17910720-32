               <p>A second count for that he, on the same day, unlawfully, feloniously, wilfully and maliciously did set fire to another dwelling house of the said Walter, against the statute.</p>
               <p>The indictment opened by Mr. Knapp. And the case by Mr. Garrow, as follows:</p>
               <p>May it please your Lordship. Gentlemen of the Jury, it is my duty, which I am called upon to discharge with more pain than I have ever executed any professional duty in the course of my experience, to explain to you the facts, and to explain to you, subject to the correction of the Court, the law by which a capital offence is to be imputed to the prisoner at the bar. Gentlemen, undoubtedly when any body contemplates such a wretch as that is, of so tender years, and recollects that he stands at this moment, one may certainly state on the brink of eternity, to be rescued from inevitable ruin only by your verdict; the sensation of such a person must be undoubtedly very painful. Gentlemen, in the course of the administration of justice, many very, very painful scenes present themselves; but inasmuch as we live in a society governed by laws, which are indispensibly necessary for the security of us all, now and then, however painful it may be to do it, examples must be made even of persons of the tender years of the unfortunate being at your bar. Gentlemen, the offence imputed to him, if it should be made out by the evidence, is of a sort undoubtedly the most atrocious that any person can commit; it sets out in the destruction of property, probably for the purposes of plunder, and none can say to what an extent it may reach; the death of many, many innocent persons is but too often involved in the perpetration of the offence, and therefore the security of society requires that whereever a case is fairly and fully made out to the satisfaction of a Jury, that Jury should discharge their duty; and some recent examples of some persons extremely young one would have hoped would have prevented the repetition of such crimes, by teaching<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179107200043"></xptr>the youngest persons in society, that if they are endued with malice enough to put people's lives in hazard, their own lives must pay the forfeit. Gentlemen, I wish I could tell you there were doubts, I wish I could tell you satisfactorily to pronounce this boy not guilty. Gentlemen, you are to judge by the facts, if they are strong and cogent, if you find that this fire, which is imputed to him, could have happened by no other hand than his, it will be your duty to say so by your verdict; you will not look to the right hand or to the left, but you will do your duty to look always at that with an eye of mercy, and to take especial care not to give more weight to the facts given in evidence against him, than those facts compel and wring out of you, and to endeavour if you can to pronounce him innocent. Gentlemen, in trials like these very difficult and very important points of law sometimes arise; on the present occasion, neither my Lord nor you will have any such trouble; he that runs may read. There is no pretence to say that these premises burnt by this offence belong to the prisoner; there is no pretence to say he had any interest in them; there is no shadow of a question in point of law: therefore it will be entirely for you to decide that it must grow out of the fact. Gentlemen, the prisoner was employed as a <rs id="t17910720-32-deflabel177" type="occupation">pot boy</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17910720-32-defend383 t17910720-32-deflabel177"></join> to the prosecutor of this indictment, who is a <rs id="t17910720-32-viclabel178" type="occupation">publican</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17910720-32-victim385 t17910720-32-viclabel178"></join>, he lived with him some time, and after he had quitted his service, he was taken back to that service in the month of June; on the 29th of that month, between eleven and twelve, the prisoner had been directed to go to bed, which he did; the family retired to rest, every thing was made secure, no appearance of fire, no possibility of its happening in the way in which afterwards happened, but by design. In a very short time after a lodger, of the name of Hall was alarmed by a smell of fire; he got up, and when he came down stairs and went to the cellar, he found in the passage, which led towards the door, a quantity of, the remains of an old shirt burnt, the partition burnt, so that a dog might creep through it; a part of the door-post burnt, so as to reduce it to charle. From a variety of circumstances, and on the boy's coming down stairs nearly dressed, immediately after the alarm, he was secured, and his apartment searched. There will be no doubt about the law: the law and reason is this; that if any man shall burn the house of another, he shall be guilty of the offence imputed to him by the indictment; and if he shall do that, which in the second count is imputed to him, his punishment shall be equal, namely, if he shall set fire to the house of another. It is now past all question, that if you in the smallest degree burn the house of your neighbour, though you have done it, as some of the cases have been, by burning your own, which if it extended no further, would be only a misdemeanor; yet if you burn also the house of your neighbour, it will be the offence of arson; and the question always will be who is the person guilty of the fact, upon which the law arises. Gentlemen, on searching the person of the prisoner, they found upon him, in his pocket, a flint, a steel, and some matches; and on searching the bed to which he retired, there was found a tinder box. Gentlemen, it would be extremely difficult to account for any honest and laudable purpose for which he could be possessed of such instruments: it is by no means an inconsiderable circumstance that they are not found together; but that the tinder box is left in his bed-room, that they are found in his bed, and the matches and other implements necessary for kindling the light found on his person, in his pocket. Gentlemen, this could have happened by no other means, it could not have happened from without, it could not have happened from within by the means of any other persons for they will be called to you as witnesses; how then could it happen? I am afraid the conclusion is too pressing and too strong, that it happened by the prisoner at the bar. Gentlemen, I have now told you only such circumstances as are extrinsic of any account this unfortunate creature has given himself; and if there are cases in which a jury may rely on circumstances, it is in cases of enormity,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179107200044"></xptr>for persons are not to be expected to call in witnesses to see their enormity, but some care, some precaution, some address will be used, in order to perpetrate offences like these, when no eye shall be looking on. Gentlemen, I am afraid I have stated facts enough already; but if more be wanting, I have a full and ample confession of the prisoner at the bar, which I cannot suppress; I have enquired, and you will enquire particularly in the case of a person of such tender years as the prisoner, whether any thing was said, to induce him to make the confession; whether either his fears were alarmed, his hopes encouraged, his mind set off its centre; or any thing done, that could induce him for a moment to believe he was benefitting himself by the story he was telling. I am told no such thing was done, but that this is the effect of that contrition which now and then is to be found in the minds of the most guilty, and that he made the confession. Gentlemen, if it is necessary to say more, it will be this, that if you should be of opinion to satisfy yourselves, that he had no hope, that he had no threat used to him, you will receive his confession; but I conjure you, on the part of the prosecutor, not to receive a tittle of the confession, which will be sworn to by the witness, if you should be of opinion, that at that time he made it, he had the most remote and distant idea, that it would tend to benefit him; I ask you to attend to it, only as far as the other circumstances, which cannot lie, shall appear to give it veracity; and to make it appear, that the prisoner made it merely voluntarily, and with a knowledge that he was doing that which might by and by impute to him a capital offence. Gentlemen, I shall call the witnesses to you, and I shall have discharged a very painful duty on the part of this prosecution. Much will remain for you to do: it will remain for you to examine with the most scrupulous nicety every syllable that shall be produced: it will remain for you, under the able assistance of the Judge, to observe the demeanor of the witnesses, to attend to their conduct, and to weigh their oaths, and to judge of it, as if you was about, on the verdict you are to give, to sign your own death warrant. Gentlemen, I am afraid in deciding on this case, you will sign the death warrant of the prisoner at the bar. I mention that to you only to put you on your guard: I mention it only to caution you, and to request you to deal with him, as you would expect that a jury of your country would deal with a son of yours of his years. Standing before such a tribunal, Gentlemen, before such a tribunal he will stand with all the safety that belongs to innocence. Gentlemen, after such a caution, I have discharged my duty, I meant to have done so at least, and your verdict, I am sure, will be perfectly satisfactory.</p>

               <p>Did you keep the Wheatsheaf on the 5th of this month? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - Yes, very well; he lived with me six or seven years backwards and forwards; he came to me the 28th of June; he was there just eight days; this accident happened on the 5th of July; he came to me in the capacity of a pot-boy; he always slept in my house from that 28th of June; on the 5th of July the prisoner went up, to go to bed, about half past eleven; all the family went to bed at the same time, within a minute; there was Mr. Hall, who is here, my family consisted of my wife and self, no maid, no servant but this boy, and about twelve lodgers; we were alarmed about twelve; we went to bed at half past eleven, in the front room, one pair of stairs; when we got up, my wife struck a light, and we opened the door, and there was such a smother and smoke, I said, Suke, we shall never be able to get down stairs, we must get out at the window; but my wife said she would go down stairs at the risk of her life; and Mr. Hall and she went down stairs, and I followed them down below stairs, just in the kitchen, which is under ground, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179107200045"></xptr>they were throwing water on the fire in the passage; I saw the boy at the bottom of the stairs as soon as I came down, he was perfectly dressed except his hat and his shoes, even the handkerchief about his neck; I saw the boy before I came to the fire; I met him just by the bottom of the stairs, before I came to the tap-room, which is on the ground-floor; I said to the boy, I struck him, and said, I am afraid, you dog, you have set fire to my house, and I desired him to go to bed; I immediately went down to the fire, which was burning at the door of the cellar, in the passage; the cellar-door was on fire next to the passage, and there was some straw on fire, and the remains of a shirt, against that door; the door-post was burnt to a cinder about a foot and a half high, and part of the bottom was burnt away; I could put this hat-crown through it; then Mr. Hall put some water on the fire, and rubbed the fire out with his hands; the fire was put out with water, and we brought away the straw and the old shirt: the floor is pavement: I went up stairs, and took the boy out of bed to the watch-house; the boy would not say any thing; I told him, if you will confess, I will not take you to the watch-house; when we took him to the watch-house of St. George the Martyr, in Bedford-street, I gave charge of him; I saw him searched in the watch-house; there was a flint and steel, and one match, and two keys, I saw taken out of his breeches pocket; nothing else was found upon him at that time; he had no use for such things; my wife, or the maid, lighted the fires, not the boy; the prisoner was ordered down to Bridewell that night; I came back, and we went and searched his bed, and there I found, on turning down his bed, a tinder-box and tinder, and some matches, five or six, between the sheets (they are here); the tinder-box was covered.</p>
               <p>Court. When you took the prisoner to the watch-house, was the door of his room locked or not? - It was locked, and I put the key in my pocket; I unlocked it when I returned; I have had them ever since. (The tinder-box, tinder, matches, and part of a shirt, produced to the Court and Jury.) Mr. Hall took up the remains of the shirt and the straw in my presence; he brought it up to my bed-room door, and I put it in paper, and have kept it ever since; I had seen a shirt hanging on an ale cask a short time before, about four or five, the afternoon of the fire; the cellar-door was open all day; it was not locked that night; it appeared to be a boy's coarse nasty shirt; I understand it belonged to the last boy.</p>
               <p>At any other time was there any thing else found, either in the house, or on the person of the prisoner? - Nothing else: I saw the prisoner on the 6th, at Justice Clarke's, on Clerkenwell-green; he said very little the first hearing; he was had up again.</p>
               <p>Court. Was this your tinder-box? - Yes; I saw it that day, over the mantle-shelf in the kitchen, at twelve or one, or two, in the course of the day of the 5th, before the fire.</p>
               <p>Can you speak with certainly, that that is your tinder-box? - Yes, I can.</p>
               <p>Was there any hope held out to him, or any threats, so as to induce him to confess? - There was no more then than there is to me now; I did not hear any thing; but the magistrate spoke very civilly to him.</p>
               <p>In point of fact, were there any hopes held out to him that he should not be prosecuted? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Or any threat? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. Was that examination taken in writing by the magistrate at the time? - I believe Mr. Clarke took down something, but I do not know what he wrote.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner say any thing? - No, nor ever was asked to do it: at the third examination there was a sheet of paper taken down, but I did not see the prisoner sign it, nor nobody asked him to sign it, or else I do not doubt but he would.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do you know whether Mr. Clarke wrote what the boy said? - I believe he wrote nothing else but Mead's confession about White.</p>
               <p>That was a charge about another person who was taken and discharged? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know at all whether the justice's clerk took down what the boy said to the magistrate? - Yes, there was a great deal<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179107200046"></xptr>taken down by the solicitor to the fire-office.</p>
               <p>Did you ever hear the boy give an account of this transaction at a time when the clerk did not take it down? - Yes, he said a great deal at that second hearing.</p>
               <p>At that second hearing was any thing taken down by the justice that the boy said? - He pretended to take it down; he did not read it to me; he was writing something; he told me he had taken down what the boy had told him about the other boy; I told you he had taken down his confession.</p>
               <p>The boy confessed the same the second hearing as the third? - The magistrate was asking the boy questions, and the clerk was writing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. At the third examination the solicitor of the fire-office took it, and not the justice's clerk? - Yes, the justice's clerk gave it up to the solicitor; he said he was more capable.</p>
               <p>Court. If the solicitor did it for the justice's clerk, that would be the same thing; then I really am of opinion that what he said cannot be received. - There was another boy taken up, and he was discharged last Thursday, and this boy was committed.</p>
               <p>Court. What sort of people are they that lodged in your house? - Very good sort of people.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not my mistress say, when she came down, that she found other people below besides the boy? - My wife never told me so, nor any thing like it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There was a girl down between five and dark, three or four different times, of the name of Norris? - Yes, such a girl was there, I believe, between four and five o'clock; the girl did go down once, to my knowledge; and I desired her to go down and fetch her father a light; I was down fifty times, I suppose an hundred, after that.</p>
               <p>Court. With respect to this bed of his, did he sleep alone? - He slept alone.</p>
               <p>Was there any other bed, or any body else slept in that room? - Nobody from the Saturday night before.</p>
               <p>Jury. What reason have you to suppose the boy brought the straw down? - Because there was no one else goes into that cellar.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Let me see if I understand you; in that porter cellar was some straw; had any body, except yourself, your wife, and the prisoner at the bar, recourse to that cellar? - No one at all.</p>
               <p>Jury. I thought you said there was a girl went for a light? - She went down into the kitchen, but not into the porter-cellar; besides, I went down fifty times after she was there; I was there after eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Court. When did you lock that cellar-door? - About a quarter after eleven that night.</p>
               <p>Court. Let me understand you right; you say you sent this boy to this cellar in the day; you went into that cellar, and your wife, and this boy, and you had lodgers; now then this cellar was open to all your lodgers to go down into that cellar? - No lodgers had any business to go there.</p>
               <p>Jury. How came the straw to be removed, and where was it after you locked the cellar-door? - We found it after the alarm of the fire.</p>
               <p>How came you not to see it before? - Because it is a passage we do not go into; it is at the farther end.</p>
               <p>Court. In locking the cellar-door, and going up to bed, did you not pass that passage where the straw and fire was? - No.</p>
               <p>Then the straw might be in the passage, and you not see it, because you came from the cellar-door another way? - Just so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Attend now a moment; I want to know, whether, in going from your cellar-door, after you had locked it, and going to bed, you passed that place where afterwards the fire was? - No, we did not pass by that place at all; that was found against the door of the spirit cellar.</p>
               <p>You have two cellars; one is a porter cellar, and the other is your brandy cellar; the one which hath the porter is open during the day for to go into to draw the porter; now how far distant is the brandy cellar from the porter cellar? - A good distance.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179107200047"></xptr>Out of sight? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then you could lock your cellar-door, and go to bed, without going near that door where the fire afterwards was? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Are you prepared to say, that any straw, any quantity of straw, was missing from the cyder cellar? - There was; I missed it immediately.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You say you missed it immediately; how soon did you go into the porter cellar to see whether there was any straw missing? - Immediately on the alarm of the fire, and I had extinguished it, I went into the cellar, and was immediately assured that some straw was taken from that cellar.</p>
               <p>Jury. Had any cyder been taken out that afternoon? - None.</p>
               <p>Court. You said that you went to the porter cellar immediately on the fire being extinguished; did you then unlock it, had you the key? - I had, and I did this before I took the boy out of bed; and I said to my wife, Suke, there is some straw gone.</p>

               <p>(Examined by Mr. Garrow.)</p>
               <p>I am a carpenter and joiner, I have lodged in the house of Mr. Carwardine twelve months, I have known the prisoner between four and five years, he was a potboy; I went to bed on the night of the alarm about eleven, and the boy was ordered to bed before I was, but what became of him I cannot say; and I suppose I might be talking with my fellow-lodger about a quarter of an hour after I went up in my own room; he slept in my room, and I went to bed; I was no sooner undressed and in bed, but I thought I smelt fire; I looked to see if I had put my candle safe, and laid down again; I could not be satisfied but there was a fire in the house, and got out of bed, and went to the table, and took the extinguisher to see if all was safe, and got into bed again, and laid for about a minute, and found the smell of fire increase; I says I will not lay here to be burned, and jumped out of bed, and called Mrs. Carwardine; I was on the one pair back-room, the landlord sleeps on the one pair front-room; the stair-case was all in a smoke; for God's sake, says I, you have not put out the fire; the stair-case is all of a smoke; I went down to the ground-floor, and got to the backdoor and opened it, and called out to the watch to bring a light; the husband said to to the wife, Suke don't go down; she said she would go down if she lost her life, for she should be suffocated; she went down first, and I followed, and a part of the door of the spirit cellar was all on fire; for God's sake, says she, where is some water? and she unlocked the cellar-door; I went and fetched a pail of water from the kitchen, and throwed some on it, and just as I was coming out of the kitchen with the first pail of water, I saw the prisoner standing near to the bottom of the stairs of the kitchen-floor; the kitchen-floor is under ground, I just saw him as I run by with the water; he had his hat off and his shoes; I believe he had every thing else on.</p>
               <p>In what manner do you think the cellar-door was set on fire? - The watchman came, and I put my right hand up the corner, and drew out that straw, with part of an old shirt.</p>
               <p>(The straw produced.)</p>
               <p>Was this straw a part of the general mass which had been burning against the door of the cellar? - This was.</p>
               <p>Court. How much was you dressed? - Nothing but my shirt on and my night-cap.</p>
               <p>How was the landlord? - I believe he had nothing but his shirt and breeches.</p>
               <p>How was the woman? - She had nothing but her shift and night-cap.</p>
               <p>Did you hear any body come down stairs before you? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Nor heard any noise? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Then it appears to you, that you was the first person that gave the alarm, and you had been out of bed some minutes when you saw the boy? - I was.</p>
               <p>Jury. Are the stairs very wide? - Not very wide stairs, I suppose they might be six or seven feet.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179107200048"></xptr>Supposing the prisoner to have gone to bed when he was ordered, he must have come down the stairs by your door? - He must, but I did not hear him when I was in bed.</p>
               <p>You was in conversation with a person before you got to bed; did you hear any body go down then? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What did you do after you took this straw out? - After I had scraped the straw out, I took it up stairs, and said this must be done on purpose; and after the fire had been extinguished, Mr. Carwardine said to the boy, you young scoundrel, you have done this; and said he would take him to him to the watch-house; I told him to tell me whether it was an accident, or whether he did it on purpose; he said he knew nothing about it; we took him to the watch-house, and I said to Mr. Carwardine, if that boy sleeps in this house to-night, I will not; I saw a match, flint and steel taken out of his pocket at the watch-house; on my return from the watch-house, I went up to the bed where the boy slept, and found some matches, six, or seven, or ten, and a tinder-box between the sheets; and then Mr. Carwardine called a person, who lived in the two pair of stairs back-room, to see what was done.</p>

Deposed that he was turned of sixteen last December, that he came to live with Mr. Carwardine the second time on Tuesday night was a fortnight; that the fire happened a week afterwards, by his being persuaded by White to do it; and deposed that White met Mead in Eagle street the Thursday before the fire, and that White spoke to him and asked him if he lived with Mr. Carwardine, and he said yes; that White said he wished he had staid a little longer, for his intention was to have set the house on fire, and if he could get it done, he would give Mead half a guinea. White proposed it should be set on fire on Tuesday night, and proposed to meet Mead in Eagle street; he went up to bed about half past eleven, staid till his master and mistress got up stairs, and got a light from a lodger, then went into his own room again; then went down stairs, and set fire to some straw he had prepared in the afternoon from an hamper, and put a shirt which he had taken from the cellar on the straw, and returned up stairs to his own room; in ten minutes Mr. Hall gave an alarm; his master met him on the stairs, and sent him to bed again; his master fetched him out of bed soon afterwards, and had him to the watch-house.</p>

            . The first alarm I had of the fire was from Mr. Hall: he said, here is a fire, for God's sake we shall be all burned in our beds; I opened my door, and there was such a smother, I could hardly open it.</p>
               <p>How did you leave your house before you went to bed? - There was no fire in the kitchen for hours, nor any candle but what I had in my hand.</p>
               <p>How long before you went to bed was the boy sent to bed? - He and I went up to bed at one time.</p>
               <p>Had he a light to go to bed by? - No, we never allowed a light.</p>
               <p>Therefore then, if he had a light, he must have got it in a clandestine manner, and against your orders? - He must.</p>
               <p>Now proceed to tell us how you found the place? - When I came to the bottom of the stairs, I could hardly fetch my breath, I just opened the kitchen-door, and Mr. Hall halloo'd out, here it is, and I found the fire was against the door of the spirit cellar; that door was always kept locked, and never kept open.</p>
               <p>When had you last seen the door? - I had not seen the door after I went down for some spirits, about eleven or twelve o'clock in the day.</p>
               <p>Had any body occasion to go to that cellar-door after candle-light? - No body at all, it went into the coal-cellar, and where we kept cinders.</p>
               <p>Was you present when the boy was searched? - I was not, he was not searched at home.</p>
               <p>Who gave him his key to go to bed? - The key was in the door; there was a young man that slept there sometimes, but he had not slept there for some nights.</p>
               <p>Who made his bed that day? - The chare-woman.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did the chare-woman sleep in the house? - No.</p>

               <p>OTTO ALEXANDER BERENS. I live at No. 21, St. Paul's-church-yard, and am in partnership with Samuel Angel. I am a Frenchman; we <rs id="t18271206-223-viclabel1186" type="occupation">keep a fancy French toy-ware-house</rs>

On the 14th of November Campbell came to my warehouse, and said he was going into the country, and wanted an assortment of fancy articles - he said he would pay me cash on delivery of the goods, and I must serve him as low as I could - he gave me this card - "Mr. Spillers, wine-merchant, Leicester-fields," as where he lodged, and on the back of one of my cards he wrote, "Mr. Campbell, Swan with Two Necks, Lad-lane;" the goods were to be sent there the next day - I told him I would serve him as low as I could, and he said I should have the cash for them - he looked at a quantity of reticules, snaps, and other articles, and selected the articles stated in the indictment - I made him out this invoice, which he saw (the list of the articles stated in the invoice being compared with the indictment, correspond with the same, and amounted to 171l. 15s. 9d.) - I was to take them to the Swan with Two Necks the following day - and I did take them, at five o'clock in the evening, and found Campbell there - he said, "I am surprised that my friend is not come; he promised to be in this coffee-room by five o'clock - he is not come yet;" after waiting a quarter of an hour, there came a twopenny-post letter to him, upon reading which, he said, "This is my very good friend, who will give me 200l. at half-past seven o'clock, at Toms' coffee-house;" I said."Certainly this must be a very good friend."</p>
               <p>Q. Where were the goods at this time? A. In a packing-case in the coach-office - I had left it there - we were talking in the coffee-room - I had not seen Lewis then - Campbell desired me to meet him at half-past seven o'clock, at Toms' coffee-house - he saw the case in the coach-office - he told the book-keeper, as he passed through the office, to keep him a place to go to Manchester on the day following - he went out, and so did I - I went to Toms' coffee-house exactly at half-past seven, but he was not there; I waited till eight o'clock; my suspicions were then excited - I sent my partner to the book-keeper at the office; he returned, and I went myself to the Swan with Two Necks - my case was not there - I then went to look for him and my property; I sent for an officer, but went out myself before he came, and found my case in about an hour and half, at a house in a small street over Blackfriars'-bridge; the officer was then with me; I found both the prisoners there, very busy, unpacking my case - all my goods were strewed about - they were much surprised to see me, and were secured - I got all my goods again.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. At what time did Campbell come to you? A. At ten o'clock in the morning, and gave me these orders; I did not inquire for his lodgings - I had nothing to do with them, because I was to have my money on delivery of the goods - I left the goods in the coach-office.</p>
               <p>Q. You delivered up the possession of it entirely? A. I left my case to receive the money - I found Campbell in the coffee-room; I went in there to be paid - I had left the case in the office - I said, "Take care of my case - I am to meet a gentleman here to pay me my money."</p>
               <p>Q. If he had paid you, you would have considered the property as sold? A. I should consider they were not sold, till I had my cash for them; we staid in the coffee-room a quarter of an hour, and had, I think, only a glass and a half of rum and water, as he had to wait for his friend.</p>
               <p>Q. The letter was satisfactory to you, was it not? A. No; my best satisfaction would be to receive the money for my goods; I went in consequence of what he said, and of the letter, to Toms' coffee-house to receive the cash.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give any directions to the book-keeper about your goods, when you left to go to Tom's coffee-house? A. I said they should take care, and Campbell said, "Secure me a place to Manchester to-morrow;" the book-keeper said, "I will."</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What did you say? A. I said, "He shall take care of my goods - by eight o'clock I shall be back again."</p>
               <p>MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Did Campbell give any direction about the case? A. He said, "I shall go to-morrow - keep me a place by the first coach."</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the book-keeper say the case was too large? A. I do not know - he said, "We will see what we can arrange;" I think he did say it was too large, but I do not know, for I went very fast through the office, and cannot say whether Campbell gave any directions about the case; something was said about the case - I said nothing about the size of it, nor whether it could go by the coach or not. When I first brought the case, the book-keeper said, perhaps it would be too large to go by the coach, and he thought he should be obliged to send it by the van (Campbell was then in the coffee-room) - I said, "I have nothing to do as to how you send it - I have to receive the money of the gentleman." All I heard in the office, when Campbell was present, was, his desiring a place to be kept for him - I heard nothing else.</p>

            . I am a book-keeper at the Swan with Two Necks, Lad-lane. On the day in question I saw Mr. Berens; he brought a large case to the office, about five o'clock, and in about half an hour I saw Campbell come through the office with Mr. Berens; Campbell said, "That is my case - I am going to Manchester to-morrow, by one of your coaches;" the prosecutor said, "I am going to meet him at half-past seven o'clock, at Toms' coffee-house, to receive his cash."</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner hear that? A. They were there both together; I went to Campbell, and just informed him I was afraid I should not be able to send that case by the coach; he said, "Do what you can for me - send it tomorrow;" they then both went out of the office. Campbell returned in a great hurry, in about a quarter of an hour, and stated that he had made other arrangements, and should send that case by waggon, and wished me to procure him a porter to take it away; I sent for Hull, who, took it, and went away with Campbell up the lane - Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182712060103"></xptr>Berens returned about eight o'clock - he wished to know what had become of the case; I told him it was gone. - When Campbell came for it, he asked if there was anything to pay, and said he would give me a sovereign if I wished it- I said No, as he was a passenger I would not take any thing; he still said he should go by one of the coaches tomorrow.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had he paid for his place? A. No; he offered the sovereign as warehouse-room - it surprised me; I made a remark about it after he was gone. I took it for granted that it was his case - the prosecutor gave me no direction to stop it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he say any thing about the case? A. He only said he had brought the case - that he was to be paid for it at our coffee-house, and when he left to go to Toms' he said, "Take care of it."</p>
               <p>MR. CHURCHILL. Q. And did not the prisoner say,"Take care of the case?" A. Yes, and I told him I was afraid it could not go; I did not know whether the goods were paid for or not.</p>

            . I am a ticket-porter. I was sent for on the 16th of November, to the Swan with Two Necks, to take a large packing-case - the prisoners were both there, standing near the case; Campbell asked if I would carry it- he said it was large and bulky, but not heavy, as it was only French toys; I lifted it, and said, "It is heavy - how far do you want it carried?" he said, over Blackfriars'-bridge - I do not know whether the book-keeper heard that - they were very busy; I said I would not attempt it, as the streets were very greasy; he then asked if I would carry it over London-bridge - I said No; he then asked if I would take it to a cart - I said the carts were off the stand, I did not know where to get one; Lewis said, "It is not far - come take it as far as you can;" I went with them up the lane, on to St. Ann's-lane, and at the corner of that lane Campbell turned round, and asked if I had not had enough of it - I said I had; a lusty man came along, and I got him to help me down with it; I suppose it weighed a cwt. and three quarters. Campbell then asked me to go and get him a cart; I said there were no cart-stands about there, but we might see one passing by; one came by, which was going to the Old Bailey, and it was put into it; the two prisoners, the two carmen, and another man helped it in; the prisoners went in the cart with it. They paid me 1s. 6d., and I left.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did the conversation in the coach-office pass in a whisper? A. No; I carried the case on my shoulder.</p>
               <p>Prisoner LEWIS to MR. BERENS. Q. Were the goods concealed in the room, or were they not in the chest? A. They had opened it, and the things were all tumbled, but put into the box again - they were unpacking when we entered.</p>
               <p>MR. CHURCHILL to THOMAS FELIGATE. Q. If Mr. Berens had come to you for the box, should you have given it to him? A. I should have requested some memorandum for it; I knew him before, by his coming to the office, but should not have given it to him without an indemnification, but I should to Campbell.</p>

Campbell and another person, who I did not notice, got into the cart with it.

Campbell said he considered it his property; Lewis said nothing.

Campbell did not live there.</p>
               <p>MR. BERENS. The whole of these articles are mine, and were part of what were in the case; this is the invoice which I made out, and sent with them. I found out Hall, and got further information, by which means I found the property.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182712060104"></xptr>MR. CHURCHILL contended this was not a felony, but only an obtaining of the goods by false pretences.</p>
               <p>CAMPBELL's Defence. If I have committed myself in the purchase of these goods, I must bow to your decision; but I am in duty bound to say Lewis did not know what I had purchased, or any thing about them; he had been acquainted with me some time - I met him in Cheapside, and asked him to walk with me - in consequence of my not meeting some friends, and the parcel being large, I determined to take it and divide it, that I might send it next day. Mr. Berens was to see me next morning, and if I had paid him that evening, I should have paid him for some goods which I had not received, as I was to have a parcel from him in the morning, and as I had to meet him in the afternoon it would do: for if I called on my friend who was to lend me the 200l. he would have lent it; I have not seen that gentleman in Court - I was not informed till last night that I was to be tried this afternoon, and the person who was to have lent me the money may not be here - I only called to select a few goods - Mr. Berens pressed me to buy these - I should have called on him in the morning, and paid the money; my friend, who was to lend me the money, was here last night.</p>

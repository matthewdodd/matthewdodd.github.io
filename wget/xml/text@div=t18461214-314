                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, and live in Friar-street, Blackfriar's-road—there is a fan-light over my shop door, about ten feet from the ground, which opens into the street—no one could look through the fan<lb></lb>light without climbing up—there is no light inside at night. On the 9th of Dec, about four o'clock in the morning, I was in bed up stairs, and heard a noise of glass breaking—I got out of bed, opened the window, and looked out—I saw nobody, and went to bed again—about a quarter of an hour after I heard a noise at the door, and a piece of glass fall—it was a kind of scrap<lb></lb>ing noise, as if somebody was scraping up to the door—I got out of bed, opened the window, and saw a man creep from the door towards the street—I called to him, and asked what business he had there—he ran away—I called out for the police—I saw a policeman cross the road and go after him—he went round the corner—I came down stairs and waited at the door—the fan-light over the door was broken—it was quite sound when I went to bed—the door was shut—it had not been opened—when daylight came I looked over the shop, and missed a pair of boots from the line nearest the door—they had been thrown on the line the night before—the line went across the shop, inside the fan-light, but within arm's reach of it—I missed nothing else—the broken glass of the fan-light laid inside the shop—a person could climb up by the handle of the door and a small ledge—the man who ran turned round into Union-street, three doors from my house—I know the prisoner by sight, I do not know his name—I have not seen the boots since.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable.</hi>) On the 9th of Sept. I was on duty at Friar-street—I know the prisoner, and saw him about the time the clock struck four, at the corner of Friar-street, about thirty yards from the prose<lb></lb>cutor's shop—he had a shawl tied round his neck and face—he was standing still—I watched him—I have known him for years—I did not see him do</p>

               <p>anything—I missed him from the place, and shortly after I heard an alarm and a window opening, and the prosecutor singing out, "What are you doing there, you vagabond"—I then saw the prisoner sneak out of the doorway a <hi rend="italic">few</hi> yards, and then commence running—he ran round Union-street—I ran after him through several streets—at last I found him on the ground, in cus<lb></lb>tody of a brother constable—I lost sight of him a few yards in turning round, and then saw him in custody—I had followed him above a quarter of a mile—we took him to the station—I then fetched the prosecutor to charge him—he came to the station to charge him—when I went for the prosecutor, I found the glass of the fan-light over the door broken—the knob of the door was grazed and covered with fresh mud, as if somebody had been standing on it—we looked along the streets he had run, but found no property—there was a piece of beading, an inch and a half wide under the fan-light, which a man could put his hand on and draw himself up by—we found nothing on the prisoner except the shawl, which he had round his neck when I first saw him.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable.</hi>) On the morning of the 9th of Dec. I was on duty, and about four o'clock I heard a cry of "Stop thief!"—I saw the prisoner running a minute or two after, and Hampton running after him—he came running towards me—I stopped him, but found nothing on him—he was sober—I consider he feigned drunkenness—when I got him to the station he was not drunk—he was told the charge was breaking a fan-light, and made no answer to it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> About twelve o'clock I met a person who was going to Birmingham next morning; I went and stopped drinking with him till half-past three, then went straight down Union-street to Price's night-house and had some gin and milk; as I passed the end of Wellington-street, I saw the policeman; I stopped at the end of Friar-street, considering whether I should go to my sister's or go home; I determined to go to my sister's; I crossed the road, tumbled against the door, and threw two pieces of glass down; the man called out; I thought I had broken a window which was over me.</p>

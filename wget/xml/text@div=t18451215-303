I am horsekeeper to Pope and Co., Bridewell-wharf—the firm only consists of one person to my knowledge—on the 27th Nov. the prisoner came with one of the wagons for five quarters of oats—he brought this written order—there was a wagon with twenty-five quarters of oats in it just at that time drawn to the warehouse door—I told the men who were about to unload it, (who were ten in number,) to load the prisoner's wagon with five quarters, which is ten sacks—in consequence of something that was told me I followed the prisoner, and got into his wagon—I found there eleven sacks, and there should have been but ten delivered to him—I took one on my back, and carried it back again—he was to take the ten sacks to the wharf at Limehoase basin.</p>

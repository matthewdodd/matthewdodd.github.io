               <p>William Blincow. I have looked after Mrs Catherine Talbot's sheep a good many years. There were some lost about the beginning of last Sept. they were found in another man's field; it is impossible to say the exact time they were lost, for they lie upon <placeName id="t17581206-10-crimeloc53">Uxbridge common</placeName>

I was sent for to see them in this field; there were 5 but 2 of them, I had mark'd my self, I swear but to them, they are both ewes, one a large ewe lamb of the last year.</p>
               <p>Q. How were they mark'd?</p>
               <p>Blincow. The ewes were mark'd on their heads with ruddle, the lamb was not; I had crop'd that's ear, and the ewe also; that is I flit the near ear of each, the lamb was almost flit down. I found them branded with a pitch mark on the near side: I know nothing against the prisoner: how

               <p>Blincow. Another man's sheep that were sold with ours, were missing on the 4th of Sept.</p>
               <p>Q. to Kitchen. How did the prisoner say he came by them?</p>
               <p>Kitchen. He said he bought them of drover.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I found them straying on the common with no mark at all upon them, and I brought them and sold them to that man.</p>

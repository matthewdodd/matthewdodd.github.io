I am now a prisoner in Newgate on a charge of felony—I was clerk to Mr. Goss, a ship-chandler—the prisoner was also his clerk—it was my department to do business at Docks—in October last Mr. Goss had a hogshead of brandy in St. Kathe<lb></lb>rine's Docks—there was an account between Mr. Goss and Mr. Everitt, a lighterman—the brandy in question was the subject of negociation with Everitt—about the middle of October I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner about the brandy—there were other persons present—there was a conversation between us about the brandy—it was to be shipped on board the <hi rend="italic">James</hi> lying in the London Docks, in the name of Richard Brown—this was said among us all—I do not know who proposed it—the prisoner took part in it, and that was stated in his presence—the brandy was at that time in bond in St. Katherine's Dock—it was necessary to execute a bond before it could be exported—Quinlan told me to put in a bond at the Cus<lb></lb>tom-house, in the name of Richard Brown—I afterwards went to the Custom-house and gave directions for a bond to be prepared—I saw Quinlan a day or two after—I told him the bond was not signed, and he went with me to the Custom-house—he said he would sign the bond—we went to the long-room—I did not see him sign anything—I left him in the long-room—he came back to me in about twenty minutes—I was in the long-room about Mr. Goss's business—when he left me he had gone over towards the bond-office—when he returned to me he told me I might go on shipping, and pass the entries, which was the next thing to be done—after the execution of the bond, I passed the socket, and did what was necessary to ship the brandy—after it was shipped on board the <hi rend="italic">James</hi>, it was brought out in bladders—I was present—the paper now produced is an account of sales of the brandy—I believe it to be in the prisoner's writing—it is an account of what brandy was sold after it was got out of the docks.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a lighterman, and live in Beer-lane, City. I had an account with Mr. Goss for lighterage—a delivery ticket for brandy was left at my father's in part of that account—I had it in my possession—I had it out of my father's house—my father had it from Mr. Goss—a person having property in the Docks can sign an order, by virtue of which any person can get the property, by jy paying the duty—this has been in my possession ever since it was given, which was on the 16th of May—I once met the prisoner, and asked him, as Mr. Goss and I were not exactly good friends, to ask Mr. Goss if he would take the hogshead of brandy back, and pay money instead; my father having failed in busi<lb></lb>ness, it would be of more use to me than brandy—he said he would ask. Mr. Goss—I saw him about a week afterwards—he said, "We have taken the hogshead of brandy"—I said, "Very well, let me have the money as soon as possible"—he said he would—I think, on the following Satur<lb></lb>day, I sent my brother with a note to Mr. Goss—I met the prisoner in the street on the 11th of November, and asked if he was going to play the fool with me—he said, "Everitt, take that," giving me a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note and a sovereign—I did not see him again till the Saturday—he told me he did not want any receipt for it, but when he gave me the remainder of the money he would take the delivery order back—on the Saturday week after I went over to Mr. Goss's on purpose to see Quinlan—I saw a servant girl outside the house, she went in, and called Quinlan out—when he came out he told me Mr. Goss was settling with the captain, and asked what house I frequented—I said, "The Bell, Tower-street," where he promised to meet me at eight o'clock, but he did not, and I walked over, and waited outside Mr. Goss's—(I expected Mr. Goss had taken the hogshead, till my brother went over)—I did not see Mr. Goss on the busi-ness till after Quinlan refused to pay me the remainder—the prisoner had said, "We have taken the hogshead of brandy," and he said, "We have shipped it, and given bond," or something similar to that—he did not say how it was to be turned into money, I expected that it was laying in the Docks, as I had the delivery order—I afterwards saw Mr. Goss about it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>, 14). On the evening of 10th Aug. I saw the prisoners on the Cadogan-pier, Chelsea—they placed themselves by the side of Jane Bell, who was standing on the pier—Meikle put his hand into her pocket, and Myers was close by his side, looking at him—she then moved on, and they followed her—Meikle again put his hand into her pocket, and drew it out—I caught hold of him, and he dropped a penny from his hand—Myers was holding his coat tails out, and looking over Meikle—I picked up the penny, and took the prisoners—Myers said, "What do you want of me? I don't know the boy; I never saw him before"—I had said nothing to him—I had watched them in conversation for the last three hours, and when the boat was coming from Chelsea to Putney some person called out to Myers, and be said, "They want us to go ashore at Hammersmith-bridge"—I searched Myers, and found in various pockets 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; he gave his address, "No. 14, Mint-street, Borough"—I went there; there are two Nos. 14, but I could find no such person.</p>

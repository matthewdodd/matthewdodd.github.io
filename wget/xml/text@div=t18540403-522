                  </hi>. I am barman to my brother, who keeps a public house in Old Broad-street On the evening of 8th March, the prisoner came about 7 o'clock, he asked for a glass of half and half; I served him and he tendered me a shilling—I gave him change, and put the shilling in the cor<lb></lb>ner of the till; I did not like the look of it—there was no other shilling in the part of the till where I put it—the prisoner drank the half and half, and when I gave him his change he went away—directly he was gone I went to the till and took out the shilling—no one had been to the till in the mean time—I found the shilling where I had put it; I examined it and tried it by a detector, and found it bad—I wrapped it in a piece of brown paper, and put it on a shelf—the prisoner came again about 8 o'clock the same evening—I had been in the bar the whole time—when he came the second time, Jane Carr, the barmaid, served him with a glass of half and half; he gave her a shilling, she tried it, and it was bad—I rose up and took the other shilling out of the brown paper—I said that was the shilling he had given me—I went to the parlour to my brother, and told him—when I went I left the brown paper and the shilling on the counter—when I came back the shilling was gone, and the brown paper laid at the pri<lb></lb>soner's feet.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in the same house with the last witness. I recollect the prisoner coming that evening; he called for a glass of half and half—he gave me a shilling—I put it in the detector and bent it; I told him it was bad—Master John Cooper recognised the prisoner, and said, "That is the man that came in about an hour ago"—he brought a piece of paper and a shilling in it, and laid it on the counter—I saw the shilling in the paper—I did not watch what became of the paper; but when Master John Cooper came back, the shilling was not there, and the paper was on the floor—I gave the shilling I took to Mr. Cooper.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Where do you carry on business? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I, Nelson Street—I have been there over twelve months, and was in King Edward Street, Mile End New Town, for five years—I keep no books—it is not an extensive business, only about 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—my mistress has brought a book which she keeps—I can only write my name and the word "paid." (<hi rend="italic">The witness here wrote his name and the word "paid," at Mr. Daly's request</hi>.) I know the prisoner's writing very well—this is his regular writing—he had not to collect money for me—his duty was to sell goods and deliver the money to me at night—he was sometimes paid on cheques—he would very often pay my mistress—if she had gone to bed he would not pay her, because I was up at most times—I always asked her if he had paid, but sometimes he received no payment—he would come sometimes at ten and sometimes at eleven at night—I have been at the theatre two or three times since he has been with me, but I always went home when the first piece was over, at half-past nine, and waited for him—I paid my money to go into the theatre, and then went home to wait</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186611190018"></xptr>
               <p>for my traveller—I used to require the money very often that he collected to pay my workpeople—it never occurred that I had not money enough to pay them until be came home—I pay 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week, and keep that amount in my house—I never told him not to take crossed cheques—he sometimes brought them—I have no banker—I paid them to a leather-cutter, who changed them for me—I told the prisoner to accept all cheques given to him—he used not to sign receipts in my name—he never signed my name except when he took money from customers, and I do not know that he signed my name then; so long as he always brought me the money, I was always satisfied—I did not go to persons to inquire—he did not tell me that he could not bring me the money that night because the cheques were made payable to order—I never said, "So long as you bring me the money, I do not care what you sign," or anything like it—he did not tell me that he had signed an endorsement on a cheque, and I never knew that he had done so—I never knew that he had obtained money by signing my name, nor did I take the money afterwards—when he took this cheque he ran away—I then went round to the customers, and found he had taken a cheque from Mr. Swift and allowed five per cent, discount, which was more than I allow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HOUSTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When he received money did he sign your name? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He signed his name first and then he signed "Paid," but I cannot read.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is it in his ordinary writing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I have got a book with me which I keep Mr. Swift's account in—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I have received nothing on that account on 11th October—I keep no cash-book, only this book—I make the entry here at the time the goods go out—the account is 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I write "Settled," when he brings the money; he pays Mr. Cohen sometimes, but I am there always to write it down—if we were out, he used to stand at the door or go inside and wait till we came in, but it was not often that we were out—he did not sleep in the house—we only went to the theatre two or three times in a year—we got home sometimes at eleven, and sometimes earlier—the first piece is over at nine or ten—we did not always leave when the first piece was over, but sometimes we left and went back again—the theatre is about five minutes' walk from our house—it is the Effingham—I only found the prisoner waiting in the street twice—he was paid by commission, two and a half per cent. I think—I gave money to Mr. Cohen—I sometimes paid the prisoner his commission—he did not deduct it out of the money he paid—it would be reckoned up a couple of hours before he came home—I used to put down what he brought home in this book, but I did not always put down the dates of the month—I know Mr. Swift's bill is not paid, because I have not got "Settled" here—Mr. Cohen used not some-times to send his father-in-law with the prisoner—when we came home from the theatre Mr. Cohen would fetch the book and pen and ink into the kitchen—the books were locked up, but the key was in the warehouse—we took it with us if we went out.</p>

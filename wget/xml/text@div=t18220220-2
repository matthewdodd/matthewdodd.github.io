            . On the 24th of January, I was left in the house with the family; Mr. Hopkins went out, and about half-past six o'clock, a person knocked at the door, the servant said somebody gave her information, she alarmed us; I went down to the parlour and missed the looking glass, which hung up opposite the door; I had been in there in the afternoon, the window was down then - there is an area, and rails before the house. I found the window next the door open, the blinds up, and footmarks<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182202200006"></xptr>on the table, a chair next the window, and on the window seat, and area rails. We found the prisoners next morning at Bow-street, with it.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 24th of January, about seven o'clock at night, I was with Haradine in Cockspur-street, nearly a mile from Hopkins's house, which is in John-street - I saw the prisoners carrying this glass; they turned out of Cockspur-street, on the ruins leading to Whitcombe-street, we followed them across the ruins - Baldwin then took the glass by himself; Pay stopped and looked back several times, Haradine took him. I took Baldwin with the glass, and asked where he was going with it, he said to a house in Whitcombe-street, I asked what house; he said he had forgotten - that he did not know the number, or person's name, but that Mr. Doe, No. 14, Great Peter-street, Westminster, sent him to carry it. Hopkins claimed the glass next morning. I went and found a Mr. Doe, at No. 14, New Peter-street.</p>

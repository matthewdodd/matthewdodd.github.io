                  </hi>. I am a watch and clock maker, of No. 56, Blackfriars-road. In consequence of information I received from the last witness, I went to the prisoner's shop, in Webber-street, on 20th Sept.—I tendered the bill for payment of the dial, 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said he had told my man that same morning that if I would give him change for a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, he would pay me—he was then absent from the bar for some time to get the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note as I supposed—after some time he returned with a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note in his hand, which he laid upon the counter—I took it up, I did not examine it very particularly—I saw a name written on it—this is the note, it has the name of "Williams" written on it—it had that name on it when I examined it—it appeared to me to have been recently written, it appeared in a damp state, and a little smeared—I placed 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the counter—I took the note—the prisoner took the change—I left the shop—I saw the name of Amelia Cumby over the door—I put the note into my pocket—I had no other note—I went to Debenham and Storrs', in Covent-garden—while I was there, I wrote my initials on the back of the note—here they are "H. P" in my writing—while I was there I made inquiries, and the note was sent to Coutts' by my direction—I received it back, and took it to the prisoner's house—I told him I wished to speak to him privately—he said it was of no consequence, it was merely his daughter who was present—(this was near 2 o'clock; I had taken the note about two hours previously)—I said, "I have to tell you that the note you gave me is a forged one"—he said he could hardly think it, or some such answer as that—I said, "I am sure of it, I have had the opinion of two or three of Coutts' clerks"—I asked him where he got it—he said, "Of that man that comes here, a customer"—he and his daughter said that at the same time, or within a minute or so—I said, "Indeed! well, at all events, I suppose you are prepared to give me my 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. back?"—he said he had paid it away—I said, "Indeed! it is rather premature; it is scarcely two hours since I was here"—he said, "Well, it is a fact; I can convince you that I have paid it away"—he took up his book—I said, "I don't know, I will take it as a matter of fact; I don't want to see your book, but you had my money about two hours ago"—he said that he should no doubt see the party that they took it of in the evening, about 8 o'clock, and the daughter made the same observation, that no doubt they should see the party—I said, "Well, from what I have seen of this business, I shall put it in the hands of the police"—I left them, stating that I would go home for an hour and consider it—I returned to the prisoner in about an hour, and I said to him, "Have you anything fresh to say to me about this affair?"—he said, No, only he had taken it of the party he spoke of, and that, he had taken it the night before"—I said, "What name did he give you? did you write it?"—he said, "No, the party wrote it himself—I said, "What name did he put on it?"—he said, "The name of Miller"—I asked if he gave his address—he said, "No, he did not"—I said, "No, you are quite wrong; Miller is not the name;" and expressed my surprise that he should give change for a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note for a pot of beer,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185510220153"></xptr>
               <p>which he said he did, without taking the address, particularly as he was wrong in the name—I then left him, and went to his house again about 8 o'clock the same evening, with two friends—I saw him and his daughter—I said to him, "I suppose you have not seen this party yet?"—he said, "Oh, it is scarcely time yet, he comes about 8 o'clock"—I then asked him what he meant to do about it, and whether he was prepared to give me the change—he said that ho was not—one of my friends spoke to him about the improbability of his taking a note in that way, telling him that he himself was a publican, and he should not have done so—the prisoner said, well, he took it, he was not so particular, or words to that effect—one of my friends began to test the note in consequence of the prisoner stating that he did not know it was forged, he had no proof of it—that was what he meant—my friend said, "I will test the note for you in two minutes;" and he called for a glass of water to test it—I, by the advice of my friends, was about giving the prisoner into custody—I was about leaving for that purpose—he seemed a little alarmed about my giving him into custody, and he then appointed the next morning at 10 o'clock to be with me—the next morning the prisoner and another man came to my shop—he said that he called to arrange about the note, that he was an innocent man; he put his friend's name and card upon the counter, and said he had got many other friends—I said, "What is the use of talking so? you came here to arrange about the note; as you have so many friends, you can easily raise 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. "—he said if I would give him till the evening, he would endeavour to get it—I told him I should put it in the hands of Mr. Freshfield, and he would have to convince him and a Jury, I should not wait any longer—this was when he was leaving me in the morning—I went to his house in the evening again and saw him—he said he was a poor man, and he hoped I should not be severe—I said if he would run his head into the fire, he must—I believed he knew it was a forged note—on the day following I gave information.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you asked him whether there was a name on the note, did not he say, "There is some name on it, Miller, I think?"<hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; my im<lb></lb>pression is, that he said "Miller" distinctly—he might have said, "Miller, I think"—I replied, "No, you are not right; that is not the name"—I said that I would not make a debt of it—he only came once to me—he was in my house about a quarter of an hour—his friend the labouring man was with him—Webber-street leads from the New-cut to Blackfriars-road.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, I am married, and live in New Gravel-lane. On the 27th of May I was very tipsy, and met the prisoner between eight and nine o'clock in the morning—she took me to her lodgings, in Cornwall-street, St. George's—I took off my clothes and went to bed—I gave her half a-crown—I fell fast asleep, and when I awoke there was nobody in the room, and my trowsers and shoes were gone—I had pawned my waistcoat to raise the money to give her—I begged somebody to go and get me some clothes to go home—they went and brought the policeman, who went and took the prisoner out of another house—these are my trowsers and shoes.</p>

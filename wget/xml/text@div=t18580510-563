                  </hi>. I live at No. 6., Francis Street, Vinegar Ground. On Sunday morning, 2d May, about 2 o'clock, I let somebody out—I saw the prisoner, I spoke to him, and he came in—I said, "What is it going to be? what are you going to give me?" he said, "Come to the door, and let us speak"—then I went to the door, and then he tore my shawl from off my shoulders, and struck me—I did not struggle with him, the blow was too violent—it almost stunned me, the second blow; it knocked one of my teeth out—I saw him with a constable a few minutes afterwards—this is the shawl and pin (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the pin is broken—the shawl is not worth much now, but it cost me 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, N</hi> 456). I was on duty in the neighbourhood of the Vinegar Ground, about 2 o'clock in the morning, on 2d May. I heard a cry of female voices; I went in the direction, saw the prisoner, and stopped him—I asked him what he was doing; he said he was going home; I said I should take him back—he had this shawl under his arm, and dropped it—I stooped to pick it up, and he darted from me and ran away—I followed, and caught him in Tabernacle Street—he then turned round, and <hi rend="italic">sparred</hi> up to me—as I got hold of him, he said he would go quietly—I took him back and saw the prosecutrix; she identified the shawl and the prisoner—she was bleeding very much—I took the prisoner to the station, searched him, and found this piece of iron on him (<hi rend="italic">Producing a bar of iron, about fifteen inches long.</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What has that bar of iron to do with this case? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I thought the blow might have been struck with it—the neighbourhood is a very bad one—there are fights in the houses nearly every night—I did not say I saw the shawl under the man's coat—I saw him drop it—it might be about 100 yards from the house; I have not measured it—I did not see the prisoner with the woman at all—the pin was sticking in the shawl as it is now; it was bent—I have made inquiries about the prisoner since this affair, and cannot find anything against him.</p>

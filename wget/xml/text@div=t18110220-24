               <p>Q. When was your room broken open - A. On the 7th of February it was broken open; I went out of an errand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you leave any body in the room - A. No, nobody. I locked my door, but left the key in the entrance to my door, being dark I do not suppose that she saw it; she had forced it in, I was not absent ten minutes, when I returned I found the door open; my fright was so great I did not look to see whether it was unlocked or not. I missed this bundle of property that I had been entrusted with to wash.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was it when you went out - A Half past eight in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you lose - A. A tablecloth, three shifts, six pocket handkerchiefs, a night gown, a flannel petticoat, a neck handkerchief, three napkins, two aprons, three towels, six dusters, a sheet, and a piece of old linen cloth.</p>
               <p>Q. What were they all worth - A. I dare say I should be charged a couple of pounds for them</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine the door - A The lock was forced, and they had not unlocked it. The bolt of the lock was out, I cannot say that the lock was very firm, there were three of the screws forced out, and one of the screws I picked up off the ground. These things were left on my chair, they were tied up in a tablecloth, and put in the basket. I went up stairs to my neighbour, and told him I was robbed of what was not my property, a bundle of linen; my neighbour went out and overtook this woman with the things.</p>

            . In consequence of what the last witness said to me I went in search of the things. On the same day I found the prisoner with the property just this side of Howland-street, Tottenham court-road. I found her with the bundle, I brought her back to Fitzroy-market, she brought the bundle back in her apron, and then she and the bundle were taken to the watchhouse, the bundle was lodged in the hands of the constable. I asked the prisoner where she got the things, she said they were her own; I said they were stolen, and she must come along with me; she did.</p>

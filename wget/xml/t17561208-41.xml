But not meeting with the satisfaction I expected, I came out very soon; (I found he had not alter'd his method of preaching) and coming out at the chapel door the woman at the bar laid hold of my watch. I laying hold of her hand, she chang'd the watch out of her right hand into her left, and dropt it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see your watch in her hand?</p>
               <p>Drew. I am positive I did. I secured her, and took her before Justice Welch, where she deny'd it.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. Have you not since declared you drop'd your watch yourself?</p>
               <p>Drew. I never made such a declaration.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you declared your uncertainty of her picking it out of your pocket?</p>
               <p>Drew. No never in my life; there can remain no uncertainty, because I am clear.</p>

            . I was at this chapel to hear Mr. Whitfield preach, I stood within the door, Mr. Drew was in a little before me; he came out, and I heard him say he had lost his watch. I turn'd about and saw he had hold of the prisoner's right hand. I saw her left hand. I turn'd and pushed the people away, and with my right hand took up a watch. I had then hold of her with my left hand, and delivered the watch to the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the watch in her hand?</p>
               <p>Pain. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear it fall?</p>

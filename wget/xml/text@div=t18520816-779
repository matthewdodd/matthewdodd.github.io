                  </hi>. I am clerk to the Magistrates, at Brighton. I remember the defendant, Mr. Sill, attending before the Magistrates there, on several occasions—I saw him there on 8th March—there had previously been several hearings of the case of Staven and Broome—the charge against them was, obtaining money and bills from Mr. Hamp under false pretences, and for cheating at cards—I did not take any note of what Mr. Sill said on 8th March; I can speak from my memory—he applied to the Magistrates that they would sanction his withdrawing from the prosecution, and that Mr. Chase's recognizance, who had been bound over to prosecute, subsequently to Mr. Hamp being bound over, might be considered to be discharged—his grounds for making the application were, that Mr. Hamp had made an</p>

               <p>affidavit in the matter relative to Mr. Sill's bill of costs, in which he, Mr. Hamp, swore directly opposite to the evidence which he had given before the Magistrates in his deposition; and that another witness, Sherman, I believe, had also made some affidavit, or statement, contrary to what he had sworn before the Magistrate; under these circumstances little reliance could be placed upon them, and he desired to withdraw from the prosecution—there was a great deal said on the subject, but I cannot charge my memory with any thing more—the Magistrates retired, and after some consideration returned, and told Mr. Sill that, as he desired to withdraw from the prosecution, they no longer considered him as the solicitor for the prosecution—that was followed by Mr. Sill saying that he hoped he had the approval of the Magistrates in the course he had pursued—the Chairman replied, "We give no opinion upon that, Mr. Sill;" and that closed the proceedings—Mr. Sill never appeared as solicitor for the prosecution after that—the Magistrates had previously bound over the superintendent of police to prosecute—I was afterwards instructed by the Magistrates to carry on the prosecution—I did so, and Staven and James were tried and convicted—the proceedings were against John Broome, Charles Staven, and John James—James and Staven were convicted, John Broome did not appear—that is, he did not appear to answer the indictment; he was there, but was not tried—Mr. Hamp and Sherman were examined as witnesses for the prosecution, on the trial of that indict<lb></lb>ment—Mr. Hamp was subpœnaed because he did not appear at the first assizes, and his recognizances were estreated; but Sherman having appeared at the first assizes his recognizances were enlarged.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at 102, Lisson-grove. I was, a short time ago, proprietor of the Opera tavern, in the Haymarket—I am also the champion of England—I remember a young gentleman of the name of Hamp lodging at my brother's, John Broome's, in Air-street, Piccadilly—I remember their going to the Brighton races last year—after that there was a charge made against my brother John, with Staven and James, of cheating Mr. Hamp at cards—I was not at Brighton at the time—I first heard of the charge on 23rd Aug.—I know the defendant—I had never known him before the charge was made against my brother—I first saw him, to speak to him, on 6th March, at an oyster house in the Strand—(I attended at the Spring Assizes at Lewes—I saw Mr. Sill there then, but that was after 6th March)—I was at the Coal-hole tavern, in the Strand, and was sent for—a friend, or relation, of the pro<lb></lb>prietor of the Coal-hole came for me, and I went to Mr. Price's oyster shop, in the Strand—it must have been about 11 o'clock at night, it was Saturday night—I saw Mr. Sill there—he shook hands with me, and said he had been anxious to speak to me for some time—we had several glasses of grog together in the oyster shop; I paid for the greater part of it—Mr. Sill then proposed going to my house, as he could not speak before so many persons—in con<lb></lb>sequence of that I ordered a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and went with Mr. Sill to the Opera tavern—it was near 12, or it might be a little after when we got there: we went into the bar-parlour, my wife was there—she left the room, and when we were alone Mr. Sill said it was he that had carried out this prosecution against my brother; and he also said that he had seen the Secretary of State on the subject, and he had told him that if my brother was convicted he would be transported—he said it was impossible for him to escape, as he had drawn an indictment with thirteen counts, and he could not get through it—our con<lb></lb>versation lasted till 5 in the morning—he said there was just time enough to save my brother, and he could do it; and he also said that he must have for doing it at least 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said he would give me till 2 o'clock on the same</p>

               <p>were, it was what the world thought—my brother said he could give him no more money, and would not allow me to give him any; but in a few minutes after I went out for a bill stamp, and Mr. Sill drew the body of it—it is an order on Taylor and Lloyd, of Birmingham, for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—(<hi rend="italic">reading it</hi>)—my brother said that he had ruined him, he had sacrificed his position, and his character, and he could not submit, or allow me to submit to this extortion, either of us any longer—Mr. Sill said we were well aware of his power with the Secretary of State, and if we did not give him the money he should most certainly carry it into effect—I sent for the bill stamp, because I thought it was better to do so than allow my brother to be sacrificed—the first bills were lying on the table, and my brother asked him to let him look at the bill stamp—in reaching over for it my brother picked them all up, and put them in his pocket—I also retained this 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill—Sill was very much excited, and said if we did not give them up, he would never leave me or my brother until he had transported us—my brother had possession of them, and refused to give them up to Sill—Sill said, "I will give you one other chance before you leave, and if you do not I will make it the bitterest day's work you ever had in your life"—my brother said he might do his best or his worst, be should never give them up, they were his property—we were acting under advice in taking this course—here is another bill (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., drawn by Mr. Sill on Thomas O'Brien—it is in Sill's writing—I had to give him the money—I gave it him on 6th March (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"3rd Oct. 1851, Three months after date, pay to my order 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for value received—to Thomas O'Brien, Esq., Accountant's-office, General Post-office, London. Richard Sill")—on 6th March I gave him the two bills of 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I believed the representations he made to me that he had been to the Secretary of State—I should not have parted with those bills if I had not believed that representation—I should not have parted with the two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-notes, the check for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the check for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., if I had not believed that representation—I all along believed, until 12th April, that Sill had been to the Secretary of State, and that he had the power he represented.</p>

                  </hi>. I know John Broome and the defendant—I was one of the witnesses examined at Brighton against Staven and James, in the case that Mr. Sill was acting as the prosecutor's attorney—I first saw Mr. Sill on the subject of that trial in the early part of Aug., 1851—that was the first examination—I saw Mr. Sill first in London, at the Cheshire Cheese, kept by Mr. Lane, in Marquis-court, Drury-lane—a man named Watkins was with him, and Mr. Hamp, Mr. Jones, the landlord, and Mr. Doyle, the barrister—they were talking the matter over before I went in; and we went from the Cheshire Cheese down to his office—Mr. Hamp said Mr. Sill was go down to Brighton, to get the bills back in the Brighton case—when Mr. Hamp told Sill about the circumstances, he said, "Broome knows nothing about it; he went down with us certainly"—Sill said, "Certainly he went down with us, and you must put him in with them, because he is a monied man, and be can pay the expenses"—on other occasions I have had conversations with Sill about John Broome, when he was in the country, at Bacton, in Herefordshire, where Mr. Hamp lives—that was in Christmas week—he said he could get a good sum of money out of the prosecution, and I was foolish if I did not get the same too—I said I should not do anything of the sort, and told him I knew very well that Mr. Broome was innocent—he said, "Innocent or not, it matters very little; it is what the world thinks of him after what I have done"—afterwards, on 16th March, I attended the trial at the Lewes Assizes—I was bound over to prosecute—I saw Sill on that occasion in the passage of the White Hart, opposite the Court-house—he said he had got a good sum of money and bills out of <hi rend="italic">Harry</hi> Broome; why did not I have some too; and he said, "You will be of great assistance to me if you can persuade him that I have got power with the Secretary of State, as he can transport his brother John"—he said if I could do that, and he could get some more bills for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I was to <hi rend="italic">stand</hi> in, and have one-third—I said I should not do anything of the sort, and said he was quite aware Mr. Hamp had told him that John Broome was innocent of the charge—he said he had completely frightened <hi rend="italic">Harry</hi> Broome by telling him he had seen the Secretary of State, and I was to keep to the same tale—I did not agree to do anything of the sort.</p>

I do not think I ever saw Mr. Sill before—I saw no one at my office who represented himself as Mr. Sill, an attorney, to my recollection—I have seen the card-cheating case at Brighton mentioned in the newspapers, but have not heard of it in any other way—I do not think Mr. Sill ever called on me, or saw me, in reference to any indictment against Mr. Broome and others, for cheating at cards at Brighton; as far as my recollection serves me, he never did—I did not tell Sill that John Broome could be, or would be, trans<lb></lb>ported—to the best of my memory, I never saw him—I never told anybody that John Broome could be transported.</p>

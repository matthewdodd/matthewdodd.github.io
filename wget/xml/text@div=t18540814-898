                  </hi>. I am the wife of Charles Murfin; he is a car<lb></lb>penter, and keeps a beer shop in Golden-lane, Barbican. The prisoner came there on 11th July, at near 10 o'clock at night—he asked for a pot of beer, and after I drew it he wanted a pint; he threw down a half crown—I gave him one shilling, two sixpences, and fourpence in change—I put the half crown in the till—there was no other half crown there—I afterwards found it was bad—I called my husband, and gave it him—I marked the half crown on the edge with my teeth, and put it on a shelf—I afterwards put it in a drawer—I gave it to the policeman on the Friday following.</p>

                  </hi>. I am daughter of the last witness. I saw the prisoner there on the Tuesday night, and my mother gave him change for a half crown—on the Thursday he came, and gave me a bad sixpence for a pint of beer—I gave him change, and put the sixpence on the shelf till my mother came down—I thought it looked rather dull—my mother came down in five or six minutes, and I took the sixpence from the shelf and gave it her—I am sure it was what I had from the prisoner.</p>

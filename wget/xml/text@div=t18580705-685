                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. David Swaefe, of No. 9, Bishopsgate Street; he is a tobacconist. The prisoner has been a customer at the shop—on Friday, 11th June, he came, about half past 12 o'clock; he asked for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of cigars, and Mr. Swaefe's son served him—I did not see him served; I came into the shop about half past 12 o'clock, and saw him sitting smoking a cigar on a stool by the side of the counter—shortly afterwards I went to hang up my coat, and I saw Rogers in the back room, watching—in consequence of what he said, I watched—I commanded a view of the prisoner; I saw him take one cigar from between the box and the counter case, and put it into his left hand trousers pocket—I went up to him, and said, "You ought to be ashamed of yourself coming here as a friend and a customer, and stealing cigars;" he said, "What do you mean?"—I said, "All the time you have been sitting here, you have been taking cigars"—I sent for Mr. Swaefe, and told him, in the prisoner's presence, what had happened—the prisoner did not say anything then; at the station, he spoke about paying—Rogers went and brought a policeman, and the prisoner was taken to the station.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you not known him to take cigars just as he thought proper, and pay the next day? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He did so once; he always picked them out himself, and he would sit and chat and smoke there—I heard Mr. Swaefe say that he was perfectly satisfied that the prisoner had no intention to steal—young Mr. Swaefe was close by the prisoner when he took the cigars, and could have seen him take them—the prisoner is a foreigner; he speaks middling English.</p>

CAARTEN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> After you observed the prisoner take this cigar, who was the first person that spoke to him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did; Rogers went for Mr. Swaefe—I sent for a policeman, by Mr. Swaefe's direction—I remained with the prisoner from the time I spoke to him till he was removed—I heard him offer to pay for the cigars, when he was given in charge and the constable came—he offered to pay when he got to the station, or perhaps it might have been in going across the road; it is just by—I was at the first examination; Mr. Swaefe said that he had made inquiries, and he did not believe he intended to steal them, but, notwithstanding that, he was sent for trial by the Lord Mayor.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Swaefe. I was in his shop on 11th June—I saw the prisoner come in—he asked for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of cigars, and Mr. Swaefe's son served him—he was served with seven; he lit one and put six in his pocket, which were wrapped in paper—he remained smoking in the shop—I went into the back room, and saw him draw at least half a dozen cigars from between the box and the counter case—one contains threepenny, and the other fourpenny cigars, and while they are selected from one box they are laid on the other, and some dropped between the two—he drew them out one by one with two splints, and put them into his left trousers pocket—while I was so watching, Howes came in—I called his attention to it—I did not see the prisoner do anything after that.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were these on the counter? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes. I think young Mr. Swaefe is about sixteen years old—I was in the room all the time—I did not go out and say anything to young Mr. Swaefe—I did not go and ask him whether he was paid for these cigars—I knew the prisoner was in the habit of coming and picking cigars out—I believe that was done with the authority of Mr. Swaefe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do not you know that he has taken cigars and come back the next day and paid for them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have never seen him; I know it has happened—there was nobody but young Mr. Swaefe in the shop when he came—he is not here because he has the house and shop to attend to—I did not hear him say that he had been offered to be paid.</p>

Between 12 and 1 o'clock on 11th June, the prisoner was given into my custody, in Bishopsgate Street Without, close by Mr. Swaefe's door, by Howes and the other witness, and Mr. Swaefe followed—as soon as I got the prisoner in the station he pulled these eight cigars out of his pocket, and said, "Here are the cigars that I have stolen"—I searched him, and found these six cigars wrapped in a piece of paper—he said, "These are the cigars that I have bought"—I found on him a gold guard chain, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in money, two duplicates, one of a gold guard chain for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and one of a watch—when the prisoner made use of those words, I think Mr. Swaefe was present; the two witnesses were.</p>

I do not know whether the prisoner is a German, he spoke good English—he did not say, "These are the cigars I took," he said, "These are the cigars that I have stolen, and these are the cigars I have bought"—he did not say,"These are the cigars that they say I have stolen," he said, "These are the cigars that I have stolen"—the case was remanded for a week that I might make inquiry about the things that were found on him—I inquired of persons who knew him well, and found him to hear a respectable character—I inquired of several foreigners, and they gave him a good character, and were surprised to hear he should act so—in con<lb></lb>sequence of that, I gave up the things that I found on him—I did not make any memorandum of what the prisoner said—he said, as soon as I got him to the station, "These are the cigars I have stolen," and at the same time making the remark, "I ought to be hang'd;" and he repeated that several times, and likewise at the Mansion House as well; not before the Lord Mayor, he said it down in the cell, in presence of one of the officers—I did not hear Mr. Swaefe say that he had made inquiries and he believed it was quite a mistake—I did not hear him say there was no foundation for the charge—he said that he was perfectly satisfied, he thought he had been punished enough; he had made inquiries, and he was going into a foreign part, and he would forgive him.</p>

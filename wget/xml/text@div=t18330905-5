            ; we went to the Gun public-house, Shoreditch, and had a quartern of rum - the prisoner was standing at the bar - I had never seen him before, but I am certain of him - while I was having the rum, he put his hand on my shoulder; I pushed it off and drank the rum, and came out of the public-house; I cannot say whether he came out before me or after me - I had a necklace of seven rows of coral beads on my neck - when I came out, a young man outside took hold of my necklace; when I got a few doors from the public-house, the prisoner snatched them off my neck, and ran away with them - Steel was on a little before me at that time; I was a little distance from the public-house, walking along, when the prisoner took hold of my necklace, that is all he did - I fell down, because the way of his catching hold of the necklace, threw me down on my back; he did not get the necklace off till I fell on the ground, because it got entangled with my cap-strings; he got it off before he ran away - he did not strike me, he threw me down; it was by pulling the necklace that he threw me down.</p>
               <p>Q. After losing it, what did you do? A. I had been to my mother's before I lost it, and I returned there again; one of the officers picked me up - I lost sight of the prisoner and went to my mother's, and one of the officers came there - he had the prisoner outside the door; I went to the station-house, and saw the prisoner; he is the man, I am quite sure - Sergeant Grove had my necklace.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Were you in liquor or not? A. I was the worse for what I had had.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Could you walk straight? A. Yes; I was sober enough to distinguish the person of the prisoner- I have not a doubt but he is the man; Steel was near enough to see him.</p>

            . I was at the Gun with Jennings, on the night in question; we had some liquor there - she was rather the worse for liquor, and so was I; I saw the prisoner in the house - he is the man; he put his arm on her neck, and played with the lock of her beads; I asked her to give me the beads, and I would take care of them until she got home; because I thought I was more sober than she was - I went out before her, and was on a few yards before her; I turned round, and saw her down on the ground - nobody was near her then, because the prisoner had then ran away; I saw the prisoner, because I hallooed out "Stop thief" after him.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it was him? A. He was against her when they came out of the public-house - he was close to her; and when I saw her on the ground, I saw him running away; it was about twelve o'clock - I hallooed out "Stop thief" after him, and ran after him; he turned round Austin-street, and I lost sight of him - I went to the station-house the same night, and saw him, and was certain it was the same man; I have not a doubt about him.</p>

            . I am a policeman. On the night of the 18th of July, I was on duty in High-street, Shoreditch - I heard the cry of "Stop thief," from a female, and saw a man run round Shoreditch-church, and turn down Austin-street - I looked, and saw the prosecutrix laying on the ground; I ran over and helped her up- I then pursued the man as quick as possible; I lost sight of him when he turned down Collingwood-street - I was forty or fifty yards behind him; and it is a very dark street - my brother officer, (H 125,) came up, and we went to No. 12, Collingwood-street, knocked at the door, and an old man let us in; I saw the prisoner coming out of the back yard - I could see his countenance then, and told him I wanted him for the coral beads - he said he had not been out for an hour - he was then very much out of breath; quite exhausted with running so fast - he had got his hat and coat off then; he was so out of breath, he could hardly speak - the man I saw running before, had his hat and coat on; I took him into the front room, and gave my lanthorn to Grove, and told him, in the prisoner's hearing, to search all the back yards over, and to search the privy, as the prisoner said he had just been to the privy - I kept him in my custody till he was locked up.</p>

I was at the end of Collingwood-street on duty, about twelve o'clock at night; and the prisoner ran past me at a very quick pace - I could see his face as he passed close by me; I am sure he is the man - he went up Collingwood-street, and from the manner he ran, I thought something was wrong - he knocked at the door, No. 12, in the street - I spoke to him at the door; I saw him go into the house when it was opened; he told me a girl had scratched his face - he came from Shoreditch Church.</p>

               <p>JURY. Q. Had you been drinking together in the public-house? A. No; I knew nothing of him - I gave the liquor to a young woman, who tried to make herself known to me - but I did not know her, and I believe she gave it to him to sip, but not in my presence - I never saw him before.</p>

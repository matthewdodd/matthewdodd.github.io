            . I am clerk to Mr. Horne in Well-close-square; I had a parcel of goods come up by the Birmingham stage . I received advice of their coming, and went to the stage, and the book-keeper told me he had delivered them into the care of a porter. I went home, but did not receive them that night. I went next morning and inquired, and was informed by the porter there was a parcel directed for me, but that it was stolen from him .</p>

When I came up again, the prisoner who came there before I went down was gone, and one of my parcels: that directed to Jecocks . There were none in the house but another woman and the prisoner, and they were both gone, and had left their beer behind them, and the boy that draw'd the beer, he knew the prisoner.

The next day, she being in liquor, took the bundle and opened it, and I saw a ruffled shirt she took out of it.</p>
               <p>Septimius Moseen. I am watchman and warder, in Aldgate-ward , the prisoner came to me at the watch-house on the 9th or 10th of August, about 12 at night; she wanted me to let her come in, saying she would send for half a dozen of beer: No, I said, I do not choose it, but said she might sit on the stone steps, and no body should hurt her. She came to the watch-house door, and made me a present of a silver thimble for my daughter. When she was taken up, and before my lord mayor, I produced the thimble. There was Mr. Jecocks, he desired to look at the thimble. There was a young woman there that claimed the thimble, and described it to have a bruise in it before she saw it.</p>

            . I lived with Miss Musgrave on Christmas-eve, and have been twenty-two months in her service; I know Adams and Mealing - I have seen Mealing at the house twice. On Christmas-eve I let in Adams, and Mary Mealing was with him; Adams staid in the kitchen about an hour and a half, or three quarters - we drank some liquor, and played at cards together; Adams did not leave the kitchen after we began to play at cards, but before that,(after he came in) he went out alone for some gin and cloves, and when he returned he rang the bell; I went up and let him in - he had let himself out; about half an hour after we began to play at cards, I heard a noise outside the house, and a whistle; I went into the area to look, but could see nothing - I heard the front door slam too about an hour after that: Adams was with me at that time - I said, "What door is that? it sounds like our street-door;" and told him to come up stairs with me to see - he came up, and after searching some other rooms, I went to mistress' bed-room, found the cupboard door open, and several things laying about the floor; the parlours and drawing-room were not disturbed - I ran down stairs, and called the Police; Adams was with me, and assisted in calling them - Bond and Bates came; I know this plate.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you known Adams before he was in the service? A. No; I lived there all the time with him - he bore an honest character; he assisted me to call the Police when I discovered the robbery.</p>

               <p>Q. Did she say if her property was found, she would freely pardon the party? A. I believe that was said, but he denied all knowledge of it - Adams did not see her after that, except at the office.</p>

I saw Adams in the watch-house - he told me he wished to have pen, ink, and paper; I neither threatened, nor promised him any thing - I saw him write this paper; I told him to be careful of what he wrote, as it might come against him -I have the paper he wrote; when I cautioned him to be careful, he said it was his intention to write to Mealing, the girl who was up stairs, because she was innocent - he wrote this paper; I saw Mary Mealing afterwards, and in consequence of what passed between me and her, I went in a coach to Rochester-row, and apprehended the prisoner Mealing - while I was handcuffing him, Bates and Bond came in; I told Mealing his sister was in trouble: when I first went in, he stood and looked at me - I said, "It is concerning some plate of Miss Musgrave's," and that I apprehended him on suspicion of being concerned in the robbery; he positively denied knowing any thing about it - I took him to the watch-house, and in the watch-house he asked me to allow him pencil and paper to write to Adams, which I allowed him; I held out neither threat nor promise to him - I saw him write a paper, which I produce; I did not tell him to be cautious what he wrote - in consequence of something, I went to Appleyard's, No. 6, Princes-row, broke open a chest, and found this basket, containing the plate produced - it was afterwards shown to the prosecutrix, who identified it; (papers read) -</p>
               <p>Mary, I am sorry to inform you that I am guilty, but you and Mary are quite innocent; I hope you will be liberated by this - my partner is one that is a near relation to you.</p>

            . I am the wife of William Appleyard - we live at No. 16, Princes-row, Lambeth. I know the prisoner Mealing - he went by the name of Warren; he did not lodge at my house - my husband worked with him this time twelve months; I had seen him at our house: the chest the officer broke open belonged to him - he asked my husband to let it stand at our house; I was not present then, but have seen him go to the chest - his tools were in it; he was not very often at our house; he used to come to bring his tools - I did not see him on Christmas-day, when he came in, as I was very ill, but I heard his voice, and was perfectly certain it was him; I asked him to breakfast - he said, "No thank you, there is a man waiting for me in the road;" I desired him to call at the new chapel to ask my husband to come home to breakfast; he just stepped into the back parlour - his chest was in the kitchen; I was in the front parlour - he might have gone to the kitchen without my knowledge - he could have gone through the passage: the Policeman came to my house next day - I saw him break open the chest, and find these articles.</p>

            . I am the son of the last witness, and am going on for thirteen years old. I knew Mealing by the name of Warren, and have seen him at my father's house - I saw him there on Christmas-day, about nine<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183001140010"></xptr>o'clock in the morning; I let him in, and observed that he had a basket under the skirts of his coat - he went into the kitchen to his tool-chest, and I went into the parlour to my mother; I did not see him come out of the kitchen he stepped into the back parlour, and had a large handscrew in his hand - that was not in his hand when he went into the kitchen; my mother asked him to stop to breakfast - he said he could not, because he had a young man waiting for him; I could not identify the basket again - I only saw the bottom of it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You saw him go into the kitchen with the basket - when he came into the parlour had he the basket? A. No - I could not see whether any thing was in the basket.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM CHURCH. I am a Police-constable. On Christmas-eve I was on duty in Green-street, where Miss Musgrave lives, and saw the prisoner Mealing directly opposite her house, between nine and half-past nine o'clock - it was after nine; I saw him twice within the half-hour in the same street - when I first saw him he was standing there with his hands in his pockets; I walked by him - he turned his back, and walked away deliberately; on seeing him the second time he was in the same street - I saw him all along the street; he came deliberately up the street, and passed Miss Musgrave's house: on observing me he mended his pace, and walked very quick towards Park-lane - I never saw him before, but have not the least doubt of him; I cannot be mistaken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q. What kind of a night was it? A. The street is very light with gas; I only saw him twice to notice him - it was merely in passing by that I noticed him; I saw him again at the first examination at Marlborough-street, on the Saturday - I took particular notice of him, having suspicion, as I saw him walk down the street, and then return: I swear to his person.</p>
               <p>JOHN FREDERICK CLEMENTS re-examined. I found this basket in the chest, with an apron covered over the plate - it was all thrown into the basket, with the jewellery and different things in a bag.</p>
               <p>MISS MUSGRAVE. The basket does not belong to me- I had seen the property some days before, it was locked in a chest; I am certain it was in my room when I went out, according to my idea - another key was taken out of a drawer to open the closet, and also keys to open the chest.</p>
               <p>Q.When can you take upon yourself to say the chest was actually locked? A. Some days previous - I did not use the plate in that box every day; this chisel does not belong to me - I never saw it till that night.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM APPLEYARD. It appeared to be a basket of this sort.</p>
               <p>Adam's Defence. I doubt whether it will be of any use, but the prosecutrix has denied what she promised on the night of the robbery - Clements has denied what he told me when I wrote what I have, and Bates the same; Mr. Monteith and Captain 
               <persName id="t18300114-5-person160">Monteith</persName>
             came home with the prosecutrix on the night of the robbery - and Mr. Monteith said, "William, do you hear what Miss Musgrave says? if the property is restored she will forgive all." and Bates told me the more I said the better it would be for me - I told him the young women were innocent, and it was wrong for the innocent to suffer for the guilty - he said it was; I told him the promise the prosecutrix had made, and he said, "She may consider of it."</p>

               <p>Mealing's Defence. I am innocent of the robbery - I was at another place that evening, and expect I have witnesses to say where I was; the property might be put into my chest, but not by me, nor had I the key of the chest at the time.</p>
               <p>MRS. APPLEYARD. The chest had been at my house since August or September - he had the key himself.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Mealing. The person I stated was outside the door, when she asked me to stop breakfast, is the person who had the key of my chest, and brought in what was found there, the basket and plate; that basket was never in my possession - he asked me to take care of them; I would not have them - I said, "You may put them into my chest if you like, here is the key;" while I was talking to Mrs. Appleyard I suppose he came in, and put them into my chest privately - I was at Mr. Francis', Spread Eagle, Lambeth-road; I slept there on the night of the robbery - I got there at twenty minutes or a quarter before ten o'clock; it was my handscrew that I got from the chest.</p>

             re-examined. Q. You say he said there was a man waiting for him at the door, did you see whether there was any man at the door? A. No - I am sure nobody came into the house but Mealing; nobody but him went into the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Mealing. Q.When you let me in you went into the parlour to your mother? A. Yes - I shut the door; I do not know whether I shut it close.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Mealing. While I was speaking to his mother in the parlour, a person came in; I believe the boy was in the parlour at the time.</p>

               <p>I live at No. 9, in Golden-lane; I was at my one-pair-of-stairs window at the time Mr. Murphy's house was pulled down, and saw the whole transaction. I saw the prisoner go into the house; he laid hold of the window frames and pulled and wrenched them to pieces; he and others, who assisted him, after that when the window frames were out there was a clear opening. He, with the assistance of others, throwed the front tap-room table into the street, which I have sat at many times; after that he and another destroyed the leaden sink, and they threw it into the street; then I saw him in the one-pair-of-stairs room with a bludgeon or something of that kind in his hand, helping to destroy a partition there; then he, with the assistance of others, threw out a large bureau bedstead, big enough to hold two persons.</p>
               <p>Did you know the prisoner before? - Several years; I have shaved him in my shop. I am sorry to see him here; I cautioned him to be out of the way.</p>
               <p>How was the house? - Demolished from the top to the bottom; the front window was beat down.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When I went into the house every thing was turned into the street. A gentleman desired me to go into the house. He said if they pulled the partition wall of the house down the house would come down. I went in to save the house. After this man had sworn against me before I was taken up he wanted me to run away, several people desired me to run away, but I would not.</p>
               <p>Did you see him when the mob first came? - Pretty near the first.</p>
               <p>How long had they began before you saw him? - I believe about a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>What time was it when you saw him? - It might be pretty near seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>When was the first time you told any per son that you had seen the prisoner there? - On the Tuesday following, the 13th, I went into a house, Mr. Murphy was there. He said he was told I could tell him of some body who had done him a deal of damage. I said yes Markess had.</p>
               <p>How came you not to tell any body sooner? - I did not choose to injure any neighbour; my bread depends upon that. When I was asked I could not in my conscience keep it.</p>
               <p>Had you heard of the reward before you told Murphy this? - No, nor do I want any.</p>
               <p>Had not you seen the king's proclamation? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you expect or claim any reward? - No, I want no other than God Almighty's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178006280188"></xptr> reward for what I am doing; I only wish to do justice between man and man.</p>

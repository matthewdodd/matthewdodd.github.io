On 2d July I was acting as barmaid at the Three Colts, Cambridge-road, Bethual-green, kept by my uncle—the prisoner came in about 12 o'clock, and I served him with a quartern of gin; he gave me a shilling, I gave him the change, and put it in the till; there were two or three other shillings there—he drank the gin, and left—in about ten minutes he returned, and asked for more gin—I served him with a quartern, the price was fivepence—he gave me a half-crown; I put it in the till where</p>

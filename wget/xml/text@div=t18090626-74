            . I am a turner, I live opposite Mr. Cotton. On the 21st of June, about two o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the other one that was with the prisoner take the kettles from Mr. Cotton's door; he gave them to the prisoner, and the prisoner ran away with them; I followed the prisoner, he dropped them in Spital square; I did not see the prisoner stopped. I am sure he is the man that dropped the kettles, and he is the person to whom the other one gave the kettles to.</p>

            . On Wednesday the 21st of June, about two o'clock, I was coming along Spital-square. I heard the sound of some kettles drop, I did not see them. The prisoner and his accomplice turned the corner opposite of me, he was pursued by the cry of stop thief; the prisoner desired me not to stop him. I pursued him through Spital-square, into Elder-street; I went to catch hold of his accomplice, he said I am not the man, and cried stop thief; the prisoner was foremost; he was going to turn the corner of Flower-de-luce-court, a man was close to him, I desired him to stop him; he did, and delivered him into my custody; I brought him back to Mr. Cotton's; the other made his escape.</p>

I was walking up Bishopgate-street, I met this boy with the kettles in his arms; he put the kettles into my arms; I would not take them, so he dropped them in the square; they began to holloa out stop thief; he holloaed out stop thief; I was running; a gentleman stopped me.</p>

When we had got our business settled, we came down and had two glasses more each; a glass of rum, and brandy. We then took a cab and went up to Shoreditch, and went into the Norfolk Arms, a public-house there; we had a pint of rum there; there were five of us; Robson, this man's name-sake, had the handkerchief and money in his hand; he handed this Robson the money and told him he would not keep it for him any longer: he said to me, "Here, Tom Smith, take care of this till to-morrow morning;" I took the money; I had it in my hand; I sat there about 10 minutes after I got the money; there were a good many there: Crawley went out of the house, and I followed him out; when I got out I could not see Robsou, so I said, "Let us go down to the East India House;" we took a cab and I said. "I had better put this money in my pocket." I did so; I had the handkerchief in my hand; my arm was hanging over the window, and I dropped the handkerchief. I was then taken by the police; the money he got as correct as he gave it to me.</p>

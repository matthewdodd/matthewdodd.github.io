                  </hi>. I live at 4, Finch Street, Prick Lane, and am the wife of Thomas Mathews—on the evening of 11th September, I was sitting at my work, when the prisoner walked into the room, caught hold of me by the throat, and said "You b----thing I have got you, and I will do for you," and he fired a pistol at me as I sat in my chair; I could not in my fright tell how he pointed it; he fired at my head, he still had me by the throat with one hand—I dodged my head and screamed, and slipped down—I then got up and struggled with him into the middle of the room, when he fired again—I got away from him and ran down stairs, and fired at me again as I was going down the stairs—he did not hit me—I ran into the front parlour, Mr. Horton, the shoe maker, was there—the prisoner followed me and gave me several kicks and blows, he caught hold of me and threw her down, and then kicked me—he gave me blows on the head and body with a shoe maker's last and a hammer—I became insensible; when I came to my senses I was in the street—I was wounded in my arm and finger, and likewise my head—I was bleeding—I was taken to the hospital—I did not see the prisoner again till he was in custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner married by daughter—I had not had any quarrel with him that day, I had not seen him since I had him up at Wor<lb></lb>ship Street, two mouths before; that was for attempting his wife's life—the magistrate dismissed that case, he did nothing to him; I did not give evi<lb></lb>dence, my daughter did—he pretends to be a teetotaller; I do not, nor my daughter—this happened at 7.45 in the evening—I had not been drinking that day, I was hard at work, my husband was at home all day, he is at night work—I believe the pistol is a single barrelled one—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the pistol I saw after I came from the hospital—he rushed into the room, rushed up to me at once and put the pistol quite close to my face and fired it—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187404070089"></xptr>
               <p>I saw fire come from it, I saw the flash quite distinctly—I got up, he still having hold of me by the throat with one hand, and struggled into the middle of the room, and he put the pistol close to my head again and fired again; I saw the flash again—and as I was running down stairs he fired a third time, almost directly—our house is in a street, there is a paved yard to the house, no garden—there are no small stones underneath the window of my room, the yard goes into the stable—five persons live in the house; none of them went into the stable yard after the pistol had been fired, they could not get in, it is locked up, partitioned off from the yard: they could not get into the yard where the small stones are, there is a gate to it—there are no small stones in our yard, there are plenty in the street—no one ran into the street after the firing—I was kicked about my legs and body—I was not so much hurt by the kicking, but I was bruised all over—I did not show the doctor the bruises, or say anything about them—I was not long in the hospital, only to have my head dressed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I had the prisoner up at Arbour Square once, that was for something done to my daughter—he attempted to cut my throat once—I went to Dr. Squires—that is better than twelve months ago—he has been married to my daughter about eighteen months, but she has been parted from him twelve months, and is at service—he got off at Worship Street by his false tongue—he was charged with trying to break into my room to kill his wife, but he did not succeed in breaking in—he had not touched her, but she was in danger of her life.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He put the pistol as close as he could to her head and fired twice, the second time almost directly after the first, and as close to her face as it could be, and without loosing her throat—I distinctly heard a third report as he was going down stairs—I did not see the child find the pistol, she said she found it, and she gave it to me—I don't know whether there are any small stones about there, there is a long passage be<lb></lb>tween the street-door and the yard—the prisoner was not in the house when the pistol was given to me—Mrs. Matthews was in Horton's room bleeding when I went down, she was saturated; all her dress—there was a vast quantity of blood, an enormous quantity; floor and all.</p>

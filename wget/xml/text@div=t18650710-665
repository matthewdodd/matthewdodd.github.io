                  </hi>. I live at Stroud's-vale, Clerkenwell—I know the prisoner quite well, I brought him up from a boy—on the night of 9th June, between 10 and 11 at night, I was near my own place—the prisoner came up to me and we were quarrelling about a few words that had occurred in the morning, some <hi rend="italic">tittle tattle</hi> about the women—the prisoner heard me talking to another party about him, and he said I was telling a lie—I said, "if I am telling a lie ask the woman whether it is a lie, or whether it is the truth"—the witness, Mrs. Masters, said, "I am quite prepared for your wife now"—with that he came and said, "I don't want women to fight, I will fight you"—he put his fist in my face as a kind of challenge—I accepted his challenge, and hit him, and we both fought together in the court—we fought one round, and in the second round I felt a heavy blow in my head, where it came from I do not know—I became partly insensible—on recover<lb></lb>ing I felt blood—I believe I bled a great deal—I went to the hospital—I was sober, and I believe the prisoner was—it was very dark—it was all through the women that this occurred—I have known the lad from a child,</p>

I am resident surgeon at the Great Northern hospital—the prosecutor came there about a quarter to 11, on the night of 9th June, bleeding profusely from a wound in the temple—an artery was severed—it was a very dangerous wound—he was wounded in other parts of his body—I made out eleven wounds and his wife discovered three others since, those were mere scratches—they must have been done with a sharp instrument; an ordinary clasp-knife would have done it—four of them were considerable wounds, very deep, the temporal artery was cut in two places—he must have lost a great deal of blood, there was a track the whole way from the hospital to Stroud's-vale.</p>

               <p>On the evening of Monday the 7th of February, I passed through Covent Garden, meaning to turn down Bridges-street, but the carriages were so thick I did not go down; I went down Little Russel-street, which leads into Drury-lane: I was quite alone; I had at that time, a gold watch, a ribbon with a medallion with hair set in gold, three stone seals set in gold, and one base metal watch key gilt with gold, one guinea in gold, and twenty shillings in silver; when I was in Russel-street, I took my watch-chain and buttoned it in my breeches pocket, I had not seen my money since I left Manchester-square, but I know I had it that afternoon; I buttoned my coat to the bottom, and put my hands in my coat pockets, and covered my breeches pockets with my coat pockets; I intended to go these men, I saw eight or ten men pushing about at the month of a court, which is directly opposite to the stage door of <placeName id="t17850223-13-crimeloc69">Drury-lane</placeName>

               <p>Was the prisoner one of these two or three people? - No, certainly not.</p>
               <p>Did you keep your hands in your pockets, Sir, all the time, or how long? - I kept my hands in my pockets some time, I cannot speak with any certainty as to the time, but I took them out to secure myself, as I was pushed about for the space of two minutes; I am quite sure the prisoner was one who pushed me, when I was amongst these people, I knew him again the next morning; I was raised off my legs, I was apprehensive I should lose my balance and fall under the horses feet; they got under my arm and raised me up.</p>
               <p>In what manner was you lifted up, with a degree of violence? - Very much so, I suspected what the case was, and I was determined to keep my hands on my pockets as long as I could; on putting my hands down again, which I did instantly, I found my left hand pocket turned inside out; I put my right hand down, and in putting it down, I caught a man's wrist, I almost instantly put down my left hand, but not my right quite so soon; my money was in breeches pocket, and putting down my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230044"></xptr> right hand I caught a man's wrist, I cannot say whether in my pocket or not.</p>
               <p>Court. Whereabouts did you catch that hand? - I cannot say with any certainty I put my hand down to secure my pocket, and I caught hold of his wrist that was the hand of the prisoner; I kept hold of his hand four or five minutes before I secured him, the moment I got hold of him, one or two pressed upon me, I reached my left hand over them, and caught him by the collar, I held him there for some time, the rest attempting to get him out of my hand by all the means they possibly could.</p>
               <p>Did any conversation pass at this time between the prisoner, whose hand you caught, and the other man? - Oh, frequently, the words,</p>
               <p>"pull him up the court," or</p>
               <p>"pull me up the court," were frequently repeated; the prisoner was talking to them the whole time: I have no recollection of what the prisoner said, they repeatedly spoke to one another, the prisoner seemed very anxious to escape, he turned his head the other way; I tore his coat entirely off his back, and his shirt too before I got him secured; I called out repeatedly for assistance, but I believe the Horse Guards dare not dismount, as the King and Queen were expected out; the prisoner's coat, and part of his shirt, and part of his neckcloth came off in my hand; the moment I got him out, I had him in my left hand, and he got from me a little way, about a yard or two I suppose; I immediately sprung after him, and caught hold of him by the hair of his head, and pulled him backwards as well as I could, and I believe at that moment one of the guards dismounted, and I dragged him between the horses; I am sure this is the man, I never lost him for an instant, except that moment that he was out of my hand, and I caught him again; when I dragged him between the horses, two of his companions followed me between there.</p>
               <p>Were these two of the men you saw pushing? - I cannot say, though I have very little doubt of it in fact; one man struck me twice on my breast very hard, so hard that if he had had room for a blow he must have knocked me down, that was evidently with intent, to rescue him; one man I should know again where I saw him, I went him to the

            , and there I searched him, I found nothing on him.</p>
               <p>Did he say any thing? - He forced his discourse to me, and said Townsend I never was near the gentleman at all, I am not guilty; his cloaths were torn very much.</p>
               <p>Had you come up to the crowd by that time? - Yes, I suppose not above a minute<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230045"></xptr> or before; I was at the crossing where the robberies generally are done, and there was such a mob, and so many coaches, I could not get up at any rate, till I came almost to the corner of Bow-street; when I received a blow from the prosecutor, I was close to the corner of Bow-street, the prisoner was then in custody of Blandy, I did not see the prisoner and the prosecutor at any time, till I saw the prisoner in custody.</p>
               <p>Are you quite sure as to the person of the prisoner at the bar? - Yes, I am.</p>
               <p>Mr. Keys. How long have you bee n an officer at the office? - Two years.</p>
               <p>You know there is a reward? - I dare say you would not wish me to say I do not.</p>
               <p>So the prosecutor mistook you for one of the gang, and hit you a blow on the breast? - He did hit me.</p>
               <p>There was a vast croud of people? - A great number, as there always is.</p>
               <p>When the King and Queen are there, the crowd is greater than ordinary? - Yes, certainly.</p>
               <p>Then how many people do you imagine there may be generally about the stage door, when the King and Queen are coming out? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Several hundreds? - I do not say that.</p>
               <p>Are there a hundred? - I cannot say on my oath.</p>
               <p>Are there fifty? - There may, fifty is a great many.</p>
               <p>You found nothing on this man? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Abbot. Pray whereabouts was that crowd that you mentioned? - Opposite where the King comes out.</p>
               <p>Where were you struck? - Just by the corner of Bow-street.</p>

               <p>I am a corporal in the Life Guards, I was on guard at the Play-house, nearly opposite the door where the King comes out, my face was towards the Play-house door.</p>
               <p>Did you see any croud in the street at that time, before you or behind you? - I did not see much, I heard a bustling several times there, I turned my head round, and saw a gentleman, the prosecutor who stands there, in distress; I called to him once or twice, and made an interval to get him between our horses; the prosecutor was a little to the right of me, but he was so engaged he could not pay attention to me.</p>
               <p>What was he about? - I saw that they were going to do him an injury, I drew my sword, and cut at several of them with the broad part of my sword, they appeared to me to be shoving him about; as I was using my sword and hitting them over the arms and shoulders, the prosecutor called to me, and said, soldier, I have got hold of the man that robbed me, I beg you will assist me to take him; I returned my sword into the sheath, and seized the prisoner at the bar behind the neck, I am sure of the prisoner; the captain called to me and asked what we were doing, upon that I let my hold go, and says to my comrade, get off your horse and assist the gentleman to take him, he got off and secured him; the prisoner was brought into the line and carried across the street; two men followed him, but I said to them, if you do not go back, I will cut you down.</p>
               <p>Did these two men appear to you to come to assist the gentleman? - It did not appear so to me, it was not very easy to pass backwards and forwards.</p>
               <p>Did the people you saw behind you appear to be passing onwards or backwards? - It was impossible for any body to pass by at that minute.</p>
               <p>Mr. Keys. There generally is at that time a number of people to see their Majesties come out? - Yes, it is very usual when they are just expected.</p>
               <p>Then a person might be very honestly pushing and shoving to get that sight, without any bad intention whatever, that is a thing that frequently happens? - I saw no great pushing, they were looking with their faces that way, I saw no shoving but by this party, but I have seen people crowd; I had my eye on this transaction about half a minute, before I was called to make the observation I did; my attention is directed to the King and Queen when they are coming out.</p>

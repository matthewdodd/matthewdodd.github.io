                  </hi>. On 15th December I was lodging in Aldersgate Street—I had been visiting a friend, as I was walking along I saw a shadow moving behind me—I saw the two prisoners and two other men behind—as they approached one of them struck me on the shoulder and knocked my hat off—I can't say which one it was—they then knocked me down and broke my arm—they fell on me, knelt on me, and pulled my pockets inside-out—my money was in the right-hand trousers pocket—they took 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. out of that pocket—I called out "Murder!" and "Police!" and they ran down a court—a policeman came up and stopped the two prisoners; in a few moments another policeman came, and the other one gave one of them into his charge—I knew them directly—I had 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. left in my pocket.</p>

Between two and three o'clock on Sunday morning, the 15th December, I was in Lamb's Place, White-cross Street—I heard a cry of "Murder!" and "Police!"—I went in the direction of the cries up Cherry Tree Court—I saw the prisoner Donovan running down the court—I took him into custody—Osborn came down directly afterwards, and I took him—there were two others, but they got away—I then took them in the direction where I heard the cries—I saw the prosecutor, and gave one of the prisoners into his custody—when he saw the prisoners he charged them with robbing him—neither of them said anything—I took them to the station—I then went back to the court and found a hat five or six yards from where I took the prisoners, the prosecutor identified the hat as his property—I found 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on Donovan—I also found 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on the ground.</p>

I am a surgeon, and live at 86, Curtal Street—I was called to the station on the 15th, and found the prosecutor with his arm broken; I set it—very great violence must have been used—I found other marks of great violence, I can't say whether the blows were inflicted with the fist or some weapon.</p>

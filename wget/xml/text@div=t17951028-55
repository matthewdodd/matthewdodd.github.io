I was informed by my shopman, that he had missed a piece of print, and had made diligent search for it, and could not find it. I applied to the police office in Worship street, offering a reward of five guineas if they should meet with the print in their walks. I applied to Harper, Monday, October the twelfth, I believe about the middle of the day. I heard nothing from them respecting the prints, but on Wednesday, the fourteenth, a gentleman came to my house, and in consequence of information, I went to the public office, in Goodman's-fields, on the fourteenth, and I see the very print there that I had lost. I think it was in the afternoon, in Little Ailiff-street, Goodman's fields; the officers has kept it. The prosecutor's husband has applied to me since, and offered.</p>

               <p>I am apprentice to Mr. Gibson. The prisoner is the person that was in the shop on Friday, the second of this month, between six and seven in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your master? - A linen-draper.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed when she was in the shop, was any body else in the shop? -Only the young men that serve in the shop, no customers.</p>

               <p>Q. How many shopmen had you in the shop? - Three other persons in the shop besides myself. When she came in, she desired me to shew her some prints for a servant's gown. I shewed her several,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179510280089"></xptr> she begged me to shew her some my lock stripes, which I did, and after I had shewn her a great quantity, she refused having them, said they would not wash, and were not sit for a servant. I then were going to turn over the prints to shew her some that were among the laylock stripes, and she said, no, I will not have it, reach me that off the hinder shelf, then she desired me to cut her six yards of it, after that she opened a pocket book, and took out a pattern, and asked me if we had any thing to match that? we had nothing like to the pattern, but I shewed her one which she approved of better than her pattern, which was a remnant of eight yards. She then looked over two or three others, which she hung down the sides, to see which would look best, She had a little child with her, which was very troublesome, and she made a sad shuffling about the shop. She threw her down some halfpence, and she was for ten minutes picking up these. After I had served her, she begged of me to do up the things in two parcels, for one she durst not carry home, because she said Mr. Smith would not approve of it; I asked her whether I should send the parcel home? she said no, she said she lived in Prince's-street, Spital-fields; I opened the door, and wished her a good evening. She bought a gown for her servant, a remnant of eight yards of print, and a petticoat, and some other things. I believe she paid two pounds four shillings and five pence. I believe that was the sum. On the tenth we missed a piece of chintz print, which I perfectly remember shewing this person; that was on Saturday.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the thing that you complain of being stolen? - Yes, and the laylock stripe.</p>

               <p>Q. How much does the two pieces contain? - I believe about fifty yards. This piece I remember shewing it to the prisoner at the bar, and she refused taking it, and I remember folding it up, and laying it on her side, and I never see it afterwards till I see it at the office.</p>
               <p>Q. You have described two pieces in the indictment, and you tell us that you only missed one? - No, we did not miss the other. I see them both at Ailiff street office. I cannot recollect the day of the month. I see it laying on the bar before the justice of the office.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. This happened on the second of October? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You keep four persons besides yourself? - There are four persons besides Mr. Gibson.</p>
               <p>Q. Has your master any partner? - No, he has not.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you served this woman? - Yes. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you took away and put up the goods that you had taken out of their places, that lay on the counter? - Those goods that I had been shewing to her I took out of the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you put them in their places again? - Yes, I did, after she was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. And then you missed nothing? - No, I did not, I shewed her such a great quantity.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not till eight days after, namely, the tenth, that these pieces were at all perceived to be missing? - No, it was not.</p>
               <p>Q. There might be some hundreds of customers between the second and the tenth? - There might.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you say, she laid out two pounds four shillings with you? - I cannot be not positive. It was thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not call that a bad customer that lays two pounds four shillings with you? - We call it a middling one, neither a bad customer nor a good one.</p>

Do you remember the prisoner coming into the shop? - Yes, I do, Friday evening, the second of October, about six or seven o'clock in the evening, we light candles before the went out. I don't know whether we had when she came in. She came in, and asked to look at some printed cottons. Our young man shewed her a great many. She laid out about two pounds four and five pence in different articles. She might be in the shop about an hour, or not quite so much. She went out after she had paid for what she had had. On the tenth, I missed a piece of goods, we searched all over the shop, and could not find it. I missed a piece of chintz printed callico. It had my mark on it, I know the pattern very well. The Friday following I told Mr. Gibson. I never found it no more. I see it the Wednesday or Thursday in the officer's custody.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. We understand there are two persons more employed in the shop besides you and the last witness? - Yes, there are.</p>

               <p>I am an officer belonging to the police, Whitechapel. I produce these two pieces of print.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they printed callico? - I believe they are.</p>
               <p>Q. How many yards do they contain? - I cannot justly say the yards. On Wednesday, the fourteenth, we went to Mr. Clarke's house, looking over the prints, we brought these away, which, before the magistrate, Mr. Gibson proved to be his.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is Mr. Clarke? - The husband of Mrs. Clarke.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do they live? - In the New Road. It appeared to me to be a linen<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179510280091"></xptr>draper's shop. Mr. Gibson applied to me the night-before.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you went to the house of these people? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you get these things? -From the shop. Hanson brought them out of the shop, they were exposed for sale I believe. I brought them away, and have had them in my custody ever since.</p>
               <p>(Mr. Gibson deposes to the prints by their pattern, and the marks being his shopman's hand writing, and he had never sold them.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys to Mr. Gibson. You are a married man? - I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Your wife assist you in the shop? - No, she does not. She has the misfortune to be hard of hearing, and very unfit to be in a shop.</p>
               <p>Q. The mark is as visible and plain on it now as it was on the second of October? - It is.</p>
               <p>Q. There is no attempt to take it out? - There is not.</p>
               <p>Q. If this person took it, she had it eight days, and therefore had time to remove all evidence, yet the shop mark is as evident now as it was when you lost it.</p>
               <p>(Turner likewise deposes to the goods, and Eddy.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney to Eddy. The marks are just at the end of the pieces? - They are.</p>
               <p>Q. These marks might be cut off without any injury to the piece itself? - Most undoubtedly they might.</p>

               <p>Q. This was eight or ten days before they were found? - Eight days.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Gibson. What value do you put on these pieces? - Three pounds; two pounds on one, and one pound on the other. I would give more a good deal.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave it to my counsel.</p>

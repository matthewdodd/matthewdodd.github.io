I lost twenty bridle-bits and these reins, on the 7th of November, between five and six o'clock in the morning, out of my stables; the gates are closed at eleven o'clock at night, but the stables are open - no person could have access to them unless they concealed themselves in the coaches; I have seen the twenty hits, and one pair of the reins, before the Magistrate - I have every reason to believe they are mine; I know nothing of the prisoner - the latest stage comes in about ten o'clock at night, and after the horse-keepers have dressed the horses, the business is over for that night; they are opened by half-past four or five o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Is there anything particular in these bits? A. No; they are common coach-bits - the yard is not of easy access without breaking the gates, but the stables are; I can speak positively to the reins from their general appearance, and from the pattern of the buckles.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live at No. 31, Compton-street, Brunswick-square, A pair of reins were pawned with me for 2s., on the 7th of November, about noon, in the name of Jane Hill, I suppose by one of the witnesses, but I would not swear to him - they were redeemed by the prisoner the same evening, about six or seven o'clock; I am quite sure of his person, as he had been employed in the coach-rank before my door - I saw a pair at the office, and I suppose them to be the same; I can only speak from their appearance.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You were well acquainted with the prisoner's person? A. I had seen him frequently - I cannot say that I saw him after he redeemed the reins.</p>

            . I drive a hackney-coach, and live in Brunswick-mews. I know the prisoner by sight; on the evening of the 7th of November he came and asked if I wanted a pair of reins; I told him No - he said he had a pair in pawn for 2s., and asked if I would buy the duplicate, as he was very poor, and greatly distressed; I bought it of him for 1s.; I went to the pawnbroker to look at the reins, but he would not allow me - I came out and gave the prisoner 2s. 1/2d. to get them out, and I bought them of him - I gave up the same reins at Hatton-garden, I think about a fortnight afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you any great bargain? A. I did not consider it so; they were worth perhaps about 4s. to me as a wearer.</p>
               <p>MR. GRAY re-examined. Q. Are these your reins? A. Yes; I judge so by the shape and make of the buckles, which correspond with the leading reins, which were not taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is there any thing particular in this kind of buckle? A. Yes; some are square and some round, but these are neither one nor the other - I do not know that I ever saw such as these till within the last twelve months; I had them of Mr. Maberly, at the Horse Bazaar.</p>

            . Q. You state your brother<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182812040089"></xptr>was in custody for it - had you not a free opportunity of seeing me every day at the Hunter's Arms public-house, and did you not drink with me there - I should not have staid if I had been guilty of stealing? A. I never saw him till the Saturday night when he was taken; I went to the Police-office the same day that Underwood was taken - I was not there when he was brought before the Magistrate, I went when he was brought up again, but I did not go in before the Magistrate - I did not know they wanted me; I told the way in which underwood got the bits to a afraid or two that came to see him, but they are not here - I mentioned it the day he was taken up or the next day; I made the statement to the solicitor, and I believe he made it to the Magistrate the second time but I was not there - I mentioned it to Mr. Sherman, the solicitor, of Broad-buildings, Holborn; I did not mention it to any constable or Bow-street officer, Mr. Sherman advised me to say nothing about it till we could see if we could get the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I proffered at Hatton-garden to produces the man I had them to sell for, but I was not allowed to speak, as the officer knows, and now that man has absconded.</p>

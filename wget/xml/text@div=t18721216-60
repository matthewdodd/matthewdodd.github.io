                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Policeman</hi> 743). On Sunday morning, the 29th September, I was on duty on the Surrey side of London Bridge, on the left hand side—I saw the defendant drive up in a mail-cart—I did not see a four-wheeled cab—I saw a Hansom cab just at the foot of the bridge, going towards the City on its proper side, the near side—the mail-cart drove up and came in collision with it—it met the cab and ran into it, and the off-wheel of the cab and the off-wheel of the cart got tucked—the cab<lb></lb>driver was thrown from his seat on to the ground—the defendant said to me, "Was I not on my right side, sir?"—I said, "No, or else you would not be where you are now"—he said, "I thought I was on my right side"—he was not on his right side—there was no other vehicle there at the time—there was nothing between the mail-cart and the eastern side of the bridge—somebody said something to me, and I went on a little further—I found a four-wheeled cab 3 or 4 yards past the first recess, on the City aide of the bridge, about 86 yards from where the Hansom was—I saw Police-constable 79 holding the horse of the four-wheeled cab, which was close against the kerbstone on the proper side—I then returned back to where I had left the Hansom—I did not find the driver there, but I found him afterwards in Guy's Hospital—I also found the driver of the other cab there—both of them were injured—at that time of night there is not much traffic on the bridge.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> This took place about 12.15 on the Saturday night, or rather Monday morning, on the west side of the south end of the bridge—the mail-cart was coming from the City—was standing at the foot of the bridge against the buttress—the collision took place just across the road about 20 yards from me—it was not raining, nor was it foggy; it was perfectly clear—I was near enough to see everything that took place—I was standing on the east side, and the collision took place on the west—</p>

               <p>it did not take place in the middle of the road; the Hansom cab was close against the kerb—I saw him drive up to the bridge, and as he got on the mail-cart came into him—I saw the actual collision—there were two persons on the mail-cart—I could not say that there was a fare in the cab—the collision threw the cab-driver to the ground—I did not see the defendant and the man with him down too—the defendant was down off the mail-cart when I spoke to him—I went across to him—there were a few persons about at some coffee stalls that are always there—a few came round when the col<lb></lb>lision took place—I did not see a person there named Bradley that I know of—the prisoner did not complain of the conduct of the cabman—I took the prisoner's name and address, and then I went on the bridge—I did not lift the prisoner on to his cart and tell him to go on.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cab-driver, and live at 83, George Street, Bethnal Green—on Sunday morning, 29th September, I had a fare of two persons in my Hansom cab—I took them up at London Bridge, and was to drive them to Old Ford—when I got to the bottom of London Bridge I was driving on the near side, about half-a-foot from the kerb—I saw a mail-cart about forty yards off coming towards me—the prisoner was driving—I was going scarcely six miles an hour—the stones were very bad—the prisoner was driving about ten miles an hour—I tried to pull my horse up, and I caught hold of the rail of my cab to save myself, and the next instant he dashed into me and turned me off on to the pavement—I became insensible—I was picked up and taken to Guy's Hospital; my knee-cap was broken, and likewise my ankle—I have not been able to work since.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was coming from the Borough side of London Bridge—I saw the mail-cart on the crest of the bridge; it appeared to be coming from one side to the other—I did not see the collision with the four-wheeled cab—the stones were in a slippery state—there would be more danger in a horse going at the rate of ten miles an hour with the stones in that state than if they were dry.</p>

I am a cab-driver, and live at 8, North Street, Man<lb></lb>chester Square—on this Sunday night I was driving a Clarence cab over London Bridge about ten minutes or a quarter past 12—I was following a covered cart, and when I was half way across the bridge a mail-cart came into collision with me, knocked me from my cab on to my off side, and broke my leg in several places—I was driving not half-a-yard from the near side, walking gently over the bridge looking for a fare—the mail-cart came into me full ten miles an hour—I did not notice any other vehicle on my off side—I was picked up and taken to the hospital—my leg was broken in three places, and also my knee-cap—I have not been able to work since, I have been in the hospital eight weeks—I am still unable to work, and likely to be for some time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was walking across, following a covered van—I could not see in front of me, or else I might have got off my cab—I was going towards the City—the collision took place about the middle of the bridge—I did not pull out from the side; there was no cause—I was knocked off the cab, and either his wheel or my own wheel went over my legs—I suppose the covered cart went on after the collision, and did not stop to see the result—I did not see the mail-cart till it came up; it came suddenly upon me, and had no means of getting out of the way—the off-side shaft, the cross bar, and the panelling of the door was struck—it was not raining that night.</p>

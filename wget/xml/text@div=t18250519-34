            . I was going by, and saw some persons round the door; I went in, and asked the prisoner who the planes belonged to - he said to himself, and that he worked at the North Bank, Regent's-park; I said I would go with him there: he took me into a shop, and showed me some other tools on a bench, which he said were his - I asked if he could refer me to any person who could state that he was a carpenter; he said if I went to his lodgings in North-court, his landlady could give me a reference - I went, and she said his name was Neenan.</p>

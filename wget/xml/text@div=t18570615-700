                  </hi>. I am a blacksmith, at Ealing; I have a dwelling house there. On 23rd May I went to bed about 10 o'clock; I was the last person up, and fastened up the house—I got up about 7 o'clock next morning—I found the window shutters of the front room partially open, and the window</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185706150030"></xptr>
               <p>sash slid up to the full extent, so that any one could get in—I had left them fastened the night before—I missed a piece of undressed beef and some sausages, which I had left on the table the night before, and the dish was removed to under the window—outside the house I observed some foot-prints, and a large button lying by the side—I called the attention of Fielder, the constable, to the footprints, and gave him the button—about 11 o'clock that same morning I saw the constable compare some shoes with those footmarks—the table that the meat was on was about three yards from the window—it could not have been reached without getting into the room.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, T</hi> 157). On the morning of 24th May I examined some footmarks outside Mr. Gillman's house, and received from him this button—I apprehended the prisoner that same morning at Old Brentford—I took off his shoes, and compared them with the marks under the prosecutor's window—they exactly corresponded; one of the shoes is very remarkable, and it agreed in every respect—the button matches those on the prisoner's jacket, there are two missing from it—on the window sill I found marks of corded trowsers, and the prisoner had on cord trowsers when I took him—the sill appeared to have been recently done over with hearthstone, and it showed the marks very plainly.</p>

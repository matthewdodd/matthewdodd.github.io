I am steward of the Euphrates, lying in the West India dock—I entered it at twenty minutes to eight o'clock on Monday the 31st of Oct.—I found the fore skuttle had been forced, and the nails out—I returned to the main deck, to see if the cabin had been broken—it bad not—I</p>

                  </hi>. I am gate-keeper. At half-past six o'clock in the morning, I stopped the prisoner—I asked what ship he belonged to—he said, the Euphrates—I asked what he had got in his pocket—he said a bottle of grog, he was going to take home to make some warm grog—I asked where he got it—he said from the ship, where it had been served out to him as his allow<lb></lb>ance, he had saved it up and was going to take it home—he said would I let him go on board and get a pass—I would not—I took him on board—the mate came out of the cuddy, and said, "This is the fellow that has robbed the ship"—the cask appeared wet all round the bung, as if the hollands had been taken out.</p>

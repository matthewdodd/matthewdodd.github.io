            . On the Friday after the king's birthday I went from London, being the 11th of November, in a one-horse chaise, a lady with me, and a servant before. I stop'd at the Old Hat, on this side of Southwell, about seven miles out of town, where I had order'd a toast and some eggs; it had rained. Presently I changed my resolution, the storm going off, and order'd my chaise out, and near the turnpike, on the otherside <placeName id="t17571207-8-crimeloc38">Southwell</placeName>

               <p>Q. Was this in Middlesex?</p>
               <p>Manners. Yes. They bid me stop; one went on one side me, and the other the other; one held a pistol while the other held his hat to take the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Manners. It is he that had the pistol, and bid me stop; he bid me deliver my money: I put my hand into my poket, and gave two guineas and some silver, more than ten shillings, into the other's hat. After that the prisoner ask'd me for my watch. I told him I had none.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you put in fear?</p>
               <p>Manners. To be sure I was, to see a pistol pointed at me, I had given my watch to the lady before, so I shew'd him I had none. Then he said is this all the money you have? and added d - n you, don't make any words; I offer'd to turn my pocket. I put my hand into my pocket and pull'd out a gun flint, and said here is all; will you have this? He said, no, I might have that myself. I had preserved some silver in my other pocket, which I did not shew him.</p>
               <p>Q. What hour of the day was this ?</p>
               <p>Manners. Betwixt twelve and two in the day. I went on to the turnpike, and ask'd my servant what I had best do. He said, pursue them. I said,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175712070006"></xptr> he might pursue them, but he would not. He was sitting on horseback before me at the time I was rob'd.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his name?</p>
               <p>Manners.

            . I am Mr. Fielding's servant, and was sent in pursuit of the prisoner by my master; I took him at a place call'd Hockley, beyond Dunstable. We searched him, and found a watch and a ring. (He produced the ring.)</p>
               <p>Q. to Manners. Do you know this ring?</p>
               <p>Manners. I bought this ring, and gave it to the lady, who was in the chaise with me, and was rob'd of it at the time that I was.</p>

               <p>I was at the time that the gentleman says he was rob'd in Oxfordshire. I think his servant ought to be here.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. He can't be any positive evidence, because he was before the chaise, and the prisoner's back was towards him.</p>

            . Mr. Olear, and Mr. Bray's. distill-house is broke up to be sold; there was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176102250059"></xptr> a large copper, which was taken to pieces, it weighed 40 hundred weight, I had the management of the distillery. This copper was sold to Mr. Ford, a copper-smith, and he sent his men to take it to pieces, the prisoner at the bar was of one them. There was a servant, Mr. Hammond, attended in my absence, and the next day he told me of some nails being stolen; the other witness can give a farther account.</p>

            . On the 5th of February Mr. Phipps left the key of the warehouse with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this?</p>
               <p>Hammond. At Bromley, I was to see the copper taken to pieces, it was to be taken into the warehouse, till such time as they could weigh it. I gave their foreman the key of the warehouse, and I went about half an hour after four to ask if they had done; I went into the yard and saw the prisoner coming with a bag of nails on his shoulder out of the distill-house, he was going into a place called the mill-house, he turned about, and laid the bag down, and put a stone over it, I suppose he saw me. I asked if they had carried the copper into the warehouse, they said they had; then I went to the bag and took it up, the prisoner was present. I carried it into the warehouse, there were thirty pounds of copper nails in it, some call them rivets, they appeared to be part of the copper taken to pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say about it?</p>
               <p>Hammond. I never heard him say any thing about it, I was not at his examination.</p>

            . On the 10th of this instant, four of us went to take this copper to pieces at Bromley; after we had done work, we were in the yard by the still-house, the prisoner came to me and said, I am afraid he'll find it out, he has kick'd the stone that lay upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. Find what out?</p>
               <p>Lee. That I did not know; presently he came and said, He has found it out? Still I did not ask him what he meant.</p>

            . I was one of the workmen employed to take the copper to pieces. I saw the prisoner bring the bag out of the warehouse on his shoulder, after I had just carried it in.

               <p>Hammond. To bring things from the warehouse he must come throught part of the still-house.</p>
               <p>Several persons appeared in his behalf, who gave him a good character.</p>

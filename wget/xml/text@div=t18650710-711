                  </hi>. I live at Deptford—on Saturday night. 24th June, at a few minutes past 10. I was in a pork-butcher's shop in High-street. Dept<lb></lb>ford—a woman was standing there when I went in and she had what she wanted and went out and the prisoner then came in—I had a purse in my pocket con<lb></lb>taining 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I took it out and took a shilling out of it and put the purse in ray pocket again—I am quite certain of that—the prisoner was there standing close by my right aide and she had a little girl with her who stood behind me—I put my hand in my pocket again to put some coppers in and missed my purse—I moved the prisoner by the dress and looked on the floor for it—she said, "What are you doing of do you think I am the thief?"—I said. I certainly did as there was nobody else there—she said, "If you think I am the thief you had better search me"—she then went out of the shop came in a few minutes afterwards and abused me and said, "Now. If you think I am the thief you had better search me"—I told her I should like to do so—she then went out and I went too—she was turned out of the shop for abusing me—I followed her and gave her into custody.</p>

I am the daughter of the last witness—I was with her at this butcher's shop—I was standing on the left side of her, and the prisoner was on the right, her daughter was standing by her—I saw my mother take out her purse and take a shilling out—the prisoner looked very hard at the purse, and I touched my mother's dress to call her attention to the prisoner, but she did not notice it—the prisoner stood there some little time afterwards, until my mother complained of losing her purse—she said to the woman of the shop, "Oh dear, I have lost my puree"—she looked about and then shook the prisoner by the frock and looked on the ground—the prisoner said, "Do you think I am the thief? you had better search me," and she then went outside the shop, out of my sight—she afterwards came in again and called my mother a d—d brazen faggot.</p>

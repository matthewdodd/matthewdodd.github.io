                  </hi>. I am the wife of Peter Reeves, of Raven-row, Mile-end-road—I let a room to the prisoner and his sister. They paid me every week regularly up to within three weeks—finding they were not likely to continue to pay, I gave them notice on Friday to go away on Saturday week—their time was up on Saturday, but I said I was not particular to a few days—on Monday, the 24th, at ten o'clock at night, I wished them to go, as me and my husband wanted to go to bed—they had taken nearly the whole of their goods, and I desired them to return as soon as they could for the rest—they took them out very quietly, but when they got outside they commenced abusing, and the prisoner used very bad language—he had a flat-iron in one hand, and an iron-bowl or frying pan in the other—he called me names—my husband ran towards him as if he was going to strike him, and said if he caught hold of him, or something of the kind, he would give him a smack on the head—I did not see my husband strike him—just after, the prisoner returned to the door and knocked me down—there was light enough for him to see who was in the passage—I was then looking out at the door—there is a gas light opposite—I can't exactly say what he had in his hand—it appeared like a flat iron—it was very weighty—I had not struck him—my face bled very much—the blow knocked me backwards on the floor in the passage—the prisoner ran away—a policeman was called—when he saw my face he went after the prisoner, and during his absence I was going to the London Hospital, but was called back again—after I had been to the station I went to the doctor's—I suffered very much pain for two nights—it was better afterward—my face was cut and black.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. About a quarter to eleven o'clock this evening I saw Mrs. Reeves at the Stepney station—she had a contused wound, about an inch in extent, on the right cheek, just beneath the eye, it was very severely bruised—a flat-iron, like this produced, might produce such a wound—the skin was divided—she bled profusely—I attended her about three weeks afterwards—she was able to leave her house in five days—it was a serious wound, inasmuch as inflammation might take place—the skin was very severely bruised—there was ecchymosis—there was effused blood under the skin, which caused discolouration.</p>

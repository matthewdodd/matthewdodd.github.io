               <p>A WITNESS sworn.</p>
               <p>The prisoner came to our shop on Wednesday morning last for a skein of silk to match a pattern, I was looking for some, and she pulled over several parcels of silk which she had no business with, and I had a suspicion that she was on no good design, and I saw her put some silk in her apron, I called up my fellow servant, and she was making away out of the door, and I took the silk out of her apron, she was searched, and a pair of stockings was found upon her.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt, prisoner's Council. There was some silk in the woman's apron when she came in? - No, I saw her take the silk and slip it under her apron.</p>
               <p>Was not she dealing with you for silk, and going to buy it of you? - It was not the silk that I served her with, it was other silk, and nothing like the pattern; it was put by way of concealment; she only wanted a single skein, and here is near two pounds.</p>

            . I am an umbrella maker, and live in Gun-street, Old Artillery-ground. On the 10th of November, about half-past seven, or a quarter to eight o'clock at night, I was in <placeName id="t18271206-22-crimeloc112">Bishopsgate-street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18271206-22-crimeloc112" type="placeName" value="Bishopsgate-street"></interp>

I was looking towards Spitalfields-church, and saw a man lying in the road, under the shaft-horse's belly - I was on the near side of the dray, and saw the near-wheel pass over his body; I hallooed out, and ran to pick the man up; I held him there till assistance came - the prisoner drove the dray; I did not see him at that instant; I cannot say he was not on that side the dray: he came to my assistance in a minute; he came as from the fore horse's head: I had not seen him there before; he helped to carry the man to the doctor's; the man sighed as I crossed the road, and he was dead when we got to the doctor's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. The prisoner came to your assistance the moment you called out? A. Yes, and stopped his dray; he seemed as sorry as a man could be; he could not go slower than he went: the deceased laid across the road; I cannot say whether he was drunk; he laid there as if he was dead, before the wheel passed over him; he might have been dead before the wheel touched him, for what I know; he did not speak after the accident, or show the least signs of life.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. You had not seen the prisoner before the deceased was under the horse's belly? A. No; he sighed after we took him up.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you meet the dray, or overtake it? A. I met it; I did not see the prisoner at his horse's head, I did not pay attention: if he had been there when I met the dray, I must have seen him; I did not see him come as from the horse's head till after the accident.</p>

            . My husband is a silk-weaver; we live in Silver-street; I was at the corner of Union-street, coming up Bishopsgate-street, and saw two drays; I wanted to cross, and stopped for them; I saw a man on the ground, about a yard and a half from the curb - I was on the near side of the horses; the man at first prevented my crossing; the first horse stepped over him without touching him, and, I believe, both horses stepped over him; the prisoner was at the side of his horse when the wheel went over the man; he was near the wheel, where the body lay - he came from across Sun-street - I saw him a minute before the wheel went over the man; he was on the right side of his horses - he had not time to stop them; I had seen the deceased before - his name was Isaac Boddy.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were not the dray-horses as quiet as possible? A. They could not go much slower - it was a dark night - the man laid in the road, as if he was dead, before the horses came near him - his bundle laid at a little distance from him; he did not seem to move hand or foot; when the alarm was given, the prisoner ran round, and seemed much agitated - it was a dark rainy night; I must have stepped on the man's legs myself, if I had stepped off the curb.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had the horses come quite up to you before you attempted to pass? A. No; they were so near I did not think it safe to pass; the prisoner at that time was coming along by the side of his fore-house - he was nearly as close to me as the fore-horse; I believe he did not see the man - he stopped the horses the moment the alarm was given - he called out, "Whoa!" and caught hold of the horses bridle as soon as ever he saw the body - that was after the mischief was done - he had not time to do it before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he attempt to lay hold of the bridle before the wheel went over the man? A. No; he did not see him; I saw the man before the horse came up, but it was very close to him; I did not call to him to stop - I was speaking to my sister at the time.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live in Bishopsgate-street; the deceased was brought to my house on the evening in question; he was then dying - his ribs appeared to be fractured on each side; the dray going over him would occasion that; I examined his body a few days afterwards; there were five ribs broken on one side, and six on the other, which must have occasioned his death; he died from laceration of the heart.</p>

            . I am the wife of Simeon Robinson, of Spicer-street. On the 10th of November I was in Bishopsgate-street, near the corner of Union-street, and saw two drays; one had passed except the hind-wheel; when I got up I saw something on the ground; my sight being bad, I could not discern whether it was a man or woman - the wheel went over it; I was taken with a violent trembling and giddiness, and was scarcely able to stand - I do not recollect seeing the prisoner, except at the workhouse, where the Inquest was held.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any man attending the dray that night? A. I saw something white, apparently like the jacket of the drayman, sitting on the shaft, but my eyesight is so very bad.</p>
               <p>Q. You have given an account of this before; had he a whip in his hand? A. I saw, as I thought, a man put something out of his hand, but it was very dark; I was much frightened - my sight failed from the giddiness of my head; I was obliged to support myself against the shutters of a linen-draper's shop.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see the dray before it came up? A. Not the first one - it was going very slow.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. About what hour was this? A. A little before seven o'clock - he was all over dirt, and asked for a small dram, which I gave him.</p>
               <p>Q. He being as drunk as he could be? A. I did not see that he was drunk then; several people were about him; I saw that he was drunk from the manner he came in; he was scarcely able to stand when I took him to the door - it was a very dark night.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a boot and shoemaker, and live at Uxbridge. I know the Rev. Mr. Hale, of Hayes—a man, who I believe to be the pri<lb></lb>soner, came to my shop on the 10th of Aug. and gave me this note, which I opened and read—(read—" Mr. Tribe, boot and shoemaker, Uxbridge. The Rev. John Hale will thank you to send by bearer a few ladies' boots, 4 1/2 size, also a few pairs of children's boots, 6 1/8 size: they shall be re­ turned in the evening, together with the money for those selected. Satur­ day, P. M.")—I looked out the goods and packed them up, while my son was in conversation with him—I gave him the goods, supposing he had come from Mr. Hale—he said he had lived in Mr. Hale's family, and looked very respectable—he said the boots were for Mr. Hale's family—I do not know any other Mr. Hale.</p>

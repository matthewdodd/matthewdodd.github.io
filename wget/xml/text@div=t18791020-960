                  </hi>. I am general dealer of Barking Side—on 3rd September, at 9 p.m., my grey mare was safe in a meadow—I was roused at 9.30, went downstairs, and found a constable in the house—the mare was gone—I found her next morning in a meadow adjoining the Warren Wood puolic-house, Chigwell—I called the landlord up; he gave me some information—I went with the police and saw them appprehend Stammers at the Reindeer public-house, Woodford; he was taken to Woodford Police-station, and Perry was brought in—I charged them with stealing my mare—they made no reply—I knew Perry before, I have dealt with him for pigs.</p>

On 3rd September, at 9.30 p.m., I was in Middle Road, Barking Side, and heard horses approaching—Perry was riding one and Stammers the other; they were two grey ones; Perry was riding the one Mr. Cancell claims—when they came near me Perry said "My God, here is a policeman," and with that they turned into a lane leading to Woodford, and galloped as fast as they could—I called to them to stop and pursued them 300 yards, but could not catch them—I went with the inspector and found the mare in the grounds of Warren Wood house—we found the prisoners at the station.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Perry's Defence.</hi> We changed the black horse for the grey mare, and next morning I paid 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for new shoes, which made 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.

I said, "The horse don't belong to one man more than the other until the money is paid "I went over two or three times, and he said, "You come over, Dick," and if I had sold the horse I should have given him half. Three times I took the pony to his shop, and he told me to come next week. I went on the 30th, and he made another excuse, and put it off till the next Tuesday, and then he had no money; he had to borrow 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to get some beer with, so I did not see much chance of getting my money.

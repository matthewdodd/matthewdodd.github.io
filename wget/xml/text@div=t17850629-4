             sworn.</p>
               <p>I was robbed on Monday the 2d of May, about half after three in the afternoon, I was going down to Enfield from London, I was stopped in a lane at the back of Hornsey wood , I believe it is called <placeName id="t17850629-4-crimeloc20">Hornsey-lane</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17850629-4-crimeloc20" type="placeName" value="Hornsey-lane"></interp>

               <p>Can you swear to him positively? - I did and do.</p>
               <p>Be cautious? - I am very cautious, I am sure it is him, it was about half after three on Monday, it was a very bad road, and I was walking my horse down hill, and about twenty yards before me I saw three men in sailors apparel, I did not conceive them to be footpads, but rather thought them to be three men loitering about, I did not suspect being stopped at that time of the day, when they came near to my horse's head the prisoner who was in the middle, gave the others a shove with his elbow, as I thought for me to go through them, which<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178506290014"></xptr> I endeavoured to do, and they every one sprang upon me, one on each side of me, and the other at my mare's head; I asked them what they wanted; the prisoner first said, damn your blood, give us your watch and money; upon which he immediately laid hold of the chain of my watch, and attempted to pull it out of my pocket, which broke the chain; not finding it possible to get my watch out of my pocket, he immediately ripped my breeches open.</p>
               <p>Did he draw a knife? - The left-hand man held a cutlass to my head, and the prisoner immediately took the watch out of my pocket, and I gave him my purse; on the other side the man with the cutlass put his hand into my pocket, and took out a large tooth-pick case, for which I begged very hard, as I had had it many years, but he swore at me, and would not return it: before they had got twenty paces from me, they turned round again, swearing they would murder me if I did not go along, upon which I was determined to pursue them, I met a soldier, and he went back with me; when we got to the top of the hill, we saw them crossing the field.</p>
               <p>At what distance? - About one hundred yards from the lane, the man immediately got over the gate, and pursued them, and I went to have leaped the gate after them, but he thought it was rather wrong to do that, and I rode on as hard as I could ride, at Newington-green I met a gentleman, with his servant, and we both rode after them; I went to Sir Sampson Wright's office, where I gave intelligence: they were not taken up till the Friday week afterwards; it was on a Monday that I was robbed, I saw them on that day fortnight; the prisoner was with two more .</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt of the other two men? - I am very well assured they were not with him at the time I was robbed.</p>
               <p>How many minutes did the robbery last? - I do not suppose it was five minutes ; I took particular notice of them, though I had not an idea of what they were going to do.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There is no occasion for me to ask any questions, as the gentleman is so positive that I am the person, there is no room to ask any questions.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I lost a gold watch, valued at ten guineas, and the other things in the indictment.</p>

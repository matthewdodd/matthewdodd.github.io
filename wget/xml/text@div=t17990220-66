             sworn. - I am a baker; I lived with Mr. Harris then, he is dead since I left him: On the 17th of January I was standing in Villiers-street, and saw the prisoner go by with a basket of bread.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know that basket? - A.Yes, I am positive to the basket; I have carried the same basket for above a twelvemonth every day; I said to a young man, Smith has stole a basket of bread, for he was out of place yesterday, I am sure he has not got into place again already; I saw Skelton about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour afterwards, and he told me he had lost his basket; I told him I had seen Smith with his basket.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you perfectly satisfied that the prisoner was the man you saw with the basket? - A. Yes, I have known him these nine years.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you positive that the basket you saw upon his shoulder was Mrs. Harris's basket? - A. Yes.</p>

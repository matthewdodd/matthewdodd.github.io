                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant H</hi> 11). On 28th August from information, I went to the Commercial Docks—I saw a waggon of Messrs. Tyndal and Jacobs, laden with cases of salmon—the prisoners Paster and Owen were with the van—I saw them come out of the dock after the van was loaded—they stopped at a public-house just outside for a few minutes—they then drove on to the China beer-shop, where they stopped again; they then drove on to a third beer-shop, where they stopped again—from there they went on to the Queen Charlotte public-house—there saw Panter take out one of the little tins, put it under his jacket, and go into the public-house—I saw Owen come out of the public-house, get on the van, and take another one, and go inside the public-house with it—he came out a second time and took a tin and went in again—I afterwards saw them both come out—I did not see that they had anything with them—they got on the van and drove on to the Young Prince beer-shop, in Blue Anchor Road—they stopped there some little time and then went on into Alfred Street, Bermondsey, where they stopped, and I saw Panter holding up a nosebag, and Owen put in several of the little tins—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are some of the tins—they are tins of preserved salmon—Panter got off the van, and Owen handed the nosebag to him, and he went into No. 18, Alfred Street—in a minute or two he came out again, chucked the empty nosebag on the van, got on the top, and then they drove away to another beer-shop in the Grange Road—I saw them go in there shortly afterwards—Owen came out, got on the van, and took another tin out of a box in the fore part of the van, and went into the beer-shop—I then got out of the cab in which I had been following them, and went into the beer<lb></lb>shop—Owen had got the tin in his hand—I said, "What are you going to do with this? "(he was about to pass it to another man, who was standing there)—he said, "Oh! it is no value much; I was going to give it to my mate"—I said, "Well, you had no right to take it; you had better come outside"—he said, "Oh! Mr. Dunaway, you don't mean to lock us up for that? "—I said, "That will be for Mr. Jacobs; you will have to go to the station"—Panter said to him, "Oh! why did you touch them? I would rather give anything than you should have touched them; you know you had no right to have touched them"—I told Mr. Jacobs's foreman, who was along with me, to go on with the van, and I said, "You two get into the cab along with me"—Owen dropped the tin that he had in his hand in the road, and I picked it up—I drove on till I met a man in uniform—I called him to my assistance—I then told them what they would be charged with, and what I had seen them do—Panter said, "Is it likely that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186710280074"></xptr>
               <p>should do anything of the kind, when the gate-keeper pointed out this old man and said, 'He is along with the police, and they are after you, or on to you? '"—I then went on to the station in Bermondsey Street, left the two prisoners there, and went outside and examined the cases on the van found two cases had been broken open; one was more than half empty—I think only twenty tins were left in that case—I afterwards went with H 88 to 18, Alfred Street, where Pearce lived; I saw the landlady, and went up stairs, and there found twenty-three tins of salmon, some of which are here—some were afterwards given up to the prosecutor—they were standing on a table on the landing up against Pearce's room door—they were not concealed in any way—I left 88 H there and went to the beer<lb></lb>shop in Blue Anchor Road, where I received eight tins from the witness Drage—I afterwards saw Pearce at Bermondsey Street police-station—I said, "I have been to 18, Alfred Street, where you say you live, and I got these twenty-three tins of salmon; what have you to say about them? "—he said, "Yes, I bought them; I met the two men in Eastcheap to-day (they were present); they asked me if I would buy any, and I said yes, I would"—I said, "You, as a carman, ought to know very well that they bad got nothing of the kind to sell, and you will consider yourself in custody for receiving these, well knowing they were stolen"—he said he did not know they were stolen—in the front part of the van, where the cases had been broken open, I found this crowbar, which would be very handy for opening them.</p>

                  </hi> I am manager of William Gallett, of 4, Perseverance Place—on 28th August I saw the prisoners come in a van to the Young Prince—I was standing outside—Panter got down off the van and said to me, "I think I have some goods here that are likely to suit you"—I said, "What are they? "—he said, "They are tins of potted salmon"—I said, "I don't think they will suit this neighbourhood, but I think I have seen your face before"—he said, "Yes, I used to drive for Smith and Nolley"—I said, "What are they?

"—I said, "Yes"—we went into the Young Prince and called for a pot—they were talking there about the salmon, and I said to the publican, Mr. Skinner, "They have some fish here; you, being a Plymouth man, may be fond of them"—he said, "What are they? "—Panter said, "Old ships' stores, that I bought from the mate of a vessel; I want to sell them cheap"—he was asked the price, and he said 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen by taking the case, or 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen if they broke the case"—Skinner said, "It is like buying a pig in a poke"—I said, "Perhaps you have a sample; will you bring one in? "—Panter I believe went and got one; it was opened in front of the bar, and several persons round the bar tasted it and said they should like to buy one each—Owen, I think, said, "No, we will not sell one, but if any person here likes to buy any and sell them to you we will sell them to that person"—Owen then said to me, "You had better have half-a-dozen on your own account"—I said, "They are no use to me; I can't do anything with them"—he said, "Perhaps you can sell them to your friends round, the bar"—I then agreed to take half-a-dozen for 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., to sell them round the bar at 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a piece profit, which should be spent among the company for a quart</p>

                  </hi> My husband is a salesman in Alfred Street—Pearce lodges with us—on 28th August something was left at our house; I don't know what it was—it was not covered up, but I was busy at the time, and did not look to see what it was—they asked me if Mr. Pearce was at home, and there was no one at home—he said there was something to be left and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to pay, and he would call in the evening—Pearce after<lb></lb>wards came home, and I told him—he said he was going to fetch nil wife from his mother's, and he left 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. with me, and asked me to pay the man if he came—the constable afterwards came and found the things up stairs—I don't know who had placed them there—Pearce had not said that he expected anything.</p>

On 28th August, about half-past eight in the evening, I went to 18, Alfred Street, and waited Pearce's arrival—I saw twenty-three tins on the landing—he came home with his wife shortly after—I said, "Is your name Pearce? "—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Have you had any tins here to-day? "—he said, "Yes"—I said, "How many? "—he said, "I think twenty-three"—I said, "They have</p>

                  </hi> I am a provision merchant, of 141, Minories—on 28th August I should have received about 165 cases containing preserved salmon—I only received 163—I gave Tyndal and Jacobs the bill of lading for 165—I received some cases that day broken open—the regular quantity of tins in each case is forty-eight—we opened three cases of the first load, one case was short seven, another three, and another three—we did not examine more—they are worth about 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do all these come from New Brunswick? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I believe the cases are sometimes opened and examined at the docks by the Custom House officers, also a tin or two, not in every case, but out of the shipment—all these tins are of the same make and description; they are not all marked alike; these are painted red—perhaps a few are used in the Navy, and also in the Mercantile Marine—I believe it is the custom when ships come home with sample stores to sell them off—if there was any tins of preserved salmon among them any one could buy them—they would fetch considerably less than 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. then—there is no difference in the description of tin in which fish is sent home, unless they are labelled—some preserved fish sell for 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a tin—by the appearance of the tin you could not tell whether it contained salmon or any other fish.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a turner, and live in Queen's Head-walk, Kingsland-road—the prisoner is my father-in-law—on Wednesday night, the 19th of June, between ten and eleven o'clock, I went out into Queen's Head-walk, and met the prisoner—I suspected he had come to make a dis<lb></lb>turbance,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184407010020"></xptr>
               <p>turbance, and followed him, because he had drawn a knife to me on Easter Monday—when he had got half way down the garden where I live I tapped him on the shoulder, and asked what he wanted—he said he had come quiet, and I persuaded him to go quiet—he said he had come to see his children his wife and children then occupied a room next to mine—he and his wife had been separated for some time—she went before Mr. Broughton, the Magistrate and he told her he was not to molest her—I told him it was not a fit time of night to come, as the children were in bed, if he came of a morning he could see them—he used very foul language to me, and called for his wife to come out—he called her a name, and she answered him, and said she had been a good wife to him—he said, "Too good"—he then turned round to me, used very heavy threats, and dared me to hit him—I said I did not wish to hurt him—he made a jeer of that—I told him to keep away from me, for he bad a knife—I had seen him put his left hand into his left-hand trowsers' pocket, and draw the knife, hold it in his left hand, and with his right hand shove it up his sleeve—he asked what made me think he had got a knife—I said because I could see it, and knew it to be the same he had drawn to me on Easter Monday—he used foul language to me again, and then turned as if to go away, and I turned to go into the house—I had scarcely turned when he sprang upon me with the knife, and stabbed me in the cheek—I have the mark now—I put up my hand to catch the blow, and it cut my hand and wrist—I seized him, and we both fell together inside a little pigeon aviary, that stood in the ground—I think he fell rather underneath me—he said he had not done with me yet, he meant to give me a blow more fatal, or some<lb></lb>thing to that effect—I was almost insensible from the blow and loss of blood—he called out "Murder"—I immediately called for help, when two brewer's men, followed by the policeman, came to my assistance—I was taken to a doctor's in the Kingsland-road.</p>

About eleven o'clock on the night of the 19th, I was on duty in Hare-walk, Kingsland-road, and heard a cry of "Murder" and "Help"—I went to the spot and found the prisoner on the ground, and two brewer's men holding him down—the prosecutor was separate from him, bleeding profusely from the face—he shouted out that the prisoner had a knife—I got a candle from a woman, searched and found this knife—I then took the prisoner into custody—in going up the walk, he said he was sorry I did not let him cut his b----throat, or rip his b----guts out, for he had broken the peace of his mind—I cautioned him not to say anything, and be repeated several times that he had broken the peace of his mind, and he would readily hang for him in the front of Newgate.</p>

I said, "To see my children, and 1 am determined to see them;" he said, "You shan't," and made use of bad language—one word caused another, and when I did stab him my senses</p>

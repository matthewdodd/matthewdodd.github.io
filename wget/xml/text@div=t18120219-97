The prisoner came in the accompting-house, and introduced himself as Mr. Ray's son; he said he was come to look out some leather for his father, Mr. Ray. Mr. Ray has been a customer to our shop many years, the reason that he asigned for his father not coming himself, was, that he was dangerously ill; he said he wanted two hides of Russia, and two skins of Morrocco leather, and he took them away.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts is the value - A. About four pound, he said he had not got the book, upon which Mr. Ray's accompt was kept, but Mr. Ray never sends the book except when he comes himself.</p>
               <p>Q. You acceeded, believing that he was the agent of the father - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You, nor Mr. West, gave credit upon his own accompt - A. We did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he afterwards come to your house - A. Yes, on the 11th of February; I let him have four hides of Russia then.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards see the father - A. On the 11th of February Mr. Ray made his appearance; I told him I was glad to see him look so well, as I had been informed he had been extremely ill. We apprehended the defendant about a week after the 11th, and took him to the compter.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever got your skins again - A. No, we have not.</p>

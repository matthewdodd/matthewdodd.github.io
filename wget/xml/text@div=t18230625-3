On Monday, the 19th of May, about eleven o'clock at night, I put ten sovereigns and ten shillings into my scrutoire drawer; I marked them all. The scrutoire stands in the back parlour - I locked the drawer, and put the key in the bookcase, where I usually kept it, and left the book-case unlocked. Next morning about half-past seven o'clock, my son called me down - I went down into the back parlour, where the prisoner sat in a chair; my son was picking three sovereigns and a shilling off the floor - the prisoner had put his foot over them, and endeavoured to hide them under the carpet; he got up and came to me, and begged me to forgive him - I said nothing to him. He said he was very sorry for what he had done, that he would never do it any more, and would serve me night and day if I would not prosecute him. My son laid the sovereigns and the shilling on the table - I took them up, and produce them - they are three of those I put there the night before.</p>

            . I am the son of the last witness. I remember my father marking the money, and putting it in the scruetoire, and the key in the book-case. Next morning about half-past six o'clock, I concealed myself on the stairs, and heard the prisoner go to the workshop behind the house, then heard him go to the back parlour, and unlock the door - the key had been left in; he went in; I heard the scrutoire drawer unlocked and opened; I waited a moment, and heard it shut again, and heard the book-case door shut - I came down, and found him coming out of the parlour; I asked him what he did there - he said he was going to open the shutters; I said as he was there he might as well open them; he went and opened them. I said I was afraid he had been doing something wrong, that he had been taking money; he said, "What money?" I said I must open the drawer and see; I did so, and missed three sovereigns and a shilling - he said he knew nothing of them, that he had never taken any money. He sat on a chair; I saw him stoop, and endeavour to put something under the carpet - I stooped down, and found the three sovereigns and a shilling laying on the floor; I picked them up, laid them on the table, and charged him with taking them, which he voluntarily confessed. I had seen my father mark them, and knew them to be three of those he put there the night before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What time was this - A. About half-past seven o'clock. I watched him from the moment he got up - he could not have taken them at different times.</p>
               <p>The prisoner made no Defence, but one witness gave him a good Character.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an upholsterer, and live in Wells'-row, Islington. On Friday, 20th July, Mary Wright came to my shop, and bought some oil<lb></lb>cloth, which came to 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I sent it to Laburnam-cottage—John Wright came and paid me for it—on the Saturday, in consequence of what my wife told me, I took a loo-table and an easy chair to Laburnam-cottage, for appro<lb></lb>val—I saw Richards—I told her I had brought the chair and table for Mr. and Mrs. Wright to see—she said they had just gone out for a walk, they might be an hour, or an hour and a half—I told her I would call on Monday morning, and if they used these things on Sunday they were to cover them up, for if they scratched them I could not take them back again—I left the goods—I went again on Monday afternoon for them, and the house was closed—I traced the prisoners to the Grove at Hackney—I knocked at the door of a house there—Richards opened the window—I asked her for the chair and table she took from Laburnam-cottage—she said she did not know Labur<lb></lb>nam-cottage—I told her my name—she said she neither knew me nor Laburnam-cottage, nor anything about it—I afterwards found the prisoners were taken into custody—I went with the officer to the house in Hackney-grove, and found the chair and table in the front parlour.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Comfort. On Saturday, 21st July, John Wright came to our shop—he paid for the oilcloth that Mary Wright bought, and he looked at two loo-tables, and inquired the price—one was 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the other six guineas—he said he thought his lady would give the preference to the six guinea one—he then looked at two chairs—I could not tell him the price—he said the smaller one would suit his lady, and I was to send it along with the table to Laburnam-cottage, and to tell Mr. Comfort to name the lowest price that could be taken for them—I gave them to my husband to take—I did not intend to sell them, not knowing the price of the chair.</p>

I concealed myself opposite to No. 6—I watched there till four o'clock on the morning of the 24th—I then saw John Wright looking through the window—he then unlocked the door, and came out into the Grove about twelve yards—he beckoned to some persons inside the house, and the two female prisoners came out—they had each of them two bundles, one under each arm—John Wright then locked the house door, and came out—I went from where I was, and with assistance I took the three prisoners to the station—I found on John Wright a door key—I went and opened the house with it, and found the table and chair.</p>

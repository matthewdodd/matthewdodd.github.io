               <p>Mr. Knapp. I am for Boxer. Did you see either of the prisoners at the bar before you saw them at the public house? - Yes, but not the third one, that is the reason why I am not sure.</p>
               <p>Q. This was at eleven o'clock at night? - No, it was better, it was eleven o'clock when I went out from my own lodgings, this was near one, that time that they robbed me.</p>

               <p>Q. Your ideas of drunkenness and mine differ a little, was not you so drunk when you got into the watch-house, that you fell below the grate? - When the watchman had locked me in I laid me down on the floor to sleep.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not fall down before the watchman's fire? - I did not, I had no more clothes to sleep in than what I have on now.</p>
               <p>Q. You was always as certain of the persons of the two men as you are to day of Quinton, and of Boxer? - Yes, I was not drunk, I was always as certain.</p>
               <p>Q. Now before the justice you swore to the persons of the two men as you have to day? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At the watch-house you was as positive of the persons of the two men as you are to day? - Yes.</p>

I said because I cannot; and I had been gone about two dozen yards to the best of my knowledge, and I heard the man cry out for the watch; I looked back but I did not go my further and I saw the man, and there were three men run past me in a very great hurry, and I was come to my own home and I saw the prosecutor talking to the watchman, I made over to him. I went to cross over to speak to him, the watchman made for answer that he saw this young woman in your company, and he said he would take me into custody, and I went along with him to the watch-house, the prosecutor said that he would give no charge of me, and I knew nothing of the robbery, but the watchman said that he should take me untill he found the young men, I was put into the watch-house all night long.</p>

When I came to the justice they said it was for this robbery; they brought the man in and asked him if he knew me? the man said he did not.

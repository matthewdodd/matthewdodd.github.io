                  </hi>. I am a baker, of Friar-street, South wark. On Saturday night, 20th July, in consequence of information, I had two policemen in my cellar—I went to bed at half-past twelve o'clock—I saw the premises secured—the bottom part of the loft-door was bolted, but the upper part of it was thrown to, but not bolted—about two o'clock in the morning, I was disturbed by hearing a noise in the shop—I came down, and saw the two policemen and two men in a state of conflict in the shop, they were fighting with life-preservers—I got a light, and saw a lantern and a lot of coppers on the floor—the two men were handcuffed and taken—I had left 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-worth of coppers on the side-board in the shop; some of it was in the same state in which I left it, but upwards of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had been removed—there was a good deal on the floor, and I saw 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.-worth of copper taken out of one of the men's pockets—the house it my dwelling-house—I did not see the prisoner at all.</p>

I was with Delaney, watch<lb></lb>ing the prosecutor's premises that night—I was under the staircase, between the shop and the bake house—about two o'clock I heard a noise, and we came from our hiding-place, and saw two men—as soon as they saw me they made a blow with a life-preserver—we got the two men, and took 5s. in copper from one of their pockets—a great quantity of copper was on the floor—I heard the sound of another person quite plainly—I am quite confident there was one other person if not more, but we were engaged with the two persons that we took—the entry was made from the loft-door which was unbolted, and was about nine feet high from the street—we found the shoes of the two men that we took, in the loft—after those two were disposed of, I received the description of another man, and in consequence of that I took the pri<lb></lb>soner—I found him in a house in Duke-street, in the Mint—it was some time before we could get to him, we had to burst the door in—Delaney went to the window, and communicated to me that the prisoner was in the room—when I took the prisoner, I told him I wanted him for breaking into Mr. Doughty's house—he said he would go quietly.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in King-street, Friar-street, and am a baker, On Sunday morning, 21st July, I heard a rattle, spring in front of Mr. Doughty's shop—I saw a man come out of the loft which abuts on the street—he dropped from the sill—I am sure the prisoner is the man, I had known him for three or four months before—when he dropped, I heard something fall</p>

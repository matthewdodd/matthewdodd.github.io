               <p>John Baden. On the 14th of June, about 10 at night, I went into the house of Mr. Dunn in Little St. Martin's-street. I had my watch in my pocket when I went there. There was no body but these two girls, and I lost my watch there.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you in liquor?</p>
               <p>Baden. I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any acquaintance with them before?</p>
               <p>Baden. I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. did you meet with your watch again?</p>
               <p>Baden. Yes, I did the Friday following in the same house; the constable and I went there, and it was found in the bed where the prisoners lay.</p>
               <p>Q. from Brannan. Did you feel either of us take the watch?</p>
               <p>Baden. No, I did not.</p>

            . The two prisoners lodged at my house. They came home at a little after 11 o' clock, and the prosecutor and a watchman came after that, and inquired for Peggy; he said he was a friend of hers. I brought Peggy to him; then he laid his hand upon her shoulder, and took her out into the street, and charged the watchman with her, and took her away. After that I heard

            . The night the prosecutor lost his watch, he came to my house, I being a constable, with the prisoner Brannan. I sent him to the constable of the night, but he would not take charge of her. The next day I heard she had the watch, I took her and the other prisoner; I asked Morris where the watch was; she said when I was searching her lodgings on Sunday, the watch was hid in the grate. I went and searched it again, and in searching the bed they lay upon, I found the watch among the feathers in the bed, in the house of this Riley.</p>

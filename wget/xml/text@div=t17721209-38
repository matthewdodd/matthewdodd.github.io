I keep my money in my bed room up one pair of stairs; my wife and I, and this girl, were the only people that had access to this room; when the bed was made my wife used to help her; the door, when we were not doing business in the room, was always kept locked; sometimes the girl was left there to do the work after making the bed. She owned she had taken it; it was in a drawer in a new chest of drawers in this room; a bag of silver of 30 l. had been there a month or six weeks; I made this bag a reserve for change when the taylors came to my house; I had another bag of silver in the drawer which I used to resort to for common change; there were 13 l. odd shillings only left in it when I came to examine it on the 3d of November; the girl went away the 1st of November. The way I found it out was. I had ten guineas to put up; I happened to put my hand upon this bag, and found it less than it ought to be; I counted it and discovered my loss. I wondered the girl did not come back for her wages; I heard she was flush of money; I took her up; she did then own she had taken it at different times; that she had taken some on Friday the 13th of October; we found this key (producing it) in a drawer of a chest of drawers which this girl had to keep her things in; it unlocks my drawers as well as the key I have myself.</p>

I had observed that the windows were shut down at half-past six o'clock, and at a quarter to seven, I observed two men near the house - I turned round, looked at them, and they looked at me, and crossed over to Bulstrode-street - I got right opposite her Ladyship's house, and saw the parlour window sash open. I rang the bell, and informed the servants; I then went after the two men, but not overtaking them, I returned to the house, and was informed that there was a man in the parlour; they unlocked the door, and I found the prisoner standing at the door, inside the room. I asked what brought him there; he said he had hardly any shoes to his feet or victuals to eat. I took him into custody. The window was shut down when I passed, half an hour before.</p>

On the 17th of December, I had not shut the shutters, this window was not fastened down, as the hasp is out of repair, but it is never opened. Hall came to the door, and from what he said I went into the room, shut the window down, and shut the shutters. The maid-servant came in with a candle. I then saw the tail of a great coat laying under the bed. It is her Ladyship's son's bed-room. I locked the door. Hall returned: I unlocked it - we both entered, and found the prisoner in the room. I will not swear that the window was not open, as I had not been into the room before.</p>

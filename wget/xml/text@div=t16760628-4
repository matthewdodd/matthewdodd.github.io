                   passing by over the way at that instant, the aforesaid Gunstick driven by the force of the Powder gave him a mortal Wound in the Back, a little below the left Shoulder; so that immediately falling, before or almost assoon as he could be taken up and got into the next Shop, he died
            </rs>, being only heard to pronounce these words, Ah Lord! I am killed ---- I am a dead man. In the mean time the Boy little thought what mischief he had done, and was only troubled at the loss of the Gunstick, which he missed assoon as he had discharged the Piece. But many people hearing the report of the Gun, and seeing from whence it proceeded, presently ran thither to enquire; going up stairs they finde the Boy with the Gun, who confessed he had shot it off; but when they told him, he had killed a Man, he struck his hand on his Breast, crying out, Ah! What shall I do, I am undone: testifying that he did not intend or imagine any hurt to any Creature, and expressing much sorrow for the same, as he did now likewise upon his Tryal. Some pieces of the Gunstick were produced<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="16760628005"></xptr> in Court by the Chyrurgeon, which were taken out of the Gentleman's Heart. The Jury could do no less than bring it in <rs id="t16760628-4-verdict16" type="verdictDescription">

            </rs>; the Court having declared their opinion before, that under these Circumstances it must be more than Chance-medley since he shot off the Gun premeditately and voluntarily, though the killing the man was accidental.</p>

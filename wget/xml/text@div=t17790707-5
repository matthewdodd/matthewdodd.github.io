On the 17th of June, in coming home after eleven o'clock at night, I lost two guineas and an half in gold, and a pair of garnet studs; they were in my breeches-pocket with my gold.</p>
               <p>What was the value of the studs? - I cannot be positive; they were certainly worth a guinea.</p>
               <p>Who took them? -

            .</p>
               <p>One of the prisoners? - Yes; I met the prisoners at a door in Ratcliffe-highway; I had never seen them before; I asked if there was a publick-house open near; I was faint and tired; they said, if I would give them something to drink, they would show me one; I said, agreed, and went with them. They were going to take me up a street; I said, I would not go out of my way; it did not signify; they then took me to a house in Bells-street; I said, this is not a publick-house, I will not stay; they said, if it was not they could get me something to drink. I gave Hope all the halfpence I had to fetch some beer. When I gave her the money, she threw her arms round me, and began hugging me. I felt her hand in my pocket; I pushed her from me, I did not think she had time enough to take any thing. They then both went out, and left me sitting in the room. I sat about five minutes; they not returning, I began to suspect they must have robbed me; I then felt, and missed my studs and money. I thought it not safe to sit there, left they should send somebody in to ill-use me. I went to Justice Sherwood's and was directed there to go to St. George's watch-house. I went, and got two watchmen, and came and found the door fast; they had got in; I heard their tongues and a man in the room. The watchmen took them in bed together, about four o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Was Hodget near when Hope took the money and studds? - I believe about two yards; I believe she was innocent enough of the matter.</p>
               <p>When did you see the four guineas and a half? - In Tower-street; I had five guineas; I changed a half-guinea at the Ship in Tower-street.</p>
               <p>They were apprehended by your information? - Yes; the watchmen took them in bed together. When we came before the justice, the party I alledged the robbery to have been committed by behaved audaciously.</p>
               <p>Was that Hope? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was she searched? - Yes; when they took her out of bed there was nothing found upon her.</p>
               <p>From Hope. Had not you been in other company before you was in company with us; with two women, and gave them three-pennyworth? - No, I deny it.</p>
               <p>Hope. He wanted to give us a dram; we did not want it, he would give us some.</p>

The prisoner used to lie in the house with another man that worked in the gardens. When I was in Monmouth-street, the man described the person he bought the things of; then I suspected it to be the prisoner. I asked him to come to Richmond: he came: Sir Charles directed me to take him and another man that was with him, and tell the gardener I had got two friends to see the hot-house; we went into the garden. The prisoner came with the key of the hot-house, one of the men looked in his face, and said, Young man I have some knowledge of your face, I think I have seen you lately in London? The prisoner said no, you have not; the other said pray was not you in Monmouth-street such a day? first he said no, then the other said he was there on the Monday last, and he bought a thickset frock and waistcoat of him. Upon his being charged with the things, he said he did not take them out of the room, but found them withoutside the gate, on some dung against a tree.</p>

I asked him how he came by them, he said his master that he worked with before he did for Sir Charles, owed him 5 or 6 l. and could not pay him, and he let him have those cloaths in part of pay; and on the Thursday morning I hurt my shoulder, and was not able to work for a week: he said as I could not work, he should be obliged to me if I would go and get half a guinea on the scarlet waistcoat. I carried it, the man said that is not your waistcoat, I said no, but it was a friend's of mine; he lent me a crown on it. The Monday following he desired me to go and sell the frock and waistcoat; I went and offered them to several places at Fulham, then I went to Monmouth-street, and sold them for 24 s.</p>

On Friday night, 1st Oct., about ten minutes to 12 o'clock, I was on duty, and saw the prisoners Langley and Churchill close to the dead wall of the tailor's shop of St. Pancras Workhouse—they were coming in a direction from the tailor's shop—Churchill was carrying an accordion, and said to me, "Would you like to have a tune this morning?"—Langley was carrying a bundle—they turned into Cambridge-place, and I saw Hasker come up to them from the lower part of the dead wall, and he received the bundle from Langley—they all three went on, and I followed them till I got the assistance of Billinghurst—I then asked Hasker what the bundle contained—he told me a pair of trowsers he had purchased in Camden Town—I asked what part of Camden Town, and they all three immediately ran away, and left me with the bundle—I ran after them, and caught Hasker by the collar—I had a severe struggle with him—he took a large flint stone from his pocket, and struck me on the nose with it—I had a violent struggle with him, and secured him—when I got him to the station I found he was wearing two pairs of new trowsers over an old pair, and the bundle contained two more pairs of the same sort—Mr. Everett and Mr. Day have identified them.</p>

About 12 o'clock on Friday night I was called to Pethen's assistance, and went with him after the prisoners—Churchill had an accordion—Hasker said he had bought the trowsers in Camden Town—the other prisoners were present, and heard what he said about them—while we were speaking to them they left the bundle, and all ran away—I followed Churchill, but he was too quick for me, and got away—Pethen was knocked down in the road, and I went to his as<lb></lb>sistance.</p>

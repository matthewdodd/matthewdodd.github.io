I saw the fowls safe in the yard, at six o'clock on the evening of the 23d of December, and missed them at eight o'clock the next morning; there is a gateway to go into the yard, which is generally locked at night-it opens into the road. There is no latch to the gate; there is a lock, it is always open in the day-time: there was no mark of violence on the gate.</p>

            . I am a patrol. About three o'clock on the morning of the 24th of December, the two prisoners came behind me in a cart. I asked them where they were going - They said, to buy fish, at Billingsgate. I asked them who they were. Burton said, his name was Burton, from Southgate. I asked him what was in the cart - He said, nothing but empty baskets. Norris said, he was going to seek a place in town; and Burton told me, there was a very suspicious cart behind loaded with furniture, and that I had better go back. I followed them to Newington-green, and then searched the cart with the watchman's lantern, and found three geese, and some fowls. Burton told me, they had fowls and geese, and that he bought them at Mill-hill the day before, of a woman. I secured them</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I never met any body so early in the morning.</p>

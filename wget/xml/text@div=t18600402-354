               <p>March, after leaving my master's, I went to Mr. Prior's, 100, Pentonville-road, an eating-house keeper, in company with a friend, a young man named Henry Mason—I saw the prisoner there, he came in afterwards—I had known him before—there were no words spoken at all—we called for our suppers, and I tendered payment for it—the prisoner then told Mr. Prior to look to me for his sixpence, that he had no money—I told Mr. Prior that I was not to pay for it, as I had nothing to do with him—the prisoner then told Mr. Prior that he had better lock us both up—I asked him what he meant by "us," and he said, "you"—I said I should not pay for it—I asked Mr. Prior for my change out of the money I gave him, and Mr. Prior said he must have it from the prisoner—he told the prisoner so—he said nothing—Mr. Prior said he must have the money from him by fair means or other<lb></lb>wise—the prisoner said he could do which he liked—I then got up to go out, and the prisoner got up and struck me with a knife, and would not let me go—he made an attempt at my neck, but I put down my head, and he struck me down the back—I leant my head forward, on one side, seeing the blow come, to avoid it—it cut right through my coat and waistcoat—it did not cut my shoulder—it did not hurt my body, only cut my coat—I tried to get from him, and he laid hold of me—we fell down—while on the ground be struck me twice in the chest—while we were falling first, he struck the knife into my hand—it is well now—on the ground, he tried to strike me in the chest, and the knife bent up—he struck me twice on the cheat with the knife—it was bent when he struck me in the chest—it did not go through my clothes—the point was bent right round, it could not go through—I do, not know what bent it—I am sure it was straight when he took it up—it was bent in the scuffle—he was on the top of me when he did this—I was down—I then got from him, and the policeman came in—I was sober—before goin into the eating-house, I had seen in the Belvidere with this same friend—I had seen the prisoner there, but nothing had taken place, no words passed, but I heard the prisoner say that he would put a knife into anybody that ever interfered with him—he was sober—I do not know how be came to expect me to pay for his supper—I had never paid for his supper before, or he for mine—I had known him before, by asking him to come and wash my carriage for me as a job—he washed it twice—I gave him a shilling, and some beer and bread and cheese for it—he knew my friend Mason.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep an eating-house, 100, Pentonville-road—on the night of 21st March, the prosecutor and his friend Mason came into my house about 10 minutes past 12—they called for some supper—the prisoner followed the two in—they had their supper, and the prisoner also—after that Mason left, and I then went to the door—I came back, and in consequence of something my wife told me, I went and took a shilling back to the prosecutor—he had tendered a shilling to my wife for payment of his supper—I said, "You have given my wife a shilling to pay for the supper—there are three suppers; do you intend this shilling to pay for the lot?"—they had had boiled beef, pickles, and bread—he said, "No, that shilling is to pay for mine, I have nothing at all to do with the others"—I then turned round to the prisouer and said, "I am to look to you then for your supper" he said, "I have no money, you must lock us both up"—I said, "Well, you may please yourself, I will either have it by fair means or foul, I won't be imposed on by you nor any one else"—then he turned round to the pro<lb></lb>secutor and said, "You had better lock us both up"—the prosecutor said, "What do you mean by us?"—he said, "You"—then a scuffle arose, and I saw the prisoner take a knife off the table—it was a dinner-knife—this is it</p>

               <p>(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is the knife that had been used for their supper—he held it in the shape of a dagger—on seeing that, I ran across the road for a con<lb></lb>stable, and on my return, the prosecutor was bleeding from the hand—I did not see either of the stabs given—when I returned, the prisoner had laid down the knife in the shop—he refused to pay for his supper, but he did when he saw the constable—he had not sufficient, so I took sixpence, all the money he had got—the prisoner and prosecutor were both sober.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, N</hi> 273). I was on duty in the Pentonville-road on 21st March a little after 12 at night, I saw a crowd of persons at the door of Mr. Prior's eating-house—I was called in—I saw the prisoner stand<lb></lb>ing at the door, and the proprietor of the eating-house as well, asking the prisoner for the money for his supper—at the same time I saw the prosecutor's hand bleeding—I examined it—it was not a very deep cut—it was done by stabbing, not a drawn cut—it appeared to me likely to be done with a table-knife—this knife was given to me by Mrs. Prior—she said this was the knife the prisoner had put down—the prisoner offered to pay for the supper afterwards, in my presence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> On the night in question there were three of us in company; we had been in company all that evening; we went to the public-house, and when that closed we went to the eating-house. Mason called for three suppers, they were brought; as soon as he had finished his supper, he got up and went out without paying; directly after, Thompson offered to pay for his; it came to sixpence. Mr. Prior asked him if he was going to pay for the three suppers, he said, no; that was to pay for his own, he had nothing to do with the other two; on that Mr. Prior said, "I shall look to you for the remainder." I said, "No, I have only money to pay for myself, and cannot pay for anyone else;" that was Mason. He said, "I will not be imposed on by you or anybody else; I will have it by fair means or foul." I said, "Then you had better lock us both up." Thompson then rose up and struck me a violent blow in the face; I struggled with him, and forgot, in the height of my passion, that I had a knife in my hand, and we both fell. I made no separate blows or stabs; he got his hand cut in the struggle; as to attempting to put it into his chest, or saying I would stab anyone, it is entirely false; he is prejudiced against me, having some time ago employed me for eight or nine days, and at the end of that time he gave me threepence, in addition to what he gave me for the work; and I, not thinking it enough, left it with the landlord of the beer-shop where he was employed; and for that cause he is prejudiced against me.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City police-inspector</hi>). Bradley took the prisoner into custody on another charge—after he was in custody I went to his house, in Church-passage, Aldgate—I searched, and found this counterpane and other things—I found his wife there, and I had seen him there just before—I found this table-cover, this toilet-cover, and blanket, and some pieces of carpet on the floor, about two or three yards square—Mr. Wood was with me—I found two pairs of blankets, and two quilts more, Mrs. Whitcher begged for one of each to be left behind—she said the children would be without any.</p>

                  </hi> I am in partnership with my brother; the prisoner was in our employ twelve or thirteen years—we dismissed him on 4th Nov.—his premises were searched on 18th Oct.—we did not take away anything at that time—I saw the premises searched after the prisoner was in custody, and saw these things found—his wages were 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—these blankets are worth about two guineas a pair—they are three yards and a half long, and three yards wide—we keep a great stock of them—some of them have been missed, we hardly know how many—this counterpane is worth 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—we have missed a large quantity of them—this toilet-cover is worth about 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—we missed articles of this kind and of the same size—I have no mark on them—we had table-covers similar to this—we have missed about 200—we had a large stock of them—they were not in the department where the prisoner was; they were in the same warehouse—one of the carpets found was a square carpet; the other was painted drugget—the carpet was worth about 32<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was not the' drugget very old? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Perhaps two or three years—the prisoner was dismissed in Nov. last, in consequence of the way in which I found we had been plundered—all the porters were dismissed—when I searched the prisoner's house in Oct. I had two policemen with me—I do not recollect seeing this table-cover then; I saw this blanket and this counterpane—this toilet-cover is a cot-quilt—it is a very good one, and worth about 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—we have blankets from 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a pair to 80<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I do not identify</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184902260081"></xptr>
               <p>these by any particular marks—we do not mark blanket—these an not common, you would get them at very few shops—I think these blankets and toilet-cover have net been washed; the counterpane has—I believe the whole of these articles to have been part of our stock—the prisoner used to sweep the ground-floor of the warehouse.</p>

                  </hi>. I am warehouseman to Messrs. Woods. I have looked through this property—I cannot say anything about this table-cover—I believe the other articles to have come from mv masters' stock—there is no mark on any of them—I form my judgment from having lost goods of this description—five of these toilet-covers are missing, and six of these counterpanes—we have not finished the blanket stock—we have missed tea or twelve pairs.</p>

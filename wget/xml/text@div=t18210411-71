The woman remained in the room sitting up, and the door locked. I awoke about six o'clock and she was gone. I found my pocket-book in my pocket, but the notes gone, and my watch safe. I expected to find her still there. I had received the notes on the Monday before, and made a memorandum of the notes and dates. I made a noise and the prisoner came up. I asked if he belonged to the house, he said he did, and his name was Arnold; he said he neither knew the woman or me. I went and got Brown, the officer, returned, and found the house locked up. I went to the Bank and stopped the notes, the prisoner was taken next morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Where did you get the notes - A. From a banker's in Lombard-street. I made a memorandum of the notes before I lost them. I have a memorandum of what notes I paid away, those lost are successive numbers.</p>

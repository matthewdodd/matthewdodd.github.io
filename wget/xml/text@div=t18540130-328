                  </hi>. I am seven years old. One evening in Jan. I was coming home with another boy in the Albany-road, which is at the top of the York-road; I think it was on a Saturday, it was about dinner time—we met the prisoner Holloway, he said to me," Go to the York and Albany, and fetch me half a quartern of lovage;" he gave me half a crown and a bottle—I went and asked the barmaid for it; I gave her the half crown, and came out with the lovage and the change—the prisoners were then peeping at the corner of the York-road—I gave Holloway the lovage and change; Bevan said, "Give him a halfpenny, and let us run off"—Hollo<lb></lb>way gave me a halfpenny, and they both ran off the Kent-road way.</p>

               <p>21st Jan., the little boy came for half a quartern of lovage, and gave me half a crown; I gave him the lovage, and the change, and he went away—I put the half crown in the till, there was no other there—not more than five minutes afterwards I was spoken to by a man named Varndell, and took the half crown from the till; there was no other there; I found that it was bad, and gave it to Ann Cain, another barmaid, who laid it on a shelf—I afterwards found another bad half crown in another till, and gave that to Ann Cain, who laid it on the shelf by the side of the other—they both remained there half an hour; I heard that the prisoners were taken, and gave them to Edward Varndell; this is the one I received from the little boy, it is rather more battered than the other.</p>

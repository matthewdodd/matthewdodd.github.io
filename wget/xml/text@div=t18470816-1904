I was called on board the <hi rend="italic">Monte Video</hi>, and saw the prisoner—the mate, whose name I do not know, made an accusation against him—it was a foreign name—he said he should not be able to attend, as the ship was going away—he charged the prisoner with stealing Spanish doubloons—he denied it—I took him into custody, searched him, and found nothing on him—he told the sergeant he had stolen the money, and told me so as well—he said he had stolen the money from the ship—he said it was the mate's and mentioned his name—he went with us—as we passed Mr. Snelley's shop there was some money in the window—he said, "There is some money in that window which looks very much like mine"—we went in—I inquired if Mr. Snelley had bought any foreign money of a sailor—he said he had—I asked if he should know the man again—he said he did not know, but that the prisoner was very much like the man—the prisoner did not say anything—we all left the shop, and went to the station—I afterwards took the prisoner to Arbour-square, where I heard him say, "I have stolen the money from the chest of the ship's mate"—he said he had sold it to Mr. Snelley.</p>

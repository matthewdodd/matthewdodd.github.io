                  </hi>. I am a widow, and keep a shop in Cross-street, West-moreland-place, City-road. About a quarter before four o'clock on the lst of Dec., I was sitting in my parlour, at the back of my shop—I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner in the shop—I got up to serve him, and saw him leaning over the counter, with his hand in the till—I screamed—he took his hand out, drop<lb></lb>ped eight farthings on the counter, and ran out—he never spoke a word—(there was more money in the till)—I ran out, and cried, "Stop thief"—he was taken by my neighbour—I went back to my shop, and picked up the eight farthings—I went to my till, and missed about eight farthings from it—I had seen my money safe not five minutes before—the prisoner was brought back to my shop—I am certain be is the person.</p>

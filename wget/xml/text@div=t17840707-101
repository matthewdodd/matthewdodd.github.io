            ? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. My Lord, on the face of this note Mr. Pearce has indorsed it, and therefore he certainly cannot be a witness to prove that this is not his hand writing.</p>
               <p>Court. He has a property in the bill.</p>
               <p>Court to Pearce. You suppose yourself to be the person to whom this bill is made payable? - Certainly</p>
               <p>Then if the bankers had paid it without your indorsing it, they are liable to pay it again? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>They certainly are, you have a right to recover it certainly? - It is not my property, I never had it in my possession, I never saw the note till I saw it at Mr. Croft's.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Have not you a claim of 4 l. 4 s. on Mr. Davis? - No this bill was to have been remitted to me with a bank<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178407070147"></xptr> note, to pay a debt of Lieutenant Cole, it was an act of friendship, I paid the debt for him, it is no property of mine.</p>
               <p>You never indorsed the bill you say? - I never saw it.</p>
               <p>Court. Then how do you know that you are the person to whom this bill is made payable? - I have it here in writing.</p>
               <p>Court. That will not do? - I can do no more, it is no fault of mine, there is an indorsement upon the back of the bill that is erased, and I would infer from that, that it is very much like the name of the prisoner, I do not say that he wrote it, if it was to be held to the light the letters that are erased will appear very much like it.</p>
               <p>Court. That is a matter of consideration.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. How many are there of your name in the world? - I cannot tell; there is never another in the Excise office.</p>
               <p>Court. But there is no mention of the Excise office in the bill, and Mr. Davis is not here to shew us who

            ; the next is, this bill being indorsed with a blank indorsment, has the same effect as a draft payable to the bearer, it makes that bill payable to the holder, and the writing the name upon it for the satisfaction of the Banker is merely an attestation to the receipt from the Banker: therefore this should have been described as a receipt for the money; in which case if they had called evidence that this man's name was not John Churchill, it might have been a case for your determination: but at present there is nothing in this case in point of law, on which you can convict the prisoner.</p>

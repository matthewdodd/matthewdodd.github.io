                  </hi>. I am a watchmaker, of No. 4, Newman-street, and am in partnership with Sigismund Lucien Imer. I first became acquainted with the prisoner in Aug. last, when he became our clerk at a salary of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per week, and his expenses paid—it was part of his duty if I sent him to receive money for articles sold, to bring me the money the same day—if he has received 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Mr. Simmons, of Newington, he has not paid me—I sent him for the money, and it was his duty to pay me the whole sum; he paid me 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. only—this receipt (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is in his writing.</p>

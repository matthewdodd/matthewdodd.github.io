               murder of her female bastard child

               <p>She stood charged also upon the coroner's inquisition for the said murder.</p>
               <p>It appeared the prisoner denied her being either married or with child the day before she was delivered. The child was found in a box, in her room, dead, on the 22nd of July. All the evidences deposed there were no marks of violence upon it. She in her defence said it was her first child, was taken in labour sooner than expected, and being surprized, had not proper assistance as is necessary. She called the person who was ordered to search her room, who produced a quantity of child-bed linen; and called Mr. Clark, who lives in the Temple, who depos'd, she came to him about two months ago and told him her case; and that he would assist her in speaking to a surgeon to help her; and that a Jamaica gentleman, one Mr. Roberts, was the father. James Mophat deposed, that one Mr. Roberts, who is now gone to Jamaica, had applied to him to assist a young woman with proper conveniences, who he expected would be delivered of a child about Christmas, but did not mention the prisoner's name.</p>

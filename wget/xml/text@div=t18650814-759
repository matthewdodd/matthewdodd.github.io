                  </hi>. I am one of the Sanitory Inspectors of the City of London—I was formerly a butcher—I was on duty in Aldgate-market—I saw the two packages from the prisoner, containing part of two hind-quarters and two fore-quarters of beef—it was in a very pale and emaciated condition—it was coated with hot fat inside and out, and upon removing that I found inflammation between the ribs—in my opinion the animal had been suffering from disease some time—I made an incision in the buttocks, and found it smelt very strongly, which I presumed was physic—it was totally unfit for human food—it was covered with fat to hide the disease—I took possession of the meat, and had it condemned in the regular way—I took these labels (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) off the packages—on 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. August I went down to Halesworth, and saw the prisoner—he made a statement, which I took down in writing—this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was sent with the meat—(<hi rend="italic">In this letter the prisoner stated that the cow had met with a misfortune, and broken its jaw-bone, that it had no disease whatever, and that the farmer of whom he bought it had kept five stone of it for his own family</hi>,)</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would diarrhoea or cold constitute disease? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Diarrhoea and dysentery together would—Diarrhoea of itself would produce wetness—the meat did not smell until I cut open the buttock—the ground upon which I say it was unfit for human food is from the wetness of the meat and the smell of the physic in the flesh—I have known of diarrhoea being caused to persons eating meat which had been physiced—it is common to rub poor meat over with fat, but it is only rubbed on the outside, not inside—the calf that was sent with this meat was good.</p>

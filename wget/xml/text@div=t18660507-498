I made a post-mortem examination, and found very extensive peritonitis, quite sufficient to account for death—there was no external evidence of bruises, but on examination the muscle covering the abdomen was discoloured as though from bruising—the symptoms were such as would arise from external injury—a blow from the fist on the abdomen might cause what I found—he was a very healthy, strong, muscular man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and am in service with Mr. Barrett, at Mortlake—this is the first time I have been examined—my mother was dangerously ill at 33, Frances-street, Westminster-road, where the prisoner lives, and I was sent for to go up from Mortlake—I went up on Sunday—it was as near as possible 4 o'clock when I arrived at home—I sent for a candle at about half-past 10 or a few minutes later—they were putting up the shutters and closing the shop—the prisoner was sitting on one side of the door, and Mrs. Shields at the other—the prisoner said, "Shall I bring you the candle?"—I said, "If you will be so kind"—I did not go out—I did not go back till the Thursday—I had seen the prisoner sitting at the door before that, when I went out for some milk to make some arrow<lb></lb>root—I saw the prisoner again at about twenty minutes to 9, when I let a friend out who had come to see my mother—I think it was the prisoner who knocked three times at the door for me—when I wanted the candle, I sent the prisoner for it—I do not think it was quite half-past 10—she brought it from the corner shop—I saw her after that, when I went across to the beer-shop, the corner house, to get a pint of beer for myself—directly I left the candle up stairs and got the jug I came down—the prisoner was then sitting at the door with a shaw! over her head—I had occasion to go into the yard after 11 o'clock—the street-door was then locked, and the house was quiet—I bolted the back door after me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> At what time did you send out for the candle? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A quarter or half-past 10—it might not have been later—I have known the prisoner some time, but I live away from them—I come up once a fortnight or three weeks, on a Sunday—I know it was 8th April because I received a letter on the 7th to come up and attend to my mother, and surely the next day must be the 8th—when I sent the prisoner for the candle her hair was in disorder, and her face dirty—she did not seem as if she had been away from the door, as she was very untidy, and I did not know that she had combed her hair out.</p>

               <p>8th April, I was standing at the street-door with the prisoner—it was from about half-past 10 to a quarter-past 11—the public-houses were shutting up—I said that it was time for her to come to bed, as the public-houses were shutting up—she came in and said, "Good night, Mrs. Shields; I am going to bed"—her mother said, "Mrs. Shields, tell Mrs. Casey to shut the door, as me and my family are in bed"—Mrs. Casey is the landlady.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Can you tell me how the prisoner was dressed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She had neither bonnet or shawl on—she had a buff cotton dress—she was quite sober—she was with me all day on Sunday—she did not move out at all; scarcely outside the door—I live up stairs, and she lives in the lower part; but I went up and down stairs, and she said to me, "I am sure I shall not go out to-day, because I have got no clean clothes to put on:" only very shabby clothes, just such as I have on myself now.</p>

The prisoner and my son and one of the lodgers were sitting outside—I was in my room, and saw them—I would not move out, for fear of the draught—they were there till quarter past 11, when I closed my door, and the prisoner went into her own room—I did not see her go into her room; but her mother told me her family were in bed, and I was to close the door—I did not see the prisoner, but I knew her voice—I have known her since she was a little girl—I did not see her at a quarter past 11, when her mother told me that her family were all in.</p>

I live at Mrs. Casey's, 33, Frances-street—I was at home on this Sunday night, and saw the prisoner at our door, to the best of my belief, at half-past 10 o'clock—I have got a clock, and I think it is right—it was a fine afternoon, and they were sitting down at the door—I saw her sitting there after that, and Johnson, Morragan, and Mrs. Shield—she sat there from half-past 10 till half-past 11—I was at the door—my boy was sitting with them, and I went and told them to come in, and the landlady said, "Shut the door; it is time for us all to go to bed"—Mrs. Morragan said, "Is Margaret in?"—she said, "Yes;" and I saw her going into her bed-room—she lives in the back parlour.<hi rend="smallCaps">

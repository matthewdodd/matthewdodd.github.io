On the 30th of April, between four and five in the afternoon, I happened to be looking about, and I saw a bag lie near the storehouse, under the carriage of a cannon. I took it up and shook it, and a pillow-case fell out, and there was something like the dust of salt in it. I called Dale: he said it was salt-petre; he took it to where Mr. Horton and another man were at work. Mr. Horton is the cheque-master of the works.

            . I examined the bag, and took particular notice of it; it was a different bag to what we use for saltpetre, and had a particular darn upon it. I directed them to put it in the place where they found it, having no doubt but somebody would come for it: it was carried there; I afterwards saw it there. About eight o'clock, I was informed they had got a man with some saltpetre. I went, and saw it was the prisoner. I asked him how he came by it; he said he found it by a bundle of hemp, which was about 200 yards from where the bag was concealed. I went and examined the warehouse; the window was broke: there are bars to the window, that would not admit the whole bag to be taken out; the bags were lying against the bars, three of them were cut, and the saltpetre taken out.</p>
               <p>Whose property was it? - The King's. I am sure this is the bag I had first seen; we knew of four bags being lost; they weigh about a hundred and a quarter each bag; it was worth about 5 l. a hundred: this man had been employed, and knew the saltpetre was deposited in this place.</p>

This man came and laid hold of me, and asked me what I had got; I said I did not know, I was going to my barrack to see that.</p>

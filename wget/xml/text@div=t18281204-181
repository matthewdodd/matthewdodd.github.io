            . I live with my father, at No. 25, Queen-street, Spitalfields. On the 5th of November, at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182812040077"></xptr>half-past nine o'clock in the morning, I was coming down Brick-lane, a young man snatched my cap off and ran into George-street with it, and there was a whole mob with a man - they had a young man with a mask on his face in the mob - there was no donkey then; they took the man up in their arms and carried him down George-street - and when they came to near the end of George-street they turned round another street, and round another at the end of that, and went up Hare-street-fields; they there met three or four young men coming with a donkey, and sat the man in the mask on it - they then went down towards Bethnal-green-road into Hackney-road, crossed there, and down some more turnings into Philip-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Well; did you see Mr. Brooks at any time? A. Yes; I was in what I think is called Hyde-place - a good many of them collected round him; some went on in front and came back again; they all turned to him, and John Quay struck him with a stick; I am certain of Quay's person; they all got round him, and I saw a young man put his hand to his watch and pull it out; I should know him again I think - it was not any of the prisoners; he took his watch, and then ran away across the bridge and down a place - I saw Wheeler there, he was round the mob and acting with them; I did not see him do any thing - he was among the men who were engaged about the prosecutor. I got my cap from the young man.</p>
               <p>Q.After the gentleman was robbed, what became of the party? A. They all went across the brick-field - they kept together while they were in my sight; I saw an officer and told him, and came to Worship-street with him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was there not a great many persons there? A. Yes, it was

             - there were forty or fifty in the crowd, and great confusion among them; I am above thirteen years old - I was very much frightened.</p>
               <p>Q.Were you not a good deal occupied in trying to get your cap during a good deal of the time? A. Yes: the occurrence with the prosecutor was over in about five minutes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. You are quite sure the man who stole the watch is not here? A. Yes; quite sure - I have seen them about the streets before; I was looking at Wheeler particularly, and saw him do nothing.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q.Had you got your cap before the robbery of after? A.When they all came round the robbery - I have seen Quay about the street, and am positive I saw him strike the gentleman.</p>

            . I live in King's-row, close to the Rosemary Branch. I saw a Guy and the mob; I was close to Mr. Brooks with my little girl; I saw Mr. Brooks step out of the carriage-road on to the footpath out of their way - I saw the crowd rush against him, and I suppose that was about three minutes before they got his watch; they struck him three or four times on his face and head - the blood gushed out of him and came on my hand: Wheeler and Dennis were there; I saw Wheeler rush against Mr. Brooks for the space of half a minute, and then I saw his hand in his pocket; I did not see Dennis do any thing, but he had a stick in his hand, and was close with Mr. Brooks.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q.How old was your child? A.Four years - she was walking; she was alarmed and cried, and I was alarmed; I am sure I was close to Mr. Brooks, and observed the crowd before they came up to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe before they came up that they had a quarrel among themselves, and were striking each other? A. No, I did not; there might be four or six persons close to Mr. Brooks at the time I saw Wheeler's hand in his pocket - but I saw Wheeler for the space of half a moment before he went up to Mr. Brooks; I did not say the mob all rushed on him together - I do not mean to say they went up singly; the footpath is only on one side of the road and I was on that side; I know Moss, he was not there - I did not see him there.</p>

On the 5th of November, about eleven o'clock in the day, Wheeler came to my shop; I live about fifty yards from where Mr. Brooks was robbed - I saw none of the transaction, but saw Mr. Brooks bleeding afterwards; Wheeler came in a direction from where Mr. Brooks was bleeding, about that time - Mrs. Taylor was in my shop two minutes before, and went towards where Mr. Brooks was robbed.</p>

            . I am an officer. I apprehended Wheeler on the 10th of November, at a public-house, and asked him where he was on the 5th - be said he was at home from nine o'clock in the morning till between one and two, making fire-works; nothing further passed then; after I brought him out of the tap-room I told him to go in and sit down again, not being satisfied sufficiently to take him, and in less than five minutes we had information that he had left the house, and was gone to the Bull's Head public-house; I went there, and took him - I told him the charge; he said he should like to see the party, to see if they should know him - he was taken to different houses, and then to the Whitmore's Head, Hoxton; I sent for Taylor, told her to go into the room, and see if she knew any body - she went in, came out, and said she knew one man there, and pointed out Wheeler as one of the men who were round Mr. Brooks at the time he was robbed; Page, the butcher, went in - he came out, and said he knew one man, and pointed out Wheeler: I then told Waters, in the prisoner's presence, to take him - he called to me, in the prisoner's presence, and said, "I want to speak to you;" I went, and Wheeler said, "I am not going to suffer for other chaps - I know the chap who robbed him, and I had a sovereign out of the money at the Halifax Arms, next day;" Groves came to me and surrendered, as he had heard I had been to his master's about him.</p>

I said, "I don't know" - he said,"If you will tell me of six people, I will let you go;" I said, "Would you have me swear to six innocent people?

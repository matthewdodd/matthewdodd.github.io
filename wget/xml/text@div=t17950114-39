               <p>Q. Did he lodge with you? - No, he did not. On the Saturday before this affair happened he was brought to our house, being a foreigner and could not speak English, if we could speak to him, and get him a lodging; he asked if we could get him a lodging, because he had just come from Jersey, for he had been about every where; I tried to get him a lodging, and let him sit in my parlour till the lodging was ready; on the Mon<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179501140071"></xptr>day following he came in and said he was a <rs id="t17950114-39-deflabel233" type="occupation">miniature painter</rs>

I spoke to a lady for him, that lady came to me, and that introduced him into our parlour. The next day he came when I was out, and he sat a long time in the parlour with my husband. On the 3d of December, he came again, in the afternoon, about four o'clock, he asked if my husband was out? I told him yes; he asked me if my little girl was at the school? I told him yes; he said, tomorrow he should paint her picture; he had agreed with my husband; he asked me if I fold writing paper? he asked me if I fold hair ribbon first; I told him yes, and he had a yard; and then he asked me if I fold writing paper? I told him yes; he said, could I permit him to write in my parlour, for his room smoaked so? I told him yes; and I gave him the pen and ink, and prepared him the table, and he would not write on the table, he would write on his knee, and he drew near to the drawer where the money was in. In five minutes before he came in, I had occasion to count my money, I had a gentleman coming with a bill, and I counted fourteen guineas, thinking I might have more money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lock your drawer? - No, I did not lock it. At the time of his writing I had an occasion to go into the shop, to grind some coffee; I left him in the parlour, in the same place where he was writing, close to the drawers. I ground the coffee, I was about twelve minutes in the shop, and when I went back again, he asked me for a water, and asked me for the post; I told him where it was; and he wished me a good night, and said, tomorrow morning at ten o'clock he should come and draw the child's picture. When he had been gone about five minutes, my husband came in, and I asked him if he had taken any money out of the box? he said no, and I said, why we have but fourteen guineas, and I know we ought to have near twenty; he said, he had no money in his pocket, and I took the money out of the box to shew him and there was but eleven in the box.</p>
               <p>Q. What does your family consist of? - Nobody but a little child.</p>
               <p>Q. No maid servant? - No maid servant in the house; there was no person in the room but this man, I shewed him the money, and I said there are three guineas now gone since this man has been here; I sent over to his lodgings and I was informed he was gone to Richmond, and should not come home all night; he came in the next night and said good morning madam, I did not come as I promised; I said, no sir, will you walk into the parlour and sit down, I went into Greek-street, to two women that knew him, and they came and he ran away at the sight of these two women.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask her why her husband is not here? - We keep a shop and he is not able to speak a word of English.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your husband appear before the court of justice? - Yes, he did.</p>

            's, his wife received me rather ill, called her husband and quitted the room; the husband told me that money was missing, that he had ten or twelve guineas and a bank note of ten pounds, that he found two guineas less. This declaration she made also, before the justice of peace; and that he suspected me to be the person who took it, because I had been and wrote in the parlour, but he could not convince me, that he shewed me his resentment and indignation and went to carry me before a justice of peace, then he told me that perhaps he might be mistaken; that was not sufficient for me, I returned to my lodgings were I had been four days, it was given out that I was a thief, and they would not receive me there; I returned again to Le Comte, his wife had been to the justice of peace; I saw myself attacked by a number of people, stop theif is cryed out, surprized, a stranget in this country, not knowing the usage or customs, I went to run away, I was stopped, I was beaten, they took from me what I had about me; a guinea and half and two shillings, which I had in my pocket, and I was carried before a justice of peace; the wife of Le Comte was there already; she declared that I had taken three guineas out of a box that was in the drawer, wherein there were fourteen, and a ten pound note, and the husband who did not think proper to have me arrested, declared he was not positive as to the sum he had in that drawer, that he only missed two guineas; see there is a manifest contradiction, and the wife of Le Comte, declared to an emigrant of my acquaintance before I was arrested, that she had missed nine.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is that emigrant? - He is a priest. Nevertheless, the wife of Le Comte told the justice that she suspected me to be the person that took the three guineas, because, I had remained alone in the parlour, she declared that the drawer was not locked, but did not say that there is a door comes into the parlour which I informed myself of, that door goes into an alley going into a street; on this suspicion the justice of peace caused me to be imprisoned and caused the money to be returned that had been taken from me, and now, my lord and gentlemen, I will inform your lordship and jury from whence I got this money; it is necessary and proper for you to know that I have been treated very unworthily; Mr. Channelly, an em<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179501140073"></xptr>grant, who raises a body of emigrants in the British pay, he is colonel of that body of troops; I not having the means of subsisting, not being able to partake of the bouney of government, not being of the age of fifty years; I engaged in Mr. Channelly's corps, and he gave me three guineas, and the guinea and half found in my pocket was a part of it; Mr. Maleet, an emigrant from France, deputy of the French slates general in the year 1789, had addressed me to him; the justice of peace sent to Mr. Maluet and he declared in writing that he knew me, from having been captain of dragoons in France, and an aid-de-camp during the serge of Lyons, and if it was possible to find three guineas on me it must come that was; that writing ought to be before the eyes of your lordship and you gentlemen, and Mr. Channelly also, will if needful, declare, that on the 1st of December, last past, that is to say two days before I was imprisoned, he gave me three guineas as a bounty, as being engaged to him. I now intend, my lord and gentleman of the jury, to establish my justification. First, when I came into the parlour there was a maid servant in the room, she quitted the room immediately; it is untrue that I remained alone in the parlour, the daughter of Le Comte, eight years of age remained with me during the time that the wife of Le Comte quitted the room for a moment. Secondly, my lord and gentlemen, could I guess that there was in the drawer which I knew nothing of and which did not lock money, that is not probable, and the justice of peace himself was surprized that fourteen guineas and a bank note of ten pounds. should not be under lock and key. I hurdly, if it had been proverty that had prompted me to rob, instead of three guineas, I would have equally taken the whole, the fourteen guineas and the bank note of ten pounds, and I could equally with the same facility have carried away two gold watches also, that were hanging in the room, belonging to Le Comte. Fourthly, If I had robbed the prosecutor I should not have returned the next day, that is not probable, besides there is a door in the parlour which belongs to that room which leads to an alley, and from thence to the street; is it not possible that somebody might have come in into the parlour before me? and can this woman in conscence swear that no person came in before me.</p>
               <p>My lord and gentlemen, a stranger as I am in this country an unhappy emigrant, I have not the faculty or means of getting a counsel, I do not speak the English language, be pleased to hear this my petition or memorial with your usual justice; I defended the cause of my king at Lyons, I have a thousand times escaped death in many battles, am I to fall here under the worst of calumny, an unhappy Frenchman, an unhappy father; am I reserved never to see my wife and children? now my lord, I persuade myself when I think I have for judges the wisest of men, who will weigh in your justice the justice of my cause, you will confound my enemies, and in rendering me my honour you will render me my life.</p>
               <p>Court to Le Comte. Was there any woman in the house before yourself at the time that you suspected him taking the money - Nobody but myself, my child came in just as he was going out.</p>
               <p>Q.Did any woman come in with the child? - No, she came in by herself just about two minutes before the man went out.</p>
               <p>Q.Was the drawer shut or open? - Shut.</p>

               <p>Jury. Is there a passage door leading to an alley? - No, no passage, but what goes into the yard; passage and alley is the same word in French.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any access to that parlour but through the street door? - No other.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot come out of that parlour and go up stairs? - Yes, you can, but there is a door that shuts in the parlour that prevents it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you lodgers? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Have your lodgers any business in the parlour? - They have no business whatever; I never permit them to come into my parlour.</p>

            . I pawned the articles, with Staples's, by direction of the prisoner. She asked me to pawn them for her; one parcel for 1s. 6d., and another for 1s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. JONES. Q. Are you married? A. I am. My husband is a cordwainer, and lodges at the prisoner's house - she gave me the things on the 4th and 6th of October - she gave me the first articles in her own parlour - I did not tell any body of this till the policeman asked me the question, which was nearly a fortnight after I pawned them - the prisoner was then in custody - I never pawned for her before - I never heard it said that I had taken the things - I am certain she asked me to pawn them - I think it was after dinner - it was not dark - I gave her the money- she said she intended to redeem a blanket with the money- I pawned them in my own name - I did not doubt their being Wood's.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Mrs. Tinsley went out - I do not believe she did lock her door, for she left her window open- a poor woman came to lodge with me, and came backwards and forwards, but I had no idea she would go up to their place - I picked up the duplicates, and a blanket and purse - I asked her whose they were, being convinced it was not right - I went up stairs, and found the prosecutrix's door open - as soon as they returned, her husband came in, in very great haste, and asked me for some warm water to clean her donkey's eye, which was hurt; and, directly they came in, I told them I was sure they had been robbed - previous to this I had asked Holman to pawn these things, to get the blanket out, thinking they were my daughter's, and not the prosecutrix's - I redeemed the blanket - the prosecutrix said that was not all - I said, "I will make you recompense for the rest" - I let her have a pig worth 12s., and forgave her 6s. which she owed me for rent, that she should not be angry - I agreed, as to the two duplicates and things pawned by Holman, that I would take them out, and if any belonged to her she should have them - I hunted nearly two days for the woman, and when I came in at night she fetched a policeman to take me, saying she would have her revenge.</p>

             re-examined. I did not agree to take one of the pigs for part of the property - she wrote a note, and laid it down on my table - I said I wanted nothing of the kind, for it was as hard for her to lose a pig, as for me to lose my property - I never suspected her till two of the duplicates were found - she offered us a pig not to make a disturbance about it, as her husband knew nothing of it - she gave 2s. 0 1/2d. to get my blanket out - I agreed to that- she said she would redeem the rest of the property in a week - I did not say afterwards that as it was not redeemed I would have my revenge, nor agree to take any thing for the property.</p>
               <p>MRS. HOLMAN re-examined. I have known the prisoner three or four years - I never heard her character questioned before - she is rather in comfortable circumstances - she had five pigs - I heard Mr. Tinsley say they were going to have one of the pigs, and he had agreed to find potatoes, and fatten it; and, afterwards, Mrs. Tinsley said she had got a paper that her pig was paid for - she afterwards said, she was given to understand that Mr. Tinsley would be taken up for a robbery, if he took the pig from the stye - she did not tell me she was to have the pig for the property lost - she was talking about the property lost, and said what use was the pig to her, for she wanted her property she complained that Mrs. Wood had not got her property back, and she would have her revenge.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I found the duplicates of the things, and got them out, and got Mrs. Holman to pawn them to get the blanket out - I took nothing out of the room - the instant I found the duplicates, I turned the person out of the house- her name is

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. DOYLE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came your husband to be a prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was an action brought for slander; it was tried before Baron Martin in 1850, and there were no damages obtained—there was 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. put down, and Baron Martin said the jury would not allow any expenses, and my husband was arrested for the costs in that action—when the prisoner was introduced to us, no one was present but me and my husband—there might have been a Mr. Borer in the prison—I know Mr. Huggett now; I did not know him then—neither Mr. Borer nor Mr. Huggett brought the prisoner to my husband's room—there was no person present at the time he came up—the prisoner first said he would go and search the book, and he did—I bare not seen this paper before (<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>); it was a little slip of paper he had in his hand—he told me the entry in the judgment book was only 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that was all—if we had owed the money we should have paid it, but not owing it we did not wish to pay, and my husband was in prison for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I suppose you told the prisoner you did not owe the money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We told him there was something wrong, because the Sherriff told us we ought not to go to prison—the prisoner told me to go and get the papers, and I brought them him—it was before I brought him the papers that he suggested the writ of error—Mr. Sorrell had the papers before; he was our attorney—he was an attorney—the person who came to us, and whom my husband asked to file the schedule in the Insolvent Debtors' Court, was not an attorney—when the prisoner came to us, it was between 15th March and 4th April, 1851—he said he could get us out under the writ of error, but, if not, he could get bail—I do not remember the prisoner suggesting to my husband that he would introduce him to an attorney—my husband did not say, "We want no more attorneys," never; nothing of the kind—the prisoner never brought us a document purporting to be a writ of error—before we saw the prisoner, my husband had applied to the Insolvent Debtors' Court—we told the prisoner that; we told him we bad applied on 15th March, and the Commissioner, Mr. Laws, told us that he would remand it till 4th April, and he told us on 4th April what Baron Martin had said—there was a meeting to give bail, to bail ray husband out of prison—that had nothing to do with the writ of error.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When the two gentlemen came to give bail, did the prisoner say to them that the matter required consideration? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He told them that the bail was no good, that my husband could not get out under bail, because he was an insolvent—he did not say, that because my husband was insolvent, it would he waste of money, to proceed; he said bail was of no good, because my husband was insolvent—the prisoner came to me after that—he did not express some disappointment about the way matters had turned out; about my not having told him the whole truth—he said that a writ of error would not do, and we had better compromise, and he would go with me; that was after we went up on 4th April—I did not ask the prisoner to assist us in this insolvent proceeding—I gave him half a guinea and a brief to deliver to Mr. Nicholson, but I believed the prisoner was an attorney—on 4th April my husband was heard at the Insolvent Debtors' Court, and the Commissioner said he had been to see Baron Martin, and he said he should do nothing till he was in Court—he appointed Mr. Nicholson assignee—he was the opposing creditor; he was the man that had my husband in prison—the reason of this delay from April to Nov. was to see Baron Martin—my husbandwas</p>

               <p>remanded till 4th Nov" and Nicholson, the opposing creditor, was appointed assignee—I cannot tell the reason of this remand—there was no concealment of property in the case—my husband assigned a house to my brother—it was mine; I had bought it at the hammer—my husband assigned it to my brother some time before he went to prison; it was not with a view to his insolvency—I cannot tell whether he was remanded on account of that assignment—he was remanded till 4th Nov.; I do not know why he was remanded—Mr. Law did not say it was a fraudulent assignment of property—it was after that that the prisoner advised me to compromise—he did not say we had better pay the debt and costs; he said we had better compromise, and he went with me to Mr. May and asked what he would take, and he said 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I said I would try and get it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Your husband was in prison for 72<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he petitioned the Insolvent Court to be discharged? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he was remanded from March till April, and from April till Nov.—we paid the whole of the schedule debts, 104<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—during all this time my brother-in-law collected the rents—the money did not find its way to my husband; sometimes it did—if my brother wanted the money he had it—the money did find its way to my husband, but that has nothing to do with it—we sometimes had it; sometimes my brother had it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What part of the prison was your husband in? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The back part; he received 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—he did nothing at all to get that 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he was put there for a false debt—Baron Martin said each party was to pay their own costs—my husband was discharged on paying 104<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I got the money of my brother—I have not paid it him; I still owe it to him—the freehold house is still in my brother's name—that is not to protect us from our creditors; we have no creditors—the house is still in my brother's name, but it is our property.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And being in possession of this, your husband went on the poor side of the prison, and after he was discharged he paid his debts? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; he paid his schedule debts, but was not discharged for three days afterwards, 11th Nov.—the debts were paid on the 8th—after my husband was got out there was a notice went to Mr. Sturgess—I was present when the prisoner advised my husband to bring an action against Mr. Sturgess—he said, "Get the money back"—I did not talk to other persons in the prison about bringing this action—there were no papers left at our house about that action of Mr. Sturgess, nothing of the kind—I never saw this paper before to my recollection—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I see how it is addressed; we lived there—I do not know anything about this paper—I never saw any more papers—I talked with the prisoner about employing a counsel—a counsel had been employed over and over again—in this particular action the prisoner said they had got big men against us, and we must have a big man—he said they had got Sir Fitzroy Kelly against us, and he must have Sir Frederick Thesiger—the record was withdrawn—I do not know what a nonsuit is—I do not know that there was a nonsuit in this case—we never owed a penny—there was another action after this against my brother, but that has nothing at all to do with it—there was an action brought against him by Sturgess to make him pay all the rents he had paid us, and to get back the deeds—he charged my husband with fraudulently making an assignment—the action went into Court—Mr. Atkinson was not our attorney—we never gave him any instructions whatever—there was a verdict against my brother for 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the prisoner consented to a verdict—Mr. Yeovill and Mr. Lush were the counsel engaged—there were some witnesses, and they wanted to get into the witness-box—I do not know whether Mr. Lush would</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185307040011"></xptr>
               <p>not allow them—Mr. Yeovill and Mr. Lush contented to a Verdict—I did not charge the prisoner with having sold us on that occasion to Harrison and Walker—I never said to anybody that he had sold us—it was through him that the verdict was found—I did not say he had sold us—I had good reason to believe it—we employed the prisoner from March, 1851, till last Nov., and then he said he was not able to obtain his certificate on account of not having settled my business—I found last Nov. that he was not an attorney—I had not the slightest idea of it before—I know Mr. Huggett; I met him at Worship street—he never said anything to me about the prisoner not being an attorney—he said nothing about it—he said he was a most clever man—he did not say he was not an attorney—he said there were many lawyers who could not do what he could—he said there were not many lawyers that knew the points of law as he did—my husband asked the prisoner whether his name was on the roll—I suppose that means having a certificate—the prisoner said he was an attorney, and I asked him myself—I was examined at Worship-Street, and told the whole truth, every word—I told the Magistrate that I repeatedly asked the prisoner whether he was an attorney—I did not ask him that every time—I told the Magistrate every word that I have told here to-day—the prisoner said he was an attorney, and his rather an attorney before him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you always passed in your own name of Perkins? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> When I attended to my brother's business I used his name—I never introduced my husband as my brother—I never did to Mr. Barton—I never introduced him as Mr. Foster—I never said I was Mrs. Foster, nor that I Was the wife of Foster.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. B. THOMPSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> At the time of this assignment you had no debts? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; the first action was against my husband for defamation—we had so debts then, and the cause of my husband being in this trouble was those costs—they were to pay their costs, and did not pay ours—the amount was 72<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—my husband became insolvent in March—while the prisoner was out on his own recognizances he came and offered me 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to forego this prosecution.</p>

I said "I don't know"—I saw Atkinson the second day; he was not acting as attorney—I do not know who were the counsel in that action—I was not called before any counsel—I had no conversation with Mr. Lush.</p>

I prosecuted the prisoner for an offence similar to this, and he was acquitted on a technical point—I have known him for several years, since 1849—he has been living by representing himself as an attorney, and robbing and plundering the world as much as he could—I have had several cases of this kind brought to me of tavern keepers and other persons—this is a check he passed on me where he had no effects, and he obtained 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from me—I was not subpœnaed here; I came from curiosity to see whether he would get off this time.</p>

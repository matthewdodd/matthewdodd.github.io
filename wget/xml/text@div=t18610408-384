                  </hi>. I am a baker—on 20th February last Bartel came into my shop for a twopenny loaf—he gave me a shilling—I told him it was a bad one—he said, "Then I will take a penny loaf, "and he put his hand in his pocket and gave me a penny—I gave him back the bad shilling—after he had left the shop I stood at my door and watched him till I saw a policeman—I gave a description to the policeman, and saw the policeman go after him.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, R</hi> 217). On 20th February I was on duty near the shop of the last witness, in Trafalgar-road—in consequence of something he said, I followed Bartel down the road—he was about 200 yards from the shop when I first saw him—I followed behind a van—when I came up to him he was with a man that made his escape, and with O'Connor—they were all in company together when I first saw them—I came up to O'Connor first—he was four or six yards behind the others—I took hold of him and said, "What have you got about you?"—he began to cry, and called out, "Father!" and Bartel looked round; both the men then began to run away—I gave the boy into the custody of a civilian who was standing there—I pursued Bartel for about sixty yards before I caught him—I took him back to where I had left the boy—I then took them both to the station—as I was pursuing Bartel I saw him lift his hand as he was running—that was in front of the workhouse—I marked the place with my eye, as near as I could tell—there is a fence in front of the workhouse, about four feet high, and I saw him lift his hand just to the top of the fence—after he had been taken to the lock-up, I went back to that place, searched there, and</p>

               <p>found this shilling (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) tied up in the corner of this handkerchief, just inside the fence—I searched Bartel at the station-house, and found on him this knife and a paper, but no money—I searched O'Connor, and found on him ten counterfeit shillings, all wrapped up separately, and a knife—I asked him how he came by them, and he said his father gave them to him to hold—I asked him who his father was, and he said the man that made his escape.</p>

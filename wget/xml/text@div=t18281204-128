            . I am a patrol. A few minutes before nine o'clock, I saw the prisoner come out of the door with a small cask on his shoulder, and a shovel - I followed him into Hart-street, and then stopped him, and asked what he had got there - he said, a small bag of composition, and what were his working tools; but I found it was a shovel, this lead, and a lock; I took him to the watch-house, and asked who he worked for; he said he could not tell me his master's name, nor where he lived; I asked if his employer ordered him to take away the lead; he said No, and I detained him.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>The prisoner, in his defence, entered into a long detail of the work he had performed, and stated that as the lodgers were removing, he thought it was best to remove the lead for safety.</p>

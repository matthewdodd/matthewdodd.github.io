               <p>Q. How did you hear him opening the cupboard? A. I heard him with a knife opening it - I went up, and he had the cupboard door open, and the glove of money in his hand - I cried out, that I was robbed; there was nobody else in the room - I am sure the glove was in his hand; he beat me with his fist, and I went down into the kitchen; he gave me a blow in the eye with his fist, and struck me with the handle of the knife - I had a black eye - he went out of the room, down into the kitchen, where there were a great many people - I accused him there, before my husband, of taking the money, and my husband beat me, because I had never told him what money I had; he did not know I had so much.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the prisoner? A. I was almost fainting, and asked for a drop of water, and as my daughter gave me the water, he ran out; he kept going on with the quarrelling; he said he would have another man, who had been two years in my house, and would stand in his blood between that and the morning; I do not know how long he remained in the kitchen - I do not know which way he ran, only he followed the other man (Richard Farrell,) who lodged with us; he was obliged to run away for his life.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever go and tell a Police-officer of this? A. I was going after him two days after the robbery, to get him taken up to Lambeth-street - I went there, but was crowded away, and they would not let me say any thing - I went to the office, on the Friday; he has not returned to our house since, only that night, when he came like a madman, and said he would have that man's life; he had not given us warning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Now, on your oath, did not the prisoner, himself, complain at the office first against both of you, for assaulting him? A. My husband and him went there first, with one another; that was two days after the robbery; they charged each other<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182801100046"></xptr>with an assault - I went after them, to get him taken up, when I heard he was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, on your solemn oath, did you at the office say a single word about a robbery, when the charge of assault was preferred by your husband? A. When I went there I did - I went there, and was crowded out, and turned away - I then went to Worship-street; they said at Lambeth-street, that there was nothing for me there, and turned me away, and I then went to Worship-street.</p>
               <p>Q. After O'Brien robbed you, did he take the sovereigns down stairs to the kitchen with him? A. That I do not know, because he knocked me down, and beat me; he was in the house when my husband beat me; he struck my husband with the knife, before he went out - I do not know how many men were in the kitchen at that time - I cannot say whether there were five, six, or seven.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the reason that you remained for two days without going to the office, about the one hundred sovereigns? A. I followed him there, when I heard he was there - I did not complain of it before, as I was waiting to get him taken up - I never wanted the prisoner to marry my daughter; he followed me on Christmas night to my bed - I never told his brother, that if he did not marry my daughter, I would make him suffer - my husband used to give me his earnings; but before I was robbed, he did not bring me to account; he knew I had some money - I never counted it before any body; a woman who lodged in the house, has seen me with ten and forty sovereigns on Mr. Benjamin's table; she is at my house now; my daughter has seen me with a good deal of money; the prisoner wanted to have my daughter - I often missed money out of my cupboard - I once missed two sovereigns, and told my husband of that.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner in the kitchen when you told your husband he had robbed you? A. Yes; and I said he had got all the money I had in the world; he went down into the kitchen directly, before I did; I did not see the money there; the people in the kitchen were my lodgers.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body demand that the prisoner should be searched? A. They saw my husband beat me after going to Lambeth-street; I went three days running to the Priest, and after that went to Worship-street; the prisoner was taken for quarrelling; he was set at liberty - but that was not in my case; when I mentioned the robbery, I was pushed outside; I was at the office on a second occasion, with my husband - he was going to mention about the robbery with me.</p>
               <p>MICHAEL MURPHY. This is my dwelling-house. On boxing-night I had been to bed, and I came down to the kitchen between seven and eight o'clock; I lighted the prisoner three times up stairs that night, to get him to bed; he was up stairs when my wife went up; she and he came down together; I cannot say who was first; she said she was robbed, but did not say of what, or by whom, at that time - but called for a drink of water; she said soon after that O'Brien was the person; I knew she could not be without money, but did not know what she had, whether it was 1l., 100l., or 200l.; when she said she was robbed, I gave her a slap in the mouth, for fear of a row being in the house - I believe the prisoner remained there about an hour after; he went out after another man, to a public-house; he had kicked up a row; I went to bed, and was forced to get up again; I found him in the kitchen; he went away in about half an hour; he never returned to lodge at the house; he had given no notice to quit; he paid weekly - this was the middle of his week; I went to Lambeth-street for an indictment against him for a row, for he had stabbed me with a knife before he went out; I went there a day before my wife; I did not complain of a robbery, for she did not tell me what sum she had lost till the next day; I never inquired the sum; my wife went to the office to get an indictment against him for robbing her; I offered, on the Friday, to tell the Magistrate of the robbery, but did not mention it; I mentioned it on Saturday to Norris, the officer; he told me there was nothing to be got there; we went to Worship-street afterwards, and got a warrant, for Vann to apprehend him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. On your solemn oath, did he not go the office to get a warrant against you for an assault? A. Yes; he got his warrant after I got mine - the Magistrate dismissed both charges, that was on Friday; he heard us both - I said nothing to him about the robbery - my wife told me that it was one hundred sovereigns, about ten or eleven o'clock on the Friday; my wife came to the office about twelve o'clock, but the officer would not let her in - he told her she would get no warrant; I swear that: it was Norris - she did not go to Worship-street till the Wednesday following - I went myself to the Lord Mayor, and they told me I should get no warrant there.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When did you go to the Lord Mayor? A. On Saturday; I made the first complaint at Lambeth-street; my wife did not tell me the amount of the money till after I left the office on Friday; the Magistrate only looked at both of us, and said he would not hear the warrants.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did not the prisoner complain that you was detaining his box, with forty-seven sovereigns in it, and the Magistrate sent an officer for you to give it up? A. No; the officer told me to give it up; he told the officer it contained valuable property.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you been an officer? A. Five years - on the Thursday after boxing-day I saw O'Brien at the office, but do not recollect seeing Murphy there that day, but I know he was there, as both the assault warrants were granted on that day - Mr. Wyatt, the Magistrate, heard them both at full length - Mrs. Murphy was outside - I took her into the office about three o'clock- not a word was said to the officers or the Magistrate about a robbery then - both warrants were discharged, and I heard nothing further till I was fetched to Worship-street, on the Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Q. Then is it true that she told you of the robbery on Friday, and you turned her out of the office? A. Quite the reverse; I took her before the Magistrate - she was not turned out, but after she heard the warrants were discharged, she said, "I will have a warrant for him myself now;" I said she had better go about her business - she had said nothing before that; I took her in before the Magistrate, and told him that she wanted a warrant, he said,"Send her out about her business."</p>

            . I have known the prosecutrix twelve months - she was at the public-house with me at the time the prisoner's brother died in her house, she drank in my company, and I was at her house at the wake and the funeral; last Saturday week she told me she had lost no money, and had nothing to lose.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where was it she told you this? A. I saw her in Goulston-street - she came up; I said, "Mrs. Murphy, how do you do? you have had a fine row at your house; is it true that you lost all this money?" she said,"My dear, I had nothing to lose, but there was great injury done to my things, and they won't make me a recompense; I have got him safe enough, and am determined to keep him there till he makes me a recompense;" the prisoner's sister lodged with me, and I told her of this - my husband is a labourer.</p>

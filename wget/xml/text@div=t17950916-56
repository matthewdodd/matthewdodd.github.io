               <p>Q. You are servant to Mr. Westbrooke? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He lives at Islington? - Yes. That man came with the two coalmen, and he helped them with the coals, and he delivered the sacks to the man as they were brought, in the cart.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in the cart? - Yes; he delivered them all but one, and he said, he must go and wash his hands; he went into the yard to wash his hands; there was nobody at home but myself, and I went to the door listening to the men counting the sacks, I told the men to be so kind as to stop, while I went to see what the man was about who was washing his hands; as soon as I returned up the passage to the man, he went into the kitchen, and the watch lay on the dresser covered over with the work bag, and I came down the passage, and I see the man come out of the kitchen, and I told him he had no business in the kitchen; his answer was, he wanted to see for something to wipe his hands. He comes and stands at the coals for a few minutes, there was a man came with some beer, I went in for some money to pay him; as soon as I came out to pay him, there was a man past by in a blue coat, and the prisoner at the bar said directly, ma'am, there is that fellow just come out of your house; says he, I would have you go and look; I went and looked round the kitchen, and the watch was gone off the dresser; I came out and charged the prisoner at the bar with it; and he said, if I thought he had got it, he would go to the White Lion and get a character directly; and he went there; I told the two coalmen to be so kind as to go after him to see what he had done with it. The men went after him, but they were not quick enough, he went in such a hurry.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever recover your watch? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. What kind of a watch was it? -A metal watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see this man come out of the kitchen? - Yes, and charged him with it.</p>
               <p>Q. When he told you that another man had been in the house, had that other man been in the house? - No, he never was high the step of the door.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask her how long she was up at the coal-yard, up at the top of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160158"></xptr>garden? - I never was high the coal-yard at all.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She came down and told me that the man was taken very ill, and he could not carry any more. - One man was ill, but I never left the men at all.</p>
               <p>Court. How far is the place where the coals were shot, to where they went with the coals?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. About twenty yards from the back of the house.</p>

               <p>I am a coal carman; I met this man in Gilispur-street. as I was going to Islington to this gentleman's house, and I asked him if he would have any thing to drink? I had been into Newgate with two casks of ale, to Mr. Stone, of Newcastle.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before? - Yes, by shoeing our master's horses; he is a <rs id="t17950916-56-deflabel328" type="occupation">farrier</rs>

I did not know any thing at all of his being in the kitchen until he was accused, and the young woman desired me to go after him; I went after him and found him in a court; he pretended to go to the White Lion for a character; he did not go to the White Lion, he went down the court and me after him; and when I turned the corner of the court my fellow servant was after him, and when my fellow servant came up to him, he knocked him down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take him? - Yes, and searched him, but could not find any thing on him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He did not search me, a constable searched me.</p>

               <p>Q. You belong to the coal cart? - Yes. All that I know about this business is, that first of all I was telling up the sacks into the waggon, and the gentlewoman came out and told me to stop; I had got fourteen told up into the waggon; she asked which way my fellow servant had gone, she had missed him a good while? with that she went backwards and see him washing his hands, and she came out and had the remainder told up, and afterwards she went in again, and came out and accused the prisoner with the watch; he pulled out and orange and dropped it on the ground, and said, he had got nothing more in his pocket; and he asked her to accept of the orange; she did accept of the orange, and he ran away towards the White Lion; I pursued him first, and my fellow servant followed, and I was up first, and he knocked me down, and my fellow servant came up afterwards and said, now see if you can knock me down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search him? - I put my hands down, and see no watch, nothing at all but an orange that he had in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. To Prosecutor. Was he searched at all? - I believe he was searched, but it was some time after this accident happened. He had been in this court some considerable time, and there are some not of respectable characters live there, and I suppose that is how the watch went.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to Bryant. Ask him if he did not search me before I went away? - No further than my fellow servant felt about him.</p>
               <p>Court. Was he searched before he went away from the court? - No, he was not by no soul.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That man, Mr. Darwin, searched me before I went away; I never went no further than to a house the back of the White Lion, and my friend was not at home, and the last witness came after me, and said, I must go back with him; I said, I will go back with you, and I struck him, but not to knock him down; they only want to clear themselves. They met me and asked me to go with them; I went with them; when<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160159"></xptr>the coals were all delivered, I went down to wash my hands; they accused me afterwards with this, and I went for my friend to come forward; he was not at home; I was talking to his wife when they came up to me; I said, I would be righted, and they took me up. The next day I was before the justice, and the justice admitted me to bail, and I was at work till last Thursday twelve o'clock; I beard I was indicted, and I came and resigned myself up voluntary; and one of the evidence know that I have worked ever since.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I consented it to be made a petit larceny, and he was admitted to bail, thinking he might be of some support to his family.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses to his character.</p>
               <p>Q. To Darwin. Do you know much of this man? - Yes; I knew him about three years by shoeing master's horses I never knew that he bore a bad character before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He knows that I work piece work. I have to make six dozen of shoes a day; I have two men to strike to me, and then have done work for the day; sometimes I have done by twelve o'clock <rs id="t17950916-56-verdict329" type="verdictDescription">

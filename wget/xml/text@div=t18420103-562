                  </hi>. I am a butcher, and live in Berwick-street. On Friday, the 24th of December, I went to bed, leaving one of the windows, which adjoin my shop, partly open—I got up about a quarter to eight o'clock the next morning, and found the window was quite down—I went to the till to get some halfpence to pay for milk, and found the till was empty—I opened the shop, and missed six ribs of beef—there had been at least two shillings worth of halfpence and pence in my till, and two fourpenny pieces—I missed a shawl from a drawer in a chest of drawers in the parlour—the prisoner is a shoemaker—his aunt lives in my kitchen, and he had lodged in my house, but did not at that time—I had some suspicion, and had him taken—this is the shawl I lost—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it.</hi>)</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Morgan, who keeps a coffee-shop in James-street, Covent-garden. The prisoner came there very frequently—he came on Friday morning, the 24th of December—he took this shawl out of his pocket, and said to me, "Maria, here is a shawl I this give you for a Christmas present"—I said I did not want it, but he left it with me—he told me he had bought it, and I took it up stairs—he had some beefsteak with him, and asked me to cook it—I said that was not a time that I cooked meat, but he said if I would cook it he should be obliged—he paid 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in halfpence for what he had, and went away.</p>

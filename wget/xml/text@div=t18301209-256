I have seen the prisoner about town for the last two or three years - he had applied to me for employment: I gave him a job or two - on the 20th of November he came and said he had an order from a gentleman in Cheapside for two reams of pink paper; I told him I had no objection to complete the order for him, but I could not afford to allow him any profit - he said, "I don't want profit, I only want journeyman's wages;" I then agreed to let him have it - he came on the following Monday, I was out; he came on the Tuesday, and I got it completed by the Thursday evening; I was out, my wife would not allow him to take it; he came the next day - he said, "Valentine, are you ready to take this paper to Mr. Wilson's;" I said "Yes, I will go in a moment with you;" I had expected from what he said, that Mr. Wilson would pay me - we went on to Cheapside, he went into the house, left the paper, came out and said to me, "We must wait for Mr. Wilson for an hour;" I said, "Well, I have no objection, suppose we go to a coffee-shop;" he said, "No, I want to go to Fetter-lane, and by the time we come back, the hour will he up;" we went there, he went into a shop, came out and said, "I have to wait twenty minutes," I said, "I will wait no more in the street," I went to a coffee shop, and paid for breakfast for us both; he then said he had a pain in his bowels, he got up as if to go to the bar, but went away, and I saw no more of him till I found him on the Wednesday after at Gravesend.</p>

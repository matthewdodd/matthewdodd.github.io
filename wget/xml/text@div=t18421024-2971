                  </hi>. I am a constable at the Eastern Counties Railway terminus, at Shoreditch. On the 20th of September I was on duty—the train arrived a little before six o'clock—a man came back, and I found that an umbrella had been left in the second-class carriage—the prisoner was lighting my lamp at the time to search the carriage, and must have heard the inquiry—I searched, and did not find it—Dock wood spoke to me—I then searched the first-class carriages, and found an umbrella—I took it to my inspector—I then took it back to the carriage, and went into another carriage—I had not been there two minutes before the prisoner came, and opened one of the carriages—he did not find the umbrella there—he then opened the next carriage, and took the umbrella from one body, and put it into the other body of the carriage—I then jumped out, and took him into custody—he directly said it was the first thing that ever he was guilty of, and he hoped I should say no more about it, on account of his wife and family—there is a general order, if any person finds any thing in a carriage, or on the platform, to take it to the office, and enter it in a book, in case the party calls for it—there are often things left.</p>

                  </hi>. I am superintendent of the police at the Eastern Counties Railway. The prisoner was brought to me on this charge—I said, "This is a very disagreeable situation in which yon have placed yourself"—he said, "It is the first time I ever did any thing of the sort, I hope you will forgive me."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I merely shifted the umbrella from one carriage to the other for better security, till there was an inquiry; I intended to ac<lb></lb>quaint the guard with the fact. It is my custom to look after the guards' great-coats, which were left behind. I had plenty of opportunity of taking it off the premises.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Taunton-place, Brunswick-street—the pri<lb></lb>soner is a bricklayer and builder. On Saturday, the 22nd of February, I heard a cry out that a man had fallen into a hole—I went and found the deceased had fallen down a hole, and somebody with him—I asked the parties who were down with him if I could render any assistance—they said, "Not at present"—I went to doors to get my hat, and when I returned the policeman had come up and got him out of the hole—he wan sitting by the side of the hole—the policeman took him in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> to St. Thomas's Hospital—I believe the prisoner was building in that spot.</p>

                  </hi>. I was building some houses adjoining when this happened. On the night in question there was no protection put to this hole—there had been a pole put up for two months at my three houses, a short distance from where this occurred, and my cellars had been turned over about nine days—I am certain the pole was there till then, but afterwards I am not sure pf it—this pole would prevent people from coming to this place, as they must pass my place to it—there was a pole at the end of this place at the time the accident occurred—while my pole was up nobody could have passed along there—I thought the pole was up at the time, and if it had been up a person could not have come on my ground and therefore could not get to this ground—it was frosty weather, and the</p>

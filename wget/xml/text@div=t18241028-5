            . I am a farmer's man. On the 8th of October I saw the prisoner standing by the Feathers, public-house, Kensington Gravel-pits, with a horse in his hand; a man on a pony came up to him, and asked the price of the horse - he asked 18 l.; the man offered 15 l.; he sold it to him for 16 l. 10 s.: 2 s. was paid as a deposit. The prisoner took the horse to the Coach and Horses stables. The man said he would go to Turnham Green for the rest of the money. I staid with the prisoner the while, as I thought the horse was sold under value: the man told the landlord that if he did not return by eight o'clock to let the prisoner have the horse and 2 s. I fetched Dawes, the constable, and gave the prisoner in charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You staid with him because you thought it was sold under value - A. Yes. I heard the bargain made. I said nothing to the prisoner about it; it was all done publicly - he was detained before the man came back.</p>

            . On the 8th of October, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I was going towards Turnham Green; the prisoner passed me with a horse; I asked if it was for sale - he said it was - I asked the price: he said it was worth a score. It had a cold, and was thin. I said it was not worth that, but I would give him 15 l., which he refused. I agreed to give him 16 l. 10 s.; we put it into the stables at the Coach and Horses, Notting-hill. I went to receive some money at Turnham-green, leaving 2 s. with the landlord, and said if he waited there till eight o'clock I would pay him, or he was to have the 2 s. and go away. When I returned he was detained. I have not seen the horse since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He did not attempt to escape - A. No. I would not give above 20 l. for it now.</p>

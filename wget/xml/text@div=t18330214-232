On the 14th of February I was carrying a loaf home - when I got to my own door I put down my umbrella to apply my key to the door - the umbrella opened again, and while I was attending to that, and trying to open the door, the prisoner came and offered to turn the key of the door for me - I let go my hand that he might turn it, as I knew him; he then put his hand into my pocket, and took out a little bag, with fifteen shillings and one half-crown in it; I did not speak to him, I only said, "Halloo, you scoundrel;" nor did he speak to me - I had the money safe just before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. How long have you known him? A. Since the 29th of June; there was no person near us - it was about half-past eight o'clock in the evening; I did not raise an alarm - he pulled out the purse, and 4s. 6d. in sixpences flew out of it, into the passage - I picked them up: I had been at the Court of Requests the day before, and the prisoner spoke to me then; my son had a claim on him for 17s. rent - I was to call on him that day fortnight, and he said he would pay me, but I had no quarrel with him - I conceived he was a poor man, and not able to pay.</p>

             (Police-constable C 1.) I apprehended the prisoner at a public-house in Macclesfield-street, Soho - I had received information a little before ten o'clock, and left word for him to come; I found on him 7l. 5s. 5 1/2d.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I believe he is a butcher? A. Yes; I have known him some months - he has a shop at the corner of Newport-market; I had seen him about ten o'clock on the night of the robbery, but I did not take him, as I did not know of whom the complaint was made.</p>

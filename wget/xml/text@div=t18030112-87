               <p>Mr. THOMAS SMART sworn. - Q. You are a surgeon? - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you examine the body of

            ? - A. I did, the second day after her death.</p>
               <p>Q.Are you able to form a judgment of what was the cause of her death? - A.She died of an inflammation of the lungs and heart.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you judge what was the cause of it? - A.There waas not any marks externally to induce me to say violence was the cause of it.</p>
               <p>Q.How long had the inflammation existed? - A. I don't think it could have existed more than twelve or fourteen hours.</p>
               <p>Q. Would beating and ill usage produce that inflammation? - A. There are various causes.</p>
               <p>Q.Is that a cause to which you can ascribe inflammation? - A. Beating and bruising will occation inflammation, but there was not any external appearance at that time to make me believe it was occasioned by violence, and had I opened the body without hearing the rumour, I should not have supposed it had been occasioned by violence.</p>
               <p>Q. was it that sort of instammation that might be occasioned by drinking? - A. The very frequent use of strong spirituous liquors might produce a strong inflammation; this was more violent than any I ever saw.</p>
               <p>Q. You should not have suspected any violence from the appearnace of the body? - A. I did not see any thing to induce me to suspect any.</p>
               <p>Q. was there that appearance about the body to lead you to accunt for the infalmmation by violence? - A. no; I can only say that violence, such as is reported to have been used upon the body, would produce such disease.</p>
               <p>Q.But would it not leave some external mark? - A. Yes; but there was not the least vestige of a bruise or contusion; I cannot pretend to say what squeezing or pressing might do, but blows or kicks must leave some marks.</p>
               <p>Q. You say it could not without marks of violence; but squeezing, such as you have stated, might do it? - A. I think pressure might do it, but I cannot say what the cause of it was.</p>

             sworn. - Q. Are you a married woman? - A. Yes; my husband is a groom; the prisoner is a chip hat weaver. On a Friday evening, in December, I cannot tell what day of the month, about five o'clock, I went to the prisoner's apartment and found him lying on the bed in liquor, and the deceased was smoaking her pipe by the fire. Her name was

            ; she was also in liquor. I went there to speak to Mrs. Lilly, and she was not at home; when I had been there about ten minutes, I asked the deceased wehre Mrs. Lilly was, and she said she did not know; she expected her in every minute, and I sat down to wait for her. The deceased said to the prisoner, you dog you have hooked my child many a time, and now I will hook you.</p>
               <p>Q.What did she mean by hooked? - A. He works with a hook at his business. She then began to scratch his face. She had been sitting by the fire side; she got up and went to the bed; I went to him, and held him down for fear he should strike her. I held him down while she scratched his face. During that time his wife came in; she was in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q.How long did you hold him down? - A. I dare say about ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q.Why did you not take the woman off? - A.She was so obstreperous she would not be persuaded by me; then the wife came in, and she began to scratch his face as well as her sister; they were both so obstinate they would not go out.</p>
               <p>Q.Why did the wife scratch him? - A.She thought he was ill using her sister, which was the deceased. I went and fetched in Mary Clarke; I was not gone above three or four minutes, and when I came back the deceased was on the floor; the prisoner was standing on her left hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he shoes on? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.What was he doing? - A. He was standing still.</p>
               <p>Q.Where was his wife? - A. She was standing in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw no blows? - A. No.</p>

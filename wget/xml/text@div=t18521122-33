                  </hi>. I am barman at the Admiral's Head, in Spitalfields. On 13th Nov. the prisoner came about 6 o'clock in the evening for a pint of porter—it came to 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I served her—she gave me a shilling—I gave her change—as she was going out of the door I noticed that the shilling was bad—I bit it, and immediately ran out with it in my hand to try to overtake the prisoner, but I could not, and I put the shilling in my waistcoat pocket—in about twenty-five minutes the prisoner came again for a pint of porter—I knew her when she came in—she offered me another shilling, and I directly found it was bad—I said to her, "This won't do; you are the same woman that came before"—she made a snatch and got the shilling out of my hand, and threw down a 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece, which was good—as soon as she had got the shilling, a young man standing by the counter seized her wrist, and pre<lb></lb>vented her from making away with it—I came round the counter and took it from her—I sent for the officer, and gave the prisoner and the two shillings to him.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable A</hi> 90.) On the 3rd of March, in the after<lb></lb>noon, I was on duty in Whitehall, and followed the prisoner and another man to Charing-cross—they looked in at Mr. Clark's shop, and passed up and down several times—I was on the opposite side, and missed sight of them two or three times—at last I saw the prisoner outside the shop-door, and close to it—I saw him take a bag from under his arm, undo it, and run towards the Strand—I there saw the other man with a ream of paper, and the prisoner received it into his bag—I went up immediately, and tried to lay hold of the other man, but he slipped under my arm, and I laid hold of the prisoner—he dropped the bag—I took him into Mr. Clark's shop—the prisoner afterwards said the other man had asked him to carry it into St. Paul's Churchyard—when he left Mr. Clark's shop he went quick, more a run than a walk—I had seen them together in Whitehall.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of my father, William Henry Clark, a stationer. I believe this ream of paper to be his—when the prisoner was brought into the shop I missed a ream packed up very much like this; it has every appearance of this—I had noticed it safe in the morning.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is not all paper packed in a similar manner, with the same excise stamp? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, the maker's name on it is Nash, of Kent Mills—our paper was of that name—I have no private mark on it—I noticed it there that morning—I was in the back part of the shop when it was taken—it was in the middle of the shop—we have one assistant—this was a sample</p>

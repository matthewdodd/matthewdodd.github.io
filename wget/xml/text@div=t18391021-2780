                  </hi>. I live at Slough, near Windsor. On the 2nd of October, I was going, with my cart, through Hammersmith—the prisoner asked me to give him a ride—he said he had come from Reading, and was going to London after a situation—I took him to town—I put up at the Greyhound public-house, in Smithfield, and gave him a breakfast and dinner—he went to look after a situation, and I took him back again with me—when we got near Kew-bridge, I got out of the cart to warm my feet—I allowed him to put my coat round his legs, as he was in the cart-a few minutes afterwards, I saw him walking by the side of the horse, and in less than a minute, I missed him and my coat also—the coat has not been found.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I apprehended the prisoner at Hammersmith, on Friday, the 4th of October—I told him the charge<lb></lb>denied ever being in a cart that week, but the following morning he admitted going to town, and back with the man nearly to Kew-bridge, that he was allowed to put the coat round him—he thought he would not go any further, and he got out of the cart and left.</p>

                  </hi>. I am superintendent of the business of Mr. John William Parker. at No. 445, West Strand—he is publisher of the Sa<lb></lb>turday Magazine—Messrs. Clowes and Son, of Duke-street, Stamford-street, are the printers—we employed the prisoner as a binder—we sent works to him to be stitched and bound—he was not a servant—in the be<lb></lb>ginning of December we gave directions to Messrs. Clowes to print 65, 000 copies of the Saturday Magazine—the prisoner was not aware of the num<lb></lb>ber to be printed—they were to he ready by the 19th or 20th of the month—I gave the prisoner an order to receive of the printer a number of those copies—he has only accounted for having received 15, 000 of them, but 15, 500 were delivered to him—I was with the officer when the prisoner was taken into custody—I asked him whether he had sold any of No. 224 of the Saturday Magazine for waste paper—he hesitated some time, and then</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is your master the proprietor of that work? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, the sole proprietor—it is not the property of a company of persons—Mr. Parker commenced the publication originally—no persons are joined with him in it—it is not the property of the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge—it is published under their superinten<lb></lb>dence—I do not know the editor—there are several persons who write in a, but there is no one who is the editor—Mr. Parker gets it up for publi<lb></lb>cation; that is, as to the arrangement—he receives it from various contri<lb></lb>butors, and the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge give their autho<lb></lb>rity for the publication—it has always been a successful publication—Mr. Parker pays entirely for the paper and printing, and pays the Society so much per thousand for what are sold—if they did not sell, he would pay nothing—he would be at the loss—he does not make out a debtor and creditor account of the profits—the Society have a divisible proportion of the profits, but not of the loss—when the work first commenced, three years and a half ago, I believe the Society entered into a contract with Mr. Parker, and I have no doubt that is the contract on which he now proceeds—I have beard Mr. Parker say, that provided there should be any loss, the So<lb></lb>ciety would not share the loss—I believe I have seen the contract.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> To whom does the copyright belong? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> To Mr. Parker, I have no doubt, but I never heard the question raised—he superintends the pub<lb></lb>lishing of the engravings as well—he does not deduct out of the profits of the concern the expence of printing and publishing—he accounts to the Society, without reference to them.</p>

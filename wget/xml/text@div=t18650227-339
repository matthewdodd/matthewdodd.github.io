                  </hi>. I am the wife of Benjamin Wybrow, a chair-maker, of 8, Kingsland-road—on the night of the 3rd of February, about a quarter-past 8, as near as I can remember, the two prisoners came into our shop together—they stood side by side—Wright asked to look at some chairs—I showed them to him as they stood—he would not let me move away—he looked at those that stood in front of him—I was from five to seven minutes showing them the chairs—I had a reasonable opportunity of looking at the men—I always look at people when I am serving them—after Wright had examined the chairs, Levi held one up in his hand—Wright said to me, "Have you any cheaper"—I said "Oh, yes"—I was going to get the cheaper pattern and he said, 'Oh, no, there is no occasion for that, we will send a young woman to-morrow to look at them and buy for her<lb></lb>self—then Levi said, "Yes, we will send a young woman to-morrow to look and buy for herself"—they then moved to go away—I felt in my pocket and found my purse was gone—I had felt it safe in my pocket just as they</p>

               <p>were coming in at the door; I was then placing it in my pocket—when I found my purse was gone, Levi had got down the two steps from the shop, but Wright had scarcely got down when I missed it—I instantly exclaimed, "You rascal, you have got my purse"—I seized Wright by the coat just as he got down the steps, but he was too strong for me and got away—they both ran up the Kingsland-road—Wright turned towards Hackney-road, and Levi crossed the road to a cab-stand into Shoreditch—my husband was in the back part of the shop at the time they were there, and my two daughters were looking at them through the parlour door; I saw them there—I saw Wright again about five minutes after, when he was in custody—I preferred the charge against Wright at the station-house, and was returning towards my own home and met Levi just this side of the station-house, not far from it—he then had another coat on over the one he had on when he was in my shop—my daughter was with me—I got in front of Levi, and said to her, "That is the other man"—I looked him well over to make myself certain he was the man—I noticed his general appearance, and I was confident he was the man, and then a constable came and took him into custody—I had never any doubt about his being the man from the first moment I saw him, and I knew his voice—I heard him speak in the shop, and when he spoke in the station-house that quite confirmed me.</p>

I am the husband of the last witness—on the night of 3rd February, about a quarter or twenty minutes past eight I came into my shop, when two men were there—I had an opportunity of observing those two men—the prisoners are the men—they were looking at some chairs my wife was showing them—I remained in the shop some time, and I went down stairs again—soon after I heard my wife call out, "They have robbed me, they have stolen my purse"—I instantly came up stairs and pursued, but did not see them then—I afterwards saw Wright, about 100 yards from my shop—my daughter Elizabeth had hold of him—I seized him by the coat-collar and said, 'You rascal, you have robbed my wife of her purse"—he said, 'Now, governor, hear me, I know where the purse is, and if you will come with me I will get it for you"—I said, 'I won't do so,' and called "Police" as loud as I could—a man had got hold of him then—he was surrounded by a mob—I caught hold of him, and he became very restive—he asked me once or twice to let him go, and I would not, and some one called out, "Slip your coat, slip your coat"—I found then we were surrounded by a great many persons of this kind—in trying to slip his coat it came open—I still held on fast, and the coat tore in my hands—it was torn almost to ribbons in trying to get it off—I then seized him by the back of the cravat, that gave way and I lost my hold again—I then seized him by the neck, and he got ray finger in his mouth, bit it right across, and made a large wound—I still struggled with him—I should think it was five or six minutes before a policeman came—some people in the mob pulled me by the legs away from Wright—the policeman came up and I said, "There he is, there he is, take him quick or else he will escape, 'and be took him—I have not the slightest doubt about the prisoners being the persons who came into the shop.</p>

In the course of the next morning, in consequence of an alarm, I went and found my trunk in the passage, broken open, and all these things gone, except two 1 l. notes - the wearing apparel was left.

            . I was in the Army, and am now a prisoner, on suspicion of being a deserter. On the 30th of April, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, I was confined in the guard-house, at Hounslow, the prisoners, M'Court and Rhodes, came into the black-hole where I was, they were on duty, and did not know I was there - there was no light there. I heard M'Court say to Rhodes, that he took the box out of the room - he did not say whose box, or what room; he said he took 48 l. out of the box, and he was afraid if there were any more in the mess they would be found out.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he said any thing before that - A. Not that I heard. He said he took the money, and told Rhodes to meet him at the Travellers' Friend, and then they would divide. After that he was going out, I rose up, they heard me - M'Court came, and said,</p>
               <p>"Who is that?" I said it was me. He said he supposed I heard what had passed between him and Rhodes, and I should not want for any thing while I was there. I then went into the guard-room. Next day I went out with the sergeant, and mentioned this to him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. How long were you in the black-hole - A. Forty days. I was never in confinement before. The guard is informed if there are any prisoners, but they did not know that I was in the black-hole, as I sometimes slept in the guard-room, which is separate; you go out of doors into a passage to go to the guard-room. The prisoners were on guard, but not on sentry - they were relieved next day; I told what I heard the next time they came on guard, which, I believe, was next day. I told them I had not heard what had passed, as I was afraid they would ill-use me. He said he would knock me on the head if told what I had heard. I told the sergeant when he came.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You generally sleep in the guard-room - A. Yes; if they had been in the guard-room, and had seen I was not there, they would have known I was in the black-hole, but not otherwise.</p>

            . I am sergeant major of the regiment. Mrs. Endfield reported the robbery to me - their room is in the barracks. On that night the prisoners' duty was to be in the barracks. I searched the whole regiment - nothing was discovered. The prisoner, M'Court, belonged to Enfield's troop. Anderson had been in the black-hole about thirty-two days - he reported to me what had passed.</p>
               <p>Q. When was that - A. I cannot speak to the day, it was some few days after the robbery. In consequence of his information on the morning of the 5th of May, I was ordered to take Rhodes into custody, and found two 5 l. and two 1 l. bank notes in his pocket, concealed in an old glove. He pulled it out, I asked him what it was? he said it was nothing. I seized his hand, and found the money in the glove, which I gave to Glanville. On the same morning I searched M'Court, and found a 1 l. bank note, and two half-crowns concealed in the turn-up leather of his dress cap. Next morning I went to him, when he was in custody, and told him if he would confess this, it would be the means of saving his life. He told me there was some property in Captain

               <p>Q. Before that, what passed between you and Eagan - A. On the 6th of May I told him it would be better to tell the truth; he said his wife had got 12 l. I got it from her, and gave all the property to Glanville. They have been seven years in the regiment.</p>

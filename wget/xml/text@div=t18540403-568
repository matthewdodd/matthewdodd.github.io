                  </hi>. On Monday evening, 20th March, I went to a fair at the Thames-tunnel—I got there at past 12 o'clock at night—I met Emma Lill, and she went with me, and a boy named David Jones—I saw the prisoner there—I did not do anything to him, I only danced behind him—I did not speak to him or touch him—he turned round and struck me in the forehead, and called me a cow—I put my hand up to my forehead and found that the blood was streaming down my face—he ran away as soon as he had done it; I ran after him, hallooing "Police!" till I became faint with lose of blood—I was taken to the station, and a doctor was sent for to dress my wound, and afterwards taken to the hospital—I could not see whether the prisoner had anything in his hand when he struck me.</p>

I was at the fair in the Thames-tunnel with Baker and Lill—when we had been there some time, I heard Baker call out "Police!"—I looked at her, and saw blood on her forehead—I then called "Police!" also—I saw the prisoner about ten yards from her, walking away with a knife in, his hand—he shut it up and put it in his right trowsers pocket—a policeman came up soon after, laid hold of him, and took the knife from his pocket.</p>

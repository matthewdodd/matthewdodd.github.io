I live at the British Lion in Hackney-road—on 23d October, I was assisting in the bar in the evening—the prisoner came in and asked for a glass of porter—it came to a penny—she gave me a counterfeit shilling—I called the landlord and gave it him—he told the prisoner it was bad—she was allowed to go, but he kept the shilling—he wrapped it in paper and put it under a glass—after the prisoner was taken, I took that shilling and marked it and gave it to the policeman—on 3d November, I was in the bar with Mr. Leary; he showed a half-crown and I saw the prisoner there—I recognised her—she was then charged with passing the half-crown and the shilling, and given in custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the British Lion, Hackney-road. On the evening of 23d October, the last witness showed me a bad shilling—I went to the prisoner and told her to walk off about her business and not to come any more—the shilling was put in a bit of paper and put in a glass—on 3d November I was in the bar—the prisoner came and asked for a glass of sixpenny ale; it came to 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she gave me a half-crown—I found it was bad—she said that a gentleman gave it her—I gave her in custody—she said that she lived in Haggerstone, but when she got to the station, she said in Brick-lane, Spitalfields.</p>

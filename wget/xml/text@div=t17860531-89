               <p>Was you hustled in that way that people are when they are pressed with a crowd, or did it appear to you as if these people pushed you into the crowd on purpose? - I think it was, I cannot speak to a certainty; when I got into the crowd, there were three or four turned me about several times.</p>
               <p>Can you say with certainty that the prisoner was one of them that turned you about? - Yes, I swear to that; I found the prisoner's hand, and the money dropping out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Had he turned you about more than once when you found his hand in your pocket? - I was turned about to the prisoner; the prisoner turned me one way, and the others the other; and then the prisoner picked my pocket; he was one that turned me about, but how many times I cannot say; when the money dropped from his hand, the other witness, Bowyer, came up, and said, you are robbed; and I said, yes, pointing to the prisoner; the prisoner was on the side of me when the money dropped from him; he was taken to Bow-street; I never saw him or Bowyer before; I lost a guinea and a half, and some silver; when the prisoner was in Bow-street, he asked me what I was robbed of, and he said he would return<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178605310105"></xptr> me the money if I could tell the exact sum; I did not see the half guinea drop; but at the time it dropped I was shoved by the prisoner, it was all done in half a minute; the prisoner wished me not to expose him; I cannot swear to the half guinea that I lost; I put my hand in my pocket about ten minutes before I was robbed.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I conduct a party of the patrol belonging to Bow-street; on Wednesday just as the King passed from the abbey to Bridge-street, I saw the prisoner; I was on this side Bridge-street, I saw a hustle of people at the corner opposite; I had been to Bridge-street, and had seen the prisoner there before; I saw him hustling the gentleman on one side, and three or four men on the other; I am positive the prisoner was one; I knew him before; the prisoner's hands were down towards the prosecutor's thighs; this was in the middle of the hustle; I crossed the way, and before they had left off hustling; when I came the prisoner knows me, and desisted hustling immediately; I asked the prosecutor if he had been robbed; the prisoner was then standing within a yard of him; the prosecutor then said, he had been robbed of a guinea and a half and some silver; the prisoner was inclining on the left side of the prosecutor, one of his hands was down on his right thigh, or near it, one hand was down to one side, and one to the other; he was partly facing of him, but inclining to the left side; the prosecutor coming out of New Palace-yard, and the prisoner pushing against him, as if he wanted to go into New Palace-yard; on the prosecutor charging him, I took the prisoner into custody, he wanted to settle it with the prosecutor very much in going up to the office; the prisoner frequently entreated me to go into some tavern, he offered the prosecutor his money, and me a guinea.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Had you heard the money drop before you asked the prosecutor whether he had been robbed? - I cannot be particular, I rather think I had.</p>
               <p>Had the prosecutor hold of the man at the time you came up? - I really cannot say; when I came up they were close together, he might have hold of him then, but when I asked him if he had been robbed, he had not hold of him then; I took him into custody.</p>
               <p>Who gave instructions for the bill of indictment? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Who did? - Mr. Johnson put it himself, he was told how the affair happened.</p>
               <p>Do not you know that the describing this makes all the difference of forty pounds? - No doubt but the law allows it.</p>
               <p>Do not you know if he was only convicted of common larceny, that the contrary would be the case? - A man must be a fool that does not know that.</p>

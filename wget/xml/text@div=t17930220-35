A few minutes afterwards I heard a rattle, I was just got into my watch-house in Berkley-street, not above one hundred yards from Mr. Platten's premises, though not in the view of the premises; then I observed Haycraft come past me, he was passing me before; I saw him, he was going from the premises of Mr. Platten; I knew him again well, it was a person with a short jacket on, he was very remarkable; Haycraft now is nearest to the jury; when I saw him pass the second time I did not know what was the matter, or else I should have stopped him then; a few minutes after

             was brought to the watch-house, and Turner confessed; I told him it would be better for him if he would impeach the others.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Where does Badger-yard lead to? - From St. John's Square, into Red Lion-street.</p>
               <p>Q. This a thoroughfare through which any body may pass, is there any thing remarkable in a man's coming through there, it is free for any man? - It is certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. You had never seen this man before in your life? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. This was between one and two o'clock in the morning; you dropped<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200060"></xptr>your voice when my friend asked you whether it was a dark night? - It was not so very dark.</p>
               <p>Q Had it not rained that night? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Recollect yourself a little, had it not been raining a great deal that night? - I do not remember.</p>
               <p>Q. You can remember a man's face whom you had never seen before in your life, but you cannot remember whether it rained or not; I ask you whether it had not rained a great deal that night? - I do not recollect, I was not out all night, I will not say any thing about it; that was not the point I expected to be asked to.</p>
               <p>Q. That was not the point you expected to be asked to; on your oath had it not rained a great deal that night? - It might or might not; I remember it did not rain in the morning when I went to fetch Haycraft out of his bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it rain when you pretended you saw this man? - I cannot remember.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it you took this man Haycraft? - I believe it was about five when he was brought to New Prison.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you the regular inspector of the watch? - I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you so now? - Now I am here.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think that answer does you any credit? - Well, I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Up to this time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never been discharged from that sort of employment? - No, I have been in it upwards of sixteen years.</p>
               <p>Q. I asked you a little while ago whether it rained that night or no, and you could not tell you said? - I reckon after twelve o'clock it is morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you thought I was talking about night only, between ten o'clock and twelve? - It did not rain whilst was walking about.</p>
               <p>Q. There was no moon you told my friend. Can you tell us what sort of a hat the man had on? - He had on a round hat.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he passed by you and brushed by you? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. You thought then he was one of the man's servants; you know you have been examined on this matter before; you told my friend he passed you a second time, on your oath did you say before the magistrate that he passed you a second time? - I don't know whether I did or not.</p>
               <p>Q. You know you must have a better recollection of it the next morning than you can have now, a month afterwards, yet at that time of night on that view you venture to swear positively to a man's person? - Yes, I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Yet you could not recollect the next morning to say he had passed you a second time. Did you search this man when he was taken? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you don't know whether he had any knife about him by which he could effect this purpose? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. So you have been sixteen years superintendant of the watch to the present time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It is not your business to be out all night? - It is not.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a great many rainy nights about the month of January and February? - There was.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you are sure the prisoner Haycraft past you? - I am.</p>
               <p>Q. You said in your first examination that you looked into the prisoner Haycraft's face, and there was a lamp opposite? - There was.</p>

In a few minutes after I heard the gate go moving backward and forward; I got out of my box and went close against the gate, then I saw

I went back again to the yard, and Mr. Platten put the glass in one of the coaches all night for safety; I can make no observation on the glass at all; I looked at him, and I said, they were very good glasses; that is all I know.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. When you took Turner he went very quietly with you? - He made no resistance at all.</p>
               <p>Q. The man that got away struck you? - This man strived to get away, and I paid him over the head with the rattle.</p>
               <p>Q. Haycraft was not the other, or you would have known him? - He was not.</p>
               <p>Q. If Haycraft had been at all coming out of that yard, you must have seen him? - I must.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search Turner? - I did at the watch-house, and found nothing at all on him.</p>
               <p>Court to Aslip. How far might Haycraft be from the gate of Mr. Platten's when you first saw him? - It was as he came out of the gate of Mr. Platten's yard in Badger-yard.</p>

In consequence of what happened I went to the watch-house on the 23d of January; I went afterwards to the Coach-yard, and I found the doors of the coaches open in the yard, and the tassels cut off; there were five glasses gone.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of glasses were these? - Plate glasses covered with wood and cloth. I went then to the watch-house again; I came back again and we looked in and found the glass in the yard close to the gates one or two of them, the wood was separated from the glass, and the glass was gone from the frame, the other was all packed together, only one separated from the frame, the others were whole; the tassels that draw them up were cut off, or else they could not draw them<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200062"></xptr>through the frame of the door; I know them to be mine.</p>
               <p>Q.

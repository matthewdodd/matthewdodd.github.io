               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner? - A. I have seen him come backwards and forwards to my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him at your house on the 10th of August? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The day before he was taken up? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What business did he come upon? - A. He came to the bar, and asked for a glass of gin, and offered a shilling; I drew him the gin, and he gave me a shilling; I gave him the change, and he went away.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the amount of the glass of gin? - A. Seven farthings.</p>
               <p>Q. After he was gone, did you turn your attention to the shilling? - A. I took the shilling from the bar, it being dark, to a window, and found it a bad one; I followed him towards Clare-market, but missed him; I returned, and put the shilling in a peace of paper, and have kept it separate from all others from that time to this; I crossed it at the same time.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him again? - A. Next day, in the afternoon, on the 11th; he came for a glass of gin, which he was furnished with.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he make payment for that? - A. He offered me another shilling; I looked at it, and saw it was a bad one; I took him by the collar, and said, my friend, I shall stop you as a smasher, or passer of bad money; he had asked to look at the shilling, and then had it in his possession; I took him into a little room behind the bar, and set him down in a chair, while I sent for a constable; I sat in a chair next to him, in order to take care he should not throw any thing away; all on a sudden he put his hand to his pocket, took out the shilling, and put his hand quickly to his mouth; I took him by the gullet, but he swallowed it, in spite of all I could do; I felt it pass between my fingers.</p>
               <p>Q. When he was searched, what was found upon him? - A. Only six or seven pennyworth of halfpence; no silver whatever.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he halfpence enough to pay for the gin, without offering the shilling? - A. Yes, and five-pence or sixpence to spare; he was then taken into custody, and sent to Bow-street. (Produced the counterfeit shilling.)</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see him the day before he was taken up? - A. I was up stairs at the time, but Mr. Soane called me down; I saw the prisoner next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him come in the next day? - A. No; Mr. Soane called me to mind the bar, while he set with the man till the constable came.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see what became of the shilling? - A. No.</p>

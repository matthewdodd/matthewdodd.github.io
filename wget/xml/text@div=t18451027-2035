                  </hi>. I am master of St. Giles's workhouse—the prisoner was employed there by the Board of the Directors of the Poor of St. Giles-in-the-Fields, and St. George, Bloomsbury, to fetch hair into the workhouse, to be picked—I found him in that situation when I went there in Sept., 1844—he was also intrusted with the collecting of the money when the hair had been picked—on the 18th of June, I gave the prisoner a note of the amount of the hair which I considered had been picked on Mr. Banford's account—this is the note I gave him—the quantity of hair stated on the note as picked was 261bs.—I made the entry in the book at the time I gave him the note, and he put his name to it in the book as being delivered by him—the reason I put 26lb. on the note was because 26lbs. was entered in the book by the prisoner when he brought it to me to sign—the note represents 54lbs.—that has been done since I saw it, in the prisoner's handwriting—on the 4th of July I gave him a similar note for 12lbs. of hair, coming to 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that was on his representation that that was the quantity, and he signed the check part in the book—that note is now altered to 60lbs., coming to 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the writing I believe is the prisoner's—on the 21st of July I gave him a note for 16lbs., the note is now altered to 341bs., and from 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., I believe in his writing—he has never accounted to me for either of these sums—it was his duty to account when he received the money—he was a pauper in the house—he had 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a month for this duty, and was boarded and clothed.</p>

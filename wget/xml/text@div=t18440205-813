The prisoner was my journeyman—I paid hin 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, with his board, lodging, and washing—I had three wash hand-stands in Oct, last—on the 27th of Oct., there was a knock at the door—I sent my sister-in-law down to answer it—she said it was a person named Henley who wanted Griffiths—the prisoner then went, and was gone three quarters of an hour—when he returned, I said, "Who was that?"—he said, "Mr. Henley who came to tell me where to soil the stands, ever the water"—oa the 28th the prisoner and I went to sell die stands over the water—when we got there he said, "This is the shop, it is a man that knowa me well, and has takes money of my father; if you like I will take them in and sell them"—he took them, and I said, "Don't sell them for less than three sovereigns, they are worth 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. "—he was there for two hours, and then came out—he said he had sold them for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; but I must wait till six o'clock tor the money—he got off, and went home to my residence, and told my brother to go to Mott and Griffin's (which I had told the prisoner to tell him)—I did not see the prisoner again till he was taken about five weeks ago—Mr. Reed showed me the receipt for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the washhand-stands—this is it—it is the pri<lb></lb>soner's writing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cabinet-maker, and have lived upwards of two years at No. 36, Brown's-lane, Spitalfields.

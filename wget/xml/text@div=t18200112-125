            . I am hostler at the inn. I was concealed in the loft to watch, as we had been robbed before. I saw Gimber shew the prisoner his flat, and said there was but one for him. Gimber returned to the office, the prisoner kept watching him; as soon as he had got into the office, he snatched one of the other flats of butter up, and threw it into his cart directly; he then took up his own in great haste, put that in, and drew his cart down to the office door. The flats were about four yards apart. I followed him into the street, collared him, and told him he must go no further, for he had something in his cart which did not belong to him. He asked me what I collared him for? and asked if he had made any mistake in taking butter, if so, he was sorry for it, and I might take it back. I said he should go no further, and I should not take it out till the officer came. Thompson came, and took him to the watch-house. The flat was directed to High-street, Borough.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He said if there was a mistake he was sorry for it - A. Yes. He had brought two empty flats back. It was early in the morning. His own flat stood alone, and was shewn to him.</p>

            . I am an officer. The prosecutor employed me to look out of a morning. I advised them to put each person's butter separate, and shew every man his own. I was out in the street, the hostler called me, and gave the prisoner in charge. It was break of day.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I took it by mistake. The boy said</p>

               <p>- PAYNE. I am the prisoner's master, and was at the office at his examination. Gimber swore that he hallooed to the prisoner before he got out of the yard, and asked him how many flats he had, and he said two.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Cross Keys public-house, in Broad-street, Lambeth. The house belongs to Louthwaite and Evans, the brewers, and I was put in to look after it, as their servant—they do not pay me wages—I was to have what I could make out of what I sold—they supplied the beer—I was liable to them for the price of it—I am single—I had a bed in the house, and generally slept there, except once a week, when I went home to my father's—I have a boy in the house to assist me—I pay him wages—nobody slept in the house but him and me—on Friday, the 10th of Jan<lb></lb>uary, I left the house, at eleven o'clock, leaving it in charge of the boy, James Sullivan—I left no one in the house but him—I saw the place all fast, and went all round it with a candle—I heard the boy put the bar down before I went away, after I got outside—I returned next morning, and missed a bundle of clothes, and two aprons and a red night-cap, which laid on the top of the bundle; also a bottle of brandy, a quart of rum, and a quart of gin—I had seen the bundle before I went away the night before—I had taken a handkerchief out of it to put round my neck—I made the bundle up after taking it out, and put it on the top shelf of the dresser at the back of the bar, in a little back room, with the two aprons and the red night-cap on the top of it—on the Tuesday morning following a baker named South brought me some of my clothes, which I gave to the policeman the same morning—the aprons and night-cap I found in the house when I went back on the Saturday morning—they had been dropped going out—I had seen the prisoners in the house on the Friday—they came in about dinner-time—they went out once in the afternoon, and then came in again—Muc<lb></lb>klestone told me, when I was putting on the silk handkerchief that night, before I started, that he would rob me that night, and lie in my bed—I only laughed at him, thinking it a joke—all the company went out of the house before I left.</p>

               <p>—there was nobody left in the house but me—I fastened the door after him, and barred it—about a quarter of an hour after he was gone some man came to the window, and asked me to let him in to have some beer—he swore, if I did not let them in, he would break the window—I let him in—he took the candle away from me, and went to the till where the half-pence were, laid hold of a handful of halfpence, took four pence, and pitched the rest back—he took hold of me, and <hi rend="italic">ruffled</hi> me about, while the two pri<lb></lb>soners got in—I had seen them in the house before several days, and am sure they are the boys—I had seen them there that afternoon and evening, and several times—I did not hear either of them say any thing to the prosecutor before he went away—I do not know the name of the man that came in—when the prisoners came in the man had half a quartern of gin, and wanted me to give <hi rend="italic">Teddy</hi> (Fleming) a glass of gin to keep him warm—I refused—he told me <hi rend="italic">Teddy</hi> had to be out all night—I then went to bed, but two po<lb></lb>licemen came first—the prisoners were gone then—I saw them go out before the policemen came—I fastened the house up again, and went to bed—it was about a quarter to twelve o'clock then—I did not see the two prisoners go out—I saw the man go out, but not the prisoners—I do not know whether or not they went out before I went to bed—I did not search round the house to see if all the company were gone—I was disturbed about four o'clock in the morning by a noise as if a cinder was trod upon in the tap-room—I slept in a little room behind the bar—I had not noticed Baster's clothes there before I went to bed—I got up, and went to look who it was, and the two prisoners ran out—there was a gas-light burning in the tap-room, and a little light in the bar—Baster always leaves the gas burning to get a light in the morning—I am quite sure it was the two prisoners—there was plenty of light from the gas to see them—I saw Mucklestone run out with his hands before him, as if holding something, and Fleming opened the street-door while he went out—I cannot say whether Mucklestone had any thing in his hands, but they were held out—I saw both their faces—after they ran out I saw a man standing against the river looking at the tide, and that man went and called a policeman, and one came and stopped till half-past six o'clock—the two prisoners then came to the door—I told the policeman they were the two prisoners, and he took them—the property had not been found then—I found the two aprons in the tap-room, and the nightcap in the passage leading from the tap-room to the street-door, about half-past seven o'clock, after they were taken—when I went into the tap-room at four o'clock I found a fire there, and the gas-light burning—there is only one gas-light in the tap-room, and the one in the bar was lighted—when I went to bed the fire and gas-lights were out—I went to the station-house about eight o'clock, I think, but did not see the prisoners there—I never had any conversation with Fleming about the goods—I am sure of that—I was examined before the Magistrate the same day—Fleming said to me, "If you don't say much, I will get you the things back, because I am sure to be transported"—that was on Saturday, when I was waiting to go before the Magistrate, as I was sitting in the box where the people wait till they are called—we were both sitting together—I was alongside of them—it was before I was examined—I had not seen the aprons and nightcap dropped by any body.</p>

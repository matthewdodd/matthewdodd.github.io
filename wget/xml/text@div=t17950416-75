               <p>Q. Did you at the same time come up to him? - I did not, I was not the same side of the way. I am a Bricklayer myself, and I know Mr. Norris very well, and I went to his foreman and acquainted him with it; I acquainted some man that did work for Mr. Norris.</p>

               <p>Q. Did Jenkins come to your house that evening? - He came to my house between six and seven o'clock, and asked me if I would buy wood. To the best of my opinion it was the fourth of March.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any wood with him at that time? - No, he said he would fetch it, Between eight and nine he came again, he brought three pieces of wood.</p>

               <p>Q. Were they the same kind of wood as the other three? - Something larger, but the same sort. He asked me if I would buy any baskets, and I understood it was chips that he had in these baskets.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he bring any baskets? - Yes, two baskets, and three pieces of wood more.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these of the same kind of the six? - Yes, the same kind and sort.</p>
               <p>Q. After he had left these with you, how long did he stay with you? - Not long; I asked him what I should do with the baskets, they were of no manner of use to me, he said they would do for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179504160201"></xptr>firing, I told him they were of no manner of use to me, and they would answer for his own use.</p>
               <p>Q. Who came with him? - Two young men, they came in, and he went out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did these two men stay? - No, he went out to them, and he went away when he had spoke to them.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you see Mr. Parker after they were gone? - About five or six minutes after Jenkins were gone, then Parker came.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you after that see any body from Mr. Norris's premises? - Yes; then when they came in they see Mr. Norris's name on it, they had a light, and went and see them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Mr. Norris's name on these pieces of wood? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then Mr. Parker desired you to keep them? - He desired me to put them into my cellar again.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Evans? - I do now, I did not then.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he see these pieces of wood? - The next day he did.</p>

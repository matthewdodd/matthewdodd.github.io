                  </hi>. I lire in Judd-street. The prisoner Herbert was in my service—I had missed something—my daughter spoke to her, and she produced from her pocket a duplicate of this shawl—she said the shawl belonged to herself—my daughter said she had lost several things, and she suspected it was hers—I went the next morning to the pawn-broker's, and saw it, and it was my daughter's—this is it—my daughter's, name is Frances—she is twenty-two years old—I told my daughter to get up early the next morning, which she did—a ring came at the door, and my daughter opened it—I was up, and the prisoner Clarke came in—she was rather surprised to see us up so early—I asked what business she had' to come so early—she said she was bringing some things for her niece (Herbert)—I said I had been robbed of a gold watch, and some other things, and that a duplicate of a shawl had been found—I showed her the duplicate—she said it belonged to her, and she had a right to do as she pleased with her own property—I allowed her to go away—when I had seen the shawl at the pawnbroker's I sent for her again, told her I had seen the shawl, and it belonged to my daughter—she then turned to Herbert, and said, "How could you give me your master's things to pawn?"—they were then taken into custody.</p>

I am house surgeon at Guy's Hospital—I was not there at the time the prosecutrix was brought in; I examined her early next morning—she had been examined that night; there was a small wound in the front passage, the posterior par—I should call it lacerated, but I could. not make out very correctly what it was in that position; she was not bleeding from it when I saw her—there had been a good deal of blood from it—it was about half an inch deep; there was no contusion externally; I thought it was certainly not caused by a kick—it was my impression that it had been caused by some instrument, giving that term a broad meaning—perhaps a broken piece of stick—it might have been either sharp or blunt, but it was my impression, it must have been something penetrating—such a wound could not be caused by a fall unless there were something project<lb></lb>ing, well penetrating the passage; I did not see the room—it is not probable that it was caused by a boot—she stoppod at the hospital till the following Saturday.</p>

            . I am a patrol. I met the prisoners about half-past twelve o'clock on Friday night, between Kilburn and Paddington; they had two donkies and a pony - I asked where they were going, they said that was no business of mine; they would not say where they brought the pony from - I took

            . I was with Mims. I took George - I drove the two donkies behind them; we came on about quarter of a mile, when George left William, and came to me; he said he wanted to tie the donkies together - he was with them about five minutes, and then went on; I saw that they were not tied together. I kept close, and presently a quart pot dropped out of a roll of cloth which was round the donkey; it was in a kind of pad. I had noticed a roll on the donkey's back before he went to it. I picked the pot up, and asked if he had any more; he said he knew nothing of that.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. They were impudent - A. Yes. I saw the pot drop out of the roll. They did not say that I had put it there.</p>

            . I am an officer, and was out with Mims and Francis. Mims took Francis and followed behind us - Francis and I led George and the donkies. I saw the put about quarter of a mile from the turnpike; it fell from the donkey, from a roll on its back - I had not noticed its being bulky before. George had been pretending to fasten them together, and was fumbling about them a good while - the pot fell as soon as he left. Mims and William were behind us. I heard something fall, but cannot say it was the pot, but I saw nothing else.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. If the donkies had kicked against it, it would make a noise - A. Not the same sort of noise. I was about half a yard behind the donkey. Mims was behind us, not before.</p>

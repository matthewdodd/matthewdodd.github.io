            . I am a Police-man. I was on duty about a quarter before four o'clock in the morning of the 11th of May, and saw three men crossing the bottom of Rosemary-lane, about four hundred yards from the prosecutor's - two of the men were before the prisoner; the prisoner had got a bundle, and I thought it my duty to see what he had, as I knew the two men to be suspicious characters; I went and asked him what he had got - he said some pieces of cloth which he had purchased the day before: he was going into a house in Mill-yard, Rosemary-lane - I told the man who was letting him in not to let him in, as I thought he had stolen property, and then the man put him out of doors, and I took him in charge - the two men had run away; the prisoner said."It is all right," and said, "I will tell you the truth - the two men who ran away gave me 1s. to carry the bundle to this house;" I said I had no doubt of its being stolen, and as I took him to the watch-house we passed Cohen's house, and the Police-men were there - he was ten or twelve yards from the other men; they looked very suspicious characters.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was the prisoner drunk or sober? A. I think he had had a little liquor - he did not seem very drunk: the two men ran away directly I went up - he pointed them out at the time they were running away - I have made inquiry about the prisoner, and understand he is the son of a respectable man, and I have not ascertained any thing at all against him.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written.) My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, - I beg you will receive this as my Defence, and not consider it written by a prisoner as a fabricated story; but for the want of confidence, being overpowered with grief, thinking that I shall be the only cause of making my parents and family wretched, by being inthraled into my present situation by persons whom I had not the least knowledge of. The night the prosecutor's house was broken open (as he stated before the Magistrates) I was at my father's house until eleven o'clock, and had my supper, when I left it and went to my lodgings being obliged to sleep from home, in consequence of the large family), which was about twenty yards from my father's house - when I got there I found the door was locked; I knocked some time, but not being heard by the landlady, I very imprudently walked away, and wandered into a public-house, which I have learned since is the harbour of an organized gang of thieves, whom at that moment I did not know - I sat down, and drank a pint of beer, and in a short time got into conversation with two young men who were quite strangers to me; after setting in the house until two o'clock in the morning, the young men asked me if I would go out for a spree: they were going towards Ratcliff-highway, amongst the girls - I, knowing there were houses of that description in Ratcliff-highway, accompanied them until we came to the corner of Ship-alley, in Ratcliff-highway, when they requested me to stop at the corner two or three minutes - I had not been there more than five minutes, when one of them came running to me, and told me they had had a lark with a girl, and she was after them - he gave me the bundle, and told me to put it into my handkerchief; having no pocket handkerchief, I took my handkerchief from my neck, and wrapped them in - I was running towards the public-house where we had left when I was stopped by a Police-man. It is not reasonable to be supposed that if I was a housebreaker that I should make choice of a house like the prosecutor's to break into, whom I know well, and to have known my family since my infancy - we were educated at one school; the property which was stolen was not worth half a crown, and the whole of the property in the prosecutor's window would not fetch 20s., only consisting of small pieces of cloth, which is of no use to any person excepting to tailors who mend old clothes. I have by my Industry and frugality maintained myself for the last four years, and have assisted my father in supporting a large family of eleven children.</p>

            . I live at No 27, Rosemary-lane. The prisoner lodged with me for three years, and Nathan about a year. I went to bed on the night Cohen was robbed, at eleven o'clock; the prisoner usually came home by eleven o'clock; his father lived about twenty-five doors from me, but the family was too large to accommodate him - I heard him knock at the door that night, but I make it a rule never to get out of bed to let a lodger in- he bore an honest and industrious character; I never knew him out so late.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did any body except Nathan lodge at your house? A. No - he knocked at the door between eleven and twelve o'clock; I am afflicted with rhenmatism, and never get up - I do not know who lives at Mill-yard, and do not know any body he visited there; it is near a quarter of a mile from my house - I have lived eight years in my house.</p>

I said I could not, or I would with pleasure, and told him to go to the first public-house and get a lodging; his father lives at No. 9, Rosemary-lane, and has nine or ten children - he has no means of accommodating him; I never knew a blemish in the prisoner's character.</p>

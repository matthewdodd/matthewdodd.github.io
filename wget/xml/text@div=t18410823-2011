                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joseph Smith, who lives at Bedford. I came to London on the 26th of July, about three o'clock in the morning, by the wagon, and coming along the road, I met a man, I cannot tell who—my niece had a basket containing some pork and bread—the man carried it, and ran away with it—the basket had two handles on it when he had it—it has only one now—I think this now produced is the basket, but I am not sure—it had two handles on it when I lost it—it has only one now.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Walbrook-row, Hoxton, and am a cooper. On the 26th of January, about nine o'clock, I went out to look for a cask belonging to me, and it was gone—I saw a truck at a distance—I went up to it, and found my cask on it—the two prisoners were drawing it—there was another cask on it beside mine—I claimed my cask—the prisoners said they had been employed by a person to carry it—it had been on my premises that evening—the prisoners gave it up; but I kept walking with them till I saw a policeman, and gave them in charge.</p>

I was at my shop door, opposite the prosecutor's—I heard a noise, came out, and saw two men lift a cask off Mr. Green<lb></lb>how's premises over the palings—they rolled it along the road—I went to the prosecutor, and I went with him after the truck—the prisoners were drawing it—I said, "Stop a minute, where did you get this cask?" They both said, a person hired them to carry it, and offered them sixpence, and they, being hard working men, were glad to earn sixpence—I took the cask back, and they went on with the prosecutor.</p>

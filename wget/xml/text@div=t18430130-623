                  </hi>. I am proprietor of an omnibus, and carry on business in Ordnance-mews, Portland-town. The prisoner Merritt is related to me—his wife is my wife's sister-in-law—he was in my service as horsekeeper with me</p>

               <p>and Harris, who were in partnership—that partnership was dissolved about June last—I afterwards made an arrangement with Merritt, that he was to be made conductor, (taking him from the horsekeeper's place,) so that his wages on an average the year through would be about 23<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—before that it was 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I was proprietor at that time of three horses and harness—in July I made an arrangement with him that the profits of the omnibus I ran with Harris would be 24<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—I agreed he should receive 23<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—that his part of the profits should amount to 23<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, the year through for his services as conductor—I did not give him the slightest share or participation in the horses—I hired an omnibus to run from Ordnance Mews to the Bank—I was to pay the expense of keep<lb></lb>ing the horses, and the omnibus was to pay the expenses—a horsekeeper was hired, and five horses were devoted to the omnibus—the prisoner was to go with it as conductor—he lent me 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., in one instance, and 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in another—I paid him back again in Aug.—I did not borrow any money of him on the horses, nor authorize him to take the horses away-Cox was my horsekeeper—I carried on the omnibus from July to Jan.—I paid Merritt from the earnings of the omnibus down to 10th of Jan., and on the 10th of Jan. I learnt something had happened to the horses—on Saturday the 14th, in consequence of information, I went to the house of Pur<lb></lb>ser, at Lampton, about a mile from Ealing, and found him at home—I asked if he had any horses for sale—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Will you allow me to look at them?"—he said, "Certainly, walk in"—I went in—he showed me three horses—I immediately said, "They are my property—they were stolen from me on the 10th—I have a receipt to prove they are mine"—I described the party who stole them from me, and said I must demand them of him—he said he could not give them up—he had bought them, and then that he had partly paid for them—I said, "What have you paid?"—he said he could not exactly say—I said, "Whatever it is I will pay you, and take them away"—he said I could not do that—I said, "Then I must give you in charge"—I went and met Sergeant Jeeks, told him of it, and he went with me to Purser's, and then he said he had got the horses from Merritt, and partly paid for them—he would not satisfy us what he paid for them—I gave him in charge—I told him there was also a set of horse-harness stolen from me with "B" on it—he declared he had never seen them, and denied all knowledge whatever of it—the fourth horse which, I had not found then, was a grey mare—I told him four horses were stolen, and asked if he knew anything of the fourth—he said he did not at first—I took him to the station, and then he said he recollected Merritt and he had sold a grey mare to Hitchcock, at Greenford—I was about to have him locked up—he then said he was going, out with his wife to dinner, and had his horse ready harnessed to go, and if I would only grant him that he might not be locked up, the horses should remain on his premises, and not be removed, and he would not advance any money on them, nor part from them on any account, that Merritt was to call for the money on Tuesday, and if he did not call he would give up the three horses to me on paying 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. which I said I would do—I asked if he would give Merritt into custody if he came—he said yes, if I wished it—I gave him orders to do ss—I went to his house on Tuesday with Ser<lb></lb>geant Thompson, and Merritt and his wife were there—I said to Purser, "I have come for the horses"—he said, "Oh, I have bought them since, and paid for them—I have the receipt in my pocket"—I immediately gave Merritt into custody—the three horses were taken to the station—I did not give Purser in charge till the Friday—the whole of the harness was found on the Wednesday in Purser's back room—they have my initials on them—Merritt</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I went with Brooks to Purser's house on Tuesday, the 17th, and found both the prisoners and Jeeks in the parlour—Brooks gave him in charge—Merritt was then taken—in com<lb></lb>ing out of the house I asked Purser where the horses were—he said, "In the yard"—I said, "I must have them"—Purser sent a boy to fetch them—the boy took them to the Hounslow station—it was one horse and two mares—Purser said he had bought the horses, but had not paid for them—I went again on Wednesday, and asked if he had got the harness—he said it should be forthcoming—I said I must have it then—he put his arm across the door—I said, "It is no use being foolish about it, I have no doubt you have got it"—Jecks said, "I will go and get a search warrant"—Purser said, "I will show you where it is"—he took me up a few steps to a room, and showed it to me on some pegs—I afterwards got the grey mare from Hitchcock.</p>

                  </hi>. In July last I was living in the same house as the prisoner Merritt—he is married to my step-daughter—Brooks is my son-in-law—he married my own daughter—I heard the arrangement they made at starting this omnibus; that they were to lay out equal sums of money to purchase horses, and different things connected with it—they were to hire an omnibus, and the expenses were to be paid out of the earnings—Merritt had purchased a mare of Brooks previous to the partnership, and it was agreed that this mare would be taken in at the same amount as he purchased it for—that mare was <hi rend="italic">swapped</hi> away—they never worked her, as she was a kicker—Harris and Brooks were in partnership before that, and they purchased her—they broke partnership—Brooks sold the mare to Merritt, and she was to be received back at the same amount as he sold her at—they changed her away—the horses they purchased were brought to the stable—I saw the horses, and heard them both talking together about what they paid for them—I heard Merritt say to Brooks the week before they broke partnership, that there was water running from the horse's eye—on the evening of the 9th of Jan. Merritt came to my room—Brooks was there—they both talked about dissolving partner<lb></lb>ship—Brooks offered to give Merritt 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and exonerate him from all the debts, which he said was 31<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that he would also take him as stableman, and give him 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—they were not quarrelling then—Merritt would not agree to the proposal—they laid out the property in two lots; one lot to consist of a horse, mare, and harness; the other, a horse and mare—they considered each lot worth 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they then talked about which lot each should have—I said, "It would be the fairest way for me to make tickets, and you draw for them, "but it broke off that evening—on the 10th they went to work again—Brooks went the first journey, Merritt the second, and Brooks the third, and when Merritt was to have gone again, he had gone away, and the horses too—I never heard Brooks call Merritt a servant during this transaction—they both considered themselves proprietors of the <hi rend="italic">buss.</hi>

I looked at it, and suspected it not honestly come by. She was to come about seven o'clock with more: when she came, I asked her how she came by it; she said her husband sent her with it. I sent for an officer. Then I asked her if I should send for her husband; she said no, but if I went to Jewin-street, and asked for one

He said it was his property. We delivered him to the charge of the officer of the night. The next day we went before the siting alderman; there he said he was going to market, to buy provision for his family, and a man stopped him to buy it or lend him money upon it, but he did not know the man: he said he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176910180017"></xptr> lent three shillings upon it.

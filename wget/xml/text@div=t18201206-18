            . I am ten years old. My mother went out the Monday before last, leaving me and my sister who is seven years old at home; about half-past three o'clock the prisoner came - I knew him before - his wife lived fellow servant with my mother. He asked if my mother was at home? I said No, and sent my sister for her. He went away and said he would call again in an hour. He came again, and I told him my mother was not yet come home; he asked if anyone was up stairs? I said No, he then went up, and came down again asking me what o'clock it was? I said "I'll go and see." I went to where my mother keeps the watch in the cupboard; he said "Stay, my little dear, perhaps you can't tell." I said I could; he took it from me pretending to put it in the cupboard, and ran away with it. I pursued, but could not catch him. He had said he wanted my father's great coat, I told him him he had it on.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODERICK. Q. How was he dressed - A. In a blue coat and waistcoat, corderoy breeches and boots, he had short whiskers - I did not say he had full whiskers. I had seen him two or three times before.</p>

            . I am the wife of the prosecutor. I went out about half-past three o'clock, and left the watch beside a bason in the cupboard - my husband had left it on a nail in the morning. I had seen the prisoner twice before - on one occasion my daughter was there - she saw him only once, and that was six months ago. I went and charged him with it; he denied it. I took my daughter to him next day, about eleven o'clock; he still denied it, his shoes appeared as if he had been out. I was with him from eleven till two o'clock on the 21st of November.</p>

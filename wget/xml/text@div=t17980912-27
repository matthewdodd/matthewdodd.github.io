Yes, in Mr. Batho's yard; I went there in consequence of some information on the 24th, and there I saw 600 weight of stones, of the value of from 40s. to 50s. they correspond exactly in size and quality with those I landed myself, as near as possible.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know a person of the name of Gate-house? - A. I do; I was desired by my father to meet him in Nightingale-lane, in consequence of a bargain having been made between them; I went to Gatehouse to know in what manner he came by the stones which he shewed to me in a place called Black-horse-yard; I asked him how he came by them, and from his vague manner of answering me, I had a suspicion; he took me to the Dundee arms, in Nightingale-lane, and there introduced me to the landlady of the house, and she informed me she had lent Gatehouse thirteen shillings to pay for these stones; in consequence of that I thought it was considerably under price, and I mentioned my suspicions to my father; we consulted, and thought it best to remove the stones to our town premises for security; they were what we call six and seven inch Aberdeen granites; I removed them to our yard, and on the Wednesday morning I applied to Mr. Goudge, mentioning that I thought these stones were his property; my father had agreed with Gatehouse for 1l. 11s. 6d. they are worth more than that; I appointed Gate-house to come for the money, and I appointed Mr. Goudge to come at the same time; they met, and in consequence of his strange way of telling how he came by them, we all three went to Nightingale-lane to make enquiries of a Mr. Huffin, that he said, he had bought them of, but Mr. Huffin said, he had given him no orders to purchase stones; then he said they came out of a Scotch vessel at New-crane, Wapping, and we knew very well that no Scotch vessels ever came there; then he said he had them from two men that drove a brick cart, but did not know who they were; then suspicions fell upon the two prisoners, who had worked for Mr. Yandall; I went with Mr. Goudge, and they were taken up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Gatehouse gave different accounts of these stones? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Which excited your suspicion of him? - A. Yes.</p>

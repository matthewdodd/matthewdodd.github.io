                  </hi>. I carry on business as a provision merchant. In March, 1850, I also embarked in the business of leather dressing, which I carried on in Short-street, Bermondsey—the prisoner came into my employ on 22nd or 24th March, 1850—he conducted the business of leather dressing for me—his wages were 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—he had no share in the business; he received no profits from it in any shape or way—I paid him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—it was part of his duty to receive moneys for me—it was his duty to bring the money he received to me—I have a cash-book in which I inserted the money he handed to me—I have the book here—I did not receive from the prisoner on 28th Nov., or on 29th, or after that, the sum of 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., paid from Mr. Gray—when he handed me money, and it was entered in the book, the name of the person paying it was always put in the book—here is no</p>

               <p>entry of 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. being paid from Mr. Gray—I think the last time, in Nov., that the prisoner accounted to me for any money was on 24th Nov. but he paid me some money on 27th Nov.—he did not pay me any money after 27th—he left my employ on 29th Nov., but he came back on 11th Jan. as I suppose—he did not assign any reason for leaving me before he left—I had no idea he was going to leave—when he came back he re-entered on his usual duties—he took the list from me of debts to collect, and went out to collect them—he went away on Saturday, and I did not see him till Tuesday the 13th—he did not pay me any money after he re-entered my service—not one farthing—I beg pardon, yes, he did—I have not the cash-book here, but I think about 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from two persons—neither of them was Mr. Heine's—I have not received any since 23rd Jan.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> With regard to that 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., at what time did you give the prisoner into custody? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think on 20th Jan.—it was on a Tuesday morning—the 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was paid on the 12th—the receipt was not dated when it was in Court before the Magistrate—it was merely the word "settled" on it—I entered into the leather-dressing in March, 1850—I had never been in that business before—I had not been looking out for a partner about March—I was never looking out for a partner in any business whatever—I saw an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> for a partner, which induced me to look after this business, and in consequence of that I saw the prisoner—an agreement was entered into in writing with reference to the terms on which we were to be together—the prisoner came into my employ—I had never put "Garstin and Co." on my cards or bills before—as soon as the prisoner came I put "Garstin and Co." on my bills, not in the provision business, but only the leather business—those others had been printed before—there was no other person in my business of leather-dressing—when money was paid to me I made an entry in a book—no other person was to receive money but myself and the prisoner—I have not the book here in which I entered the sums of money I received—I thought this was it—it is one just like this—this is the ledger—it will be but two minutes' walk to get it.</p>

               <p>was all that was paid by him—here is a sum paid by Mr. Wood, but that was in the provision line—I know the money has not been paid, by Mr. Gray's name not being entered; but I have further proof; here is a letter, which is in the prisoner's writing—(this letter was dated 17th Jan., and in it the pri<lb></lb>soner stated that he had received of Mr. Gray 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.)</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Give me the account in which Gray's payment ought to have been entered? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> This is the petty-sale book; he hands me the money, and I enter the account—in course of business, Gray's money would not have come in this petty-sale book; there is no possibility of that—the large items come here—here is 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. entered; that is cash to myself—I happened to want some money, and I went to him, and got that—he did not come to roe daily and render his account—we have several men working; and at the end of the week, if he had not sufficient cash, he came to me, and I gave him money,</p>

               <p>and on Monday we settled; but on that Saturday it was his duty to come to me, because we had no men at work—on that Saturday he staid away, and on Tuesday I went and saw him in bed—he did not abscond—he was not absented from my service—I did not allow him anything for commission, only 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—he had the care of the workmen, and travelled—there was no sign of his having absconded—I have a letter from him, in which he says he was going out of town, to see if that would do for him what medicine would not do.</p>

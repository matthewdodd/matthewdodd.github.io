                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Through an Interpreter</hi>). I am a stonemason, and live at the South-Western Chambers, Wandsworth Road—on Saturday night, 5th January, about a quarter to 12, the prisoner came up to me near Temple Bar, and asked me to treat her—we went to a public-house, and I paid for some drink—she was then on my right side, and I took my purse out of my left trousers pocket, took some money out, and put the purse back in my left pocket—we remained there about a minute after that, she still being on my right side—we both left together, and when we had got about fifty yards beyond Temple Bar I missed my purse, which had in it, when I put it back into my pocket, two sovereigns, two half-sovereigns, a German twenty-mark piece, and some German and English small change—when I missed my purse I turned out my pockets—the prisoner wanted to get away from me, but I caught hold of her, and called out "Go with me," and she said "Go with me"—a woman came up and said something to her, and wanted to take her away, but I said "You must stop with me till the police come"—the prisoner had talked to another woman when we were in the public-house—that was not the woman who came up afterwards—no one was near my left-hand pocket after I put the purse back but the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I did not treat the other woman—I left the public-house first, and the prisoner followed me—when we got through the Bar I put my hand in my pocket and missed my purse, and then I asked her to go with me—she said "No, I will not go with you, you had better come with me"—I cannot speak English, but I made her understand—I made signs that she should go with me, and she made signs that I should go with her—that was after I had missed my purse—when I called "Police" she wanted to get away.</p>

On Sunday morning, 6th January, at 12.10, I was at the top of Essex Street, Strand, and saw Sainfert holding the prisoner—I went up and he made signs that she had taken his purse and money—I took her to Bow Street station, and he charged her, through an interpreter, with stealing two sovereigns, two half-sovereigns, a twenty-mark piece, and some small change—she said "Was it all in English money?"—that is all she said—1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. were found on her.</p>

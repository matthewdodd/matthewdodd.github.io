                  </hi>. I lodge at No. 2, Reed's-place, Newington-causeway. Mrs. Rose Murray was the owner of that house—she was a widow—she occupied the back room on the ground floor—the prisoner occupied the front room on the ground floor in June last—there were other lodgers in different rooms in the house, and amongst them was a brother of the prisoner, who lived in a room up stairs—I do not know how long the prisoner had been lodging in the house; I believe four or five years—I have only been there three or four months—he was there when I came—on the morning of 7th June I was awoke by Mrs. Larter, a lodger in the house, about half past 5 o'clock—I got out of bed—Mrs. Larter called me, and returned to her bed—I went to the stairs, and saw the deceased, Mrs. Murray, two steps up the stairs from the ground floor—she was trying to get up the stairs, with her legs and hands on the stairs, trying to walk up as well as she could—she was in her night dress—the prisoner was close behind her, on the floor—I saw him draw a knife across her left thigh, and she fell back, down the three steps—the prisoner had all his clothes on, and his hat—he then walked towards the front door—I ran down, and caught hold of Mrs. Murray's left hand—I looked along the passage, and the prisoner had a clasp knife in his hand; he drew it through his hand, shut it, and put it into his pocket—there was a sound proceeding from the deceased, like a gurgling in her throat, when I had got hold of her left hand—she was not able to speak—the prisoner came back while I had hold of her left hand—he put the knife</p>

               <p>into his pocket, and said to me, "Mr. Puxty, the <hi rend="italic">big bear</hi> has done it"—the prisoner's brother came down the stairs—I went at once for a surgeon; I could not find one—I went to the station, and a police sergeant came back with me to the house—when I came back the prisoner was standing at the door—the policeman said, "Who has done it?" and the prisoner made answer, "I have done it"—he was then taken into custody—the deceased was lying in the same place, at the foot of the stairs, where I had left her—there was a great deal of blood about the place—she was taken to bed—she had not quite done breathing, but she was dead before she was on the bed—I went into the bedroom—there was blood on the bed and on the floor—she was conveyed into the other room, not into the same bed that she slept in—the surgeon soon after came, and examined the body.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have known this man for some time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About four or five months; I have at the latter part of the time observed a considerable alteration in his conduct—he has presented a wild appearance, and his conduct was altogether strange—I did not examine him for the purpose of observing the state of his mind, but I observed a great alteration of his conduct and manner—I have heard that he has been a mariner, and has been to India and other places—Mrs. Murray was an old friend to him, like a mother—she provided everything he had—his conduct, generally speaking, was grateful to her for the kindness she showed to him—I saw him on the night before this happened, at half past 11 o'clock; he was not gone to bed; I do not think he had gone to bed at all—I went into the room where he slept when Mrs. Murray was taken in the morning—his bed did not appear to have been used, and he was dressed at that early hour, and had his hat on, as if he were going out, just the same as I saw him the evening before—Mrs. Larter is one of the persons who lodged in the house—she was the person who called me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you remember the prisoner saying, after this kind friend of his was killed, "Oh, she is not dead, she can change into any shape she likes?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I heard him say so—he did not seem in the least concerned about it, and he stood at the foot of the stairs when I first saw him, and the woman was then desperately wounded, and crawling up stairs—he then went towards the front door, and came back to me, to where the woman was, and said, "Oh, Mr. Puxty, the <hi rend="italic">great bear</hi> has done this!"—he afterwards said, "Oh, I did it," when we came from the station—there were two knives found on him—he has an aunt; I do not know her name—I did not observe that at times he was free from this wild appearance—he was always so during the latter part of the time I have known him—his brother is here—when I went for the policeman the prisoner was left at the front door—his brother was with him.</p>

                  </hi>. I lodge in the house No. 2, Reed's-place. I was alarmed on the morning of 7th June—I heard Mrs. Murray's voice calling out, "Mrs. Larter"—I ran down the staircase, and found her on the stairs—I alarmed Mr. Puxty—I could not awake him at first—I know more of the prisoner than all of you—I have known him turned eighteen months—I had known the deceased longer—I lived with her very nearly two years.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Mrs. Murray was the best friend the prisoner had in the world? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; and she was very fond of him—I have observed in the latter part of the time that his conduct and manner have changed very much, and I told both his brother and Mrs. Murray that he ought</p>

               <p>to be put under restraint; and I begged of Mrs. Murray to do so—she was like a mother to him—when she was told he ought to be put under restraint she did not like to do it—I have said it repeatedly within the last five or six or eight months before Christmas—it was my impression from the observation I made on his conduct, that he was not in his sound senses—I expected some mischief either on himself or some one else—I heard him talk about the <hi rend="italic">Great bear</hi>—he said, "I'll not be amongst the Russians; I'll not be a Great bear; you'll be a <hi rend="italic">Great bear</hi>, and Mrs. Murray will be a Great bear" and at this time I noticed his appearance was wild—he would pass my door and not speak, and he would raise his two hands as though he was dreading something coming after him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Walworth-road. I attended the prisoner in April last at Ms aunt's, in Paragon-street, Walworth—he was perfectly incoherent—I took from him a knife, and I wished him to get to bed as he was so violent—he would not go to bed; he kept wandering from room to room—I took his things off, and got him at last to bed—I found in his pocket some bank notes and other things, and the knife which I believe was the very knife he committed this with—I was sent for three different times that evening.</p>

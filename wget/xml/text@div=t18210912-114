            , she is five years old. On the 21st of August, about nine o'clock at night, she was sitting on the step of the door, I heard a person come by and say, "Ah, my little dear," and the child said, "Ah;" she said, "Will you go along with me and buy some nice cakes?" the child said, Yes, but she would go and ask her mother first. She came in and asked me if she might go with the lady; I said, what lady; she said, a lady who I did not know, but it was a lady in a white shawl who would buy her some nice cakes;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182109120071"></xptr>I said No, she should not go, if she did I would whip her; the child ran out, and I heard her say, she must not go; but what more was said I do not know; the child ran in to me and cried, and said, "Do let me go, she will buy me such nice cakes;" I forbid her going again. A person came in who took off my attention. The child ran out again, and I heard her say, "I must not go." I heard no more till I heard the child and somebody going out of the Rents, I sent a girl after her, before she could have got out of the Rents, as I missed her. A little girl came in and gave me information; I ran out and met a gentleman at the end of the Rents with the child, and found the prisoner at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. What time passed between your missing the child and meeting the gentleman with it - A. Not more than twenty minutes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. You heard a person wishing the child to go with her and she would give her some cakes - A. Yes; I will not swear the person heard me refuse her. I had a glimpse of her - I think she must have heard it. The Rents are a great thoroughfare. A little girl, about eight years old, sat at the door with my child. The prisoner said nothing in my presence about her wanting to send the child to some chambers. The child was dressed in the clothes stated in the indictment.</p>
               <p>PHILIP ERSWELL. I am a glass dealer, and live in Chancery-lane. On the 21st of August, a little before nine o'clock in the evening, I was nearly opposite Symond's Inn, in Chancery-lane, I saw the prisoner there going down with a child on each side of her, walking, she had not got hold of their hands then; I heard her say she would buy them some cakes - she was walking as from Mrs. King's, she asked King's child how her sister Sally did, she said she had no sister Sally; she then hurried up Carey-street, and Bell-yard - I kept following her. I saw Kearney, the beadle, told him my suspicions - he went and took her in my presence; I went and found the mother.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you hear her state she intended to send the child to Symond's Inn - A. No.</p>

            . I am beadle of the Rolls liberty. About half-past eight o'clock, Erswell gave me information. I saw the prisoner about the middle of Bell-yard, walking very fast with two children, I ran down and overtook her about the middle of Bell-yard, near Fleet-street, and asked where she was going with them; she said to Surry-street; I asked if the children were her's, or did she live there; she said something in a very great fright, I could not understand what it was; I laid hold of her, she had a doll in her arm which she gave the child, and flew from me in a moment when I said I would take her to the watch-house; two witnesses came and assisted in securing her. I took her to the watch-house - she said there that she did not intend to do the children any harm. She wanted to send them on an errand; I asked where - she said, to a gentleman in Symond's Inn; I asked why she did not go into Symond's Inn, for she had passed it, and asked why, she said she was going to Surry-street, she said to buy cakes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then she said she passed Symond's Inn, for the purpose of buying cakes - A. She said she was going to buy cakes in Surry-street.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. They were playing about, I asked them to go to Symond-inn and did not do them any harm, the biggest child, took me down the place to buy cakes, instead of me taking them. I did not think it any harm to send them where I had sent different children before. I told the man I had been in company with people in Surry-street, and he said I said I was going to take the children there. At the first hearing, the child was brought full dressed, and at the second hearing, it was brought meanly dressed, as I first saw it.</p>

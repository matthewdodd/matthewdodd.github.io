            Hammerton four times over, I am in possession of the iron that marked them; there are marks upon the sacks which our man will prove; he said he had bought the sacks at a broker's, about fifteen or eighteen months before; afterwards he denied it, and said he had bought them at a sale but could not tell what sale.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how long this cart had been made? - A. Not above ten months, there is the maker's name upon the cart; he afterwards said he had bought it of a man who had bought it at a sale.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with Palmer afterwards? - A. Yes, at the public-house adjoining the office in Worship-street; he said, he wished to speak to me, he wished to turn evidence, and he would disclose such a scene that I should be astonished at; I told him I thought I knew enough already; he said, I did not know one twentieth part respecting the mills, and other concerns too.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. What did Palmer do respecting Innes? - A. He said he did not sleep there; and then afterwards, when I insisted upon searching the house, he told me where he was.</p>
               <p>Q. You went afterwards to Mr. With's who keeps a corn-chandler's shop? - A. Yes; and a baker's shop somewhere else.</p>
               <p>Q. When you told him the business upon which you came, he was very willing you should search? - A. He said we might see the premises.</p>
               <p>Q. And he went with you and the officer? - A. Yes; and two other men, Moses Speckernell and Absalom Phillips; and in the warehouse we found a bolting-mill, which I do not think any corn-chandler would have, but there it was; there was every apparatus for dressing flour, as complete as Mr. Hammerton could have them at his mills.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do not bakers use a bolting-mill? - A. No, not in town; they may in the country.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Is it the business of a corn-chandler to sell flour? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Without any apparatus to grind it? - A. None.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do persons in the mills dress it? - A. The usual course of the trade is, for the miller to dress it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. There were no apparatus for grinding? - A. No.</p>
               <p>JAMES GRIFFITHS sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a constable: I was called upon to apprehend Mr. With at his own house, at Paddington; I found a sack-cart, and nine sacks.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you any conversation with him? - A.Nothing particular.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with Palmer? - A. Yes, at a public-house joining Worship-street-office, the same morning he was taken; he asked me if I would speak to Mr. Skillick and Mr. Hammerton, and know if he could be admitted, that he would inform them of many things that would surprise them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Mr. With shewed you about his premises without the least objection? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH ROBJANT (an accomplice) sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I was employed by Mr. Hammerton, as miller; the prisoner Innes had been a miller, and a helper in our mills; Palmer is a publican at Lea-bridge; Mr. With is a corn-chandler, I have known him six or seven months; I have known Palmer three or four years, he lived in the house of Mr. Hammerton: On the 24th of May, there were five sacks of meal went away from our mills, there were John Innes and

               <p>Griffiths. I found all these sacks at With's.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Speckernell.) Did you ever see any cart belonging to With come to the mill? - A. Never but once; a cart of With's came to Palmer's; I saw the cart afterwards, in the custody of Griffiths, that was the same cart I saw in Palmer's premises, the name upon it is John Tilyard, Hendon, Middlesex.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you saw the cart upon Palmer's premises was there any name upon it? - A. No; but I believe it to be the same cart; it is not like a town cart, it is a country cart.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. The only reason for your knowing that cart to be the same is, that it is a country cart? - A. No; the man that was in the cart gave me great reason to believe so, his name is Limerick, I saw him in the cart about half a mile from the mill at Clapton.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. (To Griffiths.) Q.Where did you find these sacks now produced? - A. In Mr. With's granary; I have had them ever since.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. How many more sacks did you find that you did not take away? - A. A good many, I cannot say how many.</p>
               <p>ABSALOM PHILLIPS sworn. - I am employed by Mr. Hammerton: I have seen sacks with the same marks in Mr. Hammerton's mill.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen the cart that was in Griffith's possession? - A. No; I have seen it upon the road, but not to take particular notice of it; I have seen Limerick with it, but did not know his name at that time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. This gentleman is a large dealer in flour and corn, and sends sacks about the town? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Therefore you cannot swear to these particular sacks? - A. No.</p>

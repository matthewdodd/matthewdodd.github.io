                  </hi>. I am a goldsmith, and live at No. 8, Albion-terrace, King's-road, Chelsea. On Monday, the 29th of April, about half-past ten o'clock at night, I was going across Battersea-bridge, from the Surrey, to the Chelsea side—there is a toll-house at each end—I passed through that on the Surrey side, and immediately after I crossed the road, about twenty paces from the toll-house, and looked over the balustrades into the water, I heard a cry from the other side of the bridge, as if somebody was hurt—it was, "Oh dear, oh my!"—I looked in the direction from whence the cry came, and saw a woman coming over the bridge, towards the Surrey-side, not di<lb></lb>rectly towards me, but towards the end I was standing on—she ran on the op<lb></lb>posite side of the road to me, but on seeing me, she crossed directly to me, and laid hold of my hand—she was exclaiming then, "Oh dear, oh dear!"—she said, "Will you be kind enough, Sir, to take me to the toll-house?"—I said, "What for, my good woman, what is your object in going to the toll-house?" for she was very unsteady, and reeled as if she was tipsy—I thought she was tipsy at the time—she said, "Oh dear, oh dear!" and said, "some<lb></lb>body has cut me, Sir"—I held her hands firm, for she felt as if she was fell<lb></lb>ing—she turned round, saw the toll-collector, and ran from me direct to him, which was about twenty paces—it was the toll-collector on the Surrey<lb></lb>side, from which I had come—I looked at my hand, and by the light saw that it was covered with blood—I immediately went to the collector, where the woman was then standing, and said to him, "What is the matter with this woman; she says somebody has cut her, and look at my hand?"—at that time she was falling, and she was laid down on the ground—there were two women there—I stood looking at her, and perceived a great quantity of blood close to her shoulder—I knelt down, looked at her, and saw the back part of her neck was cut—during that time the alarm had been given, and several persons had come around me—I was kneeling down at that time—when I saw the wound, I said, "Good God, the woman's throat is cut"—a person said, "It is Mrs. M'Farlane"—I do not know who it was—it was some person in the crowd at the back of me, and I heard another voice say, "Then Dalmas has done it"—some gentlemen came round from the Swan Tavern, and Mr. Freeman and Mr. Mullens each said he would go for a doctor—they ran away for the doctor—two policemen came up, and I said to one of them, who was leaning over me, "Why don't you go and give information on the other side of the bridge?"—he replied he could not leave till the doc<lb></lb>tor came—I saw another policeman, and said, "It is no use two of you being here"—I said, "My God, the woman will bleed to death before assistance</p>

               <p>comes"—I said that so as to be heard by her—she was then removed to the passage of the Swan Tavern, which was close by, and while lying there, I said again, that she would bleed to death, that she was dying—she appeared to me to be dying—I saw Langton, the officer, there then, and Mr. Gosling stooping over her—he is the landlord of the tavern—Langton knelt down and addressed some question to her—she was then lying on her back, bleeding profusely—before that I had heard her say nothing but "Oh dear"—I can<lb></lb>not say positively how long she lived after the question was put to her, but I should think about five minutes, not more than that—Mr. Gosling did not in my hearing say anything with respect to her state, before the policeman put the question to her—nor had any person besides myself said anything in her hearing about her state.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a toll-collector on the Surrey side of Battersea bridge. On the 29th of April, about half-past ten at night, I was at the door of my toll-house—I know Mr. Parkins—I noticed him pass by me towards Chelsea—I came out, and soon after that, a woman came to me from that end of the bridge—Mr. Parkins was not with her at the moment—he came immediately afterwards—I knew her to be Mrs. M'Farlane, the deceased—she said, "Oh dear, oh dear" when she first came up, and when she first saw me, and then again when I went up to her to assist her she repeated the same words, and said, "See how I have been ill used on the bridge"—she wished me to take her home—finding her in a weak state, I took her into my toll-house, and she was afterwards taken to the Swan—I had seen Mrs. M'Farlane about eight o'clock that evening—the prisoner's youngest daughter was then with her—I do not recollect her name—she was going over the bridge towards Chelsea, with the girl—I know a person of the name of Cook—I saw him rather better than a quarter of an hour, (I should think,) after she had come up to me—after she had been carried to the Swan—she was on the Surrey side of the bridge, on the bridge side, on the other side of the gate—Cook was on the bridge.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the William IV. beer-shop, King's-road, Chelsea, not quite a quarter of a mile from Battersea-bridge. On Monday, the 29th of April, I remember a man and woman coming to my house, from about a quarter to ten to a quarter or twenty minutes after—I cannot speak to a few minutes—I think they had a pint of porter—they drank it at the bar—on the Sunday after I was shown the body of the deceased, it struck me from the side-face that it was the same person—the woman paid for the beer—they were strangers to me—I heard of the death of Mrs. M'Farlane on the following morning—I had no other strangers come to my house that night, that I recollect—I did not know the man—I took notice of him that night—not particular notice, sufficient, as I thought I should know him again—I</p>

To the woman that I adore, and will adore to the last hour of my existence—Sarah, beloved Sarah. In the name of God have pity upon your unhappy Augustus. I waited yesterday morning in the greatest anxiety in the hope of seeing you with me at the altar of God, according to your promise. This morning I intended to watch for you at Queen's Elms, but you sending me word by Caroline that you would call on me at eleven o'clock, made me stop at home; did you do that on purpose? It is now four o'clock, and I shall not stir from Queen's Elms till I have seen you; but if you should evade me, pray send me word by Augusta before twelve o'clock to-morrow, where and at what time I am to meet you in the evening. See you I must, if it cost my life—that life which is entirely in your hands, and at your commands, next to God. Beloved, truly beloved Sarah,—do not abandon your Augustus."</p>

Not having seen anything of Augusta, I forward this by post, to say that Caroline sat up last night to make the three caps, one for you and two for Augusta.

I suppose you spent a happy evening yesterday, while I was pining in my now desolate garret. O my Sarah—if you knew how unhappy I felt, I think you would almost have been tempted to come and see me, even at the late hour at which you came home. What a miserable day again I have to pass. Pray, my dearest Sarah, shorten the dull hours of my solitude, and come and see me as early as you possibly can—as early as your good heart will prompt you. Come and take a cup of coffee with your Augustus—your devoted Augustus and faithful husband. I shall expect you from four to five o'clock, for your interview with Dr. Morrison will, I know, be the means of saving me, and insuring my future welfare, by being able to possess you. How proud I shall be then to say to my ungrateful children, "Here is the woman that saved your father's life"—I suppose you are aware what makes me so unhappy this day—if not, look at the date of this letter, the 16th. I fully expect a letter from your sister Caroline to-morrow morning, as I requested it as a par<lb></lb>ticular favour, as you would spend the evening with me. God bless you, my beloved Sarah.

               <p>"Thursday afternoon, 18th April, 1844. Dearest and beloved Sarah,—I have not recovered from the shock the news you brought me last evening gave me. I did not say much to you for fear of increasing the lowness of spirits in which I found you; but the nervous grasp with which I pressed your hand while at chapel, must have let you know what was passing in my agitated bosom. Bitterly did I reflect and repent the rash step I took on the 9th of August last, as by this time, with perseverance, you and I might have been happy. The idea of your being obliged to turn your house into a lodging-house for common men, breaks my heart. Is there nothing else you can do? The idea of an unprotected woman to be surrounded and have to wait upon a parcel of fellows, drives me mad. The continued hatred of your sister Ellen towards me also afflicts me to the highest degree; a woman who I never injured in any way, but always respected, and would have been proud to call my sister. She was partly the cause of my leaving my home, and I do really believe will not be satisfied till she sees me dead; on her head their will be my death, and I shall leave to Providence the care of punishing her for her inveterate and undeserved enmity to me. Excuse me, my adored Sarah, if my feelings force me to write thus; but you have no idea what pangs I endure when I reflect upon what has passed for the last nine months. Do not fail to meet me and Caroline at chapel on Sunday. Poor girl, I thought she would have fainted when I told her of your troubles; she would have gone over to you this evening, but the little boy is so poorly she cannot leave him in the evening. Do not be shy at Mr. Morrison when you see him on Sunday. I merely told him, that you had acted as a mother to my children, and how happy I should be to have such a woman as you for my partner, if ever it pleased God to put me in a situation to offer you my hand. I inclose a letter I received from your Caroline. You will inform me on Sunday what I am to say to her in my next. I suppose William will call on</p>

               <p>me by eight o'clock on Saturday evening; I shall wait at home for him. Perhaps you will send me a few shillings by him, in case the weather should be bad on Sunday, which I pray God will not be the case, for I long to join my prayers to yours, for our future welfare and happiness. Should Dr. Morrison write to you, or make any further inquiries, pray let me know im<lb></lb>mediately. I shall call on him on Saturday morning. I hope, my beloved, you have been able to keep up your spirits, and gone on pretty well with your work; to-morrow evening you will be enjoying yourself, perhaps while I am pining. Can I call at Higgins's for you if so let me know. Why don't you get Mrs. Rock to write to me if you cannot spare time, yet a line from your own hand would be such a consolation to your unfortunate Augustus. Try, my dearest, to find a few minutes to spare to write yourself, if it is only one line, signed by my beloved Sarah; I shall preserve it as a treasure. Do not forget the broach and the book on Sunday. God bless and protect you, my beloved Sarah—my only friend. Pray for your affectionate husband, "<hi rend="smallCaps">A. DALMAS</hi>."</p>
               <p>"Monday afternoon, April 21, 1844.—My beloved, adored Sarah, Remem<lb></lb>ber you gave me your blessing and forgiveness on parting this morning, there<lb></lb>fore do not harbour a reproach against your Augustus, but still love him as he loves you. My unfortunate Augusta leaves her situation to-morrow even<lb></lb>ing—can you still act as her mother, and give her shelter until she recruits her health and obtains a situation as nursemaid? she can take care of your house, and do all you require her to do, to assist you and keep your house in order; pray do not abandon her. Will you be kind enough to meet me at seven o'clock to-morrow evening, at Trafalgar-square, to receive her in your care, and see what her mistress will allow her for what she has done. My poor heart is broken at the idea of seeing such a young girl so unfortunate. I have something on my mind which I want to divulge to you, in case anything should happen to me, therefore pray attend to this solemn appeal of mine to meet me to-morrow at seven o'clock precisely. Your unfortunate <hi rend="smallCaps">AUGUSTUS DALMAS</hi>. "</p>
               <p>"Tuesday evening, 23rd April, 1844.—My Sarah,—This is the first time you sent me a cross message, and I hope it will be the last. You told me you had forgiven me, and gave me your blessing. Why, then, should you now send me such a message that you are very cross with me? Augusta has money to pay you for her temporary stoppage at your house, as I think Caroline will require her assistance in the nursery, or get her a situation near her, therefore do not be angry. You always told me that Augusta should never want a friend as long as you had a home for her, but whatever you do for her will be fully rewarded. See you I must; therefore send me word by Augusta to-morrow morning, when and where with the least inconvenience to you. Although you sent me such a cross message, I am still your affec<lb></lb>tionate husband, <hi rend="smallCaps">A. DALMAS</hi>. Relent, relent."</p>

               <p>A—"To Mrs. M'Farlane, Bridge-road, Battersea, Surrey.—Read with atten<lb></lb>tion the last sentiments of a man who did once love you to perdition, whom you have ruined, and now grossly insulted, and call Mr. Kiss my * * Infernal Millwood! monster in woman's shape!—you have now thrown off the mask, and shown yourself in your true colours; an abandoned profligate prostitute of the lowest order. I know all your artful deceptions. You are little aware who watched you when you were carrying on your criminal intercourse with your paramour. You used to send my daughters up stairs, and under pretence of bringing the tea-kettle on the wash-house fire, you artfully ex<lb></lb>amined</p>

               <p>the passage and the stairs to see that no one was listening or watching, then locked yourself in the back chapel room, and prostituted yourself for hours together. You have dishonoured the names of your father and husband, and have the effrontery to boast of it. Well might the gar<lb></lb>deners, when they used to pass your dwelling, say, "This is the house of that b—old wh—M'Farlane, who used to live in the gardens; she keeps a chapel and a brothel." I was so infatuated, I would not believe any of those reports, but am now fully convinced; indeed your obscenities with me, and your repeated pollutions of my person ought to have opened my eyes, but under a spell, I mistook your profligacy for affection. All you wanted was to satisfy your obscene propensities, and enjoy yourself at my expense, and when you found all the money gone, like other prostitutes, you laugh at me for a fool, and insult me in the most disgusting language, fit only for a Westminster wh; but you shall not go unpunished. I write by this very post to Mrs. Talk, and others of your family, and disclose the whole of your profligate conduct. You—to dare to say that you have done anything for my family; they never had an ounce of bread from you but what you charged them the price of a loaf. You have shamefully robbed them and me. You directed your thief of a son to enter in the book double the amount of whatever they had. You have lived upon my money for the last four months, and you never rendered an account. Where did you get the money to pay for your son's shoes, but in my purse? Did you not charge me for Sophia's expenses down to Derby, when you had more than the amount sent you by Miss Graham and Mrs. Woolf? Did you not have the meanness to charge the 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which your paramour, Meredith, deducted from the linen-draper's bill? when you had so much money of mine in your hands, you would not even allow poor Augusta a penny for medicine, while you was launching me into all sorts of extravagance, in supplying you with gin, &amp;c., &amp;c. Instead of a virtuous woman, I found in you a cursing, swearing, blaspheming, gin-drinking prostitute, who will go with the lowest fellow, provided he can treat you—a woman of the most vulgar and dirty, lazy habits—who blushes at nothing—call to her son, in the presence of my daughter, to fetch the p—p—, and squat and ease herself before him—and O, horrid! allows that son, seventeen years old, to sleep with her, when she is aware of his having obscene books and pictures in his possession. In<lb></lb>famous woman, these are the actions for which you ought to be horse-whipped out of Battersea; and wherever you go, there ought to be a post and a lantern with the words, 'Beware of a prostitute.' Simpson had often told me that you were a bad lot altogether, and that you were one of the most artful pro<lb></lb>stitutes in Battersea, but I was fool enough not to listen to him. Monster, you have obtained your wishes in bringing me to my grave—you are my murderess. I shall haunt you during your life, and when I meet you in hell, will torment you to eternity—you will wither and die a miserable old wretch. Miserable man that I am, to have placed my affections on such a prostitute and monster; but my children will revenge me I hope, and make you restore all you have robbed them of, and give an account of my money. You have lived for years by your prostitution, and obtaining possession of the unfortu<lb></lb>nate property. Well might you, with your two days' work, wear nothing but silk stockings and French shoes, and lull yourself in bed till nine o'clock, while my poor unfortunate children were obliged to do your dirty work. You and that old b—d, Rock, dare to call my daughter a wh—; look how she works, and that will be at once a complete denial of all you artfully tried to insinuate in my mind against her; but she has found friends, who will punish you for what you have done to her. I have informed her of all your</p>

               <p>obscene actions with me—your debauchery and profligacy; and you may rest assured she will revenge me. I send this letter unsealed, on purpose that it may be read at the post-office, and that all Battersea may know what a pro<lb></lb>fligate wh—you are. The letter to Mrs. Talk is also left unsealed for the same purpose; independent of which, I left a paper on my table which shall appear in the papers, that you may not have a chance of escaping the op<lb></lb>probrium and the scorn you so richly deserve, and prevent other miserable beings from falling into your snares. Go, wretched wh—, and carry on your trade fairly at Wapping, amongst your companions, and don't assume again the cloak of religion to hide your profligate conduct. Complete the educa<lb></lb>tion of your worthy son—he cannot have a better tutoress in the art of iniquity; you can make him fit for anything, and prepare his way to the gallows. Love, jealousy, and despair—all your works, have brought me to complete madness—my pen curses you—yet, in my dying moments, my poor heart still loves you. Farewell for ever.—<hi rend="smallCaps">A. DALMAS</hi>. "</p>
               <p>B—"To Mrs. Talk, near the Bridge, Battersea, Surrey. Madam,—That consummate prostitute, M'Farlane, is a dishonour to the name and to your family, and it is high time you should be acquainted with her profligate conduct. She has carried on an illicit intercourse for some years with a married man—that profligate Meredith, the nephew of Mr. Breeze, the linen<lb></lb>draper, at Kensington. With all her cunning she could not prevent my children from discovering her licentious libertinism; and yet this is the woman that I unfortunately did love—fatal is the hour I ever admitted her in my house; but under the mask of hypocrisy she resolved my ruin. She had hardly closed the eyes of my dying wife, than, by the most lascivious caresses, she created the fatal feelings which have now brought me to perdition. She made a secret entrance from hers into my house, that she might have access at any hour, without being perceived by her sister Ellen. Alarmed at the progress of the fatal passion she was to art<lb></lb>fully raising in my bosom, I resolved to fly from the scene, and accordingly abandoned my home, family, and business, with the full intention of destroy<lb></lb>ing myself; but the recollection of a faithful and affectionate daughter, who was hastening home from America, prevented me; she met me at Liverpool, and persuaded me to come back to London, where, on my arrival, that Mill<lb></lb>wood, M'Farlane, came to meet me. She invited me to her house, where she renewed her lascivious caresses, professed the most ardent affection for me, saying that since the death of her husband she had never loved any one like me; she readily accepted me as her future husband, and induced me to pub<lb></lb>lish the banns in Kensington church, and our marriage was actually fixed for the 16th of Jan. last. Meanwhile she had received a large sum of money for me, which she wanted me to give to her son, to set him up in some busi<lb></lb>ness; however, having received some hints that she was carrying on an illicit intercourse with that profligate, Meredith, I hesitated; she then made up her mind to rob me of part of the money, and make me spend the remainder in debauchery with her, play-going three times per week, suppers, gin-drinking, coaches, <hi rend="italic">cabs</hi>, omnibuses; nothing stood in the way. She then began to amuse herself, as she calls it, in exciting the passions to an unnatural degree by acts of the grossest indecencies, and repeated pollutions of my person, ex<lb></lb>posing her bosom for me to suck her breast, and all sorts of obscenities that can be practised in the brothel; stopping with me till one and two o'clock in the morning; had me at her house on the Sundays, and while prayers were offering to God below, was amusing herself in her libertinism with me, sending word down to Mr. Baker that she was very poorly. You now know the cause of her absence from chapel. Ask at the toll-gate at what</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184406100196"></xptr>
               <p>hour she used to come home in the morning; interrogate my children, for even their presence did not stop her from her indecencies. Finding my money going fast, I wanted once more to fly from such a den of infamy, and, under pretence of having some business in Paris, asked her to let me have 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of my money: but no, that was not her game; she would not see me depart till she had quite done with me. Alarmed at my awful situation, I began to make repeated inquiries, and found all my suspicions well founded, that every one of the Battersea gardeners knew her to be a common prostitute. I taxed her with her illicit intercourse with Meredith, and she had the un<lb></lb>blushing effrontery that she should still carry it on; and to prevent her sister from observing when he comes, she meets him at that old bawd's, Mrs. Rock. What will you think when I inform you of her allowing her son, seventeen years old, to sleep with her, when she admitted to me herself that he had in his possession obscene books and pictures; and when she comes home, even in the presence of my youngest daughter, calls out to <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi> to bring her the po, and squats herself before him. Horrid! Will you after this look upon that infamous woman as your sister? Impossible. Having now given up the chapel, she intends to turn her house into a brothel, by taking none but single men lodgers. What a miserable and unfortunate man I have been to put my affections in the power of such a vulgar prostitute. Now that she has completed my ruin, she most grossly insults me, and even to my daughter calls me Mr. Kiss my * * *. Could I have expected more dis<lb></lb>gusting language from a Westminster wh—? Heartless wretch! When, last Sunday week, she kept me in debauchery till four o'clock in the morning at her house, I informed her that my mind was in that state that I should cut my throat; she very coolly said, "Don't do it here, it will make such a mess." Can you any longer allow that infamous prostitute to dishonour your maiden name, and allow her to call you sister? She has driven me mad—mad—mad; she has murdered me! <hi rend="smallCaps">A. DALMAS</hi>. "</p>
               <p>C—"To my unfortunate family—Be it known, that infernal prostitute, M'Farlane, of No. 13, Bridge-road, Battersea, that second Millwood, has brought me to perdition; she has robbed me and my family under the mask of affection; she has led me into all sorts of debauchery: her profligate and illicit intercourse with that married man, Meredith, the nephew of Breeze, the linen-draper, of Kensington, at the very time she had offered to become my wife, has made me come to the determination of committing suicide. I have been adoring a common prostitute, who now insults me in the most re<lb></lb>volting manner. To have been mad enough to put my affection on a swearing, cursing, blaspheming, gin-drinking washerwoman and a wh—, has turned my brain; I can live no longer: let the world know her, and may this prevent other victims from falling into her infernal snares. <hi rend="smallCaps">A. DALMAS</hi>. My unfor<lb></lb>tunate children, my unfortunate family! Farewell Caroline; farewell Char<lb></lb>lotte; farewell Sophia; farewell Augusta; farewell for ever: that Millwood M'Farlane has murdered me. <hi rend="smallCaps">A. DALMAS</hi>. Avenge my death."</p>

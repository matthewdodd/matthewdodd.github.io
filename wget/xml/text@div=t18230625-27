On the 26th of May, about ten o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came to my house, and had half a pint of beer, which he warmed; he complained of being ill and went to the water-closet; he afterwards staid in the tap-room a long time; this wine was locked up in the cellar; he left and came again about two o'clock, and had a pint of beer, and went to the water closet, which is in the cellar; I went into the bar between four and five, and was informed some wine was stolen; a gentleman ran into the cellar; I afterwards saw two bottles of wine found in the prisoner's pocket. I gave him in charge.</p>

            . I was in Mill's bar, and in consequence of information, I went into the cellar, and found the prisoner there; the wine cellar was open; I caught hold of him, and said what are you about; he was under the wine cellar; the water closet is by the wine cellar door; he said he had been to the privy and was adjusting his clothes. I collared him, and said you have been robbing the cellar, and found a bottle of wine laying horizontally in each of his pockets, which appeared to have been made for that purpose. I found two more bottles of wine in the beer cellar, between the water closet and wine cellar. A man who came in with him jumped out at the back window when the alarm was given.</p>

            . On the 26th of May, the prisoner came to my father's house, with his wife and a man, they went into the parlour, called for a pint of beer, and in a short time he went into the cellar; I went to the top of the stairs afterwards, and saw his shadow at the further end of the cellar, beyond the water closet. I came from the stairs; his wife met me in the passage, and asked for a glass of rum; she detained me several minutes at the bar, and when I had served her, she took me by the, and said I need not be alarmed, for it was her husband, had gone below. The wine cellar was locked, but it was found forced open.</p>

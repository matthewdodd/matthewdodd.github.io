                  </hi> I am in the service William Henry Jones and Son, of High-street, Borough, leathersellers. On 1st Feb., about half-past six in the evening, I received information, and missed a roll of gutta percha in front the grating in front of the shop—it was safe a little before six—this is it (<hi rend="italic">prod<lb></lb>uced</hi>)—I had cut a band off it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, M</hi> 265.) On Tuesday evening, at a quarter before five, I was passing Mr. Jones' shop, and saw two rolls for gutta percha—about six o'clock I saw the prisoner at he shop-window, and after<lb></lb>wards met a man, not the prisoner, with a roll similar to what I had seen—I though the prisoner belonged to the shop, and let him pass me—I them followed him, and next saw he gutta percha on his shoulder—I stopped him and asked what he was going to do with it—he said he was going to his master's—I asked who his master was—he dropped it, and said a man promised him a pint of beer to carry it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> A man asked me to carry it, and said he would give me a drop of beer; if I had known it was stolen I should not have taken it.</p>

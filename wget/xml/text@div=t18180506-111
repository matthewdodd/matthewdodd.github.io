            . My, husband keeps horses at Mr. Badcock's stables, Queen-street, Chelsea. On the 16th of February, between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, I saw a country-looking man come to the stable with the saddle on his shoulder. He said he had three bridles and a saddle to sell. I told him my husband did not buy such things, but that I would shew him a man who would probably buy them. I took him to the prisoner, who was by the water-side. I left them, and did not see the prisoner purchase them. It was by the Yorkshire Grey.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker, and live at Westminster. On a Thursday in February I saw the prisoner dealing with a man for the bridles and saddle, about ten o'clock in the morning. He asked three guineas for them-the prisoner said he would not give so much. They went into the Yorkshire Grey to pay for them.</p>

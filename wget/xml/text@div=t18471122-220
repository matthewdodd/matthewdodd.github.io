                  </hi> I am the wife of Thomas Hammond—on Friday, 1st Oct., I lodged at 64, Little Surrey-street, Blackfriars-road—the prisoner occupied the back parlour ground-floor of that house for about two months—I occupied the front parlour—I knew the prisoner's brother, Robert, who is now dead—he was in the habit of coming to the prisoner in the daytime—he was there on Friday the 1st; I saw him—a lad named Vincent also used to help him—I had seen him on other days, but not on that day—the prisoner took the room of me, and said he worked at a cabinet-maker's shop, in the Westminster-road—I never saw him doing anything but rolling papers for three weeks or a month before this occurrence—I saw him filling pa<lb></lb>persin the yard, behind his parlour, on Friday morning as I was hang<lb></lb>ing out my clothes, but I did not notice what with—I never heard any noise—on Friday afternoon I was sitting at work in my room about half-past five, and heard a dreadful report all in a moment, like fireworks—I saw a lot of smoke in the passage, and I opened the window, jumped out, and ran away—I then came back again, thinking of my father, who was in the house, and the first person I saw was the little boy, Robert Mordey, all on fire, coming out of the street-door—he was fourteen years old—I never saw him afterwards—about moment after, the prisoner came out of the door with his hands and hair terribly burnt—I asked him what he had been doing, and he said something had flown out of the fire—another report of the same sort then went off—he said he would go in and put the fire out, and he went in—I did not see him again—I went in again in about five minutes—the house was in a smother, and perceived a smell of sulphur—I went into the room the prisoner occupied when my husband came home, about eight o'clock in the evening—it was terribly burnt, the windows all broken, and the door blown off.</p>

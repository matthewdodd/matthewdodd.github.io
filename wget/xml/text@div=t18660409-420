I am a labourer residing at the back of the Grand Surrey Canal—on Sunday evening, April 1st, between 11 and 12, I was in the Borough, walking a little behind my wife and daughter—some boys came round me like a lot of little wolves—I was knocked down, and had my watch taken from my waistcoat pocket—they couldn't get it out properly—the prisoner is the one that took my watch—I went with my wife and daughter and a constable to Angel-court, and found the prisoner at a common lodging-house—I had followed him up quickly.</p>

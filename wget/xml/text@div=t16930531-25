The Counsel for the King opened the Indictment to the Gentlemen of the Jury, and told them that the said Cave was Barbarously Murdered. The Evidence was first Mr. White the Coroner, who declared that he sate upon the dead Body, and that one Mr. Stanley who is now dead was the chief Witness of the matter of Fact, and his Examination was read in Court, which set forth that Mr. Cave that was Kill'd, and he, and Mr. D - were all at the Chocolate-house in <placeName id="t16930531-25-crimeloc117">Bridges-street in Covent-Garden</placeName>

Mr. Cave would not answer the question at first, but after did, saying he did do it; then Mr D - drew his Sword upon him, and first struck him over the Head in a   manner, and then Mr. Cave endeavoured to avoid the Prisoner's fury and went back, but Mr. D - followed him and gave him the Wound aforesaid, of which he died; there were others that saw him in the Room. The Information of Mr. Stanley was allowed as good Evidence in Law. The Prisoner being asked what he had to say, he answer'd, That he was not the man that did it, and there were others of his Name in Town; he utterly denied the Fact, and presumed that there was no  Evidence that affected him; being asked again if he could prove where he was at that time when Mr. cave was Kill'd, and if he had any Witnesses to call, to which he replied, That he had none, and no more to say, being very willing to submit himself to the Judgment of the Court, the Jury giving this Reason for their Verdict, that because Cave did acknowledge to Mr. D - that he was the Person that did so affront him, it therefore was a fresh provocation, and so they found him <rs id="t16930531-25-verdict118" type="verdictDescription">

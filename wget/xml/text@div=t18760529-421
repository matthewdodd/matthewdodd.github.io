This is a warrant for the full complement, 165 slabs—that is a slab (<hi rend="italic">referring to the ingot</hi>)—the weight of the entire quantity was about five tons—I do not know anything about the quality of metals; it is not a part of my trade—the "mark I refer to is "Brisbane;" that is the place where it comes from-we get a good deal from there in the course of the year, not all with that mark on it; there are several brands—I don't, know what "T.M.C." means; it is generally that brand, the Brisbane brand—I think it means some mining company—there is our mark here of "283 draught;" that corresponds with the warrants—a draught represents five slabs, weighing so much—there ought to be five slabs marked "283;" the five slabs so marked would altogether make up the amount put opposite them here—when the ingot was stolen it had not that gaping hole in it; I cannot exactly say when that was. done; I think it was done for the analysis—there is a witness here to prove that I never saw or heard anything more of this metal after it was stolen from the tug boat, until five months afterwards.</p>

               <p>five tons—the price varies very much—at that time it was getting on for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a ton—the price of the tin in the market on the 11th or 12th of May this year was about 76<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I recollect a man of the name of Armitage being' charged with the unlawful possession of three of the original ingots—this is one of the three—I had a sample cut from it for the purpose of analysis-, for both sides and gave it to Messrs.

I saw a piece off this at the police<lb></lb>station—our piece was cut first, and the essayer cut the next piece—here our piece—we took a good sized piece and gave it to Johnson &amp; Matthey—it is only marked by ourselves to know one from the other—that is marked with the letter F and this is the piece that came off it—some of these were produced before the Magistrate—these are the pieces which the prisoner was charged with receiving when he was apprehended; I am quite clear about that—they were all three produced before the Magistrate: not on the first occasion—the prisoner was twice before the Magistrate—I know the trade very well, and have been connected with it for thirty years—there is an immense trade with Brisbane in that tin—it comes in with the wool season, the spring; in January it comes in as ballast in the wool ships—the analysis at our instance was made about the 13th or 14th May, I think—it was some time after the search warrant was obtained—I do not know the day that the result of it was reported to our solicitor—two or three days after we received it; after the last hearing before the Magistrate—the Magistrate requested it to be done, and a certificate was handed in in regard to it on the second occasion.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> In regard to the certificate, I heard it offered to be read in the presence of the plaintiff's solicitor if wished—Brisbane tin is very pure, nearly 100—tin coming from Brisbane is always marked so.</p>

I accompanied Greenfield to the prisoner's place where, after certain conversation, we found 155 ingots of tin—I said to the prisoner "These ingots are quite hot and have evi<lb></lb>dently recently been run down"—he said "Yes, they were all run down last night and this morning"—I said "Where is your furnace?"—he took me to a back warehouse and pointed to the corner and said "There it is," and behind a quantity of old rags I saw a copper or iron boiler—I said "Is this it?"—he said "Yes"—I said "Why, this is quite hot"—he said "Yes, it is"—I said "If you run it down last night and this morning where is the dross? if it is old teapots and metal joints there must be a good deal of dross"—he said "There it is," pointing to some dust in the dust bin—I said "This is not dross, this is dust and evidently has never been in the pan"—I then went back into the shop where the ingots were, and in a basket I saw some dross with a lot of old metal—I found those pieces of dross (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I said "What are those, they appear to me to be dross from tin?"—he said "They are bits that came in with the lead at various times"—I said "This is quite hot and evidently has not long left the furnace"—he said" It is bits, they came in with the lead, and it is the collection of years"—I then accompanied him to the back warehouse again where I saw a quantity of moulds—they were quite hot many of them—I said "Do those moulds belong to you?"—he said "No, I borrowed them last evening from Mr. Hedge"—these are them; I asked if he had any entry in his books to show how he became possessed of this tin—he said it was a collection of years, and that he had only those books in the shop—he said it was not tin, it was pewter run down from joints and teapots—he afterwards produced this pan in which was this dirt, which he said was dross (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I think it is a warming-pan.</p>

I was before Mr. Peterson, the Magis<lb></lb>trate, the case was remanded—I remember Mr. M'Caull appearing on behalf of the prisoner—I believe he asked for a further remand for the purpose of the analysis—I am not positive as to that, the Court was so crowded—I could not get into the Court—I could not really hear what was said—I remember no opposition was made to the committal, and that course was agreed to—the copper is here (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he did not tell me he had borrowed the moulds of Mr. Hedge, on many previous occasions—I have not inquired of Mr. Hedge to find out whether he told me the truth as to the moulds—I have every reason to believe it was the truth—I would not suggest that there is no metal in this dirt.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the firm of Johnson and Matthey—we are Assayers to the Bank of England and the Mint—we have received some samples of tin for analysis from Messrs. Bell and Co., of 2, Lower Thames Street, first two and then one, three altogether—No. I sample is refined tin, containing 99.90 per cent, pure tin, so practically speaking analysis is useless in such a thing as that—they would have it done; it is really refined tin—if the original analysis of a particular tin showed it was 99.88 and not 99.90 per cent., a further smelting or purifi<lb></lb>cation of the metal might increase or diminish, the alloy in it to a fractional extent; it is possible it might—it does not follow that it would—it is such a fractional difference that it amounts almost to nothing—I am not in a position to say whether that is Brisbane tin—I only received a sample—lam not supposed to know whether it is Brisbane tin or not; it is refined tin—I am not in the lead trade, but I believe lead is about 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a ton—there are others who can inform you on that point better—we analysed sample No. 2, "Tin found at Deptford"—that is cut from the larger ingot—I should know it if I were to see it—this is the sample, that was handed to me at the same time as the pure tin, No. 1—those two samples were handed me by Cundall and by Reed, I think his name was—No. 2 contains, tin 57.50; lead, 42.23; iron, 14; copper, 6; and a loss on determination making up 100—No. 3 was given us as a sample of the original tin, marked No. 4, which is 99.88 of tin—this dross in the warming-pan is not from pure tin—it may be dross from very impure metal, but I think it is open to great doubt what it is—there is a piece of metal in it—it is from impure metal, but not from refined tin—I don't think it is from tin at all—it is from pewter; very course metal—I should think there was a great mixture of metals in that dross—it is extremely difficult for anyone to say what that did come from.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WADDY</hi>. I do not know which is No. 3; I never saw it—the 3rd that I analysed was marked No. 4 as given to us—there is only one that I analysed; the two others I only found the tin in, and I said there was no occasion to have them analysed—I have not analysed No.l or No. 4—I ascertained them by direct determination—I can only explain it by going through the exact-process; a certain quantity is dissolved in dilute nitric acid, the oxide of tin so produced well washed, dried, and calcined, the amount of pure tin being determined from the resulting oxide—antimony is not an accompaniment of refined tin certainly—when you say "perfectly pure" you are not speaking of refined tin—there is no an<lb></lb>timony, I should say, 'in <hi rend="italic">that</hi> ingot—I simply say so as the result of ex:<lb></lb>perience—I should think it quite probable that I have found minute traces of antimony in Australian tin—it is quite possible, but in Australian refined</p>

               <p>tin there is no antimony; it is insoluble—I cannot tell whether there is antimony in that tin by looking at it without determining—I think it quite possible that Brisbane tin contains minute traces of antimony; no chemist would dare to say it docs not—it is a very difficult point to pin anyone down to—the same thing is true with regard to arsenic, bismath, and copper—there was neither of those metals in No. I or No. 4—I tested the solutions after I had done with the tin, and I found no traces of either metal—I did not test for antimony directly or indirectly—I was only em<lb></lb>ployed to determine the tin in those two samples, and it was only tin I determined—there could not be much antimony in No. 2, as we accounted for eyerything almost.</p>

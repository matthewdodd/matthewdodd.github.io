On the 6th or 7th of December he came for some trifling articles, and asked for credit; I objected - he said he would give me good security; and next day he presented a bill, which he said was on his master, Mr. Bailey - he gave me the bill. I observed there was no address to it, and told him a bill without an address was illegal, and he had better get it cancelled. He said he would, and next morning, or the day after, he brought me another bill - I had trusted him on the 6th. I agreed to take it, and said I would enquire into the respectability of the acceptor. He left it with me. He said I might enquire, for he was a very respectable man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you let him have goods upon receiving that bill A. I did; he wanted me to give him some cash, and I gave him 10 s. He came in three or four times every day, and on the 11th he asked me for more money, which he said he would return in the afternoon. I agreed to let him have goods and money to the whole amount of the bill. He took another bill out of his pocket, and said</p>
               <p>"You may as well take that, as I shall not want it." I paid the first bill away. I afterwards went to the person I paid it to, and took it up myself. I did not see him after I had advanced him the 30 s. until he was taken (looks at the bill) - this it it. It has my endorsement on it.</p>

About a fortnight before Christmas he came in about ten or eleven o'clock one morning, and said he had had a little money from Mr. Cooke, and as he had some business to settle, he should not return to dinner; I did not see him for near three weeks after; he was brought to my house by a young man.

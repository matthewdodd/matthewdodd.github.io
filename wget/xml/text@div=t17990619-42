               <p>JOHN BARNWELL sworn. - I was brought up to the sea; the prisoner at the bar picked me up in the street; I had been drinking a little, but was sober enough to know what passed; I had been at Blackwall; three or four of us had two or three pots of ale, we had no spirits to my knowledge; I went up stairs with the prisoner, and sat down on the bed; she immediately snatched my watch out of my pocket, and ran down stairs; this was on Friday night, the 30th or 31st of May; I saw her again on the Monday morning in the street; I sent an officer after her, and she was taken.</p>

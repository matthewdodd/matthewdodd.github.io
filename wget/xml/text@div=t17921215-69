               <p>On the 2d of November, between eight and nine at night - I think it was Tuesday - two men called on me to know if I had sent a person out with any property; or whether any person in the house had.

I immediately said, when I saw the roll of carpeting, you have taken this from the top-hole, in the upper-part of the warehouse. He did not deny that; but said, he believed the devil was in him. I mentioned to the officers, the next morning, how many yards there was in it; and when it was measured at the mansion-house, it proved to be that quantity. I have no doubt about it being my master's property; we had the same in our shop; we know it by the name of the pattern.</p>

I asked him, where he was going with it; he said to Red Lion-street, Clerkenwell; I told him it was not his way from where he brought it; I stopped him, and then sent two of the officers to enquire of his master; four of us were together.</p>

                  </hi>. I have two partners—we are warehousemen and commission-agents, in Bow-lane. In July last the prisoner came with a person who he represented to be a merchant—the prisoner was a stranger—he said a party in Manchester, who was well known to us, had told him that we had certain goods which he wanted for some party—we showed him some—he said he was a commission-agent, and he was buying for other parties—he first asked for gingham, and requested us to let him have a sample—he came next day, and brought back the sample, and began to bargain about the price—I told him we should only sell for cash—he said he was buying for cash, and for other people—he came very frequently to the warehouse after that, and amongst other samples, he obtained three samples of velvets—in the course of the times that he came, I repeatedly asked him to return the sam<lb></lb>ples of velvets—he made excuses—at one time he said he forgot them—he had brought in the first sample he had, and other samples, but not the velvets—he had them about 19th Aug.—the other goods had been looked out that he wanted to have; we had put them aside, we said we wanted the thing settled one way or the other—he said a bill was coming due on 18th Aug.,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184811270109"></xptr>
               <p>and after that he promised to pay—after 18th Aug. he said he could not find room in a vessel where the goods were to be shipped, and asked us to wait a few days longer—I gave him this list of the articles and prices, to show the party for whom he bought the goods—he had asked for it for that purpose—that was the only reason I gave it him—I never intended to give him any credit—I told him so from the beginning—it refers, amongst other things, to the goods of which I had furnished him samples, and to the velvets amongst the rest—he came again on 31st Aug., and asked for an invoice, or list of all the goods he had bargained for, to show to the party the amount of money that he was to be prepared with the next day—I furnished him with the invoice, amounting to 553<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—next day he called again—he was conversing with me in the warehouse, and a gentleman came in from the country—he asked me, in the prisoner's presence, loud enough for him to hear, whether I knew him—I said we only knew that he said he came from a party we knew in Manchester—the gentleman went on to say that he was a swindler, and several persons in Manchester had lost goods by him—the prisoner passed by us and went out, I did not think he would run away all at once, but he slipped away, and said he would come in again—I did not see him again till he was in custody, about six weeks afterwards—I have seen my velvet samples produced by the pawnbrokers.</p>

On the 17th of October, the two prisoners knocked at our door; Sheaf asked for 2lbs. of brass ferrules - I went across my sitting-room to get them; Sheaf sat down while I was getting them, and while I turned to get the scales to weigh them Canthon left the room - I weighed the ferrules, and missed the watch immediately; I went down stairs, followed Sheaf about twenty doors down the street, and then sent a butcher's boy after him - I had seen them before on the Wednesday; they came to my house - I am sure he is the person - there was no one else in the room; there are families live in the house.</p>

            . I took up Canthon in Great Dover-road - the prosecutor and I were together; I found four sixpences on him.</p>
               <p>HARRIET INCE re-examined. Q. What was Sheaf doing when you saw him in the street? A. Walking quietly with the ferrules in hand - he was not attempting to escape; I had seen the watch just as they knocked at the door - it has not been found; I suppose Canthon did not stay more than five minutes, and the other not more than ten - they came through the room where the watch hung, to the shop.</p>
               <p>SHEAF'S Defence. I went for 2lbs. of brass - she said she did not know that she had quite two lbs.; I said,"Let me have what you have got" - I helped her to break the sticks, and she weighed them; while I was being served Canthon went away - I paid her, and went away; while I was going along the street the officer stopped me.</p>
               <p>CANTLON'S Defence. I saw Sheaf, who asked me to go with him - I said Yes, if he would not he long; I went to the house, and they were a good while breaking sticks, and I could not wait, as I had to take some fan-lights to Peckham.</p>

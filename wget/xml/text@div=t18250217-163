On the 29th of January, I went to bed at half-past twelve o'clock at night, leaving my husband up.

I found the doors opened, every thing gone from the bar, and the cupboards all open. They were not locked the night before. I missed property worth about 5.</p>
               <p>PETER WELSH. I am the last witness's husband. I went to bed last, and examined the house. It was fastened up. I was alarmed between six and seven o'clock next morning by Flynn, it was before day-light; I could scarcely see him till I got a light. I found the back-door, which leads into a court, open. I think they had got in at the window, and opened the door. The window shutter was forced, and two squares of glass cut, to enable them to undo the fastening. There were marks of blood on the sash. The cupboards and drawers in the bar were open. I found a crow-bar on the bar table, several things scattered about, and the articles now in Court stolen. They were all safe the night before.</p>

            . I am a Trinity waterman, and live in King-street, St. George's. I pass the prosecutor's house to go to work. On the 29th of January, about a quarter past four o'clock in the morning, I went by, but noticed nothing then. I was returning between six and seven o'clock; it was day-light; it might be after seven o'clock; and as I passed I saw the prosecutor's door open, but no shutters down. I thought he had gone to bed and left it open. I put my head in and called out "house" several times. Welsh came down in his shirt, and I went away directly, and did not look to see if the house was broken. I have lived in the neighbourhood fourteen years.</p>

            . I am patrol of St. George's. On Saturday morning, the 29th of January, between four and five o'clock, I was in Hyam's Buildings, Bluegate Fields, about a mile from Welsh's house. I went to No. 3, and saw a light in the front room up stairs. I got on the opposite side of the court; continued there some time, heard somebody talking, and saw some person get up and go towards the candle, extending his hands out as if he had something which he was looking at. This was repeated several times; and presently I heard one say to the other, "I will have that!" - the other answered, "By G - d, you shall not have that!" I thought all was not right. A watchman was passing the Buildings; I told him to go and send one of our watchmen directly. Perry came, and waited while I went to the Inspector, to acquaint him. He told me to wait there till six o'clock. Perry and I stopped there some time. He went to the Inspector again; returned to me; and between five and six o'clock the prisoner Cochrane and another came out of the house and shut the door after them. Perry was nearest; he stopped them. I came up, and told them they must wait a bit. Cochrane went up to the top of the court to go into the privy; Perry went to see for the Inspector and an officer; I was alone with the two, and could not leave the entrance of the court, or they would have come out. Jeffery and Summers the inspector came. I pointed out the other man, and said the other was in the privy. We went to the privy to look for Cochrane, and the other man escaped from Perry. We could not find Cochrane in the privy: I have frequently seen him before, and am sure he is one of the men who came out of the house; it must have been nearly six o'clock when he escaped from the privy. I simply asked where they were going; they said, to work.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 29th of January, I went with Summers to Hyam's Buildings. Love pointed a house out; I went up stairs and found Davis in bed; before that, I saw a young man standing in the Buildings; Perry was with him. While Love and I went to the end of the court to look for the other, he escaped. I found Davis in bed - a candle was burning in the room. I found all the property there; part of it was between two beds, which were used instead of a mattress. On the top of the bedstead I found a white veil, and nine caps were wrapped in a black veil, and about the bed I found five shirts, a shift, two pair of sheets, two silk handkerchiefs, thirteen pieces of silk, a shawl, two pieces of lace, and other articles claimed by the prosecutor, and in the fireplace a ring box was among the coals, and under the grate a bill for wine, which Welsh claims; it is dated 1814. I found a phosphorus box and matches in a cupboard, and above the cupboard one pound of tobacco. I asked Davis who the people were who had gone out; she said she knew nothing about it. I apprehended Cochrane the same morning on another charge, and he was discharged.</p>

            . I am inspector of the watch. I received information, and went to this court to the bottom, leaving Perry with the other man. I found a place at the bottom where Cochrane could have escaped; I do not know where he lived. This is a house of ill fame; there are only two rooms in it, one on a floor; a young man was in the lower room, but Davis was alone up stairs; the houses are let out in tenements.</p>

I only saw the reflexion of one person, but heard two voices - they were both male voices. I have frequently seen Cochrane, but could not recognize his voice; there was a curtain before the window so that I could not see what they had.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH WELSH. This property is all ours, and was all in the bar - nothing was taken from anywhere else. This is a bill which my husband made out for Mr. Connell; I saw it in a drawer in the bar the night before the robbery.</p>
               <p>PETER WELSH. This bill I made out as a memorandum before I was in business, it was in the drawer the night before. I know nothing of the prisoners. Flynn called me in the morning, by singing out that the door was open.</p>
               <p>COCHRANE'S Defence. The watchman said I was too tall for the man.</p>
               <p>JEFFERY re-examined. Perry told the magistrate he thought the prisoner was rather too tall for the man who escaped from the privy, but Love immediately said he was the man.</p>

I shall, from now, hate every female, and nothing is left me any more worth caring for, for, as long as I thought you were mine, I was happy; but now I have lost everything. May you never love any one as I loved you, and then lose that love. Good bye, dearest love, for I shall always love, though hundreds of miles away. Your affectionate William. I leave London at once.

H. White, Director," on it, and asked him if that was his signature—he said "Yes"—he left the office upon that, saying that he would be back in two hours; but he never came back any more—I afterwards met him in the Borough, stopped him, and said I was completely ruined, and wanted my money, or 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account—he said "I have got your money at my house, tod I will pay you"—he took me to his house, and got two policemen, and gave me in charge for setting fire to my house—I had been in the house five years before the fire.</p>

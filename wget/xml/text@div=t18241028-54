            . I rent this house, it is in the parish of St. Leonard, Shoreditch. On the 30th of September, at three o'clock in the afternoon, I was sitting in the parlour behind the shop with my daughter; she said something and I ran into the street, and saw the prisoner thirty or forty yards off with the glass on his shoulder walking very leisurely. I ran and overtook him, looked at the glass and knew it. I secured him and brought him back in three or four minutes - it has my private mark on it; the selling price is eight guineas - it cost me 7 l. 14 s. and is quite new. I am certain he is the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far was it from the door - A. From three to six yards - it hung up; he had to go round several pieces of furniture to get at it. I asked how he came by it - he said it was given to him to carry by some person - it is too large to run with, it is 3 ft. 9 by 2 ft. 9.</p>

            , a carver and gilder, who used to live in Bath-street, City-road - he stood next door to the prosecutor's with this glass on his knee - he called me over, and said he had been fresh gilding a glass and could not carry it, it was so heavy, and asked me to carry it to Bishopsgate-street. I took it, and the prosecutor came and tapped me on the shoulder, and asked where I got it, I said a man gave it me to carry, and made no resistance - my friends have endeavoured to find Smith.</p>

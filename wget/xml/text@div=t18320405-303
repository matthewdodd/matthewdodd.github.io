I let it out to single men furnished; the prisoner took a lodging of me last Wednesday week, the 4th of April; he came the next day, and staid two nights - on Saturday morning I was awoke by one of my lodgers calling to him, and asking if that was his napkin which was hanging out of his pocket; I got up, but before I was dressed, he had got him back into my house, with the two sheets and the napkin.</p>

About a quarter past five o'clock, on Saturday morning last, I heard the prisoner coming down stairs; I opened my room door, and bade him good morning; as he was going down the next flight of stairs I saw part of a napkin hanging out of his pocket - I opened the street door, and said, "Master, does that belong to you?" he turned and said, "No, no;" I followed him, and asked him again; he said, "Say nothing about it, I have got a sheet;" he took off his hat, and there was a sheet - he then went back; I called the prosecutor; he went up into his room, and I went up after him - he had his clothes unbuttoned; I said, "You have another sheet round your body," but I did not see it.</p>

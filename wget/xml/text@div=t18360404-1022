                  </hi>. I am out of business. I was in Worship-square about half-past one o'clock in the day on the 1st of March, going home—I met a man who snatched out my watch, chain, and seals, and ran down Worship-street—I called "Stop thief," and some persons pursued, but I could not, as I am lame—I went to the pawnbrokers, and gave notice—I saw my watch the same evening.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker, and live at No. 42, Shoreditch—on the 1st of March, about ten minutes before four o'clock, the prisoner brought this watch to me to pledge—he asked 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on it—I looked at it very hard, and said to my wife, "This is the watch I have received infor<lb></lb>mation about"—the prisoner said, "You have had it before for 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—you can lend 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on it"—I said, "How came you by it?"—he said it was his own, and he had given 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it, that he had had it six months, and pawned it several times for 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I came to the front to look for an officer, and gave him in charge.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. He asked me to tell him the truth, where the watch came from—I said, "A young man, a sailor, stands at the door, who asked me to pawn it, and he said, "If they ask any questions, tell them they have had it before.' "</p>

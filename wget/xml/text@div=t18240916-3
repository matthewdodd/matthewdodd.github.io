I have known the prisoner five years - her husband worked for us. She came to live in my house about the end of July, to take care of an insane lady who lodged with us: she was about three weeks with us, and left on Monday, the 16th of August; I did not know that she was going, but missed her about half-past seven o'clock in the morning; I went to my drawers in the back room on the first floor, and found them empty; I had been to them the night before, and put a handkerchief in, and saw my child's silk pelisse there - but in the morning that and the handkerchief were gone: the drawer was not locked. I missed a white petticoat, a white muslin handkerchief, and a silk pelisse of my own, from the bottom drawer; also a silk gown, which she had put on the front room table the night before - my bonnet from a box in that room, and a bundle of clothes from a basket in the kitchen, which were safe the morning before: there was a white muslin dress in that bundle. On Thursday, the 19th, I met her in the custody of Cass, with this muslin dress on, also my bonnet, a handkerchief, and a collar, which I had worn on Sunday. I asked how she could treat me in that way, when she knew I worked hard for what I had, and she left me nothing to put on; she said she was ashamed to see me, for she knew she had done wrong - I asked her where my pelisse was: she made no answer. The constable said in her presence that she had given a pelisse to Mrs. Green, as security for some sheets; she made no reply. I went to the watch-house: he fetched the pelisse from Mrs. Green, and it was mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not give me leave to wear anything of yours - A. I lent her the dress she has on now, and a silk scarf, to appear decent in. I do not charge her with stealing them. I lent her none of these things.</p>

            . I am a widow, and live in Rose-street, Long-acre. The prisoner took a lodging of me in June last (I think) and slept but one night there. On the 19th of August I met her in St. Martin's-lane: I spoke to her, and recognized her voice; she said she did not know me: I said she did - she then said,</p>
               <p>"Let me go;" I insisted upon taking her to the watch-house, but she gave me a plumb coloured pelisse as security for something. I followed her, and was with her when Mrs. Brix met her. I gave the pelisse to the constable.</p>
               <p>THOMAS CASS. I am a constable. I took the prisoner by Mrs. Green's direction - she gave me a pelisse, which I produce; I have had it ever since - she had a green veil on when I took her. She said she lived at No. 3, Phoenix-street, but did not say in what room.</p>
               <p>MRS. BRIX. Here is the pelisse which I wore on Sunday night - I had only worn it four times - the silk cost me 2 l. 1 s. 7 d.</p>

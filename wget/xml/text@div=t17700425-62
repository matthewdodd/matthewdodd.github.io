I called to the watch; when the watchman came, there was nobody in the house. I heard somebody jump out at a window. I went up stairs with the watchman, and found the window shutter broke open in the parlour, in the ground-floor; the fastening that the bolt goes into of the window was wrenched off: three locks of the drawers were broke, and the things in the indictment were missing; a linen gown and petticoat, a red and white linen gown and petticoat, a pair of stays, three linen shifts, a cloth apron, a muslin apron, a blue sattin cloak, four silver pins, set with stones, a gold ring, a pair of gold ear-rings, a pair of green ear-rings, a black sprig, a black silk handkerchief, a white linnen gown, and a dimothy petticoat, my property. Part of the goods are here; I know nothing who took them. I was in the parlour about eleven in the evening; then the window-shutter was safe, and the things in the drawers.</p>

            . I am one of the patrol belonging to St. Ann's lower liberty. I believe it was about half past one o'clock that night, I was standing in Union-court, speaking to a watchman. The prisoner came past, and two companions with him; he had this bundle under his right arm. I seized him by the collar, and called for assistance. The watchman hit him on his head, and knocked his hat off: he hit again, and hit my hand; I said, Hold your hand. The prisoner dropped his bundle; one of the men behind him pointed a pistol at me, and said he would fire if I did not let him go. I said, You may fire away. He turned round and fired at one of the watchman; the pistol flashed in the pan, but did not go off. Then a watchman took hold of the other side of the prisoner's collar, and we brought him to the watch-house; the other two got away. One of my fellow-servants picked up the bundle, and brought it after us. As we were carrying the prisoner to the watch-house, he sumbled at his right side coat-pocket. He dropped a piece of iron. I called to a watchman to see in that place if he did not find a piece of iron. He picked up a chissel within a yard of the place where I told him. The prisoner was searched: there was a piece of candle, and a snuff box, he called it, but it was a tinder-box. (Produced in court.)</p>
               <p>- Crocker. I am a watchman. I was standing in Union-court, talking to Shaw; that is better than half a mile from the prosecutrix's house. The prisoner came by with a bundle,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177004250050"></xptr> and two men at a little distance from him; Shaw told him, he should detain him. The prisoner said, The watchman knows me very well, (I black shoes sometimes, and I have blocked his.) After he was seized, the two men that were about six yards behind him, stepped up, and with a great oath, said, they would blow our brains out if we did not let him go. I did not see the pistol. The third man snapped a pistol; it flashed in the pan, but did not go off. We took the prisoner and his bundle to the officer of the night; the other two went away.

             took up the bundle. Going to the watch-house, near a grocer's shop, we heard some iron fall from the prisoner. We did not stand to look for it then; but we went back to the place, and found a large chissel.</p>

            . Q. You are partner with Lyon Henry - A. Yes; I was with him at the Welch Harp on the 30th of January; we went into the public house to get a pint of beer; at the same time we had some things that we bought, we looked them over; the prisoner came up to me and asked the price of the jacket, he tried it on; it did not fit him! she gave it to another man; the other man tried it on, it did not fit him; then they began to talk Irish, I did not know what it was; the prisoner and the other man went towards the door; my partner came up and said give me my jacket; the prisoner gave my partner and the man a shove, and shoved them both out of doors; I saw no more. I went and put my things in the bag.</p>

            . I am a private soldier. I was in the Welch Harp at the time; the jew asked twelve shillings for the jacket; the first man pulled it off, and the other man put it on; the jew and the man that had the jacket on went off together; the prisoner staid in the house for ten minutes afterwards. The prisoner did not hand the jacket to the other man, he took it off the table.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you recollect the jew coming in - A. Yes, after the prisoner; the jew laid coats, waistcoats, and jackets on the table; this first man tried the jacket on, it was too straight across the shoulders; it did not suit him; I saw him lay it on the table; another man in company took the jacket up and went out with it; the prisoner remained in the room ten minutes or a quarter of an hour afterwards.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence, called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

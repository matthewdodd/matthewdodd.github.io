                  </hi>. I live at 18, Loman Street, Southwark, and am a labourer at the Phoenix Gas Company—on 22nd July, about 12.30, I was by the Borough Market, going home—I had had a drop of drink in the early part of the evening—just as I got to the corner of the arch two men rushed out—the prisoner held me while the other rifled my pockets of my purse, 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and a pawn ticket, a key, and a pocket-knife—he did not hold me very tightly by my throat, but so tight that when I got my mouth open I could not shut it again—I fell against the low wall of the church, and shouted "Help!" and "Police!"—they both ran away—I ran after the other man, but could not catch him, and then ran after the prisoner—I found a policeman with the prisoner on the spot where I was robbed—I am sure he is the man—the moon shone brightly on his face as he stood in front of me—this is my key and knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did you ever see me before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Never, to my recollection—you had a dark coat on—you held me by my throat about a minute, not more—my purse had about 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in it, and the rest was looser—it was the other man who robbed me—you called him by name—there were two, not three—I did not say before I went to the station that I would not swear you robbed me—I ran about thirty yards after the other man—it was nearly 12 o'clock when I got off an omnibus at the top of Lombard Street—I had come from Bow, and had a friend with me who I left at his home in King William Street—I stopped there with him a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, and went straight through to the Borough Market down the steps—I am very likely stronger than you, but when a man is held by the throat and his breath is stopped, his power is taken from him—you were in front of me, and I was looking at you all, the time you were holding me—I said at the station in my confusion, that I was robbed at 11.30, but I told you the time directly after—I said 11.30 instead of 12.30—you said "What is the time now?" and I said "1.15."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Two men attacked me—I said at first that there were three—the prisoner called the other man O'Connor or O'Conolly—I am sure he is the man.</p>

On 22nd July I was on duty at London Bridge—I heard some one shout out "Help!" in the Borough Market, and saw the prisoner run out of Wellington Place very fast—he crossed the road on the way to Snow's Fields—a man after him shouted "Stop thief!" to the sergeant, but I stopped him before he got to the sergeant—he was very short of breath—I asked him what he had been doing—he said "Nothing"—I took him back to Pritchard, who said "Policeman, that is the man who has robbed me; one of them"—I said "Where were you robbed?"—he said "Here," and picked up a pocket-knife</p>

               <p>How far was he when you saw him again in the street? - He got on the opposite side of the way.</p>
               <p>Are you quite positive? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When had you been in the parlour before? - The windows were down I never remember their being left up, I am sure they were down, for my master was gone to the Royal Circus; and they were left down when he went out, and I am sure nobody else opened them.</p>
               <p>Which way did this man get in? - He got into the parlour window, because the blind was forced almost down, and in his endeavouring to get out, he forced it down entirely.</p>
               <p>How do you know that this pint mug was lost? - When I waited at dinner, the mug was there then, and when my master went out it was there.</p>
               <p>And what became of it afterwards? - I cannot be sure, we missed it when we came to look into the parlour to see what was gone.</p>
               <p>Was there any plate on the sideboard? - Some.</p>
               <p>None of that was gone? - No.</p>

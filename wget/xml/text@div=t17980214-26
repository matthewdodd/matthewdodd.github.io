               <p>Q. Who had been in the kitchen in the mean time, you do not know? - A. I asked them, if any body else had been in the kitchen, and the man immediately said, he had not been out; my sister had been down in the kitchen just before, for a plate of bread and butter, she had asked me, if she should assist the servant in getting the tea, and I had told her to go; I followed her immediately to take some better tea things from the parlour to the kitchen; I had not then missed my purse; I took those things off the tea-board, and placed the others on; Mr. Hedley then came into the kitchen, and asked me for my purse, I gave it to him unopened.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you opened it in the mean time? - A. Yes, I had; the prisoner Shannon came to me, and told me, I had given her a French half-crown, I was then in a room where the children were dancing; I went out into a dark passage, and opened my purse to give her another, but I did not then take notice of it, I was engaged with company, that was within a quarter of an hour after I had given her the first half-crown; I afterwards went into the kitchen, Mr. Hedley asked me for my pocket-book, which I gave him unopened, he took it up stairs, and immediately returned, and asked what I had done with the notes, I immediately recollected leaving the notes on the dresser; I then returned to the kitchen, and then it was that the conversation took place with the prisoners, that I have before related.</p>
               <p>Q.Had the woman prisoner been out, and brought in the articles for which you had sent her? - A. Yes, she had.</p>

               <p>The prisoner, Shannon, put in a written defence, which was read, as follows:</p>
               <p>Your petitioner lived five months servant to Mrs. Hedley, in Belgrave-place, and during that period received the approbation of her employer, never having had the smallest reflection upon her character, till through some misfortune, which your humble petitioner knew not, an execution took place, and the proper officer was put in possession; the next evening Mrs. Hedley came into the kitchen, the officer sitting there, and taking out her pocket-book gave your petitioner a French half-crown for some butter, which the shop-keeper refusing, I brought it back and gave it my mistress, who was then up stairs; I went up stairs, and received another, in the dark, out of the same pocket-book, from my mistress, I then went again to the shop; soon after my mistress's sister came down to help get the tea; soon after that, Mrs. Hedley came down, and said, she was ruined, and she desired me to turn out my pockets; she said, she had left upon the dresser, although it must be observed she had taken the same pocket-book out up stairs in the dark; I submitted to be searched, and nothing was found upon me; the officer next underwent the same, and they would have hurried the officer out of the house, perhaps for a private purpose, but he refused till another man came in his room; I was removed to Mount-street watch-house, where I was again searched, notwithstanding there was no woman there, and your petitioner's prayers and entreaties to the contrary, representing the cruelty and indelicacy of the action, I was stripped even to my linen before Mr. Hedley, and nothing found upon me; your petitioner now stands trembling before this august tribunal, and begs your Lordship will weigh her case with benevolence and humanity, and consider whether Mr. Hedley would suffer an execution to be put into his house having near thirty pounds in his wife's pocket, when his credit must suffer, and his new instituted school be ruined without appropriating it to that purpose; I had a good recommendation for a character to my place, I declare my innocence, and humbly intreat that your Lordship's benevolence will discover, that through the whole of her unhappy case, she is perfectly innocent of the present charge.</p>

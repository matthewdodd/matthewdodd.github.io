            . I am a patrol of Bow-street. On the 7th of March, at a quarter before nine o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoners near Hackney new church, coming in a direct line from Clapton, towards London; they passed me, I observed they had a bundle, I returned and asked what they had, Clear said he had a bag of tools, and produced a hammer from the bag - Titmouse said nothing; he had another bag - I stopped them, put my hand to the bag, found a book and two bottles in it, there were tools besides; I then took them to a public-house, and found one book in Clear's coat, and a small book in his coat pocket. I found two small books in Titmouse's coat pocket; they were dressed as working men, and said they had been at work were the fire happened. I took them both to Mr. Hamilton - he claimed the books.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. You found they had been at work at the ruins of the fire - A. Yes, Mr. Hamilton said no doubt the books were his. I did not hear him say he could not swear to them - Titmouse gave me no account where he got them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Clear said he saved the things out of the rubbish to take care of them - A. He said so before the magistrate.</p>

            . I am an auctioneer. On Tuesday, the 6th of March, I was employed to go to Clapton, by the Hand in Hand fire-office, to estimate the loss of Mr. Hamilton and Mr. Judson; Titmouse met me at Clapton by my order, and we there met Mr. Rubens, who informed me where the furniture was put. Titmouse accompanied me to take an inventory of them; we found the furniture and property, in five or six different houses. On the following morning, the prisoners went with a small caravan to collect the different articles of Mr. Judson's, to a place of safety, which they did, and in the evening of Wednesday, I saw what property of Mr. Hamilton's was saved in the opposite house; some furniture and about 100 volumes were in the green house. When they finished their work, I told them they might go; the books had not then been removed from the green-house. I left the prisoners there between five and six o'clock, and told them to go, as they had nothing more to do - they said nothing about finding any books or wine - what property was found, was to be deposited in the neighbourhood, not taken to town.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What time in the evening would the green-house be locked - A. I do not know that there was a lock on it, the property was under the protection of the fireman - I told them they might go - Titmouse was very active.</p>

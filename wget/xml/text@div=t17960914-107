               <p>Q. Are you a married woman? - A. Yes; I was a widow when this happened; I let a lodging to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Has she a husband? - A. I don't know; she told me they had not lived together for some months; she said, she was keeping a house for some gentleman that was in the country. Peckham-fair was on Monday, and she left her lodgings on the Wednesday; I let the lodgings furnished; she was to give me three shillings a week; she went away on the Wednesday, and took the sheets, blankets, a flat iron, and the key of the street-door.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your name now? - A. Edwards; she owes me one week's rent; a lad and I took her in Fetter-lane.</p>

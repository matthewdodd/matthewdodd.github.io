On the 30th of March I had my pocket picked of my pocket-book; I suppose it to be at nine o'clock in the evening, I did not find it out until half after twelve. I had been to Deptford.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in liquor - A. I had been drinking, I was a little fresh; me, and two or three friends, and the prisoner, went out together. The last time I saw my pocket-book, was at the Nelson's Head, at Deptford. I had in my pocket-book a check of fifteen pounds ten shillings, two five-pound Bank notes, and the rest one's, in all, sixteen pounds in Banknotes.

I got out of bed and heard what he said; he said he had paid a one-pound note to Mr. Lightfoot, he took a score out of it. On the next morning I went to Mr. Lightfoot, I saw the note; I had endorsed that note with the man's name that I took it of; I am sure I had that note in my pocket-book when I was at Deptford that evening. I had the prisoner taken.</p>

               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence, called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

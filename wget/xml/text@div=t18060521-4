               <p>Q. Did the prisoner live near you. - A. Yes, in the same house in the three pair of stairs room, and I lived in the two pair of stairs. On the 19th of April I went down to Margate, and I returned on the 26th; I missed my property on the 28th, I took a clean striped cotton shirt to a pawnbroker's, and asked him if he had got any striped cotton shirts or<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180605210005"></xptr>handkerchiefs pawned at his house in the course of the week, he told me had one, it had been fetched out half an hour before I came there, I went to another pawnbroker's, he told me that two of the handkerchiefs that I had described were fetched out that morning, and he had one left, I asked him to stop the person that pawned them and send to me, which he did, and the prisoner was taken to the office in Marlborough-street; after that she owned to the three handkerchiefs and the two shirts that she had taken out of my box.</p>
               <p>- ROBERTS sworn. I live at No. 25, Great Windmill-street, I keep a sale shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner at the bar, did you ever see her before. - A. I think so, she came to me on the 28th of April with an old check shirt, said her husband had gone to sea and left her, I told her it was not good enough; she asked me if I bought silk handkerchiefs, she had the ticket of three in her hand, she said she would bring them, instead of bringing three she brought but two, a cotton handkerchief and a silk one; I produce them; I am sure I had them of the prisoner. (The property identified by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was in distress when I took them, I had not a bit of bread to eat for my child nor myself.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

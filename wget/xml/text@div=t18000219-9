             sworn. - I am a pawnbroker, No. 92, St. Martin's lane; I manage the business of Berry and Patmore: On Wednesday evening last, between eight and nine o'clock, the prisoner offered six tea spoons to pledge; I asked him where he lived; he told me he lived at No.12, Castle-street, that he kept a house, and that he was a jeweller by trade; from his manner of answering these questions, I suspected him, and sent my lad to the house to enquire; and while he was gone, the prisoner wanted very much to go, but I would not let him go till he returned; I asked him how he came by the spoons; he said he bought them at a shop in the Strand; I asked him if he could take me to the shop where he bought them; and he said he could not; he then said he did not live in Castle-street, and went out of the box; I ran round, and locked the door, and took him into the shop; I suspected he was the servant of some silversmith; I told him he need not hesitate, for I knew the mark upon the back of the spoons, I told him they belonged to Mr. Hougham; he said if I would let him go, he would take the spoons and put them from whence he took them; he said that he lived with Mr. Hougham, and hoped I would let him go, for it was the first time he had ever taken any thing; I told him I could not let him go; I sent for an officer, and he was taken into custody; the officer searched him in my presence; he said he had nothing more about him; but in his pocket he found eleven duplicates, eight of them were of spoons, which he said he had taken from his master.</p>

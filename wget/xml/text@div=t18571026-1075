                  </hi>. I am a lithographic printer, and live at No. 10, Devonshire Street. I was in Steward Street on the Friday evening in question; I saw a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> pass with two trunks on it—in a few minutes afterwards I saw a man carrying a trunk in front of him, on his knees; Roberts is that man—that is the trunk—it was not very easy to carry in that way; it was very heavy—I saw him, soon afterwards, put it into a door way; then he took it out again, put it under a window, and walked up the street—I afterwards helped the policeman to carry it to the station—it was a heavy weight for two to carry; we could hardly manage it.</p>

On the 7th of March my house was broke open; myself, wife, and three children, were at home; I made all fast over night, before we went to bed; the house was broke open on the back-side; it was a hole made in the plaister: I heard no noise in the night: I keep a shop: I missed near twenty shillings in halfpence and farthings, some stockings, two cannisters with about a quartern of tea in each cannister, and a lump of sugar. The prisoner lives in Longford, about 150 yards from me: he is a sawyer; I had information of him, but did not suspect him, till I saw a pair of stockings on his legs last Sunday was a week, that I thought were mine; then I got a search-warrant, and in a chest I found seven pair of stockings; I can safely swear to them all. I said to his wife, These are my property: I lost more than I laid in the indictment, and I lost two cannisters at the same time; then I said, Deliver them up. His wife denied knowing any thing of them for a great while; at last she went to the top of the stairs; I followed her up, and saw her take them out of some boot-legs. (The stockings and cannisters produced and deposed to.) I know one by part of the rim being unsoldered; we took the prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176505220004"></xptr> at work in Cranford park: he asked us what we took him up for? we told him upon account of goods found in his house, my property; we took him before Sir

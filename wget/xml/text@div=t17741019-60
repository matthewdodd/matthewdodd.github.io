The prisoner's daughter had been with me a month; she had been out of place, and having no where to go to, I gave her lodgings at my apartments: the prisoner came to me, and desired to lie a night at my house; that was the Wednesday evening before the gown was lost; I gave her leave to lie there; I myself lay from home at that time, because my husband died a week before. I had not lain in my apartments since his death; coming home next day, I missed the gown; the prisoner was then gone; I detained the daughter; on Monday night I found the prisoner, who said she would tell where the gown was, if I would clear her daughter. I promised to clear her daughter if she would discover the gown: the prisoner had me to Murthwaite's the pawn-broker's, and there said, that the door of the room was open, and she went in and took the gown.</p>
               <p>Q. From the prisoner. Whether you did not promise not to hurt a hair of my head if I would confess?</p>
               <p>A. No, I only promised to clear the daughter, whom I had in custody at the time.</p>

            . The night the prisoner lay there, I observed her to be in liquor; I lay in the next room; I looked through a crevice in the partition, and saw the prisoner take every thing out of the drawer in the prosecutor's room; but she put every thing in again; she continued in the house till between four and five in the afternoon of the next day, when I told the landlord of the house a strange woman was in the room; he turned her out; when she was taken the Sunday night after, she said her name was Smith.</p>

            . I am an apprentice to Mr. Murthwaite, a pawnbroker; I took in the gown of the prisoner, who came there and pawned it for 8 s on last Thursday was se'nnight; she said she brought it for another person, and that she lived in Princes-street; the prosecutor told me that she had been pumping the prisoner in order to make a discovery, and had given her a glass of liquor, and then promised to give her 5 s. and not to prosecute her if she would confess, and

             a confession from her by that means.</p>
               <p>The prosecutor positively denied this, and she and Phillips both declared, that Fitzgerald said, if they did not give him part of the money that might be allowed them in court, he would take care to get the prisoner acquitted. Fitzgerald acknowledged this to be true, and he was severely reprimanded by the court.</p>
               <p>The prisoner, in her defence, insisted upon it that the prosecutor promised to forgive her.</p>

                  </hi>. I live on the second floor at 9, Great George-street. On 1st March I saw the prisoner on the landing, about ten o'clock in the morning—I asked him what he wanted—he said, "Mr. Swift"—I took him down with me to Mr. Swift's office, and found there was no one there—I called the porter, and asked the prisoner whom he came from—he said, "From Mr. Billiter, in Parliament-street"—I told the porter to go with him there, and, if there was such a person, to let the prisoner go.</p>

                  </hi>. I am porter to this Railway company. Mr. Cowan desired me to go with the prisoner to Parliament-street—when I got down the stairs with the prisoner, I told him to wait in the passage while I went for my hat—while I was taking my hat, I saw the prisoner run out of the door as fast as he could—I followed him—he ran, and I ran—he ran down George-street, to Duke-street—when he got to the steps, he looked round and saw me, he increased his speed, and directly I called, "Stop thief!"—I caught him in Fludyer-street—I lost sight of him before I caught him—I am quite sure he is the same person—I said to him, "Come back with me"—he said, "No; come to where I was going"—I said, "No; what made you run away?"—the policeman came up, and I gave him in charge.</p>

I was on duty in Fludyer-street, about ten o'clock, on 1st March—there is an empty house there, No. 11, and in the area of that house I saw this silver fork—the prisoner had been taken into custody before I found this fork—I found it about ten minutes past ten o'clock.</p>

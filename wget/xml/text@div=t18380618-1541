                  </hi>. I live in George-street, Limehouse-fields and am a mast and block maker. At the time in question, I lived in Queen-street, in the parish of St. Dunstan, Stepney—I was master of the house—the prisoner lived in my service for about two months, as servant of all work—on the 16th of March, I left home about six o'clock in the morning, leaving here at home—I returned about half-past three o'clock, and she was gone—I missed the articles stated in the indictment, which I believe were all safe when I went out—she did not return—she had given me no notice—the value of the property was 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have not recovered any of it—I have one aged mother living in the house, and she was confined to her bed—I never saw the prisoner again till the 4th of May, when she was appre<lb></lb>hended—I had been looking for her all that time.</p>

I heard of this, and was looking for the prisoner—I found her on the 4th of May, at her father's house, in Upper-court, Harris's-street—I asked if her name was Weatherstone—she said, "Yes"—I said, "You lived with Mr. Beaver?"—she said, "Yes"—I said, "I want you for his robbery"—she said, "I know nothing about that"—a few minutes afterwards she said, "Mr. Beaver said he would not hurt me"—I cautioned her several times not to answer my questions un<lb></lb>less she chose—I searched, and found sixtyone duplicates in the house, but none belonging to Mr. Beaver—on the way to the station I cautioned her again, but at the station-house she said she did not see why other parties</p>

                  </hi>. I am a glass-cutter, and live at 27, Green-street, St. George's, in the Borough. I lived with the prisoner eight or nine months, and left her more' than three months ago—on 26th April, about 3 o'clock in the morning, I had just come out of a public-house, near the Surrey Theatre, when the prisoner came up to me, and was prevented from striking me by a policeman; and knowing I had once lived with her, he said I had better see her home, and her companion came with us—I went to her lodg<lb></lb>ings, and directly we got in-doors the prisoner snatched up a knife, and her companion, being a powerful woman, prevented her using it—she then said she wanted to say something particular to me, and her companion went away—she pretended there should be no more words; and as soon as her compa<lb></lb>nion had gone she fastened the door, took a fork, and inflicted several wounds on my face—she then got a knife, and cut me on both cheeks, and I had several blows and cuts, and lost a good deal of my hair in the scuffle—I had done nothing to provoke her—she was in liquor.</p>

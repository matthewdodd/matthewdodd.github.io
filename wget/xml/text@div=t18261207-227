            . I am a constable. Last Saturday week, about half-past six o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner in Ball-yard, Golden-lane; I stopped him, and asked what he had got in his sack - he said cow-hair, which he got from his master, Mr. Page, and, in consequence of what I heard, I went to Mr. Kember.</p>

            . I am a lamp-lighter, and live in Ball-yard. About a month ago I saw the prisoner coming out of a shed there, with a bag or sack on his back; I could not see what was in it - he carried it to his own room; I went, and saw it was a quantity of bullocks' horns - he afterwards told me he had got them from Green's shed, and was going to take them to Mr. Kember's.</p>

I missed some hair last Monday, and the Wednesday before, and at other times, from my shed; it was in two sacks, and both sacks were gone; I believe the hair in this sack to be mine; it is of the same description, and the bag I believe to be mine; I have not found the other - this has the initials of the person I bought the hair of - it was safe about four months ago; I think I saw it three weeks ago - the man I hire the shed of ought to mind it.</p>

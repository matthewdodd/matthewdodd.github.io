                  </hi>. I am a boot-maker, at 48, Newington Butts—on 2d October, about 12 at night, I was in King William-street, City, looking for a cab—the prisoner and another woman came up to me—the one seized me by the throat while the prisoner tore my watch and chain out of my pocket by force—they then seized my scarf and tore my pin out—I was released by my scarf breaking, ran after the prisoner and caught her, and she gave me back my watch and chain—a constable came up and I gave her in custody—I lost the locket and part of the chain—I had been drinking, but knew what I was about—I was not running about with my watch in my hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Were you not struggling on the ground with another female before you came up to me? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I was not half an hour before I signed the charge sheet at the station, nor did I say that I was not sure of you—I said that I did not wish to press the charge, knowing the trouble I should be put to—I told the Inspector I had been drinking—I know you perfectly well—you had a black eye at the time.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where had you come from last? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had just left the European—that is a public-house—I had seen a friend into a cab at the top of King William-street to go to the railway—I had had a drop of brandy and water—I had been before that to a solicitor's, Mr. Thompson's, 4, Nicholas-lane—I called there about 6 o'clock—I was not there till 11—I went to other places before I went to the European—I had seen one or two friends that evening at one or two houses—I had a chop at 9 o'clock at a coffee-house on Fish-street Hill—I drank nothing but coffee there—I was at several public-houses in the course of the evening—I could not see a cab in King William-street, or an omnibus—I did not speak to the prisoner—not a word was spoken by either of us—the exact spot was very near Ridg<lb></lb>way, the grocer's—I also lost my breast-pin—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my scarf.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a servant to Mr. Scott, a victualler, of 15, Clement's-lane, King William-street, forty or fifty yards from Ridgway's—I was shutting up the house about a quarter to 11 o'clock, heard screams of "Police," ran out, and saw the prisoner and another woman struggling with Mr. Barnett—I went up to them and said, "You hold this one, and I will run for a constable"—I did so, and the prisoner was taken—I went to the station, and then returned and picked up this locket and piece of a chain, by Smith's, the cutler's—that is about twenty yards from Ridgway's—I am sure it was the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did you see me give the prosecutor a watch? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; the policemen looked about on the ground with their lanterns for the locket, but not on that spot—the prosecutor repeatedly refused to sign the charge—he was not sober, but sober enough to catch you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You did not see the prisoner run away? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I did not see the beginning of it, I only saw the prosecutor come up and catch the prisoner—he was screaming "Police,"—it was quite clear; there were no cabs about, or omnibusses—there was nobody in the street except us three, but two or three people came running when they heard the screams of police.</p>

On October 2d, about a quarter to 11, I, was on duty in King William-street, and Mr. Barnett gave the prisoner into my custody—the watch was given to me and the prosecutor asked me for it again, but I told him he must come to the station—he said at the station that if he got his property back, he would not press the charge—he had no scarf on, only a shirt-collar; his scarf was found afterwards in two pieces—I went to the address the prisoner gave, but it was false—she afterwards said that she had made a mistake.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> In the morning, did not the Inspector say to you that the prosecutor was so under the influence of liquor, that he did not think he would be there, and you had better subpoena him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He said that he was under the influence of liquor, and he could not leave his business to prose<lb></lb>cute, but would rather lose his property.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I was coming over the bridge, and the prosecutor and a young woman were struggling in the water together, fighting. I went across the road to avoid them. The prosecutor came across and said, "You are the person who stole my watch." Then he said, "No, I have lost my locket." I never saw his watch or property. He was very drunk.</p>

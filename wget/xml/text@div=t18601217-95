                  </hi>. I am a gentleman—I live partly upon my private means, at Hornsey-rise—I know the prisoner, and I know Herbert Anthony Manley—he is my brother-in-law—I married his sister—I married her in the name of Augusta Anthony Manley—I remember the marriage of Herbert Anthony Manley with the prisoner on 28th November, 1852—I was present at the marriage—prior to that I went with Mr. Manley to obtain the license—they were married in the name of Herbert Anthony Manley and Helen Morris—her father is a respectable man, and foreman of the plasterers at Messrs. Cubitt's—after their marriage I was present when they started for Melbourne—I accompanied them to Liverpool—they went off in the ship <hi rend="italic">Africa</hi>—shortly after they had left I received a letter from the husband—I spoke to the prisoner about that letter upon her arrival in London about two and a half years afterwards—the letter was from Lisbon, and contained a communication respecting the prisoner—this is the letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I had two letters from him from Lisbon—I after<lb></lb>wards received this letter from him (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), it is dated April 30th, 1853—I received that about two years afterwards—it was detained at the Post<lb></lb>office for want of postage—I know his hand-writing very well—I afterwards received this letter from the prisoner from Lisbon, dated May 28th, 1855—I it is addressed to "Mr. Kirtland, bill-office, Bank of England"—I was I at that time a clerk in that office (<hi rend="italic">This letter contained an inquiry whether Herbert was in England, and expressing a wish to come to England in two or three months</hi>)—I answered that letter, and about a month or six weeks I after, I saw the prisoner at her sister Janet's—she asked me relative to Herbert—I told her we had not heard from him—at that time I had not received the letter of 30th April—I told her we were very anxious about him, and I asked her the cause of her leaving him at Lisbon—she said she I left, him at Lisbon and had gone off with a Mr. Price, and Mr. Price had kept her for the period of two and a half years—I forget the exact purport of the conversation, it is so long ago—it implied that she had left Herbert and gone off with Mr. Price—it appeared to have been a pre-arranged matter between them—she said that the vessel put into Lisbon from distress, and remained there about a month or five weeks to refit—in point of fact she confirmed my brother-in-law's letter—she said that she made a pre-arrangement with Mr. Price,' and that, as the vessel was leaving the Tagus, the whole of the passengers were dining at Mr. Price's house and she left the dinner table, taking my brother-in-Jaw's watch away with her, which it appears she has since given to Mr. Richards, that they searched for her everywhere without success, that the vessel was leaving the harbour and my brother-in-law was carried on board by his fellow passengers in a state bordering upon madness—she told me all this—I afterwards saw her in June, 1856—I had then received the letter of 30th April, 1853—I spoke to her about the letter—I told her that we had heard from him from Melbourne, and that he was alive and well at that period—I gave her the date of the letter, and told her that it had been delayed at the Post-office—I did not read the letter to her—to the best of my belief I did not see her again before her second marriage—I did not hear of the second marriage until she told me of it, after receiving a letter—I received this letter from her, dated October 5th, 1857, from Kildare-terrace, Bayswater (<hi rend="italic">This was signed "Helen Anthony "and contained merely a request for an interview, to ask the, advice of the witness with respect to the settlement of some property, the postcript was as follows:</hi> "If you write, address Mr. Archer, as I have not gone by the name of Anthony since I left Buckingham-street")—I</p>

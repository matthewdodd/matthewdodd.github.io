                  </hi>. I reside at 76, Jermyn-street, and am clerk of some works now being carried on, Turkish-baths building—on the morning of the 7th Decem<lb></lb>ber, about 5 o'clock, I was in Cockspur-street, and a man, whom I suppose to be the prisoner, suddenly ran against me with such violence, as to knock me into the road on my back—before I had time to recover myself, I felt a sudden tug at my watch-guard, which was round my neck—the guard broke—I called out "Police," and "Stop thief!"—I then got up and saw the man who had started from me, from fifteen to twenty yards from me, running in the direction of Dorset-place—I gave chase, calling out" Police!"—I followed him to Dorset-place, and then into Whitcomb-street, and in a small street there I found in custody of a police-constable—I only lost sight of him just as he went round the corner—I charged him with knocking me down and robbing me—at the moment of the assault, I did not see the man sufficiently to recognise him—I saw him, with sufficient distinctness immediately after—I recognised him by having a light jacket on—he was the party I followed—I am quite satisfied that the prisoner is the man I then saw—I saw no other man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Samuel Hoy, and live at 10, Pierpoint Row, Islington—I am stepmother to the prisoner, he lived with-us and also my three children, aged eight, seven, and two—on Wednesday morning, 4th December, about 8 o'clock, whilst I and my husband were in bed, the prisoner brought us up a cup of tea each—he gave me a cup and his father a cup; he brought it in his hands—I can hardly say to whom he gave the first cup—his father drank his and I drank mine, the whole of it—I did not hear my husband say that he was ill after drinking his—having taken mine I got up, and dressed and washed my children, and sent them to school, and in about two hours I gradually came over very funny at my chest—I felt that there was something there that wanted removing, and I felt very ill; then I came over very sick indeed, and vomited very much and was purged very much; they were not particularly painful purgings; they pinched me a bit; there was great looseness, I was very ill all that day with purging and vomiting—at 3 o'clock I had some hot brandy and water and felt much better—I got well—on the following Saturday morning the prisoner again brought up some tea to me and my husband, I did not feel quite well, and I asked him to put mine by my bedside, and said I would drink it in a few minutes—my husband drank his—I did not hear him complain of any ill effects—about 10 o'clock I got up and went down stairs and took the cup of tea down with me, I did not drink it, it was cold, and I threw it into the sink—I was just going to wash the cup when I saw a thick white substance at the bottom—I showed it to my husband and he kept the cup—I don't know what was in it—on the Thursday evening previous my eldest little girl Emily said something to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Emily goes to school, and has done so for some years, ever since she was about two years old—the children all play about the house together when they are at home; I knew no difference between them—the prisoner has been in the habit of bringing us up tea only on Sunday mornings, to my husband and myself—the teapot was kept in the kitchen—the children did not make their own tea—the prisoner would not give any of the tea to his sisters, it was merely for me and his father—we used to come down to breakfast—the teapot would be kept on the dresser in the kitchen—I am always at home, because I am in the business; we keep a furniture shop—I have heard that arsenic was kept in the shop; I don't know it myself—I did not know where it was kept—I know it was kept in the shop, I believe in a drawer that was not locked—the prisoner has always been to school till lately—he can read very well I believe—I have not been in the habit of hearing him read; his father generally <hi rend="italic">done</hi> that—that which I saw in the cup was a thick white substance—it was what you call dirty white.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the husband of the last witness—the prisoner is my son—he was in the habit of bringing me a cup of tea on the Sunday morning as a rule—on Wednesday morning, 4th December, he brought up two cups of tea, one for me and one for my wife—I had not asked him to do so—I drank the cup of tea that he gave me—I did not feel ill after it—I saw my wife drink hers—she was very ill afterwards, vomiting and purging—I keep a shop—I had arsenic in the shop; it was in this drawer (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), concealed in the shop—I hid it behind some goods—the drawer was not fitted into a table or anything, but was hid behind some furniture—I had no knowledge that anybody else knew of the hiding-place—the arsenic had been given to me by my landlord five or six years ago, because I complained of the rats in the place—about two months before this Wednesday morning I had used some of it for the rats—I cut a potato up, and put some of it into it, and put it under the holes in the boards in the kitchen, as I usually did—I put the remainder of the arsenic back where I took it from, and hid it in the same way—I think I took the arsenic in the drawer into the kitchen, and put it back again in the same place in the shop—no one was in the shop when I did so that I am aware of—my wife was in the kitchen—I don't think the prisoner was there when I used the arsenic on that occasion, because I was always very cautious—between that time and the Saturday when my wife gave me something in a cup I had not been to that arsenic—on that Satur<lb></lb>day I went and looked at the arsenic after I came back from the doctor—I found that it had been disturbed; the box had been moved, and the coverings over it had been moved too; some mats that I kept over it—the box had been shifted, and the best part of the arsenic was gone—it was in two papers, one inside the other, and the outer paper was gone—it was a paper similar to the inner one in which the arsenic is now—both papers had labels on them—about 11 o'clock on that Saturday morning my wife gave me a teacup; there was something on the bottom of it—we talked a little while over it, and then I put the cup aside on a chest of drawers in the shop—it remained there about an hour and a half, when I showed it to Dr. Harle—he came by, and I called him in and asked him what he thought it was—nobody had touched it since I put it there—I had remained in the shop, and I had put it out of any one's way—the doctor did not take it away with him; he was going somewhere, and told me to bring it to his surgery, which I did, between 3 and 4 o'clock that afternoon, and gave it to his assistant—Mr. Harle was not there—the stuff in the cup was of a dirty whitish colour, like the arsenic—it was the similarity between the colour of it and the arsenic that roused my suspicions, and caused me to speak to the doctor.</p>

               <p>six weeks or two months—the water runs out two or three times a week—when I put the arsenic on the potato I covered it well; I took the potato in my hand, cut a slice off, undid the wrapper and put a little on, and then rubbed my hand over it, and shook a little on the potato out of the package—that was in the kitchen—I think I placed three slices of potato, all equally covered—I did not ask the prisoner to bring up the tea on the Saturday morning, I was getting up when he brought it up—my wife was in bed—it was a usual thing for him to bring up a cup of tea on the Sunday without being asked—on the Wednesday he brought it up just before 8.30—I hardly know whether the prisoner can only read imperfectly; it is not for want of going to school—his education is not so good as I should like it—he has his different books at home, the "Leisure Hour" and the "Boys of England," and such books as those—he reads those—he reads them to himself; he has read so seldom in my hearing that I could not say whether he reads well or badly—I know he can read a little—he is not thirteen yet.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon at 23, Essex Street, Isling<lb></lb>ton—on Saturday, 7th December, I was called by Mr. Hoy into his shop—he said something to me, and showed me a cup containing a dirty white substance at the bottom—I did not form an opinion what it was at the moment—I did before I left the shop, from what I saw and from what hestated—he did not show me this drawer—I did not take the cup away with me—about 7 o'clock in the evening when I went home, I found the cup there; I received it from my assistant; it was in the same condition—I afterwards analysed the stuff—there were about three-parts of a teaspoonful; about a drachm; I proved it to be arsenic—if it was taken it would kill a person—it would kill a dozen persons—it is a heavy material, it would sink to the bottom of any liquid that it was put into—I have heard the symptoms described by Mrs. Hoy on the Wednesday; purging and vomiting are the symptoms that would be produced by arsenic—I have heard that it was two hours before she felt unwell—the quantity she then took I should imagine was very slight—this box contains arsenic—it is exactly the colour and appearance of the stuff in the teacup.</p>

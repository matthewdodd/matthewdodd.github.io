He keeps a marine-store shop at the Colonnade, St. Pancras—on the Thursday evening before 7th Aug., I was in the shop and saw the prisoners come down the Colonnade—Squires came into the shop—I was attending to two men, and he said something, but went out with the</p>

On this evening, I was sitting outside my door, and saw both prisoners come down the Colonnade—they stopped and spoke—Squires went into the shop, and afterwards a man with some caps—I saw them come out, and Squires went in again—Lee came and spoke to me, telling me he had not been at work in consequence of headache—I knew them both before—Squires came out, and Lee followed him.</p>

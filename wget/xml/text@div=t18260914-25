            . I am a comb-maker, and live in Shoreditch. I knew Edward Lavey - he was a <rs id="t18260914-25-viclabel137" type="occupation">French polisher</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18260914-25-victim232 t18260914-25-viclabel137"></join>, and about sixteen years old. On Wednesday, the 16th of July, between eight and nine o'clock in the evening, I saw him and Lee in Leonard-square; Sanders and a person named Ghost were there; Lavey struck Lee twice - then Lee struck him; they fought two rounds - the watchman parted them, and they went home; Lavey challenged Lee to fight on Sunday morning - they agreed during the week not to fight, but on Saturday I understood they agreed to fight; they met at Shoreditch church on Sunday morning, about half-past seven; all the prisoners were there, and a quantity of people; they began to fight in a field about eight o'clock, and fought more than an hour, with their fists; there were no regular seconds - several acted as seconds. Lavey had the best of it, but at the close of the fight Lee fell with his elbow on Lavey's throat - it was an accident in the fall- he was taken up by his second, and put on his knee, but he fell senseless; I and two more helped to take him to a doctor, who bled him, and ordered him to the London Hospital - I went to see him there - he died at two o'clock that afternoon. I saw no unfair blows struck; the other prisoners acted as seconds, as well as others on the ground - when one was tired the other helped. I saw Stockweller pick Lee up two or three times; Smith picked Lavey up three or four times; Sewell picked up Lee once or twice; and Sanders picked up Lavey once or twice. There were fifty or one hundred people there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did not the principal object of their interference seem to prevent any unfair blows being struck? A. Yes. Stockweller tore his trousers, and left them after the first three rounds; he sat down on the bank, and did not interfere again; he was not there five minutes; the accident happened at least an hour after - he was ten or twelve yards off - he said nothing, but looked on.</p>

            . I am a pupil at the London Hospital. Lavey was brought there at ten o'clock in the morning, perfectly insensible; he was bruised on his temple, forehead, neck, face, and under the left ear; the bruises appeared to have been produced by blows from a fist; he died about two o'clock that day. I opened him next day, and found a considerable quantity of extravasated blood on the brain, which caused his death; a severe blow or fall was sufficient to occasion it - his stomach and chest were quite perfect.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. If in fighting he used violent exertion himself, and fell from that exertion, might not that have occasioned the extravasation? A. Yes.</p>

               <p>LEE'S Defence.

On Saturday night, as I was coming home, he said he wished to fight on Sunday morning, and in the morning I met him by Shoreditch church, as I had been for some watercresses; he asked if I meant to fight - I said No; he said then he would hit me in the mouth - I did not wish that, and two or three others persuaded me to fight, and I went and fought him in the <placeName id="t18260914-25-crimeloc138">Cat and Mutton fields</placeName>

             to London, with this load of hay. I found him again at the Basing-house, Kingsland-road, with the prisoner - he said that was the man who bought it of him. I asked the prisoner for the money - he said he had not got it, but he would pay me all he had, which was 2 l., and he now owes me 3 l. 16 s. I took the 2 l., and sent for an officer, who took him. I found 1 l. in his left shoe, and 6 d. in his right shoe.</p>

            . I sold the hay to the prisoner. He asked what I wanted for it - I said 5 l. 18 s., and he said it was too much - he came again to say he would give me 5 l. 16 s., which I agreed to, and went with him to unload the hay - we unloaded it, and carried it into the house. I asked him for the money - he said he had not got it all, and asked me to go with him to get the rest of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a stationer, of No. 1, Huggin-lane, Bread-street, Cheapside. On Monday, 26th March, about 11 o'clock in the morning, I had been to King's-cross on business, and was going home—I went to a public house in Southampton-street, Pentonville, and called for a pint of stout—the prisoner was playing at skittles there with another man, not in custody—he is very much altered now—he was dressed like an ostler with kerseymere trowsers, a cap, and lace-up boots—I took my porter at</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185508200011"></xptr>
               <p>the bar, but went to the back of the house, for a necessary purpose, close to the skittle ground—the door was open, and the prisoner, who was in the skittle saloon, said that I was a, d——d shabby humbug, and was afraid to play for a pot of beer—I said that I was not, so long as they played fair—I went in, and played with him for 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and won it—I went on playing with the prisoner for twenty or twenty-five minutes, and lost 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I attempted to go out for a necessary purpose, went to the door by which I had entered the ground, and found it locked and bolted, and the key taken away—before I could ask for an explanation, Jones came and kicked me on the lower part of my person behind, lifted me off my feet, and I fell on my back, and be and the other man rifled my pockets of ten sovereigns, and 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, which were quite safe when I went into the house—I had no com<lb></lb>munication with any other person, and spoke to no one but the landlord—I felt my money safe when I was in the skittle ground—it was loose in my waistcoat pocket; the gold in one pocket, and the silver in the other—my head was cut open—I was rendered insensible, and knew no more till I found myself at home—the name of the house, I believe, is the Robin Hood—I did not touch the ten guineas in the skittle ground; what money I lost 1 took out of my trowsers pocket—I next saw the prisoner on 3rd July, when he came in front of the Eagle Tavern bar, on the night of the occur<lb></lb>rence in the last case—I recognized him immediately, and meant to have secured him, but did not want to lose sight of him by going for a policeman; but I charged him that night, when Mr. Edroff charged him—Pointer was there then.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You are rather an expert skittle player, are you not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I never played but two games in my life before, I played with the prisoner—I have charged parties with robbing me outside before, but not in a skittle ground—I charged a man with robbing me outside a skittle ground, and took him before Mr. Tyrwhitt, at Clerkenwell; the man went with me to buy this gold watch—it was not last month, but this—I was examined on oath before the Magistrate—I was all alone, and had nobody to testify on my behalf—I declared to the Magistrate that the man I charged had robbed me—the man is out on bail—I have got to appear to-day; he was remanded from last Tuesday—the Magistrate did not say that I ought to be indicted for perjury—I was at home the whole of the night before this; not at any public house, nor on that day—I had not been engaged in betting on horse racing or skittles—I very seldom bet—I may have betted once or twice, or three or four times—I had not that morning been in a public house in that neighbourhood, and betted on a game—I played the game; I could not bet—I played for money and for drink—I think I am now certain that the name of the public house was the Robin Hood—the landlord served me, I suppose—I suppose he is one who was in connection with the others—there was nobody in front of or behind the bar, except the landlord—I was before the bar, but nobody else—a passage leads directly from the bar to the skittle ground—I will not say whether the door communicating with it is glazed or not—the door of the skittle ground does not adjoin the passage; you have to go down two or three steps—there is a side door at the end of six or eight yards, then you come to twosteps, and then there is a small room, with the skittle saloon covered over from the sky—I had been playing twenty-five minutes, or it might be half an hour—there were only three of us—the landlord, as I supposed him to be, brought out the beer—we had been playing five or ten</p>

               <p>minutes when he first brought out the drink, and I do not think five or ten minutes elapsed before the act was committed—a second quantity of liquor was brought out, perhaps six or seven minutes after the first—I do not think we had more than two quantities, but we might have had three—each quantity was brought by the same person; he came through the same door on each occasion—I do not think I had ever seen the prisoner before; I will not swear; and I never saw him again till the night when Mr. Edroff's watch was stolen—when Jones kicked me, I called out and made a noise—I only had one kick—I did not submit quietly; I called for assistance—the Robin Hood is in a row of houses in Southampton-street and, I believe, there are yards on each side—my father says that I came home in a cab—I do not know who directed me to be taken home—we have had the landlord of the Robin Hood before a Magistrate since, but he said that he knew nothing about it; he was not the man officiating as landlord when I was robbed—I have made inquiries to find him—the landlord took his oath before the Magistrate that he had kept the house seven years, and knew no such person—I mentioned this robbery to several police officers, who came into my father's shop, but did not give information of it at the station houses in the neighbourhood.</p>

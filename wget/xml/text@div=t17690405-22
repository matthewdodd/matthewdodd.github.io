            . I am a watchman. The prisoner was coming along with a carcase of mutton at Hay-Hill, near Berkeley Square, between eleven and twelve o'clock that night. I asked him what he had got there? To the best of my knowledge I think he said he had got a dead dog. He attempted to go into the buildings where I was at watch, but I would not let him; then he went into Brudenell Muse, just by Berkeley-Square, and hung it up in a stable there. It was a carcase of mutton. He used to lie there. I knew him before. Then I went to my master that employed me, and told him of it. He desired me to take care of it. so that the prisoner did not spoil it. I went and took it, and laid it by. The prisoner was taken the next day by the Muse. He had some bread there, which he sopped in water, and threw it about as if he was mad. I by enquiring found the mutton belonged to Mr. Jolley.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jolley. I had the mutton again. It was my property. We have a particular mark in our business. I knew it well.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence.</p>

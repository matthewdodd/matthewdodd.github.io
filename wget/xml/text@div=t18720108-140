I am one of the house surgeons at the London Hospital—on 10th December, between 12 and 1 a.m., Frederick Errington was brought there, suffering from a lacerated wound of the scalp, at the back of his head—it was not dangerous, but he had lost blood, and was rather faint—he also had a black eye—I do not think he had been drinking.</p>

I am a turner, of 14, Elizabeth Street, Hack<lb></lb>ney—on 9th December, after 11 o'clock, I was in Victoria Park Road—the prisoners came up and asked me to treat them—I at first refused—I afterwards went into the John Cass and had a pint of ale—the prisoners had a glass each and they were put out, I do not know who by—I was not put out—when I went out the prisoners followed me—Low knocked me down—I got up, and then a man came and gave me a blow on the back of my head with a preserver—I fell, and Low put her hand in my pocket and took my purse containing 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—Rogers knelt on my neck—I am sure these are the two women.</p>

I am the wife of this witness - I attend all the marriages in that church - to the best of my recollection, I saw the prisoner married - it is stated in the book that he married Mary Ann Cook - I do not recollect who he married - Mr. Gibbons called on me, and asked if I remembered such a marriage taking place.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did Mr. Gibbons tell you the name of the person whose marriage he wanted to prove? A. Yes; I had not seen either of the parties before - I said at the office, if he were the man, he was very much altered.</p>

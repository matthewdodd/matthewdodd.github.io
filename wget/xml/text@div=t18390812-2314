                  </hi>.(<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant G</hi> 20.) About eleven o'clock in the morning of the 1st of July I was with Hay ward at Battle Bridge—I saw the prisoner with two females—I watched, and saw them go into a public-house, and remain there ten minutes—they came out together, and crossed the road—they stood close together—I saw the prisoner put his hand to his right hand trowsers' pocket, and take a piece of paper out—shortly after heput it in again—I ran across and seized him, and asked what he had got—he gave no answer, but resisted very much—I held his arms—Hayward came up, and put his hand into the prisoner's pocket, and he dropped a piece of paper, and tried to put his foot upon it or on my hand—I succeeded in picking it up, and in doing so six sixpences dropped out of it—I picked up four, and Hay ward picked up the other two—I asked the prisoner what he called that—he said, "What you like"—he was then taken to the station-house—the women who were with him ran through a passage, and escaped.</p>

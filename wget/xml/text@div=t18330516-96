On the morning of the 1st of May, at near two o'clock, I was in <placeName id="t18330516-96-crimeloc497">Oxford-street</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. Were you sober? A. Yes, I had been spending the evening with a friend, and we had been to Bagnigge-wells; I had only one glass of rum and water all the evening - I can't say that I know Blenheim-steps; I left the prisoner two or three times, but she came running after me - I went up to Oxford-street to take a bit of a walk; I went down some mews or stables, but I did not take any liberty with her - I went down to get away from her, I did not promise her five shillings I did not give her the watch.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you mean, upon the solemn oath you have taken, to say, that when you were at the mews, you took no liberty with her? A. Yes, I do; I had no talk about giving her 5s., she asked me to go to a house, but I refused - I had left Bagnigge-wells an hour and a half before I found myself in Oxford-street; I had been walking in some streets, I don't know their names - I had not been into any public-house, nor spoken to any woman that night - I believe I went into two streets with the prisoner.</p>

             (police-constable E 52). The prosecutor called me, and said the prisoner had stolen his watch- I saw her on the opposite side of the way; I followed her to All Soul's Church, I then put my hand on her, and said she had been with some person whom she had robbed of his watch; she gave me this watch, and said it had been given her in the room of five shillings - I took her back and met the prosecutor; I told him he had given it her in the room of five shillings; he said he had not, he appeared sober - I then took the prisoner.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

             thus depos'd, On the 4th of September, going from the City near Chancery-Lane end, I met the Prisoner, and asked him, which was Chancery-Lane? The Prisoner said he would shew me; I wanting to speak with Mr. Hearn, the Prisoner said he would shew me his House too, or bring me to the place where he used; but I found the Prisoner did not know Mr. Hearn's, for he carry'd me above his House a pretty way, however, upon Enquiry, we found Mr. Hearn's , but he was not at Home; afterwards the Prisoner ask'd me to give him a Mug of Ale, I did so, and then the Prisoner press'd me to go to his Lodgings, and he would treat me with a Glass of Wine; upon his being so importunate, I went with him to the One Bell Inn behind the New Church in the Strand, and had half a pint of Wine, but seeing the Prisoner had no Money, I paid for it my self; I had a Box of Lace with me, and the Prisoner followed me Home, was very full of Talk, and invited me to go to his Quarters, and I did go, and then the Prisoner talk'd to me about Sodomitical Practices, and told me of great Persons that us'd that way, and offer'd it to me so far as to undo his Breeches, I told him I would suffer Death before I would admit of any such thing; the Prisoner said I had Gold about me, and if I did not give him my Money, he would swear Sodomy against me; then seiz'd me by the Collar, and told me, 'twas in vain to resist, and took my Money (which was 9 s. 6 d.) from me by Force: I would have given him part, but he would have it all, and made me turn my Pocket; indeed I was so surpriz'd, that I scarce knew what to do, and was glad to get from him on any Terms; I got away, run into a Baker's Shop, and enquir'd for a Constable , and then the Prisoner made off. On the Sunday follo wing the Prisoner came with a pretended Constable to take me up for Sodomy, but his Constable ran away.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner ask'd some trifling Questions, as, who spoke first? whether Mr. Thompson could Read or Write? because he shew'd him his Directions where to find Mr. Hearn's which being imperfect, Mr. Thompson said was the Reason of his shewing it, not that he could not read it himself; then the Prisoner desir'd to know, if the Prosecutor ever came to him from Thursday to Saturday? Mr. Thompson said, No; because he was so hurry'd in Business that he had not time.</p>

             thus depos'd, I fell Apples at the Door where Mr. Thompson came in, and the Prisoner follow'd him; Mr. Thompson was very much surpriz'd, and said, he was dogg'd by the Prisoner, and wanted a Constable - A Constable, said the Prisoner, and lift up his Hand, and would have struck Mr. Thompson, but he avoided the Blow; then the Prisoner ran away, and Mr. Thompson ask'd for a person to Aid him Home; he said the Prisoner had Robb'd him already, and he did not know what further Designs he had.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Ray depos'd, That she saw Mr. Thompson come in very much affrighted, and that he said a sorry Fellow had dogg'd him from the One Bell Inn in the Strand.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and am a boot and shoemaker, and live in the Kingsland-road. About two o'clock in the afternoon of the 15th of Oct. I saw Cole, and another man, shorter than West—the shorter one asked for some morning slippers—I showed them about two dozen—Cole was standing by the counter, by the side of the other one—they did not purchase any slippers—they asked for different sorts of slippers—they turned round after a short time, and went out—after they were gone Westbury came and gave me some information—I then looked in my shop window, and missed a pair of Blucher boots—I turned round after the officer had gone out, and saw a pair lying on the floor—they had been in the window—my daughter missed another pair—I know these boots to be mine—they are the boots I picked up from the floor.</p>

On Tuesday, the 16th of Oct., Cole and another man came into my mother's shop—they asked to look at some slippers—my mo<lb></lb>ther showed them some—they did not buy any slippers—they turned about, and walked out—after the policeman came in, I missed two pairs of Bluchers out of the window—I had seen them in the window the day before.</p>

Between two and three o'clock in the morning of the 16th of Oct., I was in the Kingsland-road—I saw the two prisoners in company with another—I am sure it was the prisoners—I knew them well—I followed them to the shop of the prosecutrix, and they all three stopped and looked in at the window—Cole and the third one went in—West walked backwards and forwards in front of the shop—he then went to the corner of Union-street, where he had a full view of the shop—I went into a confectioner's shop, opposite, and saw Cole and the other in the shop—they seemed to be looking at slippers—the prosecutrix seemed to be in the other part of the shop—I saw Cole take a pair of Blucher<lb></lb>boots out of the</p>

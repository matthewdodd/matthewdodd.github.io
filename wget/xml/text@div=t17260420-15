             thus depos'd. On the 11th of this Month about 10 at Night, the Prisoner came to my Shop in New Row, Tuthill-Fields. I have known him above these 10 Years; he call'd for a Dram and begun to tell me of the Fire that had happen'd at Ratcliff; I said I was sorry for it, but he said he was glad. I asked him why, and he answer'd, because he had found 2 silver Mugs, which he then produced, and desir'd me to weigh them, for he intended to sell them next Day. I told him he ought to carry them to the right Owner, whose Name and Place of abode were engrav'd upon them, but he would by no Means agree to it. He told me that he intended to lodge at his Brother's that Night. I thought that he had stolen the Mugs, but did not let him perceive my Suspicion, because I intended to apprehend him. Last January was a 1 s. Month, Mr. Topping's House was broke open; he suspected the Prisoner and desir'd me to give him notice whenever I met with him, which I now did. John Topping thus depos'd.

I found my Shop-Door and Window both open, and my Cheese, Bacon, Eggs, Candles, 2 Razors, 2 Flasks of Liquors, and several other Goods were taken away. - The Prisoner came into my Shop the same Morning, and call'd for a Dram. - I told him what had happen'd. Ha! Ye old Son of a Bitch, says he, did not I tell ye that your House would be broke open at that Window. - My Wife going out at our back Door, she found some Tallow sticking to the Stile that led into Gore-lane. She Suppos'd that the Candles were broke there in getting over. - She told me of it, I went over there to the Prisoner's House and found more Tallow Sticking upon his Door. - I asked him how the Tallow came there, he swore he could not tell. I then took more Notice of him, and saw that his Hat was greasy and that Eggs had been broke in his Pocket and run thro'. I examin'd him strictly, and at last he confess'd, and gave back most of my Goods. He said he broke open the Window and to go into the Shop. He beg'd me not to prosecute him, and promis'd to make it up, - But he went away, and I heard no more of him till after he has stole the Mugs and then he offer'd to give me them to let him go again. <rs id="t17260420-15-verdict75" type="verdictDescription">

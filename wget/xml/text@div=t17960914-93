            , in Sloane-street; I did not know any thing of the robbery; on the 1st of July, I lost the things mentioned in the indictment, (repeating them;) when the prisoner was taken, he said, he was in bed at the time the robbery was done.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You were not present at the time of the robbery? - A. No; I was at Bow church.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a person of the name of Rayson? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. They live next door to you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you can hear extremely well in your house, what passes in the other? - A. No; I don't think it can be possible, without any body was to call very loud.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you see Mr. Rayson after your wife had told you of this robbery? - A. I don't know that I saw him till after I came from Bow-church.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether you did not desire Rayson to swear Flaxman was like the man that committed the robbery, that he should be put on the back of the bill, and have a part of the reward-remember I shall call him? - A. No, I deny any thing like it.</p>
               <p>Q. This happened in the course of Friday the 1st of July? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go on the Friday evening to Mrs. Norman's, a public-house, near the prisoner's house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. With your wife? - A. Yes; the prisoner followed us in there; he stood at his own door when my wife and I went in.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it? - A. The Star and Garter in Sloane-street.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is that from the prisoner's door? - A. There is only one house, I believe, parts it, one or two houses, not more.</p>
               <p>Q. When you and your wife went in, the prisoner followed you in? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179609140121"></xptr>Q. Did your wife or yourself at all tell him the story of the robbery? - A. The prisoner himself asked us of our assair, and how we got on, whether we had heard any thing of our loss, or something similar to that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you or your wife repeat to him an account of your loss, and how it happened? - A. I don't recollect that; he said it was a shocking thing for my wife, and asked her how she was after the fright; the was the first thing almost, he called her by her name, as if he had known her ever so long.</p>
               <p>Q. It had been talked of in the neighbourhood? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you and your wife take him that evening? - A. No; not till the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not mention any suspicion of him that evening? - A. Not till after I came back from the public-house; I think I told Mr. Rayson we had seen the man that had robbed us, that we certainly did tell him.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, as the prisoner lived so near to this public-house, what kind of a house did he keep? - A. He kept a chandler's-shop.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you take him up upon this charge? - A. About half past four o'clock, I believe, in the afternoon, the next day, Saturday; I went in the morning to Mr. Bond's, at eleven o'clock, for his advice.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search his house? - A. The officer searched part of his house.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you, from that hour to this, found any thing that was taken away at that time? - A. No, not a farthing; or any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. He told you, when he was taken, that he was in bed at the time the robbery was committed? - A. Yes; he seemed to be in a great tremor, as any man might be upon such a charge, whether he was guilty or innocent; he was taking some money, and he threw it down with great violence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not say, what do you mean by that, Mr. Taylor, do you mean to assert it was I that robbed you? - A. I cannot say; it might be something of that kind.</p>
               <p>Q. And he told you he was in bed at the time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at all say any thing to Rayson to persuade him to swear that he was like the man? - A. I will tell you what I did say; the next day, Rayson said, your wife gave me every description of the man before I ever saw him; I said very likely, Mr. Rayson, if you can say that, it may be of service if you will go; and he said, I should not like to have any thing to do with it, because of my work, unless you subpoena me, and then I will come.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say nothing of this kind: I will pay you for your trouble; you shall be put upon the back of the bill, and you shall have thirty pounds for your trouble? - A. Nothing like it; I call God to witness, I told him I would not take him out of his business unless it was necessary.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never say to Rayson, that you would have your name put upon the back of the bill, and that you should have a reward of forty pounds, or something of that kind? - A. No; I said, if there was any reward, or any thing of that sort, so as to help my loss, that I had as much right to it as any other man.</p>

             came from behind my chamber-door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before? - A. I never saw him before with my eyes; I had left the door on the latch, not locked; I found it latched in the same condition as when I left it; when he came from behind the door he presented a pistol at my head, and asked me if I knew him? I told him no; he blasted my eyes, and told me if he thought I knew him he would blow my brains out; then he went to the drawers in my presence, and took out a pair of sheets, a cotton gown, and a green silk petticoat, and a white petticoat; he asked me for the key of my husband's box, I told him I had not got it; which supposing I had got it, he kicked me on the knee; then he took an iron out of his pocket and wrenched this box open; but mean while that he was wrenching it open, he asked me if I had got any money; I told him no, and asked him where he thought poor people, like us, could get money; with that he broke the box open, and the first thing that laid was half a guinea and two half crown pieces on the life of Christ; the next thing he took out was the book; the next thing was some coats and waistcoats; they were taken out, though they were not taken away, and a large damask table-cloth; the next thing was half a dozen of silver tea-spoons, and a large table-spoon, and a box of different kinds of coin, which contained a King William and Queen Mary's half crown, two new shillings and a sixpence, a silver three-pence, a silver thimble with a steel top, and a gold sleeve button, and a pair of silver clasps.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to stand by? - A. Because I was in danger of my life.</p>

               <p>Q. Could you see his countenance all that time? - A. Yes; I looked at him, and saw him as plain as I see your face; I can positively swear that the prisoner is the man; he took out a silk purse, containing twelve guineas; when he took out the purse he struck me twice on the head, and told me that was for the lies I had told him; I don't know what became of him after that.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. I suppose you had the misfortune, upon this occasion, to lose all the money you had in the house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. All the gold certainly? - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no more gold that day, nor for some time? - A. Yes; I had for some time.</p>
               <p>Q. But no more gold all that day? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. That you are sure of? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any gold the day after? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This happened about what time? - A. Between the hours of eleven and twelve; it might be twenty minutes to twelve, of thereabouts, I cannot say for a minute or two, it is so long ago.</p>

               <p>Q. But the man was taken up the next day, you could recollect the time then? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Mr. and Mrs. Rayson? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This man struck you twice? - A. Yes; two blows on the knee, and kicked me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this chamber where you were robbed in the front or back part of your house? - A. There are only two rooms in the house, one below and the other above.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your window open? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Recollect? - A. I cannot; it was open after the robbery was done.</p>
               <p>Q. Who opened it after the robbery was done? - A. He might open it; I can't say.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not know whether it was open at the time of the robbery or not? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after this was it that you told your loss to Mrs. Rayson? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you wait an hour before you made any alarm? - A. I could not till I became sensible.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you suppose you remained insensible above an hour? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure this is the man? - A. Yes; I am positive of it.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not alarmed? - A. Certainly I was.</p>
               <p>Q. But you kept looking at him all the time? - A. When I was in danger of my life, I had an undoubted right to look at him; I looked at him all the time he was in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted, you have described him to Mrs. Rayson? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I shall call Mrs. Rayson, and therefore beg you will attend to what I say: Upon your oath, did you not say the man was pitted with the small pox? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You will swear that? - A. Yes; that I will.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any alarm at all, cry out thieves, or any thing of that sort? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether there was a man in your back garden or not? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Mrs. Rayson was hanging out her linen, when you found her by your door? - A. She was out of doors when I called to her.</p>

               <p>Q. What kind of man is he? - A. He does not at all answer the description of this prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Now upon your oath, did you not tell Mrs. Rayson, at the very instant when you acquainted her with it, that he was as like Gill, the soldier, as ever he could stare? - A. Begging your pardon, I did not; I told her this man Flaxman had got on long whiskers like him, but not his face like him; how could he be like him; when his face is not like him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say to Mrs. Rayson, if it was not Gill, it was certainly somebody employed by him? - A. I certainly did not say so, I will be upon my oath.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Mrs. Rayson tell you that she thought Gill, the soldier, had been gone away? - A. I don't recollect such a thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Now did not you tell her something of this sort-Why, no, he is not gone away, a nasty fellow, he followed me from the College along the lane last Monday, and said he wanted to speak to me? - A. No; this soldier was lame in the hospital, and be used to look out at the window to Mrs. Rayson and I; and ask us what was o'clock; this man was out of the hospital one day, and spoke to her as well as to me; I was coming along from the brew-house with a barrow of grains; and he said Mrs. Taylor, I have not seen you a long while; and that was all that passed. I did not say a nasty fellow; he only followed me and said, Mrs. Taylor I have not seen you along while.</p>
               <p>Q. You told Mrs. Rayson that? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And that white you were talking about the robbery? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How came Gill's name brought up about the robbery? - A. Because there had been so many false reports about this man Gill.</p>
               <p>Q. What reports? - A. Don't you disturb me too much; speak in a proper manner; if you are a gentleman, behave like a gentleman.</p>
               <p>Court. Keep your temper, woman, and I will take care no improper question shall be put.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any false reports about Gill, at the time of the robbery? - A. No.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179609140123"></xptr>Q. How came you to talk about Gill then? - A. We were coming from Bow-street on the Friday night.</p>
               <p>Q. But I am speaking of the Friday morning soon after the robbery? - A. I could not tell her about the robbery before it was done; it was not done the Friday morning.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you tell Mrs. Rayson that before or after you told her of the robbery? - A. It was after that; I never mentioned his name till night.</p>
               <p>Q. Besides Mrs. Rayson being here, there were some people about, I believe, in the fields? - A. Yes; two men.</p>
               <p>Q. And you gave no alarm to them? - A. I did not know they were there till she told me.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe, on the Friday evening, you went to Mrs. Norman's, the public house? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. What time in the evening? - A. Between ten and eleven, it must be, or thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Q. That is within two doors, I believe, of the prisoner's house? - A. I believe it is.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him there on the Friday evening? - A. He followed me in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pitch upon him then as the man? - A. Yes; I did.</p>
               <p>Q. To whom did you say he was the man then? - A. I told my husband he was the man, when he came out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell any body else he was the man? - A. Not that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he sit long in conversation with you? - A. No great while.</p>
               <p>Q. How long do you think? - A. It might be ten minutes or so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you talk about the robbery at all? - A. Yes; he asked me about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ask you if you suspected any body? - A. I told him, yes; he asked if I could swear to the man; and I told him, yes, among a thousand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go away first, or he? - A. He went first.</p>
               <p>Q. How long? - A. No great while; we were not long in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps there was not above a minute difference between his going and your's? - A. I cannot say exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew where he lived then? - A. No; I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. As he went away before you, had you the curiosity to ask any body in the house where' he lived? - A. No; I did not ask any one foul.</p>
               <p>Q. And you had at that time made up your mind that he was the man? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>I am an officer belonging to Bow-street, I assisted in apprehending the prisoner in his shop, we found nothing.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Taylor. These two runners came to take<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179609140124"></xptr>this man, they are father and son; they went into the shop, we told them to do justice, and they went to his shop under pretence of buying some tobacco, he weighed it, and they took him; I told them he was the man, and they searched his kitchen and and shop, and the little back yard, and the place backwards; I asked them if we were not to go up stairs, they said, no, the warrant was only to search his apartments; as to what Mrs. Rayson has said, it is as false as God is true.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, that this woman has been robbed and cruelly treated, I have no doubt at all; and that she thinks she is swearing true, I verily believe; but you see she stands as a witness who was very much alarmed, and who, therefore, may be subject to error and mistake; every thing, you see, depends upon her testimony here, she is the only witness who identifies the man, there is not a single circumstance to affect him besides, on the contrary, the man, the very evening of the robbery, goes into the house of Mrs. Norman, where this woman is, talks to that very woman who had been so very ill-treated by him, and only mentions her suspicion to her husband after she got out of the house; and she is contradicted by Mrs. Rayson, as to this Gill the soldier, and by the conduct of the man, who must have been the most audacious villain upon earth, to thrust himself in up on her company in the most unconcerned way, and kept his conversation, and this very man stands his ground, and when the Bow-street officers go to take him, makes no attempt to escape; and, therefore, unless you have any doubts, I don't think it necessary to call upon the man for his defence, and, in case of real doubt, a Jury always inclines to the side of mercy.(The Jury consulted, and expressed a wish that the trial might go on).</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. (To Mrs. Rayson.) Q. You say, this woman told you he was as like Gill, the soldier, as ever he could stare; and that was before you went up stairs to see the condition in which the house was? - A. Yes</p>
               <p>Q. Did she ever describe the person of the man who had robbed her, any farther, by any marks of the face? - A. She said, he was of a yellow complexion, that he had a very short, black, stubby beard, long whiskers, and that his hair was cut short.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she describe whether the man was marked with the small-pox? - A. I don't recollect that she did.</p>
               <p>Q. From the view you had of the house, do you think any man could have gone in and out of that house without your perceiving him, between twelve and one that day? - A. Not forwards, for we were at dinner, and the door was open all the time.</p>
               <p>Q. You think you must have seen him if he had? - A. Yes, I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>Q. You say she said, if it was not Gill it was some body he employed? - A. I said to Mrs. Taylor, I thought he was gone; he had been in the York hospital, but I thought he was gone; the window of the hospital looks into our yard; Mrs. Taylor made answer and said, no, he is not gone, a nasty fellow; the last time I went to the brew-house, he followed me from the College up into our lane; she said, he was determined to make her speak to him; she said, she was not ashamed to speak to him in the hospital, but in the street the did not like to speak to a soldier.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the person of Gill at all like the person of Flaxman? - A. No; he is a fatter man than the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he wear his hair cut in that way? - A. I cannot say justly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever use to be out of soldier's cloaths? - A. I never saw him out of soldier's cloaths; but I did hear that he had bought coloured cloaths with some money that he had got.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Is he at all like that man? - A. I cannot say; there were some men at work in a field behind the house.</p>
               <p>Court. If the Jury are not satisfied, I will call upon the man for his defence; but this woman was in a fright, and there is no one circumstance to affect him except that of her single testimony, contradicted as it has been by this woman, who you observe is also a witness for the Crown.</p>
               <p>Jury. (To Mrs. Rayson.) Q. Did you ever know the prisoner before this time? - A. I never saw him that I know of till I saw him at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Jury. My Lord, the gentlemen leem to be in doubt, and wish to go on with the trial.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>

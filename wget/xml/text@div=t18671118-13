               <p>up Oxendon Street into Orange Street, when he gave me three shillings, and I gave him sixpence change—I did not look at the three shillings till he was going away, and then found they were bad—I told him so, and he said that he had not got such money on him, and that they were not bad—he went away, and I hallooed, "Stop thief!"—I saw him stopped—he was searched at the station—I gave the bad money to the policeman.</p>

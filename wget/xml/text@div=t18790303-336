She did not say anything to me before she went through the door. The mistress came rushing out and tried to detain me at the door, when the man who was in the shop with me rushed out. I tried to follow him, and pushed up against the mistress accidentally. The cabs being so thick outside the door, I lost sight of the man that had given me the half-crown.

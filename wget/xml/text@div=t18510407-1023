On 25th March the prisoner came to my shop, about three o'clock, for some butter—I served her—she paid with a shilling, which I found was counterfeit—I asked her if she knew it was bad—she said she did not—I asked her who gave it her—she said a gentlemen—I asked where he was—she said she did not know—I said I was afraid she was a <hi rend="italic">smasher</hi>—she said she was not, the gentleman had given her the shilling, promising to meet her again—I gave her in charge, marked the shilling, and gave it the officer—this is it—I was examined at the police-court; the prisoner was remanded tail Saturday.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see O'Donnell and Gore there on the 29th of 
               <persName id="t18060917-69-person648">August. </persName>
            - A. Yes, Gore I had seen two or three times in the day.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time of the day had you seen Gore first. - A. To the best of my recollection he was there about ten o'clock in the morning, he came again in the afternoon, but I cannot tell what time; Cuddiford was with him in the morning and in the afternoon. In the evening I saw Gore and O'Donnell there about nine o'clock, when O'Donnell came down Gore was there.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the room did they sit in. - A. Sometimes they sat in the parlour, and sometimes in the tap room, they were drinking together.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Cuddiford there. - A. He was drinking with them.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180609170049"></xptr>Q. Where were they drinking together. - A. In the tap room.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of the three, or all of them of these names you have mentioned, were in the parlour, was O'Donnell in the parlour. - A. He did go in, he came out directly; Gore went in the parlour, and Cuddiford was in and out of the parlour.</p>
               <p>Court. And Gore the same. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. Did you or did you not see the other prisoner Carter there. - A. No, I did not, I did not know him, he might be there for any thing I know.</p>
               <p>Q. You in point of fact did not see him there. A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing particular in the conduct of O'Donnell, if there was describe it. - A. When he came down stairs he came singing, laughing, and dancing.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Gore at that time. - A. Gore was sitting there to the best of my recollection, he was sitting on a chair by the door way.</p>
               <p>Q. You have told us there was a door that led from the parlour into the bed room. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you fasten that door, and at what time. - A. I fastened it when Mr. Kendall went to lie down about four o'clock to rest himself; about six o'clock in the afternoon I locked the door again myself, I am sure I left it fastened, I put my hand against it and tried it, I hung the key up in the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you retire to rest that night. - A. About ten minutes after eleven; I took the key out of the bar, and went to unlock the bed room door, as there was no latch to the door, I found the door open.</p>
               <p>Q. It was in a different state to what you had left it at a quarter after six o'clock. - A. Yes, I went to the bureau, I found it had been forced open.</p>
               <p>One of the jury. When you first looked at the lock of the bureau was it sticking up. - A. The bolt was shut as if it was locked.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. How was the shot of the lock. - A. It was completely up; I opened the little drawers where the notes were, I found they were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is Cuddiford. - A. I had seen him frequently at the house ever since Mr. Kendall has been there.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Cuddiford a person that Mr. Kendall ever employed. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you cannot of your own knowledge tell me how Cuddiford was employed in the day. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp.</p>
               <p>Q. I understand you to say, that the last time you saw the notes was at six o'clock in the morning, that was quite daylight. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.O'Donnell was not in the house till the evening of that day. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Cuddiford was there the greatest part of the day, going backwards and forwards from the tap to the parlour frequently. - A. Yes, he had been used to the house a great length of time before we came there.</p>
               <p>Q. So that he knew every room in the house, and every place there. - A. I do not know that.</p>
               <p>Q. I mean as far as from the parlour to the tap room and the bed room. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He knew the house better than these persons that were dancing and drinking there. - A. It was the first time that I saw O'Donnell there myself.</p>
               <p>Q. And this honest Mr. Cuddiford, that had known the house a great while, he was there a great while in the day time, and O'Donnell was not there till the evening. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw your notes after six o'clock in the morning, Cuddiford was there a great many times in the course of the day, and he was in the bar. - A. I did not see him in the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. He had an opportunity of doing it if he had seen fit. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.O'Donnell came in the evening, might not the notes have been lost in the morning while Mr. Cuddiford was going backwards and forwards, as well as in the evening. - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore for any thing you know they might have been lost in the morning when any body was going backwards and forwards, as well as in the evening. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore O'Donnell not being there till the evening, the notes might be taken away in the morning by any body so disposed so to do, for any thing you know. - A. Yes, but I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Cuddiford you say you do not know a great deal of. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any good of him, I am speaking in plain English; do not you know of your own knowledge that he is as big a thief as there is in London at this time. - A. I cannot say that, his character is quite a stranger to me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. How long have you lived there. - A. About three months, to the best of my recollection.</p>
               <p>Q. How many rooms are there. - A. A tap room, bar, small parlour, and a bed room.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Only one bed room. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Gore is the son of a respectable baker in Bond street. - A. He is for any thing that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not know perfectly well that he is the son of a respectable baker. - A. I am told so.</p>
               <p>Q. You said that before this robbery took place he frequented your house for refreshment as workmen do who frequent your house, as he lived with his father as you knew before. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You described some extraordinary singing and dancing in your cellar, did that never happen before. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.

               <p>Q. Tell me, did any thing pass between Gore and you, and what. - A. He asked me if I would go along with him, I told him I would; as we were walking along I told him that there was some money that I thought we might get at; he asked me if I thought so, I told him I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give him any reason why you thought so. - A. The people that lived there before Kendall, I had seen them pass in and out to get change there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell Gore that. - A. No, he said if I thought so we would try, he thought, it would be a good thing for us if we could get it; he asked me if he should see me ormeet me the next morning, which day was the 29th of August; he came in the morning, he asked me if I thought any thing more of what we were speaking of yesterday, I told him yes, I thought there was money in the bureau which stood in the bed room, and the key hung up in the bar; he went away and said he would soon come back, he came back about noon and asked for something to drink at the cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. Where you down in the cellar when he came down. - A. I was, he had something to drink, we had some gin and bitters, and so had Kendall and his wife (she went by the name of Mrs. Kendall); soon after that he asked me for the key of the bed room, I unhooked it and gave it him.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the key hanging at that time. - A. Inside of the bar, he took the key, he went towards the door, and he brought me back the key again, I hung the key up where I took it from; he was absent with the key about half a minute; after he gave me the key, and I hung it up, he said the door was open and he said he thought he could do it, he went in, and tried to open the bureau; I heard him say that he had broke the top of the scissars in the lock, and that he could not open it, he brought out a cloak or a black silk handkerchief, I did not know which.</p>
               <p>Q. What was done with that. - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it left with you. - A. No, it was never in my hands.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing further pass between you and Gore at that time. - A. Nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see Gore again. - A. He came down to me at the top of the stairs in the evening, and said that he would go and look for John O'Donnell, I think it was between seven and eight o'clock then; he went away, and I went into Tottenham Court Road with a trunk; when I came back I went down into the cellar to get something to eat.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were down first in the cellar, at what time did you first see Gore. - A. I think it must be nine or between nine and ten, he came down just before the other men.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at that time know the persons of the other men. - A. A very slight acquaintance, I never saw but one of them before in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. After Gore came down how soon did you see the other prisoner's. - A. They came down directly.</p>
               <p>Q. That is Carter and O'Donnell. - A. Yes, Sam Carter came down very quick, he went towards the bed raom, and John O'Donnell, he began to jump about the place, and kick up a noise, he sang a song, and broke a pipe, I joined with him and many more at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Carter in the tap room. - A. No, he was in the bed room; I believe Gore was in the door way, between the tap room and the bed room.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might this continue. - A. It might be ten minutes or more.</p>
               <p>Q. Gore, you said, stood in the door way between the tap room and the bed room, how long was he gone. - A. He was gone for more than ten minutes.</p>

               <p>Q. Who did you meet in Carnaby-street. - A. Sam Carter and John O'Donnell; when Gore and I met them there, I heard John O'Donnell say that he would go and try to change the twenty pound note, he went away by himself, he was gone for some minutes, he came back and said he could not change it; we went from there and called at a public house, going along there, we had a pot of porter, some we drank and some we left, after that we went to St. Martin's-street, to a public house there, the sign of the Horse and Dolphin, we all four together went into a room there, called the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you have any thing there, - A. Yes, three bottles of wine.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect who brought you the wine. - A. I cannot positively say, but I believe it was the landlord, we went from that room into the taproom, and called there for a pot of porter, where they put me down seven guineas in way of share.</p>
               <p>Q. Who put you down the seven guineas. - A. I cannot say whether it was Sam Carter or John O'Donnell. I put it into my pocket.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know what the landlord brought by way of change. - A. I believe part of it was gold, but I cannot say it all was gold. I believe Sam Carter gave the ten pound note to John O'Donnell, and John O'Donnell gave it to the landlord</p>

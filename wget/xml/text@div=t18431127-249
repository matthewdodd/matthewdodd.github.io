                  </hi>. I am a ginger-beer manufacturer, in Gate-street, coln's-Inn-Fields. The prisoner has been in my business ever since I took it till last Sept.—it was his duty to take oat goods and receive money for me—he ought to pay me when he returned in the evening—on the 19th of April he paid me 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for Mr. Gillam—I furnished him with a book, which he takes with him—there is an entry of 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. as received from Mr. Gillam—he never paid me 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. more—on the 13th of June he did not pay me any money</p>

               <p>for Mr. Cooper—there is nothing of that in his book—on the 17th of July, he accounted to me for 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. received from Mr. Cooper, and 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is inserted in his book, and 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I have a great variety of small payments.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a fruiterer, in Tothill-street. The prisoner came to my shop on 10th Jan. at nearly 11 o'clock at night, for change for half a crown—I told him I had no change—he turned back, and said he would buy an orange if I would give him change—I was looking out the change—I put down two shillings on the counter—he took them up, threw down a bad half crown, and ran out of the shop—he only took the two shillings; I had not given him the rest of the change—I ran after him, and caught him in Dacre-street, under an archway—the policeman followed me—I took him by the collar, and said, "You have got my two good shillings, here is your bad half-crown"—he said at first he was not the same person—I said, "I know you are;" and I gave him into custody—he then said, "Don't lock me up, I will give you your two shillings," or some<lb></lb>thing of that sort—I kept the bad half crown in my hand till I got to the station, and marked it, and gave it to the policeman—I am perfectly certain the prisoner is the man.</p>

On Tuesday night, 10th Jan., I saw the prisoner running in Dacre-street—the last witness was following him—when he was stopped, I went up, and he was given into my custody—the witness said he had been in his shop, and passed a bad half crown, and run away with two shillings and an orange—the prisoner said he would give him the two shillings if he would let him go, and give him the half crown back—I took him to the station, and found on him one shilling in silver, and 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper, all good—this is the half crown (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

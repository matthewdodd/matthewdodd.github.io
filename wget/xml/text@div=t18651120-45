I reside, at 36, Dean-street, Soho—a person who is now dead of the name of Gustaldi lodged at my house in the name of Dubois—I afterwards saw him in custody at the Marylebone Police-court on this charge—his room was the second floor back—he lodged there from June until the time he was taken into custody—I know nothing about the prisoner—Sergeant Cole came to my house on Monday, 16th October, and my sister showed him the room in which Gustaldi had been living—I was not there at the moment he found something.</p>

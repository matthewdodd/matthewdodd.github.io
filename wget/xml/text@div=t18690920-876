I live with my father and mother, at 82, Trafalgar Road, Old Kent Road—on Monday, 9th August, a little before 3 o'clock, I was in the second floor front bedroom, when I heard the footsteps of a man on the stairs, and shortly afterwards my mother screamed—she was in a bedroom on the first floor, which was unusally occupied by my mother—I was going down to ascertain what was the matter, and when I got on to the landing, I saw the prisoner standing at the door of the bedroom, with the handle in his hand—he put his foot on one of the stairs leading to where I was, when he looked up at me, and immediately went down stairs again—I am sure the prisoner is the man—I was partly undressed, but finished dressing, and then went down stairs to where my mother was—I saw her on the top of the stairs, on the first floor, bleeding very much from the head—I gave a descrip<lb></lb>tion of the prisoner to the police, and on 16th August, I was sent for to Carter Street police-station—I there saw fourteen men, and picked out the prisoner from amongst them—I recognized him as soon as I set my eyes upon him—the kitchen door had been broken open, and the prisoner got into</p>

I am the wife of James Peake, and live at 82, Tra<lb></lb>fulgar Road, Old Kent Road—on the afternoon of 9th August, between 2 and 3 o'clock, I went into my son's bed-room to lie down, and whilst I was there, two men came into the room—I said, "What is it you want?" and finding no answer, I got off the bed at once, and said, "Are you come to rob the house?"—no answer was given, and I repeated the question, when the prisoner sprang towards me, with what I supposed was a hammer, and struck me a blow on the right side of the forehead—I put my hands before my face, and said, "Don't murder me! don't murder me!"—the prisoner then jumped at me like a madman, opened his mouth, groaned with passion, and gave me a second blow—I knew nothing more, and did not hear the man go down stairs—I became insensible—the other man was of fair complexion—my daughter came down stairs, the doctor was sent for and information was given to the police—since then I have been unable to leave the house, and am still very weak—on the 27th August, I went to the Lambeth police-station, and picked out the prisoner from amongst a number of other men.</p>

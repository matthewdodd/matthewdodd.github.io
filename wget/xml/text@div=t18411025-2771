               <p>forced—I opened it with a key—I did not perceive the lock till I missed the money—I suspected the prisoner, and gave information at the police-station that evening—he had not slept in the house from the Wednesday evening previous—I did not know where he was—there were five other lodgers, I believe, and they all remained and slept in the house—I believe they were all in the house at the time I missed my money—on the Satur<lb></lb>day morning I traced the prisoner to Cameron's house, in Camomile-street, Bishopsgate, and saw him there some where about eleven o'clock—the po<lb></lb>lice were with me—the first question I asked was, "Where is my money?"—he said, "If you will go over the water with me to-night, it will be all right"—I gave him in charge of the policeman—that is all that passed that I can recollect—I got excited on seeing the prisoner, and cannot recollect exactly what passed till I gave him in charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I have known the prisoner for thirty years—he came to my, house on the last Wednesday evening in September, and said he had had some words with his wife, or housekeeper, or whatever it may be termed, for I did not know he was married—he said he had left home, and would not go back again for some time; that be had saved a bit of money from his own hard earnings; that he would go home and see his friends, and if it did not suit, he would come back again to London—his friends live at Glasgow—he did not tell me then what he had saved, but he had told me several times, eight months previous, that he had saved money unknown to any body—he staid at my house from Wednesday till Saturday morning, when he was taken out of my house, about ten or eleven o'clock, by the police and the prosecutor—they took him up stairs into a top room, and examined him, but not in my presence.</p>

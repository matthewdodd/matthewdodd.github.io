This gentleman went and searched my house where I live, he found no bad money there; in the course of the day I had sold several articles out of my shop, such as rags and bones that I had there; as to the money being bad I did not know it, and the way I had so much small change in my pocket, I was always in want of it in such a business in regard of buying rags and bones.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Little Chesterfield-street, Marylebone. The house belongs to my aunt—the prisoner slept in the same room with me—I am a tailor—on the 21st of August last, I left a waistcoat at the corner of my bed—the prisoner was in the room when I left—I missed it next day—he did not return to the lodging—I went in search of him, and found him on the 24th in Grotto-passage—at first he said he had not seen it—he then said he had taken it, and if the Lord would spare his life he would bring it back next day, about ten o'clock, but he never came, and I could not find him till the latter end of September, when I asked where he had been all that time—he said he did not know, and I gave him in charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and keep the house in Little Chester-field-street. The prisoner lodged with me about three weeks—on the morning in question I went in to ask if he would have any tea and he was doubling the waistcoat up—I thought he might have bought it of the pro<lb></lb>secutor, and said nothing—I was called away to serve a customer—he passed me at the time, and went out—I met him a few days after in Grotto-passage, and asked him where the waistcoat was—he said, "What waistcoat?"—I said, "The waistcoat you took out of the bed-room"—he said "Go with me, I will tell you all about it"—he said he had left it somewhere for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and if the Lord would spare him he would bring it back next day by eleven o'clock, but he did not.</p>

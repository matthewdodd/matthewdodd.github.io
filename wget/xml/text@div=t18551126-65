               <p>not here—after the evidence was given, the Court directed a prosecution which stamped it on my memory—it is an unusual thing for evidence to character to be rebutted by subsequent evidence—during a trial I have other matters to attend to—my attention is distracted—I did not look at the notes to refresh my memory, but to make a copy of them—I have a distinct recollection of hearing Watts state that Webb said that he was married—I believe most distinctly that I recollect hearing him say that he saw the sergeant give him the shilling.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">THOMAS UPTON</hi>. I live in Golden-square. I carry on the business of a coal-merchant and am in partnership with Mr. Joseph Parker—the prisoner has been our clerk since the 11th of May last—I have an establishment in Marsham-street, which the prisoner used to attend to principally—I have my books here—the prisoner retailed coals there, and what monies he received there he was to account to me for—he was in the habit of receiving money for orders—he was to account to me for them immediately—I did not receive 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from him on the 14th of oct.—I find the name of Lufkin entered in the day-book which was kept at the warehouse by the prisoner—it is entered here two tons of coals sent to Mr. Lufkin's but it makes him a debtor for them to our firm—on the 2nd of Jan. here is an entry of one ton of coals to Mr. Jenkin—here is no entry of its being paid—it makes him a debtor to the amount of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="largeCaps">MR. DOANE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> That was the balance he ought to have had in hand? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes.—this matter came to my knowledge by my sending the bill to Mr. Lufkin, and he showed me the prisoner's receipt—I told the prisoner that—he did not look at the nor did I—it was the prisoner's duty to pay it to me—there are entries of all sums paid by him to me, but he has made these parties debtors to us—by looking at the books I can tell whether any man has paid us—I had looked at them or I should not have sent the bill in—the prisoners acknowledged he had received it—it was on a Saturday that I told him about Mr. Lufkin's case—I had not a knowledge of the other at the time—I did not sy I should insist on his paying the money—I said, "I am exces<lb></lb>sively annoyed at this, I am very sorry you have placed yourself in this position"—he did not offer to pay me—he said he was very sorry for it, and he would get the money some how or other—I did not tell him to go and pawn his watch, nor tell him he had a watch—he said he would pawn his watch and clothes, and try all in his power to repay it—I discharged him on the Saturday—I did not take him into custody—he went away—the balance he had to pay was cash in hand from the retail business—I charged him with not having paid Lufkin's account—he pawned his watch and clothes and brought me back 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or some money, I cannot exactly recollect the amount, and promised to pay more on Monday if he could—I found him on Monday in a public-house in Carnaby-street—I asked him to accompany me to my warehouse—he went willingly with me, and then I gave him into custody—I kept him at the warehouse from one to two hours because we could see no policeman—on the Saturday I would freely have forgiven him, but on that day he was sent to many of the customers to deliver bills inclosed and sealed, and instead of that he applied to most of them for payment—two or three of them came on Monday and said, "We were surprised you sent to us for money, you never did before"—we felt ourselves not safe, and wrote to them to ask them not to pay the prisoner at all.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

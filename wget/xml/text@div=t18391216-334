                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live in Peter's-court, Golden-lane, in the parish of St. Botolph without, Aldgate. The prisoner is my brother-in-law's daughter—she left her place, and I kept her two days—on the 5th of December I sent her to my box (which was in the same room we were in) with the key to get a shift out for me—I thought she was a long time at the box, and told her to lock it, and give me the key—I had six sovereigns and a half in a purse there, which I know were all safe that evening—the prisoner left me on Friday about four 'clock, and on the Sunday following, between eight and nine o'clock, I missed my money—I went to Greenwich, where she had told me she as going, to her cousin's, and found her at a public-house—I asked how she came to rob me—she said she had not robbed me, and knew nothing about it or the box—I said, "You can't say that, you went to my box"—the purse which my money was kept in was found in her bosom, and four sovereigns in it—this is my purse—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>.)</p>

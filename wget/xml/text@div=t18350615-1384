                  </hi>. I am a police-inspector. On the 1st of June 1 stopped the prisoner on the bank of the river at Blackwall—he had a large bundle with him, containing several sea caps, a rug, and the other articles, stated in the indictment—he appeared to have been in the water—his trowsers were wet nearly up to his middle—he said he belonged to the brig <hi rend="italic">Nixon</hi>, which laid off East Greenwich, and he had escaped from the vessel in consequence of the treatment he had received from the mate—he subse<lb></lb>quently mentioned another vessel to me—I found a ship's boat lying about 300 yards from where I stopped him, high and dry, as if it had been put there at high water—he afterwards acknowledged he belonged to the <hi rend="italic">Anatolia</hi>, and had come on shore in the <hi rend="italic">Simpson's</hi> boat—when I stopped him he said the clothes were his own.</p>

These trowsers, jacket, and two silk handkerchiefs, are mine, and were on board the vessel—the prisoner was on board as an apprentice—it was his watch that night—I had left my property in ray chest in the aft deck—he left his own chest and bedding behind, but no clothes—his chest was on one side of the aft deck and mine on the other—he could not have mis<lb></lb>taken mine for his—I don't know of any ill usage he received—he bore a good character—he never wore my clothes without my leave.</p>

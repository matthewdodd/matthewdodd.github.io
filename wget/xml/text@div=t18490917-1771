                  </hi>. I am assistant to Abraham Barber, jeweller, of 56, Cheapside. On 20th Aug. the prisoner came and said he wanted some plated dish-covers for Mr. Hooper's son—he was dressed as he is now—I suspected him, and said, "I will go with you," and asked where Mr. Hooper resided—he said, "Upper Thames-street"—I said, "Is it the son of Mr. Alder<lb></lb>man Hooper, of Queenhithe?"—he said, "Yes, "and that he was going to be married—I said, "Will you carry them?"—he said, "No, "and I called a porter—we went down Bread-street, and the prisoner seemed very fidgetty, and said he wanted to buy some twine—I said, "What for?"—he said Mr. Hooper commissioned him to buy twine—I said, "There is a shop, you can buy some"—he went in, came out directly, and said, "Can't you go with the covers yourself; do you think I am misleading you?"—I said, "No, but I am determined you shall go with me"—he said, "I want to buy my string first"—I asked him how long he had been in Mr. Hooper's employ—he said, "About two years"—I asked who Mr. Hooper was going to marry—he said, "A lady named Lee"—I gave him in charge—he was dressed as a trades-man's boy—Mr. Alderman Hooper does not live in Thames-street.</p>

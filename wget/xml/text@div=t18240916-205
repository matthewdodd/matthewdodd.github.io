The prisoner came into my service on the 14th of July, and on the 13th of August she had leave to go out, and never returned. She sent a person for her box next day, which I refused to send. She came on Saturday evening with a woman for it. I said I had missed some property.</p>
               <p>MARY BURKE. I keep a fruit-stall in Carnaby-street. I generally go to the prosecutor's house every day. On the 13th of August the prisoner came to my stall, and wanted me to go on an errand; I said my little girl was out; she said it would do when she came back; she said it was to take a parcel to the pawnbroker's for a woman in the second floor. I asked if it was a ready-furnished room; she said No, - her own things, but the woman was ill, and could not go. She then brought this property to me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That woman came and asked me to lend her some money. I told her I had no money, but if she would take these things she might; she took them, and kept the money and the tickets too.</p>

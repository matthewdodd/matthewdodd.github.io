On the 8th of June as I was going to attend the funeral of a relation in London, my son followed and overtook me, and told me Old Mouse (that is a dark brown gelding of mine) was lost from out of the field where were five others. I sent him back to enquire at the turnpikes. As I came on I overtook the prisoner on my gelding at Hounslow. The prisoner formerly had lived with me about eighteen years ago. I had forgot him till he mentioned it to me. The gelding had a halter on, but no saddle; it was both a cart and riding horse, the value about 5 l. I took the prisoner before a justice, who there begged my pardon.</p>

             the Younger. I saw the gelding about seven o'clock over night at grass with five others, and he was missing about four in the morning on the eighth of this instant. My father had been set out about ten or fifteen minutes, when I rode after and told him.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. How far is Hambleton from Hounslow?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It is about thirty miles. The horse seemed to be leg weary.</p>

               <p>I took him only to ride to London to see a friend. I was afraid of being too late. I intended to bring him back again.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. How did the prisoner behave while in your service?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. He behaved very well.</p>

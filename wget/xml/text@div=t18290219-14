            . I am waiter at Mivart's hotel. On the 29th of January, I missed a table-spoon and a tea-spoon; the plate had been about in several rooms - the prisoner had been at our house several times to inquire about his sister, who lived in our service; I lost four table spoons, one tea-spoon, and one fork, between the 12th of November and the 28th of January.</p>

            . I pawned these spoons by the desire of the prisoner; he lodged with me, and was in great distress - I asked if he had no relation who could assist him; he said he had a sister - he went there as he said, and was there nearly all day; in the evening he brought a spoon, and said his sister lent it him to get a little relief - when that money was spent he went again and got another; I said "William, I hope you got them honestly;" he said I had no occasion to fear that.</p>

                  </hi>. I lodge in Lawrence-lane, St. Giles. The prisoner lodged there—there was an opening between my room and Cresey's—I looked through the boards, and saw the prisoner taking three silk hand<lb></lb>kerchiefs out of Cresey's hat—I know it was his hat—I had seen him with it—I did not see the prisoner take any thing else—she put the handker<lb></lb>chiefs, one after another, on the bed—she then lifted up her clothes, and tied them round her waist—I followed her down stairs—she went into a pawnbroker's shop—she then came out, and went to another pawnbroker's—she pawned one there—she then went to a marine-store shop, and sold the other two.</p>

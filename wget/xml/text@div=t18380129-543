                  </hi>. I live at No. 126 Newgate-street, and am traveller to Orchard and Co., of Smithfield. On the morning of the 30th of Jannary I went into my bed-room, and missed my waistcoat, and afterwards my watch and appendages—the watch is worth about 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the chain, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the waistcoat, 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the watch was in a case at the head of the bed-they were all gone at the same time—the outer door of the house was kept open-my bed-room door was not locked—the house belongs to Mr. Skelden, but he does not live there—I have only an apartment—it is not a separate dwelling-house—the staircase is common to every room—I pay no rent or taxes—the furniture is my own—I take it by the week, month, or quarter.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a potato dealer, and live at No. 66, Noble-street. I have known the prisoner many years—on the 30th of January I saw him at the tap of the Castle and Falcon—he had a watch-chain hanging from his fob—I asked him the time—he immediately looked at the dial in the tap-room, and said it was two o'clock—I told him the dial was wrong, and what time was it by his watch—he immediately pulled a watch from his fob—I obtained it from him, and noticed the maker's name, and took particular notice of it—I gave it back to the prisoner, and he walked oat—I followed him into Aldersgate-street, and asked him to take some beer, which he said be would, and he came back into the tap-room again—I asked him to let me examine the watch again—I got it into my possession, and delivered it to the landlord, while I went and fetched a policeman—he had a waistcoat on at the time, which has been since claimed—I beg to state that I think the man is a little deranged at the <hi rend="italic">ebb and flow</hi> of the moon—I think he is a little mad-brained—I have known him many years, and always knew him to bear a most excellent character, till lately he has been guilty of a few transactions—he is not right in his senses at all times—he is not quite as sound as other people—I lived fellow-servant with him many years.</p>

The prisoner lodged in the same house with me, but had a separate apartment underneath—I went to St. Bartholomew's Hospital on the 28th of July, and came out on the 2nd of August—when I came out I went up and found my lock had been tampered with—I could not unlock the door—I pulled the bolt round, and it was opened—it had been opened by a false key—I missed all the things stated in the indictment—I know them all to be mine—they were found in Catherine Tots' room.</p>

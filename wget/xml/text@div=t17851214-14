               <p>Had you curiosity at that time to ask him his name? - Not immediately I did not, he then asked me if I had Irish cloth, he said, Sir, I should be very glad to have a piece of Irish cloth of you, you can serve me as well any man in London; I said, I should be sorry I could not, he then wanted some lawn for trimmings, I made him an account for five pounds, one or two shillings, he then presented a draft for fifteen pounds, of Messrs. Pybus's, I looked very earnestly at it, it was in the parlour, he followed me into the shop and said, Sir, you are very right to be careful, there are a great many bad drafts about and swindlers, I asked who Mr. Richards was, he said, that is myself, I live at Fulham, and Mr. Parsons the drawer lives at Fulham also, upon this I took the draft, and gave him the balance in cash, the amount of it was fifteen pounds; it has been in my possession ever since, excepting a few days, I am very clear it is the same, I entered it in my bill book, and took particular notice of the number.</p>
               <p>Did you mark that identical paper? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Who did you part with it to? - To one Mr. Tate.</p>
               <p>Do you think, Sir, you are able to say that is the same note? - I am positive sure.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of that? - I am clear.</p>
               <p>How much money did you give him in change? - Between nine and ten pounds.</p>
               <p>What conversation continued between you? - He followed me from the parlour to the shop, and I examined the note very minutely, I had many checques from Mr. Pybus's house, he said, I did very right to examine very minutely, that there were a great many bad notes about, but this was a very good one; I observed to him that I was sorry he would not give me leave to send his goods home, I offered to send them home two or three different times, he only said he was going to Fullham, and should return on Monday with the lady to shew her the house.</p>
               <p>Did he say where he was going before he went to Fulham? - No, he said no more than that, but I rather concluded, he was going to the tavern.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do not tell us what you concluded; did he say he was going to the tavern? - No, I sent this draft for payment, and it was not paid, I have no doubt but this is the very identical draft that was produced for payment.</p>
               <p>You know it by comparison with your book I suppose? - I took the particulars down<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178512140032"></xptr> Your book is not here? - No.</p>
               <p>Looking at that without comparing it, what is there upon it that enables you to swear it is the same draft that was tendered by the prisoner? - No. 17.</p>
               <p>Did you bear that in your memory, or did you take it from your book? - I bore it in my memory, it is written.</p>
               <p>Any other paper that had seventeen wrote in it might impose itself upon you; if I was to make an accurate copy of that note how would you know one from the other? - Not only the number but the capital letter R struck me.</p>
               <p>What is there peculiar in the capital letter R by which you now recollect it? - Why there is not particular support at the bottom to the return.</p>
               <p>I will thank you for a sight of it? - The last part of the letter.</p>
               <p>This has as much the appearance of a P as an R?</p>
               <p>Court. It is not a common R certainly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Now I take it you are not quite sure it is an R? - It strikes me as an R.</p>
               <p>Now will you venture to swear the name on that draft is not Prichard? - There are not letters enough.</p>
               <p>I say that which you call a capital R, is a capital P? - I cannot venture to swear that it is.</p>
               <p>When did you for the first time, make that observation on the supposed R? - I entered it down as an R in the copy.</p>
               <p>When for the first time did you take any particular notice, or make any particular observation on that letter? - In the course of about five days.</p>
               <p>Then before you had made that observation, it had passed out of your hands? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Yes, you had sent it out for payment, you did not carry it yourself? - No.</p>
               <p>Then you see I was right? - It was in the hands of my nephew and servant

               <p>He brought it back again? - He did, then I entered it.</p>
               <p>Your book is not here? - No, then I put it in my pocket-book, and then I received this letter.</p>
               <p>Put that letter into your pocket-book again; did you communicate your observations on the letter R to any body? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Then it rested for some months I think, 'till Mr. Tate came to you? - Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>When did you again see the prisoner at the bar? - Not before the 23d of November, Mr. Tate had been with me prior to that, and told me that my name was put into the body of a draft to Messrs. Hankey's house, the man was at liberty when he came to ask me if I knew any thing of that draft.</p>
               <p>When you first saw the prisoner you knew he was then in custody upon a charge of forgery? - Yes, I understood to.</p>
               <p>You was called upon to identify the prisoner's person? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Other people could not identifie him? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>The prisoner stood there as a party accused, as a prisoner? - Undoubtedly.</p>
               <p>Probably with irons on? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>That was the first time you saw him after he came to your house at Kensington? - Yes.</p>
               <p>At the distance of six months? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long might the person that bought the lawn and the Irish stay with you? - I suppose about twenty minutes or half an hour.</p>
               <p>You have told us the whole conversation that passed between you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>There was nothing else that passed between you? - Nothing.</p>
               <p>You are sure of that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Have you any doubt in the world of that being the man that came to your shop? - Not the least doubt in the world.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt in your mind that that is the note? - Not any, I asked him if his name was Richards, and he said it was.</p>
               <p>Court. When did you part with this note out of your hands to Tate? - It was about six weeks ago, he had it about a fort, night or three weeks: he came down to me, to ask me if my name was Stenson,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178512140033"></xptr> about a draught on Hankey's house, I then compared it, and found it was the ame hand writing.</p>
               <p>For what purpose did you give it to Mr. Tate? - For the purpose of comparing hands.</p>
               <p>Did it never occur to you, that it would be a better method to put some mark of your own hand writing upon it, than to enter it upon your book? - It being a bankers draught I did not.</p>
               <p>Suppose, now, any person had been at the pains after you had parted with this note to take another checque of Pybus and Co. and upon that to make an exact copy and imitation of the note; I do not mean a common copy, but a copy professing to imitate the hand-writing, should you know the one from the other? - Some people are very ingenious in copying to be sure, but Mr. Tate put his mark upon it.</p>
               <p>Court. Then let him be called, although the belief of this witness would be evidence certainly to be left to the Jury.</p>

               <p>Was it after that partnership was formed, ever known by the description of Pybus, Call, Dorset, Pybus, and Hayley? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>In 1784, the partners were Pybus, Dorset, Cockell, Pybus the younger, and Haley; in January, 1785, Dorset and Cockell went out, and Call and Grant came in.</p>
               <p>Was the partnership of Pybus, Call, Pybus, Grant and Haley, that partnership firm in 1785, was it ever known by the old firm of Pybus, Dorset, Cockell, Pybus and Haley? - I do not know that it was.</p>
               <p>Do you know one way or the other, answer the plain question without endeavouring to find out the consequences of it, whether the new partnership was ever know by the old firm? - No, I do not believe it was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. If any person was possessed of any of your old checques, and kept cash there, though it was directed to Messrs. Pybus, Dorset, Cockell, Pybus and Haley, yet the new partnership will pay it? - They would.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Was not the reason of that draught being so answered, that it was properly addressed to the old firm, being one of the draughts of the old firm, of a remaining balance of Pybus, Dorset, and Co? - It was.</p>

               <p>Have you had one single instance of this; that a customer of the new firm, not a customer of the old house, has drawn a draught upon the old checque, and that it has been paid? - We have not.</p>
               <p>Court. Then you mean the draught of a customer who had come from the old firm?</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. If by any mistake a new customer had written on a checque in the old firm and drawn? - We have had an instance of that kind: Mr. Cuthbert arrived from the East Indies since January, and drew a draft, on the new house, upon an old checque, and it was honoured; he had no account at all with the old house.</p>

               <p>Mr. Silvester. My Lord, you see this man says my name is Richards, and the note is made payable to him, it is within his knowledge who represents it, the note is not taken on the credit of the prisoner, it is taken on the credit of Parsons having cash at Pybus's house: I have known a great many convictions, I have known men suffer upon no other evidence before the Court than merely this, there was evidence at the banker's that no such person existed that kept cash at that banker's: it is a fact within the prisoner's power to become acquainted with.</p>
               <p>Court. The law is not to accommodate itself to particular cases, or to the particular conduct of persons; where you charge a forgery, it is incumbent upon you to give some evidence that it is a forged instrument, be the instrument what it may; if a person takes the draft or note of a stranger, it is not very usual to take it upon a man's saying it is Mr. Such-a-one's, who lives in London or any where else, but people enquire a little more particularly; the party uttering the note is bound down by the description that he gives, and the law will not permit him afterwards to say that there is another man of this name who really wrote the note of another description; but where a man takes a note without any description, or with very little description, he takes it at his risk: In the present case, you are not to convict a man because he cannot prove his innocence, but you must first give reasonable evidence of his guilt; the matter in doubt at present is this, this draft is the draft of

               <p>Mr. Fielding. My Lord, although it is not a very pleasant employ to exert one's-self in aid of a prosecution, where the event of it, if it obtains, will be certain death, yet I must say a word: my learned friend has stated a case out of Douglass, that does not seem to me to apply: if I charge that an instrument purports what it does not, that charge falls to the ground: purport will equally apply to representation, viva voce, that represents matter of evidence from the mouth of a witness, the evidence must altogether arise from the instrument itself, here it does not seem to me that my learned friend took any objection to the instrument, but to the evidence: the purporting is here delivered to the Court, upon which there can be no mistake: the man tells him, that this is a draught drawn by a Mr. Parson's of Fulham, upon Pybus and Co. and that he is Mr. Richards, the very man in whose favour the draught is drawn; now suppose in this case, the evidence had stopped short, and he had not assumed the name of Richards, the evidence would be compleat as to this forgery; but when you have it in evidence, that a man assumes that his name is Richards, which is a manifest falsehood, that would form a subject for a serious deliberation, there would be sufficient to leave it to the Jury, but I do conceive there is something in this, that he being the person in whose favour the draught is made, it is incumbent upon him to know something of the firm of the house, before he receives the draught on the drawer; he therefore takes upon himself to receive the draught, and professes that this man keeps cash at Pybus's, and when the fact comes out that there is no such person as this

            , it is another circumstance of presumption, that the whole is a fabrication from beginning to end: as to the putting it to us to search through Fulham, this seems to be putting upon us the proof of the negative: I agree with your Lordship, that the justice and the humanity of the law of this country is, that no man should be called to defend himself, till some guilt is proved, but there are degrees of proof, it hardly ever in forgery amounts<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178512140037"></xptr> to demonstration; therefore, as in this case, it depends upon the degrees of probability.</p>
               <p>Court. I shall leave the evidence to the Jury.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, I was told from the Bench a day or two ago, which I own was news to me, that I was entitled to a reply.</p>
               <p>Court. In stating your objection, you are entitled to a reply, I think so, clearly in all cases.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. It has not been usually, I believe, the way with us here.</p>
               <p>Court. It is a constant practice in all interlocutory matters.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I have very often fallen into the error of supposing I had no right to reply, because the objections I have had the honour of stating, have generally been so strong, that they have not stood in need of a reply: the gentlemen on the part of the prosecution have observed pretty strongly, and pretty much at large upon the facts of the case: that certainly is not the province of the Counsel; but that is all that Mr. Fielding has done, and Mr. Silvester supposes that there was something more in this representation, than he is warranted by the evidence to suppose; because as it stands at present, it is a naked representation of this fact, that he was the Mr. Richards to whom it was payable, and that

             living at Fulham, when perhaps to-morrow the very man that drew the bill may stand up.</p>
               <p>Court. I think this case by far the shortest in point of evidence, that I ever remember to have heard of, or to have read of; there are two sorts of forgeries; one is the forgery of known and defined person, in that case it is necessary to prove that the party did define that person, if he is not sufficiently defined on the face of the instrument, which, in the case of an acceptor he may not be; but in the case of a drawer he rarely can: it will be necessary to prove, that the party having the draft, did, by his description, limit it to be the instrument of that person whose it is charged to be; and then you are bound to prove by the best evidence the negative, that is not the hand writing of that person. There is another kind of forgery more difficult of proof; where a draft is drawn in the name of a man who did not exist, or rather in the name of a man not known, for perhaps there cannot be contrived a draft in the name of any person who did not exist; (for draw a draft in any name, there are persons of the same name,) but who do not exist for the purposes of that draft, that case is most difficult of proof; but it does not follow because a case is difficult of proof, that the law does not call for it to be proved; the parties must always use due caution, and due diligence: here is the designation of a place which seemed to be capable of being ascertained with due diligence, now Fulham is not a place of that extent, but it might have been ascertained; if therefore, this case stood merely so, I should not be inclined to leave the evidence to the Jury, but should give them my opinion, that there was not evidence of this<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178512140038"></xptr> being a forged draft, which is a necessary question before they can enquire whether the prisoner forged it; but there is one circumstance that inclines me to leave this evidence to the Jury, which is, that the prisoner professed to be the payee of the draft; now I do not agree with the learned gentleman, that his saying his name was Richards, when it was not, is a circumstance of the guilt imputed to him by the indictment; for tho' that argues a consciousness of guilt of some kind or other, yet it may equally refer to twenty other kinds of guilt, and I think it would have the same effect, as to this question, if his name really had been Richards, and if that part of his representation had been true; it is not therefore because he gave a false representation, that I think that helps the evidence for the prosecution, but because by stating himself to be the payee of the note whether true or not, he takes upon himself the knowledge of who is the drawer; that circumstance weights on my mind, to leave the evidence to the Jury, and tho' a party should not be called on to prove his innocence till his guilt is established, yet a person who takes upon himself the knowledge of the drawer should be called upon to shew who is that person: at the same time, the prosecutor has not used due diligence to lay the best evidence before the Court; they might have called the parish officers and have proved that they knew the parish, and had gone round to collect the rates, and that they knew of no person whatever of the name of

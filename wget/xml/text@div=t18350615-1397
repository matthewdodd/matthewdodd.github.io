                  </hi>. I am a painter, and live in Caroline-street. On Sunday morning, the 17th of May, I went into a public-house, in Shadwell, and saw the prisoner there; I know him well—I went into another public-house, and he was there—I do not recollect that we had any thing to drink there—I laid my head on the table and went to sleep—I had my watch safe in my pocket then, and afterwards missed it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a basket-maker. I went into the Crown pub<lb></lb>lic-house—I saw the prosecutor and the prisoner there—the prosecutor was asleep—I saw the prisoner put his hand round his waist and take his watch out—he snapped the guard—he put the watch into his own pocket—I went out and got the officer, who took the prisoner—he took him into the middle of the tap-room, and drew the watch out of his pocket.</p>

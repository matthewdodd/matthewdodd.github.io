On the 18 th of February about seven o'Clock at Night, I saw my Shop Door latched with an iron Latch; I was in a back Room behind the Shop, and a Boy came and told me I was robb'd: I went directly to see what I had lost, and looking about, I miss'd the Till, Money, Lock and Key, - all was gone together. The Boy told me he saw them and knew them.</p>

            , (the Boy) I was going of an Errand, and saw the two Prisoners, and Jones the Accomplice at Mr. Atwood's Door about 7 o'Clock, (I don't remember the Night) but Jones cross'd the way and stood still: Burn open'd the Door, and brought out the Till, and left the Door open When Burn came out with it in his Hand; Jones cross'd the way to him again, and they all went out together: Burn spoke to Ingram when he came out, but what he said I was not near enough to hear. I knew all of them, and so I told Mr. Atwood.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it so light at 7 o'Clock in February, that you could know their Faces.</p>
               <p>Walten. It was dark; but there was a Lamp by the Door and the Shop Windows were open. I don't know whether I could distinguish their Faces, if there had been no Lights.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Ingram and Jones seem to be of the same Company?</p>
               <p>Walton, Yes, they were all 3 standing together at the Door, when I pass'd by them.</p>
               <p>Burn. Do you know whether the Door was latch'd or no?</p>
               <p>Walton 'Twas a Hatch, and 'twas fast; I saw him lean over it and open it, tho' I cannot say I saw him lift up the Latch.</p>
               <p>Burn. The Door was a Foot open, when I went to the Door: I only went in for a Farthing's worth of Small-Beer, and the Till was half in, half out, and that was not lock'd neither.</p>
               <p>Ingram. Did you see me at the Door?</p>
               <p>Walton Yes; I knew them all 3 very well, and saw all their 3 Faces, but did not speak to them.</p>

            . About the middle of February, the 2 Prisoners and I, coming down the Street, saw Mr. Atwood's Door shut. I cross'd the Way and stood still: Burn went in and brought out the Drawer, and we ran together to the end of Bell-Alley; then Ingram perceiving that Burn's Hand was in the Drawer, - You Rogue, says he, what are you doing, and took it away from him; there was 23 s. and Eight-pence half-peny in it; if there was more, Burn sunk it while his Hand was in it. The Money was empty'd into my Apron, and at the Tobacco-Roll against St. Andrew's Church in Holbourn we shar'd it. I had 6d, less than either of the Prisoners, for they said 6d, had been lost, and so to prevent Disputes I took the Loss to my self. We had some Beef-stakes dressing then for our Suppers, but Ingram's Mother informing us that Mr. Atwood was coming upon us, we went away without eating them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the Hatch latch'd or not?</p>
               <p>Jones. Yes, it was; for he push'd against it, and it would not open, then he lean'd over, and lifted up the Latch?</p>
               <p>Q. On your Oath, Did you see him lift up the Latch?</p>
               <p>

               <p>Burn. I never touched the Latch with my Hands, and how can he say he saw me lift it up, when he stood on the other side of the way.</p>
               <p>Jones. I was not more than 3 yards distance from the Door.</p>
               <p>Burn. My Lord, we had just stole some brass Weights, and the Evidence carried them to his Wife to sell for us, and he came back to us after I came out of the Shop, and said, Charles, have you made the Lob?</p>
               <p>Jones. This was half an Hour before.</p>
               <p>Burn. My Lord, he is an old Rogue; he brings up Youth to Thievery, and then Swears against them for the sake of the Reward.</p>
               <p>Ingram. The Night this Robbery was Committed, I was at the Magpye at Holbourn-Bridge, and Burn and Jones came in there; my Mother persuaded me to go out of the way, and with long Persuasion I did: I knew nothing of these Fellows, not I. To Ingram's Character,

                  </hi>. I am second usher at the Clerkenwell Police-court—on Saturday, 24th October, there was a summons against a Mr. Andrews, signed by Mr. Barker, the Magistrate of that Court—I have it here—it is directed to Samuel Andrews, St. Pancras workhouse, commanding him to appear before the Magistrate, T. H. Barker, Esq. on Friday, 12th, for that he had been charged with unlawfully assaulting and beating one James Abel—that summons came on to be tried on 24th October—Mr. Andrews appeared—he denied the charge—I administered the oath to the prisoner on the Holy Gospel—the clerk took notes of his evidence—I produce them now (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>: "James Abel, upon oath, saith as follows:—'On the 17th of this month, at 11 o'clock, I applied to the relieving officer for relief; I was handed by Mr. James a ticket—I asked if it was for a 2-lb. loaf; Mr. James said it was; the defendant Andrews then said, "I will give you a 2-lb. loaf," and he left his stool where he was sitting in the office, and came and struck me under the right ear three times, and knocked me down and kicked me." In cross-examination he said: "I have been brought up in the workhouse. I have been nine times brought up for assault. Ann Abel, Watts, and Gurton were present. Mr. James was present when Andrews came off the stool, and kicked me behind without saying a word"—at the end he said, "Loader was not present at the time"—he swore that positively.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant relieving officer to the parish of St. Pancras, and have been so twelve months—I was summoned to the Clerken<lb></lb>wall Police-court for an assault, on 25th October—on that occasion the prisoner swore that I struck him three times under the ear—on Saturday morning, 17th October, the defendant applied to Mr. James for relief—he was supplied with a half-quartern loaf—after he had received it he said to Mr. James, All right, I will give you a b—<hi rend="italic">topper</hi>"—Mr. James was talking to him about some violent language he had used on the Friday evening before some of the directors—I said, "We don't have such language as that here, you had better go out"—he said, "What the b—h—has it to do with you"—he then passed by my desk in the office, and deliberately spat in my face—I saw Loader the beadle at the door at that time—I got from my seat and said, "We must eject this man"—I then took hold of his arm, and with the assistance of Loader, ejected him from the office—the woman Abel was not present at that time, or the woman Watts—Loader was at the door when the prisoner spat in my face—I don't say he was present before that—I did not strike the prisoner—I did not strike him three times under the ear, or at any time—he is one of the paupers receiving relief from the workhouse.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Roberts, who keeps a beerhouse at 4, George Street, Deptford—on 21st January, about twenty minutes after twelve in the day, the prisoner and a person named Mann came in—they called for a pint of porter and paid with two penny-pieces—about twenty minutes afterwards they had another pint, and paid with two more penny-pieces—I afterwards went into my kitchen—before going there I counted to see what money I had in the till, and I had 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and a farthing, after taking the 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from the prisoner—there was 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, and 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and a farthing in copper—my daughter was there when I counted it—we then went into the kitchen together, we had been there between five and ten minutes when I heard a rattling noise at the drawer, the drawer sounds very much—I said, "There is somebody touching the money in the drawer"—my daughter ran out, I ran after her—she said to the prisoner, "Oh! you are robbing my mother"—I said. "Oh! you bad man"—he said, "What's the matter with you?" raving up at me, and Mann moved from one corner of the seat to the corner by the door, and sat down there—I said, "You have been robbing my till"—I counted the money and three shil<lb></lb>lings and sixpence in halfpence was gone"—I said, "You have robbed me of 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—the prisoner again said, "What is the matter with you?"—I said, "You have got 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and if you don't give it me I will send for a con<lb></lb>stable "—he said, "I have not got 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—I said, "Well, give me what you have got"—he said, "I won't give you any"—I sent my daughter for a policeman—when I came out of the kitchen I saw the prisoner reach<lb></lb>ing over to the drawer, and he put his hand from the drawer into his side trousers pocket—I can't say which pocket it was.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You were examined before the Magistrate, and told your story before your daughter was heard? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I mentioned about his putting his hand to his trousers pocket—my deposition was read over to me and I put my cross—I said that he was reaching over with his hand in the till, and that he put his hand in his side-pocket—I was present when my daughter was examined—I had before that told the constable about his putting his hand to his trousers pocket, but not the Magistrate—the till is not here, it is a large drawer with a little iron bowl inside to put the money in—I don't keep other things in the drawer, my husband has some roll papers there, and that like—my daughter and I were both excited at seeing such a thing—I had seen the prisoner twice or three times before in the house—I did not know him about the neighbourhood—I counted the money because I had a purpose, to pay it away—I looked on the floor, and so did my daughter, but could not find anything there.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at Woodford. On 16th May, I was standing at the Bald-faced Stag, seeing a greasy pole climbed up for a leg of mutton—I had never seen such a thing before—it was the fair day, Whit Monday—I had a purse in my pocket, containing 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I felt something touch me—I turned round instantly, and the prisoner was drawing my purse out of my pocket—he ran away; he looked round about three times—I ran after him, and told the police—I missed sight of the prisoner for about a minute—during that time he could have thrown the purse away, or passed it to some one—I then saw him again—I put the prisoner into custody myself—I said, "That is the man that stole my purse"—at the time I saw him draw the purse from my pocket there was a man standing near me—I have no doubt the prisoner is the person.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Woodford, and am a groom. I was at the fair on 16th May, near the Bald-faced Stag—I saw the prisoner there against the greasy pole—I saw the prosecutrix; he was about four yards from her—I saw him put his hand in her pocket, and then run away—I followed him, but was pulled back—I saw the prosecutrix run and cry "Police, police," and she was pointing to find the policeman—I ran, but Iwas</p>

               <p>stopped by two men whom I had seen not far off—they pulled me back—I got from them after having two buttons pulled off my coat—I ran after the prisoner again, and saw him going down the road with the policeman who had stopped him—I have no doubt he is the man.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You saw Miss Windor, and I suppose you spoke to her? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I did not say a word—two men stopped me for a little while; it struck me that those two men had something to do with the robbery—I did not stop them—they went away—I did not come up to the prisoner when he was in custody; I was taken away by my master—I went to the police station about two hours after—I saw the prisoner again on the Saturday at the police office—I had not seen him at all from the evening of the 16th till the Saturday—he was not shown to me before the examination; he was at the bar when I saw him—I went to the police office because I was called to go—the prisoner had been examined on the Tuesday, but I was not there—I gave in my name and address to the Inspector—I did not know anything about the prisoner before I saw him at the fair—as soon as the purse was taken 1 was held back, and I did not see the prisoner till he was in custody—all J saw was a person take the purse from the pocket and run away—it was all the work of a moment.</p>

On the 30th of October, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner with this bag - another person was with him; I saw them go to Zion-terrace, and I thought they were going home; I turned down another street, and then saw them again, going into Cromer-street; I called a constable - the prisoner was taken - the other got away.</p>

            . On the 30th of October Mitchell came to my house, and told me two men were gone round the street with a bag; I put on my coat, and went out - I stopped the prisoner in Swinton-street, and took him to Hatton-garden - this bag has been locked up there ever since.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

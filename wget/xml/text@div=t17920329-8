               <p>I was servant at Mr. Mitchell's; I had been out with beer, and coming back I caught the prisoner out of the doors with only this dish in his hand; it was the 3d of March, about nine at night; he was standing against a watch-house; I passed him, and returned, and saw him peeping after me round the watch-box; I went on the side of him, and saw him with the dish in his hand; I asked him what he had; he said, nothing; he dropped the dish; I took him into the house, and there were eleven plates and two dishes missing.</p>

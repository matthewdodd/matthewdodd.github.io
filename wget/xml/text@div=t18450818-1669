                  </hi>. The prisoner is my husband; we live at Horsenden<lb></lb>hill, near Greenford. He came home on Saturday, the 5th of July, about seven o'clock in the evening—I was talking about what I had been cor<lb></lb>recting a little girl about four years old for—he approved of it, and said he should have done the same—he then went into my neighbour's house, and staid some time—he then came and called the child out, and said, "Poor little thing, she looks as if she was starved"—he said, "If anything hap<lb></lb>pens to the child I shall never forgive you"—he said I was no mother to the child—he said if I was no mother, he would be a father—he directly struck me a blow on my head with his fist, which made me feel giddy—to went into my neighbour's house, came back in about five minutes, and asked me if I was going to have my tea—I said yes—I had not had any—I made the fire up—he told me that for what had happened to the child she had nobody to thank but me—he struck another blow, which he aimed at me, but it struck my baby of six months old, which I had in my arms, on the head—I told him if he had any spite to throw it on me, not on the baby—I directly went and laid the baby on the bed in the bedroom, and before I could turn myself round he struck me another blow on the side of the head, which rendered me insensible—I do not know whether I fell, but I dare say I did—I was very giddy after the first blow he gave me—I think it was two days and two nights before I came to my senses—I was attended by Mr. Curtis—the effect of the blow has been concussion of the brain, I believe—I have been very ill ever since.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Horsenden, near Greenford, near Mrs. Jones's. On the 5th of July I was going up my garden, and heard a great noise—I stopped in the garden, and heard Mrs. Jones say, "Come on, you b----,</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live at Harrow-on-the-hill. I was called in to attend Mrs. Jones on the 5th of July—I saw her about a quarter-past ten o'clock at night—she was insensible—I applied remedies—it was forty-eight hours before she showed any effect had been produced—she was labouring under concussion of the brain—it was an injury which might have been caused by the blow of a man's fist on the head—a blow on the head sufficient to produce concussion might make the party insensible before they fell on the ground—it was an injury dan-gerous to life.</p>

I positively affirm that the same witness has followed me about the streets on several occasions, as a spy; the boy is unknown to me; I took my handkerchief from my pocket, telling him that I had no other but my own; I had scarcely taken it from my pocket, when he I alleged that it was the gentleman's, but did not describe it.</p>

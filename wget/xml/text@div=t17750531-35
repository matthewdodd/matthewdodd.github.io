I told him he was out of town, and desired him to leave his message; he drew back a little, and then said; I should be glad to see him. Can I leave a few lines for him? I said he might. I then thought I knew him, and that he had been an acquaintance of my master; he went into the dining-room, where he sat down and wrote a note. I staid some part of the time while he wrote: I then went and told my mistress a gentleman was enquiring for my master; I told her who I thought it was. She bid me go down again; I went down; he was just finishing the note; he asked for a wafer; there was none in the house; I went to get one, which I brought; he sealed it, and gave it me for my master, to whom he gave his compliments, and should be glad to hear from him as soon as he could.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, at 19, Sun-street, Bishopsgate. I became acquainted with the prisoner in July, 1848, through a sister of mine—I had some time previously advanced some money to her to bring an action; it was in the attorney's hands, but I had drawn it back—the prisoner knew that—I received a letter from my sister, and saw the prisoner about it—I told her I came respecting a situation which she told me she could get through her influence—I asked her several questions, and wished to know who she had influence with—she mentioned several names, and told me she would get me a situation if I would give her 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was what she said first—I said I hoped this affair was quite right—"Oh dear, yes," she said, "I am personally acquainted with Lord Alfred Paget, to whom I will write concerning the situation that I know he will get for you through my influ<lb></lb>ence," and she would let me know the result in a few days or a week, when she heard from him—that was about the 2nd or 4th July—she asked me for some money: I had none with me: I went round to the attorney, got 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and sent it to her by my sister—the prisoner afterwards sent me a letter about 10th July, and I saw her in consequence—she said she received the 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. through my sister, and showed me a letter—she said she had written to his</p>

               <p>lordship, and he could get me a place in the Home-office as a messenger—she held a letter, and said, "I have received this letter from Lord Alfred Paget, it is respecting this situation, which he says he can and will get you in a week, as he has made application for it"—this is the letter I received from her—I have seen her write; it is her writing—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"27, Coventry-street, Haymarket, July 10th. My dear Sir,—Shall I be intruding on your time, if I ask you to call upon me to-morrow, Tuesday morning, I shall be alone and quite ready to receive you from half-past ten until twelve o'clock, if between those times will suit you. I have had the pleasure of seeing your sister to-day, who I am happy to say is looking much better. I have seen the party I wrote to you about, and have good news to impart to you. I remain, dear sir, yours most respectfully, <hi rend="smallCaps">ANNE M. TOLFREY</hi>.—when I next saw her she asked me for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I told her if she came to my residence she should have it—she came down with my sister, and I gave her two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-notes in Earl-street, Finsbury, on the faith of the promise of this situation, and on the letter—I should not have parted with my money unless she had mentioned the name of Lord Alfred Paget—I had several interviews with her afterwards—on 13th October I received another letter, appointing to meet me in Wilson-street—I went there that afternoon, and saw her—she told me I was to go to the situation on the Monday week following, and asked me for another 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I gave her in two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bank-notes, on the faith that I was to be installed in this situa<lb></lb>tion on the Monday week following, and I was to give notice to give up my business—I saw my sister during these times; she was present at the first interview between the prisoner and me—I was appointed to the situation twenty times but never got it, and I never got my money back—I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner afterwards—she held out hopes to me that I should get the situation—I lost sight of her at Christmas, and did not see her until I apprehended her.</p>

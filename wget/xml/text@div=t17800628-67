               <p>On Wednesday the 7th of June, between six and seven o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner coming up Field-lane with a tub of liquor; he said to me, Bosworth, I know you are an officer, will you drink with me?</p>
               <p>It was geneva was it? - It was by the smell as it passed me. I did not taste it. I said no, I will not drink, where did you get it? he said, At Mr. Langdale's, and if I would go, I might get as much as I could drink. I said I would not touch a drop of it. The next day I met him, but we did not speak together. On the Friday-week following, it was search-night, then I apprehended the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Are your sure the prisoner is the person you saw with the gin? - Yes; I knew him before.</p>
               <p>What is he? - I believe he calls himself a hay-seller.</p>
               <p>How far from Mr. Langdale's did you meet him? - About half way up Field-lane.</p>
               <p>Do you know where the prisoner lives? - Yes, at Cow-cross, in a court facing the Castle.</p>

               <p>I have not spoke to this gentleman since last Bartholomew-tide. I deal in the same business as he; he and I had some words about a horse; he jawed me about it, and said he would be revenged of me. He reported that I asked him to drink, and said, D - n my blood, there is liquor enough running down the kennel. I never asked him to drink.</p>

               <p>How came he to be so long with you? - We were out together; he was part of the time at my house in the bowling-green alley, Turnmill-street. My house is half a mile from Mr. Langdale's; he came at twelve o'clock. We were at my house about an<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178006280159"></xptr> hour, and we were some hours going backwards and forwards in the street.</p>

I came down to Hockley in the Hole, to Mr. Parker's; he was not at home; his wife sent for him; she said he and Irons were together. I found the prisoner with Mr. Parker and Mr. Kitchen at the Horse and Groom, about five o'clock, as near as I can guess. I staid there till better than half after seven.</p>

               <p>Harding. I came in a hired Coach from Derby: The Coachman was to drive me into the City to my Brother's in St. Paul's Church Yard; but as he was not willing, I complied to be set down at <placeName id="t17460903-32-crimeloc125">Rathbone Place</placeName>

               <p>Q. Was there any Difficulty made about going into the City ?</p>
               <p>England. The Coachman refus'd to go; upon that a Hackney Coach was call'd, and we were set down in Rathbone Place.</p>
               <p>Q. Was either of the Prisoners the Driver of the Hackney Coach?</p>
               <p>England. Yes, that Man in blue.</p>
               <p>Court. Then the Things were put out of the Coach that you came to Town in, into a Hackney-Coach.</p>
               <p>England. Yes; there was a Coach Seat that came out of the Country put into the Boot of the Hackney Coach.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what Things were in that Coach Seat?</p>
               <p>England. I don't know all of them; there were a great many Things.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you go in the Hackney Coach to St. Paul's Church-Yard to Mr. Thornhill's ?</p>
               <p>England. Yes. And when I came there I miss'd the Coach Seat, and enquir'd for it after the rest of the Things were out.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you the eat sent again.</p>
               <p>England. No, Sir,</p>
               <p>Q. Did any Thing happen to you between Rathbone-Place and St. Paul's Church-Yard?</p>
               <p>England. Yes, Sir, it happen'd to rain, so the Coachman got off his Seat and said he would go for his Great-Coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he stop the Coach?</p>
               <p>England. I can't tell Sir; I am almost a Stranger in London.</p>
               <p>Q. When he went for his great Coat, was any Body left there to take Care of his Horses?</p>
               <p>England. He said he would leave one to take Care of his Horses.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was he away.</p>
               <p>England. I think about a Quarter of an Hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any Thing more to say?</p>
               <p>England. When I ask'd him about the Seat he said there was no such Thing; I said it was committed to his Care.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the other Man?</p>
               <p>England. He was the Man that was with him upon the Box; he own'd that he was there himself, I can't swear to him.</p>
               <p>Court. Then Thomas Barrow own'd that he was with the Coachman; but you don't know it upon your own Knowledge?</p>
               <p>England. I saw the Coachman take up some Body, but I could not tell who.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say when you ask'd for the Coach Seat ?</p>

               <p>Thornhill.

Upon the 6th of July, early in the Morning, I receiv'd a Note from Dr. Harding, to go to Mr. Edger; which I did, and told him that I wanted to enquire of the Man that drove the Coach last Night: So we went into Tyburn Road, and call'd him up, and I desir'd him to go with me to find out the Man that drove the Hackney Coach last Night, No. 190. So he ask'd another Man if he knew the Prisoner at the Bar, calling him by a Nick-Name; he said, Yes, and that he had burnt almost a whole Candle that Night, and he did not come home; another Man made Answer, he believ'd he was asleep in the Haylost: The Man went down, and came up again, and said he was there. So I spoke to him, and ask'd him if he knew any thing of a Coach Seat that was lost last Night; the Coachman said to him, Did not you and I put it into the Coach? then he said he did carry it to St. Paul's Church-Yard, and that he set his Feet upon it; but at first he said nothing of it, which made Mr. Budby give him some rash Words, and lay to him, Did not I help you to put it in myself? Then he answer'd, he had carried it to Mr. Thornhill's in St. Paul's Church-Yard. The Man that brought me the Note for my Master told me, that there was another Man came along with him. I ask'd Smith whether somebody did not get upon the Coach at Rathborne-Place, when he drank a Dram with him; he said, Yes, but he went no further; but afterwards confess'd that he went along with him all the Way.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 28th of September I was sent for to Mr. Dyer's house, in Devonshire-place - I saw the prisoner, and told him Mr. Dyer had lost his purse, containing a sovereign and 16s.; he said he had not seen it, and knew nothing about it - he proceeded to search the dressing-room with me; I then went into the hall, where the prisoner slept, and searched his pockets - he then expressed a wish to speak to Mrs. Dyer; I called her aside, and told her not to make him any promise - I then searched the prisoner's person, and found in his hand this purse, containing a sovereign and 16s.; he said he was very sorry, that he did not know how he came to do it, and hoped Mrs. Dyer would speak to Mr. Dyer to forgive him.(Purse produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to get the clothes, and was going to brush them; the purse fell from them - I took it up, and laid it on a trunk, with the full intention of returning it, but I had got up late, and was in a hurry; I took up the clothes, and forgot the purse - I did not think more of it till one o'clock, when I was called up, and asked if I had seen it; in consequence of the officer being there I did not like to say any thing about it - I meant to give it to Mrs. Dyer, and the officer seized hold of my hand.</p>
               <p>MR. DYER. The purse laid separate from my clothes on the table; I arose about nine o'clock, and sent for the officer about twelve.</p>

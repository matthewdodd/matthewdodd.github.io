            . On the 23d of March, about eleven o'clock at night, I was going down Drury-lane, I met with the prisoner, I went home with her to her lodgings, <placeName id="t18100606-69-crimeloc384">No. 4, Charles-street, Drury-lane</placeName>

I told him that I had given her half a crown; he went and brought her up again to me, and asked her why she did not stop with me, or else give me the half crown: she said she would stop with me all night, and after some time I went to sleep; I locked the door and left the key inside. In the morning, about a quarter past five, I awoke and found the prisoner was absent. I felt in my pocket, my watch was gone, and a five pound note, a one pound note, and fifteen shillings in silver; I went down to the landlord and told him; he said she was his lodger, she had broke the lock of the street door and got out; the constable took her up about a fortnight ago; I went to the watchhouse to see her; I knew she was the person.</p>
               <p>THOMAS DYSON. Q. Did the prisoner lodge at your house - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. She was an unfortunate woman, was not she - A. Not before this time. She lived with a plaisterer, he was gone in the country. On the 23d of March I heard a noise in the prisoner's room, I went and asked what that noise was; Shaw told me that the prisoner brought him in, that he gave her half a crown, and that she went away with it. I went and looked and found the prisoner in another room; I said to her, Nancy, you must come up stairs and give the young man the half crown, or else give him satisfaction; I took her up stairs, and the matter was settled; I then went to bed and took the key of the street door between three and four o'clock in the morning I heard a noize, I got up and found the street door open. I went to bed again, and about a quarter past five Shaw came down stairs and told me that he had been robbed of eight pound, I believe, and a watch. In four days afterwards I saw her and spoke to her; I asked her if she was not ashamed to rob the man in my place and run away; she said she was sorry for it, she had got drunk on the business and lost all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you send to the prosecutor and let him know where she was - A. No; I told the constable to send for the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence I never saw the prosecutor before I saw him at the watchhouse.</p>

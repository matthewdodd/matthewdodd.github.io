I went to the Coach-office on Monday; and they persuaded me to stay till Friday. On Saturday last, I received a penny-post letter: I described the trunk left in a hackney coach: I went on Tuesday last, where I was desired to go by this letter; it was to Dog-row, Whitechapel. After the prisoners were taken up, I found a pair of my stockings in their apartment, in Whitechapel; this was on Tuesday last: the man prisoner, I think, drove us: I cannot swear positively to him.</p>

               <p>I was with Mrs. Rogers on the 19th of June last, at the White Horse, Piccadilly; and went to Upper Mary-le-bone-street in a hackney coach: there were two deal<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179007070032"></xptr>trunks, and two other trunks, in the coach; a hair trunk was put in the coach; it was left behind: I know the principal part of the contents: we were taken up about half after eight: the prisoner was the coachman; I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Rogers. Here is a list of the things that were in the trunk.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Brotherton. I took particular notice of the coachman, while he was putting in the trunk; he seemed to make a difficulty of it.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Clear brought a bundle to me and asked leave to put it into my drawers, and I gave her leave; on Tuesday morning Mrs. Clear brought another, and an empty trunk, informing me it belonged to a person that had lived well, and was reduced; I asked her no particular questions about them; in the afternoon of the Tuesday, Mrs. Clear came and drank tea with me, and told me there was a person coming at six to buy the property; about six a man and woman came in, and they went into my bed-room, and Mrs. Clear took out the bundle and carried it in; and they went away; I do not know what passed; Mrs. Clear called me in after, and told me they had bid too little money for it; I asked her what things they were; she said, a find of her son George's; a find in the coach; she told me before that they belonged to people who had lived in better circumstances; but then she contradicted herself; I asked her if they had been advertised; she said no; with that her son who was there, went out and fetched the paper, and they were advertised; then the man and the two women came again, and the woman took the things away.</p>
               <p>You do not know particularly what they were? - They were wearing apparel; but I do not know particularly what; I am a mantua-maker; and that same Tuesday morning Mrs. Clear gave me a gown to make; she said she bought it, and I have brought it here; Mrs. Clear took the trunk away herself; when I received the gown it was in a great coat.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Brotherton. The coachman had first of all put the trunk into the coach, and there not being room enough, he took it out; I took notice of him, because I thought he seemed rather to wish to put it into the coach.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Was you at the office, when the driver of No. 206 was there? - Yes, I said he was not the person; but that the prisoner was: the prisoner only came in by accident; I was not quite so clear at that instant; he stood with his side face, and he went soon out of the coach office; and I could not get a full view of him.</p>

               <p>May not some body else have such stockings? - Yes, they may.</p>

As I was going along the street, the prisoner and three other women were on the pavement; this woman walked from the rest and stopped me as I was passing by her, and she would walk along with me; in the course of two or three minutes she forced her hand into my pocket, I wanted to get away, she would not let me; I did not know that she had got any thing till she was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. When she put her hand into your pocket, did you make any resistance. - A. I asked her what she was about, she said nothing; she had not been gone five yards from me when I found I had lost a seven shilling piece, a sixpence, and a few half pence; I had felt it in my pocket not three minutes before she came up to me. Upon finding I had missed the seven shilling piece and the other money, I followed her and gave charge of her to the watchman; she then said she had got nothing. At the watchhouse the prisoner was searched; out of her bosom there fell a sixpence and four halfpence. One of the halfpence I can swear to.</p>

            . On the 3rd of May last I was the constable of the night; the watchman and Silver brought in a girl to the watchhouse, it was about twenty minutes to five in the morning. I searched the prisoner; I found in her bosom, when she was unloosing her clothes, a sixpence and four halfpence, they dropped from her; I asked her what they did there, and why she had not put it with the six shillings and sixpence that she had in her pocket; she said that she had them given her in change out of a quartern of gin that she had. I could not find the seven shilling piece upon her; I shewed the prosecutor the money. He said he only knew this one halfpenny.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I can swear to this one halfpenny; I had it three or four months, I never saw one of the kind before; it has four heads on it, and I know it by the brightness.</p>
               <p>Jury. It is a George the Second's halfpenny, it is like every other halfpenny of the same die.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going along Whitcomb-street, that young man followed me, he asked me if I was going home; I told him yes. He asked to go with me, I told him he could not; he put his hand into his pocket and gave me four halfpence. He said he wanted to go with me, and because I would not let him, then he charged me with a robbery.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I never gave her a halfpenny, nor ever wanted to go with her.</p>

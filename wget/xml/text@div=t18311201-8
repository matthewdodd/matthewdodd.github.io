On Thursday, the 17th of November, I was at Uxbridge; it was market day - I saw Dowling at the Sun there, kept by Mr. Cherry, and in the evening, a little before six o'clock, I went with her to Mrs. Langdon's house, in Bell-yard, Uxbridge, for a certain purpose - I did not stay above five minutes there, and gave her a shilling; I had about 26s. in silver, in a purse in my watch pocket; I did not pull out my purse, as I had a shilling loose in my breeches pocket - I was sober; I had had a little beer, but was sensible; I am quite sure I had the money about me when I left the house, for before I left the room I felt for it, and not recollecting that I had shifted it from my breeches pocket to my fob, I accused her of having it, but found it in my fob, and she blamed me for accusing her falsely, and said, "If you don't stand half a pint of gin I will punch your head;" I said, "I have accused you wrong, and will stand a drop of gin;" we went down to the Sun, and had some gin together - she followed us from there to the Eight Bells; a man named Weatherly was with me; they followed me up to the town - we both drove our carts up into the town, and at the Eight Bells Weatherly called for a pint of beer; I went in after him, but before I went in the two prisoners attacked me against 'Squire Cox's park, about two hundred yards from the Bells.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoners come up to you together? A.She pushed me across the road, and wanted me to go with her again; she wanted me to pull off my great-coat, which I refused - she then said, "You have blamed me for the money, and I will give you a punch of the head;" she hit me a hard blow on the nose with her first, and was going to strike me again, but I caught hold of her arms; I held them, and the male prisoner came up behind me - I am<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183112010010"></xptr>sure of him; I have every reason to believe he is the same man - it was quite a moon-light night; I had seen him that evening in the room, taking a pot of beer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing when he came up? A. No, he put his leg behind me, put his arm round me, and threw me back; we had a scuffle on the ground - I got the better of him, got up, and ran away to the Eight Bells, to Weatherly; it might be one hundred yards from there - I called Weatherly out; my face was all over blood: I said"Philip, come out and see what is the matter;" he came out, but they were both gone; I washed my face, sat down, and took a pint of beer or more with Weatherly, and before we left the house the prisoners had the impudence to come in where we were, and they took part of the beer which we were drinking - Weatherly asked them to drink.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you then complain that they had attempted to rob you? A. No, I gave up thinking any thing about it; we seemed good friends; nothing passed between us - we remained there about half an hour - I and Weatherly then went out together, and each got into our cart; after going to the next public-house, kept by Mr. Honey, about a quarter of a mile from the Bells, the prisoners followed us, and we all went in together there; Weatherly called for a pot of beer - we all four drank it together; we had another pot there: Weatherly would not come away without having some more, and we had 4d. worth of bread and cheese- Weatherly and I came out; they followed us directly, and on going down the hill from that house to Hillingdonend, about a quarter of a mile from the house, Weedon jumped up into my cart; Weatherly's horse was going at full trot; I was keeping mine from going too fast, and when I turned my head round Weedon was in my cart- I asked what he did there; he did not answer - I told him to get out, or I would throw him out; he did not get out, but he took me by the collar in the cart, and began feeling outside my breeches pocket for my money; I caught hold of his collar and one of his legs, and threw him out of the cart as well as I could, but he hung to my collar, and we fell out together, and had several tussels on the ground- I got the better of him most of the times while he was by himself; and after we passed the canal bridge, at the bottom of the hill, he got me down again; we had two or three more ups and downs - Dowling stood at some distance, and finding me get the better of him, she said, "Get him down again, or else he will get away from you, and I will assist you;" I did not see her, but could hear what she said - I was not on the ground when she spoke, but we were having a scuffle; he got me down, and she came and helped him - they confined my hands, got hold of my neck handkerchief, and almost strangled me: the blood came out of my nose and mouth with their almost choking me; they cut my purse from me, with a knife - they cut the fob quite away, the lappels of my shirt, and part of my breeches with it; they left me almost insensible on the ground - I did not know whether I was dead or alive; they got 26s. as near as I can tell, within about 6d. - Weatherly was on forward with his horse, and mine followed him; I cried out Philip! twice, but he was laying down asleep in his cart - I could not make him hear, and suspect he was asleep: I overtook him about three-quarters of a mile from where the robbery was committed, which is in Hillingdon parish; I got up in the cart, awoke him, and told him I had been robbed - we both rode home in his cart, and after putting the horses up I went to the cart to take the sacks out, and found a white heaver hat in Weat herly's cart; I do not know how it got there - the prisoner was never in his cart that I know of; I was sober enough to know what happened.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BALL. Q. Are you married? A. Yes, and have two children; I have been married seventeen years - I left home that morning between eight and nine o'clock, with a load and a half of hay; I drank nothing before I started - I got to Uxbridge between ten and eleven; the hill was slippery, and we gave an old man some beer for helping us up - we had a pot among four of us at the Tom and Jerry new beer-shop; we then went into the market, and were there most of the day before we could sell the hay - I had nothing to drink till it was sold; I had no dinner - I went into the Ram, and had two pots of beer among three of us; I had no gin, nor anything to eat - I was paid there for half a load of bay; I then went out to see if Weatherly had sold his hay - I drank nothing till he came; we then went to the Sun, and had a pot of beer there, between himself, me, and Dowling, who was in Weatherly's company; he is married - I drank nothing at Langdon's; I had a glass of gin and a pint, or it might be, a pot of beer - I never pulled out my purse.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are you quite sure the prisoners are the two people who ill-used you? A. Yes; I have not a doubt of it - Weatherly is not here; he did not see me robbed - I struggled with Weedon, and we hit each each other several times on the ground; I do not think the blood was caused by that - it did not come till I was strangled; I spit blood from my mouth and nose -Dowling gave me a blow on my nose, and made it bleed, but I had washed that off; I had seen her before that day, but was not in her company.</p>

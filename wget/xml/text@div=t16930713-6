The Evidence for the King declared, That the Prisoner did present the Musquet against the Deceased in a kind of a jesting manner, saying, have at thee Jonathan; or words to that effect; and furthermore, That they had always been very Loving Friends, and there was never any malice found nor proved to have been betwixt them, neither was any words let fall on either side at the same time, which gave any suspicion of malice, but they saluted each other as formerly they had been wont to do. The Prisoner lamented the loss of so good a Friend, and alledged that he had no malice against him, which several of his Neighbours attested; and the Deceased acknowledged before he died, That he did believe that the Prisoner did not design to kill him; So the Court directed the Jury as to the Law in the Case and they having considered maturely of the Evidence on both sides, they <rs id="t16930713-6-verdict25" type="verdictDescription">

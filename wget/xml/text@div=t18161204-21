            . I am an officer belonging to Bow-street; on the 29th of November, about half past eight in the evening, I observed the prisoner come out of Great Russel-street and turn down George-street, with something under his arm, I told my brother officer to head him and stop him, which he did at the corner of Buckeridge-street, and took the glasses from under his arm, he got loose from us, and at that time he drew a large stable lock from under his arm, threw it down, and ran away; we followed him into a house, and up-stairs, under his bed, we found an iron crow.</p>

            . On the 29th of November, about half past eight o'clock, the last witness desired me to follow the prisoner; he got away from us, and we followed him into a house in Buckeridge-street, and found him under the bed; he cried out, for God's sake do not hurt me. I am sure the prisoner is the man.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence as follows:-My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, on the 29th of November, as I was returning home I saw something white laying on on the ground; I picked it up; a cry of stop thief was raised, and knowing the thing did not belong to me I threw it down. I was overtaken and secured. I have a large family, and implore the mercy of the court.</p>

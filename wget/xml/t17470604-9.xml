            . I saw what a Condition the Child was in, the Woman draging of it along, upon that I seized the Woman. I took the Prisoner in one Hand, and the Child in the other. The Mob interposed, and they would take the Woman, and do speedy Justice to her. I begged they would not. Then I took care to get them before the Justice; and I found the Parents of the Child lived at Knightsbridge . I had taken my Handkerchief out of my Pocket, and tied it about the Body of the Child. The Prisoner own'd she had stripp'd the Child in the Prince of Wales's Passage ; and that she had made away with some of the Cloaths. So the Justice committed her; and the Child was committed to it's Parents.</p>

            . I am Mother to the Child. I live at Knightsbridge . My Child was gone from 9 o'Clock in the Morning to 6 at Night. The Prisoner is a Neighbour of ours, and used frequently to take a little care of the Child, which did not give me a great deal of concern; but I thought she stay'd very long. The Child was decently dress'd in the Morning; had on a Velvet Cap, Frock, &amp;c. but came home naked. The Things were gone. The Child is two Years and a Quarter old.</p>

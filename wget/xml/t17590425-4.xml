On the 13th of March last I was at work near my own house at three or four little houses; there were the prisoner and others at work also; my watch was hanging by the mantlepiece; it was missing, and at the same time the prisoner was absconded, on which I suspected he must be the person that took it, and I pursued and took him.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before you missed it was it that you had seen it?</p>
               <p>Wells. I had seen it about two hours before.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was he got before you took him?</p>
               <p>Wells. He was got to London; I found him in East-Smithfield; I taxed him with taking it; he told me he had pawn'd it to a person next door to the red-cross in East-Smithfield; I went with him there for it, and found it was pawn'd for a guinea; he had a little money left out of the guinea, which we offered to the pawnbroker for it, I not having enough about me to make it a guinea, the pawnbroker would not let me have it; I took the prisoner before the justice, and he was committed; and the justice granted me a warrant to fetch the pawnbroker.</p>

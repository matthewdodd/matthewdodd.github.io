On the 19th of February I delivered a peck of beans at four o'clock in the morning to Hearn, into a basket, which he had to feed his horses; he took them into the stable to feed his horses with part of them; part he mixed up in two nose bags to take with him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he mix the beans with. - A. Clover, chaff and grains; he took the two bags and put them on the shaft of the waggon; I took and cut a bit off the ends of both of the straps; he went off, I followed him up to Bethnal green, I stood at a distance, I saw him deliver one nose bag in a cart; as soon as the bag was put in the cart Hearn drove on; I went for Armstrong; Armstrong, me, and Bishop went up to the cart, there was nobody with the cart at the time it was delivered; it was an empty cart standing on West's premises, with the name of West on the cart; we concealed ourselves backwards, and watched the cart; during that time we saw West come from his house to the cart, he took the bag out of the cart and carried it before him into the stable; Armstrong followed him and seized him; I followed Armstrong, and saw the bag taken out of a tub in West's stable.</p>

            . Q. You are an officer. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On the day mentioned in the indictment you went with the prosecutor. - A. Yes, between six and seven in the morning, Bishop was with me; I accompanied Mr. Frith and Bishop to Bethnal green; I then came to a cart which had the name of West on it, standing very near the stable door; I looked into the cart and saw a bag stand in the corner, just like this; I did not handle the bag; I returned with Bishop and Frith behind some paling. In about five or ten minutes I perceived the prisoner West with this bag before him, going into the stable; I ran after him, and left Mr. Frith and Bishop to follow me into the stable; I catched hold of West; about a yard behind him was a tub, which appeared to have some grains. I looked in that tub; this bag stood upright in it, which I took and shewed to Mr. Frith; I asked West if that was his cart, he said yes, it was, and that was his stable, and he found that bag in his cart; I secured West, and Bishop went after Hearn.</p>
               <p>Jury. Had he emptied the bag, or was it in the state it now is. - A. In the state it is in now. I instantly followed him.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Hearn's Defence. I chucked it in the cart; I never saw any body; I thought the horses would not eat it.</p>
               <p>West's Defence. I know nothing at all of it; when I got up I went to the cart and unlocked the wheel; it has no where to stand but in the open road; it has stood there twelve years.</p>
               <p>Hearn called no witnesses to character.</p>
               <p>West called ten witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

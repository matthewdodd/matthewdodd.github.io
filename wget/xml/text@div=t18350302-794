I was in my parlour adjoining my shop, on the 27th of February—I heard a noise at the shop door—I went out, and saw the prisoner with the handle of the door in his hand, as if opening it to go out—he asked if I could recommend him to a situation—I said, "No"—he then went out, and when he got a short distance, I saw him run—I looked about my shop, and missed a flageolet—I pursued and caught him—he struggled a good deal, and this flageolet fell from him—it is the pro<lb></lb>perty of me and my brother, who are partners.</p>

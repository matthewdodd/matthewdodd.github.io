            . I am a journeyman taylor, I have often seen the prisoner; I was never in his company before Tuesday the 8th of September; I was in company with him then at Mr. Dobson's, the three Castles, at Puddle dock, in the forenoon; Mr. Dobson keeps a house of call for taylors; we both resorted to that house being out of work; Maurice and I went to take a walk together; we went to Charing-cross and St. James's Square, having nothing else to do. I dined before I went to the house of call; at four o'clock Mr. Maurice asked me to go into Mrs. Johnson's, the Cock and Magpye, Drury-lane; I objected to go in because I had no money; he said he had money, and desired me to go in, I did: we sat down and drank a pint of beer; he desired me to walk out into the yard; I did; there he desired me to take notice, as he had some business with Mrs. Johnson; we sat down in the kitchen; he wrote something down upon a piece of paper about three inches square; Mrs. Johnson was in the bar: he went into the bar to Mrs. Johnson with it. He had before desired me to take notice, so I went to the bar, and saw Mrs. Johnson sign it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any conversation between them?</p>
               <p>Moore. No, I saw no more pass; then we came into the room, he desired me to look at the receipt and see if I could be sure that was Mrs. Johnson's hand writing; I made use of an oath that he should desire me to take notice of so trifling a thing as a receipt for three shillings, for I did not know of any deception then; I read the receipt, it was for three shillings then: it was dated 8th of Sept. He bid me put it in my pocket; I did: he asked me immediately for it, and I gave it him, then he desired me to go up stairs with him into his room; I did not know he lodged there before. When I went into the room he took up a box, from whence he took a smaller box, out of which he took some promissory notes for small sums, one of which was I think for five pounds or five guineas; I did not observe whose note that was; he said I will show you the deception; he took the receipt that Mrs. Johnson had signed; he took off the the written receipt from the rest of the paper; it had been slightly gumed on the other paper; he separated it, and so made it into two; there stood on one paper the bare receipt without any name, on the other was a blank piece of paper, excepting only an L, a figure of three, and two scratches above and below the figure of three, and

            ; then he laid the promissory note of five pounds before him, and wrote from it a promissory note, upon the blank paper over Mrs. Johnson's name; he made it payable to himself; the date was the 8th of September; he then altered the figures; he put a 1 and an 0 before the figure of 3 which made 103 and added a 1 to the 0 which made 10, which made it 103 l. 10 s. I asked him what was his intention; he said he had no intention of hurting her, he meant only to marry her; he said he would call Mrs. Johnson aside into a room, and he intended to present that note to her for payment, if she refused to marry him: I told him I thought no man could have the face to do so; he said he did not intend to injure Mrs. Johnson, but he imagined she could not procure bail, and said she would consent to marry him. We drank I believe a pint of beer in this room; then we went down stairs again, and I went home. I frequented Mr. Dobson's house, where I casually met with him several days, and we occasionally drank together. About a week or a fortnight after this, Mrs. Johnson, and some gentlemen of her acquaintance, came to Mr. Dobson's; I was there; Maurice came in a few minutes after them; Mr. Dobson called me up; when they informed me of the affair I was struck with great surprise; told them that I knew something of it, but I did not tell them what then; on the next morning I went and acquainted my friend (one Mr. Day) of it, and asked his advice, the next morning I sent to Mrs. Johnson to come to me; when they came, I gave to Mr. Skinner, her attorney, the same information concerning it, as I have done now; we then went to Sir

Maurice was taken up on the Saturday; he came to me on Friday night, and said he had been to Mr. Mayhew's chambers, and that Mr. Underwood had conveyed him out at the back door, and said he had left Mayhew to make up the matter as well as he could; I said Mr. Maurice, I believe this will be attended with dangerous consequences; I would advise you to make off; he said Mr. Mayhew advised him to do so too.</p>
               <p>Court. Upon your oath in case this marriage had ever taken effect, what was you to have had?</p>

            . I keep the Three Castles, in Black-friars; both the prisoner and Moore used my house, which is a house of call for journeymen taylors; they were often together at my house. On Tuesday the 15th of September, in the morning, Mr. Maurice desired me to go a little way; I asked him what it was about; I said I could not go then; I would go after ten o'clock; going down Ludgate Hill, I asked him what the business was; he said it was not much further; he went to a chamber in the Temple; there were two gentlemen and a lady there; he said good morrow to you gentlemen; Mr. Mayhew said good morrow to you Mr. Maurice; Mr. Mayhew said to him, is this your friend? he said no, it is a gentleman that is come along with me, Mayhew asked whether he should proceed upon it; Maurice said, yes; I looked at the note; the attorney said it will not be so well for one to be plantiff and attorney, and he said to his clerk, Mr. Andrews I will get you to be plantiff.</p>

It was then mentioned that the action should be brought in Underwood's name; Underwood agreed to it; Mayhew asked the prisoner where she lived; he wrote it down upon a slip of paper, the Cock and Magpye, Drury-lane; Mayhew said, does she keep the house? he said, yes; then they wrote it down, and he said Maurice must indorse it, which he did; then Mr. Mayhew said he would give him a note for security, or a receipt for the note; he gave it Maurice, and Maurice gave it me to look at; the sum was in figures, and Mayhew had signed it only with his name, not mentioning where he lived, and the back was full of writing; I said I thought the sum should be specified in letters, and he should put his place of abode upon it. Mr. Mayhew said he would write a letter; Maurice put the receipt in his pocket book, and we came away; coming out at the door, I said, how was this contracted? he gave me no answer; then I said I supposed it was something of his late wife's affair; he said it was right enough, and Moore saw her sign it. I had no farther conversation with him; he asked me every day if any body had enquired for him.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner to Moore. Whether he has not received a certain sum of money for swearing against me?</p>
               <p>Moore. When Mrs. Johnson's friends came to me, I expressed to them the nature of my situation, I was turned out of Mrs. Dobson's house; turned down stairs, and used in a most desperate manner, and ever since they have not admitted me any where for subsistence. I said to Mrs. Johnson's friends, in what manner am I to be supported: I have a wife and two children, that cannot live on the air. They voluntarily<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177210210015"></xptr> agreed that they would support me; they only allow me a subsistence.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. Upon your oath did not you receive five guineas from Mrs. Johnson or her friends?</p>
               <p>Moore. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not you a security for five guineas more upon conviction?</p>
               <p>Moore. I have for five guineas more, as Maurice says, in order to defray my expences.</p>

            . On the 16th of September last I went to Mrs. Johnson; I went into the fore parlour on the right hand side, and Mr. Armstrong followed me in; Mrs. Johnson was there, and some other people were there, the prisoner was not; Mr. Armstrong told Mrs. Johnson, he had a writ against her; he arrested her at the sait of Underwood; I was one of her bail. I never heard Maurice say any thing about it; he was a journeyman taylor and lodged at Mrs. Johnson's. On the 18th, when we went to Mr. Dobson's, after waiting a little while, Mr. Maurice came in; we asked him to go up stairs; he did; we talked to him about this note; he seemed vastly confused, did not know what to do; we asked him how he could be so cruel; he said he never meant to hurt Mrs. Johnson, he had a very great respect for her; we said, did she ever owe you a farthing in her life? he would not answer any such question; we asked him how he could be so cruel as to arrest her, what a base man he must be; as we then supposed the matter was, before we discovered Moore's account, that as she did not look at the receipt when she signed it, we supposed that she had signed the note of hand, and did not look at the contents. He said if Mrs. Johnson, or her friends, knew his heart, they would be happy, and make themselves easy; I called him into a room by himself, where I discoursed an hour with him about the matter; he would not answer any thing material. Moore (after Mr. Dobson informed us he knew more about the matter) said he believed Mr. Maurice was a very honest man; we sent for Moore up stairs; he said, I think, he knew nothing about it. Moore sent for us next day; he said it was in his own breast to discover this affair; that he was a poor man, and that it would be attended with loss of time, and he expected to be satisfied for it; we asked him his sum; he said ten guineas; we proposed five guineas; he said if it was put in any other man's hands, it would be the same to him; it was not our offer but his request.</p>
               <p>Q. How did the note run?</p>
               <p>Asto. It ran, we promise to pay five guineas for trouble or loss of time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing said in it on conviction?</p>
               <p>Asto. Yes, I think it was.</p>
               <p>Cooke again. I have known Maurice two years.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you, know any thing about his circumstances?</p>
               <p>Cooke. I believe he was never any thing more then a <rs id="t17721021-22-deflabel102" type="occupation">journeyman taylor</rs>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>The note was wrote first before she signed it; I had no intention in the world to deceive Mrs. Johnson; I had it in my pocket a few days after; going along Fleet-street, I shewed it to an acquaintance; I met at the end of Fleet-market, one Mr. Keyland, who lives at Islington; I told him I asked Mrs. Johnson to sign it; he told me I had not best shew it to Mrs. Johnson; he asked me if I was acquainted with any attorney; he told me of one Mr. Mayhew, he was acquainted with; he recommended me to give it to him; we drank a pint of beer together; he went into a public house; I went to the chambers to Mr. Mayhew; I told him a gentleman wanted him at the Cock; he came there; I shewed him the note. Keyland bid me tell him it was a good note. I did not know any body could be taken out of their house and be imprisoned without a warrant.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Dobson. I have known the prisoner five or six years; I always took him to be an honest man.</p>

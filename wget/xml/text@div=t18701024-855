                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Before you went to the office of Taylor &amp; Co., had you speculated at all on the Stock Exchange? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, but I had invested as I accumulated a little money—from October 1868, to May, 1870, I had a good number of dealings with Taylor <hi rend="italic">&amp;</hi> Co., but those were investments also; I had no speculative business—I used not to pay and receive differences—he has paid differences to me—I have bought and sold stocks, and drawn a cheque for the difference, but not as a speculative transaction—I sell one stock and buy another, and if there has been a little difference I have paid or received it, but not time bargains—I have always advanced my own money to buy the stocks—I have sold bonds, and received the money from Taylor &amp; Co, 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and some<lb></lb>times double that amount—they have always paid me the difference, and their cheque has always been honoured—from October to May, 1870, I had made money, thanks to myself, and no one else—Taylor <hi rend="italic">&amp;</hi> Co. simply fol<lb></lb>lowed my instructions to buy or sell—I made 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. during that time, more or less—when I purchased these Turkish Bonds the price was 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and between the 14th and 24th July, they had fallen to 49 1/2, which alarmed me to this extent that I thought it was time to average, to "hedge" my bets—a week or ten days before I wrote the letter asking for the numbers, these stocks hod recovered themselves, so that taking the two loans I believe I could have sold out, and paid Taylor &amp; Co. all their charges and had 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to receive—I may have seen Mr. Taylor at the office a score of times—he was not present when the agreement was made—I have never done business with anyone but Mr. Tripp—I read this agreement over carefully before I entered into it—as to the fourth and fifth clauses Mr. Tripp pointed out to me that when the term was a fixed term, six or twelve months, it was usual to put a pen through those clauses, and I said "Put a pen through them."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not you wish that the agreement should be for six months certain, and that neither borrower nor lender should have power to close it before</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187010240080"></xptr>
               <p>that time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Of course—I thought it was for six months certain, and the other one was for twelve months certain, always supposing that they really bought the stock—from October 15, 1868, up to the end of May, 1870, Taylor &amp; Co. had given me every satisfaction in the business they had done for me, in consequence of which I introduced my relations, and they have no reason to complain, that I am aware of—they had actual trans<lb></lb>actions with Taylor &amp; Co.—I did not introduce Mr. Dearden to them for the purpose of speculation—I looked upon him as a friend of mine; we look upon persons as friends until we find that we have made a mistake—he had dealings with Taylor &amp; Co., but you must not take my introduction to that firm in connection with what they did afterwards—I believe they lost by him, much to my regret, but I do not know how much—Mr. Dearden did not behave honourably, and I cut his connection in consequence—I know that up to the first settlement they lost about 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by him—I know nothing about any subsequent dealings—I never heard that they had lost thousands—I always received sold notes similar to these on all those transactions, but the words "or loan" were omitted, it was the same printed form—the bonds which were drawn would be paid off at <hi rend="italic">par</hi>, on 1st October—the announcement that there would be a drawing in September was made long before I bought in July—I had not consulted anyone when I wrote the letter of 6th September—I wrote the draft of it in the City, and intended to have posted it then, but I thought I would give them a chance of sending me the numbers by the next morning's post—I had not then con<lb></lb>sulted Lewis &amp; Lewis; I simply knew them by reputation—in the first agreement I buy 5000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Turkish Stocks, worth 3000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and in order to do that I deposited with Mr. Tripp 1700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Turkish Stock, the greater part of which cost me 54<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 54 1/4 <hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I cannot say whether the value in the market was as low as 33, but the value of that 1700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. stock would be seventeen times the market price—out of that 1700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I had beforehand deposited 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I believed that Taylor &amp; Co. would advance me hard cash the difference between the two, in order to purchase the stock.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> They were to advance in cash the difference between the value of the stock deposited and the stock which they bought? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were the transactions wherein you were quite satisfied with Taylor &amp; Co., those where you advanced the money yourself? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and those transactions only—I paid my money for the stock I wanted, and secured the stock—precisely the same kind of business was done by my relations and friends, they always advanced the money—I had nothing to do with the loan and investment system till July—the prisoner agreed to accept the stock I deposited with him as the proper value—I went to him first by advertisement—I do not know whether he is a broker—I had done business with one stock-broker for my sister-in-law, being away from London at the time—I read this prospectus, and it was on the terms of it that I supposed I was dealing in advancing 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per cent—I never understood that they were to sell my deposited stock and not buy stock for me at all.</p>

Madam, Mr. Gandee, in handing to us your note of the 5th instant, informed us that he claimed an interest in your loan agreement, which of course we cannot admit without your written authority. We are sorry to say that in consequence of very heavy losses lately sustained, we have been obliged to ask indulgence from our larger creditors, and we have not a doubt that an honourable arrangement might have been carried out, but for the proceedings which Mr. Gandee has thought proper to adopt. Irrespective of the consequences to our creditors and to ourselves, which must ensue if bankruptcy cannot be avoided, for, in that case, we have no hesitation in saying that there will not be 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound for the creditors, our solicitor informs us that Mr. Gandee has laid himself open to be brought up at any moment before the Old Bailey for wilful and corrupt perjury, that has been committed without any excuse, and for which he has subjected himself also to an action for damage, to an amount far beyond any claim he can have upon our estate. Had Mr. Gandee acted wisely, and left the matter to have been arranged between ourselves and his stock-broker, Mr. Lloyd, the grave consequences which will now ensue would have been avoided, and you and all our other creditors, we believe, would have been paid in full. As it is, Mr. Gandee has taken it out of our power to comply with your letter of the 5th inst., and has left us no alternative but to seek the protection of the Bankruptcy Court, or allow him to have a fraudulent preference over our other creditors. <hi rend="smallCaps">RICHARD TAYLOR</hi> &amp; Co.")</p>

                  </hi>. I entered into the contract which has been read—I wrote this letter to the prisoner—(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "27, Chesham Street, Belgrave Square. Dear Sir, We have expected your clerk all this morning, according to appointment, to bring the 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. we arranged about last time we saw you. I conclude this has been overlooked, but you will be kind enough to desire him to call to-morrow, between 10 and 11 o'clock in the morning; and you will desire him also to bring the numbers of all the bonds you have purchased for us, including those of the New and Old Honduras Loan, &amp;c. Signed, Jeanette Allen. Wilfred Allen.")—We received the numbers of the Guatemala Loan—we did not know the prisoner before we saw an advertisement in the paper.</p>

SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You were satisfied with the drawing of the Guatemala Bonds? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; but since August we have I cen more satisfied, because the loan has been paid back to us—I think it was the 15th September, and we had a communication with Mr. Tripp, and I said that in consequence of all the disagreeables in the City, it ought to be cancelled, and he agreed, and we cancelled it—legally, I consider myself bound by that agreement—that was a speculation which was to list twelve mouths, we had the agreement in the house three days, and he thoroughly understood that he could sell the Honduras Bond—I have not been a party to this prosecution, nor has my sister, nor did we know of it till we saw it in the papers—I was subpoanaod by Mr. Lewis—we showed him why we should not prosecute—that we had no claim to call the prisoner up till the end of the year—we intended to receive the differences, not to take the stock—wo were very much pressed to prosecute, but never did so—we had this agreement to read over, and we requested that the fourth and fifth clauses should be struck out—we thought then might be a panic—we determined that it should last twelve months, and we might lose, and we might win—that was the spirit in which we entered into the transaction—it was rather like a little bit of gambling.</p>

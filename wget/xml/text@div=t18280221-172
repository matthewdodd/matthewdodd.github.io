            , at 1St. John's1 church, in St. John's-square, Clerkenwell, in 1823; I gave her away, and afterwards visited them when they were living together as man and wife; the last time I visited them was in Old-street-road, nine or ten months ago - they had three children. I saw his wife three weeks or a month ago - she was then pregnant; I saw her at a brewery in Coppice-row, which was carried on, as I understood, by the prisoner and his father-in-law.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ADOLPHUS. Q. Are you any relation of the Aldridge's? A. No.; it was at the prisoner's desire that I attended to give the bride away; I knew very little of her before - I have seen her with him, and knew her name was Mary Aldridge; I never knew whether she had any other name - I do not know that I had heard her called Mary Aldridge, except when she was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182802210106"></xptr>married; I should think the prisoner was at that time about nineteen or twenty years old, and I should think her seventeen or eighteen; his parents and friends were not present - I believe it was a clandestine marriage; they did not go home to dine, but dined in Clerkenwell: the banns had been published I believe. I have been acquainted with them since; I never heard they parted by mutual consent; I have not seen the prisoner in this last brewery. but I believe he was in the former brewery, connected with Mr. Aldridge.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You were at the marriage? A. Yes, and they afterwards lived together as man and wife; I know they lived together about eight months ago.</p>

            . I became acquainted with the prisoner, the latter end of July last - I then lived at Albany-street, Regent's Park; he called on me for bills from the Blue Lion Brewery, in Coppice-row; we had had some beer which was returned again as not good; he called for the money, and I refused to pay for two casks; the reason I saw him was, because I settled all the accounts for Mr. Sutton - I was at that time under Mr. Sutton's protection. The prisoner represented himself to me as one of the partners in the brewery - I removed afterwards to Speldhurst-street, and the prisoner called there for the money, under an excuse that I had offered him the money in Albany-street; he first explained the objects of his visiting me, when he called one evening in September and took tea, he said a great deal of nonsense to me, which it is not necessary for me to explain; he said he was going to Bedfordshire where his guardian wished him to marry a lady of great property - he had at that time always passed as a single man; he said if he attended to the business, he could make 20l. a week by it, and if he married me he should give up a great part of his property, but did not describe what that property was; some time afterwards a groom called upon me, and brought some game, and a letter from the prisoner to which I returned an answer, that I would receive him poor or rich - three days afterwards, I saw him again - he spoke to me of the message which I had sent; he said he was unhappy in his mind, and wished to have me; he said he should give up a great part of his property; and he could have a lady directly with 20,000l.; and his father wished him to marry that lady, but he would not, for he did not like her; he said he was going to Boulogne, as he had some contract business, which he could do better there than in London; he again said he was unhappy, and if he did not have me, he should not be happy. The first time he proposed to marry me was on the 16th of October; I hesitated and said I could not think of marrying him without asking my family; I afterwards told him, my mother and my friends did not seem to like this match; he said they had nothing to do with it; if I made up my mind; and he was determined to have me; he came one morning, at eight o'clock, and said he was going immediately to Boulogne; and I told him I was about to visit a brother-in-law, Lieutenant Lawrence, who lived at No. 2, Battery, Sandown; he proposed to accompany me as far as Canterbury, and in about a fortnight afterwards we set off; he said he did not know what to do with himself, and I told him, if he could do better by going there to go, but before he got to Canterbury, he agreed to take me on to Sandown - when we arrived there, he was introduced to my brother-in-law as a lover of mine; he staid there about a week; while there, he said he must either go to Boulogne or marry me; I said he might do as he pleased, but on one Sunday morning I agreed to marry him on the Monday, but we could not get the licence till the Wednesday, when we were married at St. Peter's Sandwich, and Lieutenant Lawrence gave me away; we lived together as man and wife for one week at the Bell, at Sandwich, and then came to town to Speldhurst-street - we lived there together about a fortnight, when a Mrs. Truman called, and told me he was a married man; I challenged him with it - he said it was only some servant that he had something to say to, that he had a child by; he denied being married, and I told him I would go with him the following Sunday to this woman; he agreed to go; but while I was putting my things on to go, he said, he thought it was an improper day for me to go on such business, and I did not go, but he went with my sister the next day; I went myself on the Tuesday to his wife's house in Coppice-row; but I never saw him any more till I saw him at the office in Worship-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What age are you now? Q. Twenty-three - I lived with that gentleman in Albany-street, four years and a half - I carried on his house, and kept his accounts; I had no child by him; I have had one child by a gentleman to whom I was not married; which brought me to my misfortune; he is a lieutenant in the navy; a brother officer of my sister's husband - my child is now five years old; I never had a child by an officer in the army; my mother did live at Southampton, but now lives in the city; when I removed to Spelhurst-street, I was not under the protection of the gentleman in Albany-street - I had parted with him in June - The prisoner got acquainted with me by calling a number of times I did say at one time, that whether poor or rich, I would have him; but after that he had a great deal of trouble, for I did not like his ways - my sister lived with me; but I never heard from her that he was married, and had separated from his wife.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did the prisoner know you had had a child? A. Yes; he knew all my circumstances; I told him my situation before I married him - he has not been deceived in any thing; he knew that I had an annuity of 150l. a year. I said I would have him whether poor or rich, because the servant said he was so unhappy, he was going to blow his brains out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS, Q. But was not your annuity to be discontinued if you did an irregular thing? A. Yes; but being married was not an irregular thing - I should have retained that, though he lost his brewery.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. If you committed any actual irregularity, your annuity would have been forfeited; but it would have been continued if you married? A. Yes; I made him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182802210107"></xptr>acquainted with my having this annuity, and that it would be continued if I married and lived reputably.</p>

            . I am brother-in-law to Miss Jennings. I remember the prisoner coming to my house with her about the beginning of November, I think - I understood from her, in his presence, he was about to marry her, and I received him in the capacity of her intended husband - they were at my house about four or five days; he was particularly anxious to be married; he went to Canterbury to get the licence, and told me he wished Maria would make up the marriage; but she seemed backward to do so - he said his clothes were at Boulogne, and he was on his way there, but did not explain to me the reason of his going. In consequence of the desire which he expressed to me to marry her, I used my influence with her to effect it, and they were married - I was present, and gave her away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Are you married? A. Yes; my wife is living with me - she is sister to the prosecutrix - I was not aware of her situation - I had been absent from England a great deal.</p>

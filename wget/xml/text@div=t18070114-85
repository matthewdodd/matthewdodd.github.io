Yes, on the 12th of January; I saw them safe on the mantle-piece between eleven and twelve, I missed them a little after four in the afternoon; the prisoner lodged in my house, he had belonged to a man of war; there were two more men in the house, and when they were missed they said they were willing to go before a magistrate, and when

I did; on Monday the 12th of January in the afternoon, about six o'clock. I gave him six shillings for them. I am almost certain of his face, but then he has but one arm; I did not percieve it then.</p>
               <p>(The property produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I sold the gentleman no spoons; I have been eleven year's in his Majesty's service, and I was wounded in my head, and I lost an arm with lord Nelson. I cannot bring to my recollection any thing of the kind, being very much intoxicated in liquor; if done, it was not meant to defraud. It is the very first crime that ever I have been charged with.</p>

            . In April last, I was employed by Mr. Page, my uncle, at Messrs. Broadwood's. On Friday, the 4th of April, the prisoner came into the shop where I was at work, and said he wanted to speak to me - I went down out of the shop - he said he had by him a piece of silk, which was made a present to him as a Christmas-box, by Mr. Chester - I do not know who Chester is - he asked if I was acquainted with any body in our line who would purchase it of him - I made inquiry at night as I went home - I saw him again on Saturday, and he asked if I had spoken to any body about the silk - I told him I had, and they could give me no satisfactory answer unless they saw it - that was about one o'clock - I saw him again between six and seven o'clock that night, at Mr. Swan's public-house, at the corner of Windmill-street - he had a parcel with him like silk - I did not know what it contained - it was rolled in paper - I came out of the public-house without my hat, and went to the Lemon public-house - I stood outside the bar, and the prisoner then had the same paper parcel with him - he asked me if I knew where he lived - I said no - he then asked for a pen and ink, and gave me his direction on paper - I told him I was going back to Mr. Swan's - he gave the parcel to the bar-maid, to be left there till I called for it - it was put behind the counter - I left the house in company with the prisoner, and in Windmill-street he told me the silk was all right - I was to leave it at a Jew's at the corner of Marylebone-lane, where I had called about it on the Friday, and if it was approved of, I was to go back and let the prisoner know - I was to go to his written direction - while I was going to the Jew's, Preston joined me, and while I was with him I was taken into custody by Thompson, and gave him the direction the prisoner wrote me, and the parcel which I had received from the bar-maid - I cannot say whether that was the parcel that the prisoner left with her - I told the policeman how I procured the silk.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You were accused of stealing it yourself? A. Yes - I said I got it from the prisoner, and was let go - I have known the prisoner for the last four or five years by seeing him about the premises, - the different workshops at the prosecutors' - I frequent the different workshops myself some times - I am not employed by Messrs. Broadwood's - I was on the premises five years as polisher there - Mr. Page contracts for the polishing for Messrs. Broadwoods - I work in their shop, which is in Bridle-lane, Horseferry-road - I never saw any silk there except bits lying about - I have seen it out he instruments- I never saw silk in the workmen's hands - I will swear that I have not seen yards - I am not aware that it is in Bridle-lane that the silk is put into the pianofortes - I have never seen more than will go into an instrument - I do not know whether silk was kept there - I never saw any silk put on the instruments - I believe a man contracts for doing it - whether he does it at home or not I cannot say- no rolls of silks are kept in Bridle-lane or Horseferry-<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183405150009"></xptr>road that I am aware of - I was tried last Sessions for this - I was charged with stealing the silk - those are the only two workshops Messrs. Broadwoods have that I know of - nobody threatened to indict me as a receiver.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you expect if this man is convicted you will not be tried as a receiver? A. No; I do not - I am not a receiver knowing it to be stolen - I know nothing at all about it - I do not expect to be tried again - I was never taken up before - I have been in a watch-house once - I have not been twice - I will swear I was not twice in a watch-house - it was for standing by when there was a row- a piece of work - there was nothing stolen - the watch-house is in High-street, Marylebone - I went before Mr. Rawlinson, the Magistrate, next day, and was examined - I was only there five minutes - I was taken up as tipsy, as they said, and was fined - that was the only time I was ever before a magistrate, that is two or three years ago - I told Thompson how I got the silk, but not all I have stated to-day - I went home after I got from prison - I was sent for by the solicitor about being a witness - I never opened the silk at all.</p>
               <p>MR. LEE. Q. When taken into custody, you gave an account to Thompson? A. Yes - I was afterwards tried and acquitted, and afterwards I was sent for by the solicitor.</p>

            . I am a sergeant of the D division of the police. On the 5th of April I was in Marylebone-lane - I saw Page and Preston between eight and nine o'clock at night at the shop door of Mr. Moss, a Jew - Page had this parcel of silk with him, which I afterwards took from him - it has been under my care ever since - after I got to the station-house, Page gave me a piece of paper, which I produce - in consequence of that, I went to No. 2, Titchfield-street, Dean-street, Soho, and found the prisoner there, in bed -(there is on the paper containing the parcel, "Harding and Co., 2625;" and under that, "80") - I awoke the prisoner out of his sleep - it was on the same night, between ten and eleven o'clock - I asked if he knew a man named Page - he said he did - I asked if he had sent Page to sell any silk for him - he said no - I told him he must get up - he did so - Jacques was with me - I sent him down for another officer, who was down stairs; and while he was gone the prisoner was by the side of the bed, and he said, "You can make this all right"- I said, "No; I can make nothing right" - I did not want him to say any thing to me, but to reserve what he had got to say before the magistrate - on our way to the station-house he said, that I could do all for him, and he would give me a sovereign to let him go home to sleep - at the station-house I asked him to write his address, which he did - I then produced this paper, and asked if he knew that handwriting - he said yes; that it was his direction - I said, "Yes, and your writing" - he said, yes it was.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He wrote his true address without any hesitation? A. Yes - he said he had not sent Page with any silk - I only asked him that question once.</p>

Broadwoods with silk of a particular description - this roll of silk was supplied by our house to them on the 25th of March - the figures on the paper are the marks of the manufacturer - I produce the invoice of the manufacturers, which corresponds with the number on the paper, and also on the block - it is worth 3s. a yard.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It is by the mark on the block you know it? A. Yes - the silk is considerably wider than silk is usually made - it is made expressly for Broadwood's - we do not supply any other house with it - other houses may use the same width.</p>

            . I am a French-polisher, and live in Princes-street, Soho - I recollect the Monday the prisoner was taken into custody - on the Saturday night previous, I was at the corner of Windmill-street - my men are paid at Swan's, but I never go there myself - I was near the house, and recollect seeing the prisoner opposite the house, about a quarter to seven o'clock - he asked me to go and drink with him - I refused - he had a parcel with him, eighteen or twenty inches long - it might be six times as large as this - I cannot say, for I did not take particular notice - I cannot say whether it was larger or smaller - that was a little before seven o'clock, as near as I can tell - the parcel was wrapped up in a different way to this - the paper is different altogether - it was wrapped up in whity-brown paper - he went from me into the public-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The paper parcel you saw was quite different from that altogether? A. Yes, it was - Page is my nephew - it is five years, on the 1st of April, since he was first in Broadwood's employ - I was on the premises in Bridle-lane - I do not know that they silked the piano-fortes there, but I believe they do - I believe they take the size of the front of the piano-forte and mark it out, and cut the silk out to the size - I have seen men at work there on the silk - one man, I believe, in particular was employed to put the silk into the fronts - I am still in the employ of Messrs. Broadwood - they have a great number of piano-fortes, and require a vast deal of silk - I may have seen forty of fifty piece of silk there during the time my nephew worked there; they were different colours - I have seen several pieces in the counting-house, containing a good many yards - the counting-house is in Bridle-lane - it is not my nephew's place to go there - it is my place - I do not believe he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183405150010"></xptr>ever was in the counting-house - he was taken up for this - he is now a polisher in the cabinet line - I came here last sessions to give him a five years' character - I have known him twenty-six years.</p>
               <p>MR. LEE. Q. During the five years he worked at Messrs. Broadwood's, who paid his wages? A. I did - I hired him, not they - part of the work is done in Bridle-lane and part on the premises - my nephew worked on the opposite side of the way from the counting-house, in the square yard - he had no business in the counting house, or any where but in the polishing room, unless I sent him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. In what respect was the parcel different to this? A. Instead of being rolled in this manner, the paper was twisted at both ends.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was it wrapped up? A. It was- I did not open it - this is the paper which was round it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How can you say that is the same piece of silk? A. First, from the number on the paper, and the handwriting, and the number on the roller - the quality is the same as we use; but I cannot swear it is the same silk - I think it was delivered to us on the 24th or 25th of March - I saw it there on the 25th of March - it was received by the prisoner then - I was not present - I saw two other pieces lying with it; one blue, and the other the same colour as this - there was no silk missed.</p>

               <p>CAESAR LONG. On the 14th of November I lost my watch and seals; I think I was in <placeName id="t18271206-164-crimeloc871">Artillery-lane, Bishopsgate</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Do you undertake to swear you did not drop your watch by accident at the tobacconist's? A. I do not recollect that I did; I swear it was in my pocket previous to missing it; I cannot say I did not put it inside my trousers instead of my fob; I took the other woman into custody; she was discharged after three examinations - I did not feel it taken; the tobacconist's is in Artillery-lane - I will not swear either of the girls took it; I have no mark on the watch - I know its appearance and the name; I swear positively it is mine - I put it into my fob, to the best of my belief - I find the prisoner bears an excellent character, and supports his father and mother.</p>

            . I sold this watch to Hoppe - I bought it of the prisoner, on Thursday, the 15th of November, between five and six o'clock in the evening; he came to my house and asked four guineas for it - I gave three guineas and a half - I lived at No. 8, Goulston-square - I did not ask where he got it, nor did he tell me - I am certain he said nothing about it; I had bought watches of him before - he dealt in them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give no reason for selling it? A. He said he would not sell it for that if he had not wanted money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where do you live now? A. At No. 95, Long-alley, Sun-street; I had lived in Goulston-square about twelve months - I am in the watch line - I often buy second-hand watches, without asking questions of people; I know I sold it for 4l. 15s. a day or two after; the officer desired me to attend at the office - I said there that I bought it of the prisoner - I can prove it by a gentleman, who is not here - his name is Emanuel Josephs - he is constantly in Wales, but comes to town once or twice a year; I told the officer directly that I bought it of the prisoner; he deals in jewellery, and sells at a stand; Josephs left town last Sunday week - I told the Alderman he could prove it.</p>

            . I am an officer. I apprehended Levi.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did he say Josephs was present when he bought the watch? A. Yes, and that he was in Wales; I believe I mentioned this before the Magistrate myself - he said he got 3l. 15s. in money, and 1l. in segars, for it; I afterwards went and took the prisoner - I asked if he knew anything of a watch which he had sold Levi - he said, "What Levi?" I believe I said,"Of Goulston-street;" he said, "Yes, I know - it is Levi the cloberer;" I asked if he had sold him a watch; he said No; but as I was taking him from Harrow-alley, where I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182712060085"></xptr>found him, he said he had sold Levi several watches; and after the examination, he said he could not tell whether he sold that watch or not; he said at first that he recollected nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the Thursday after the robbery a gentleman, named Smith, sold me a watch for 3l. 5s. and I sold it to Levi for 3l. 6s.; I had sold him several in a fair way of trade, but the watch produced is not the one I sold him: I would not sell one for 3l. 6s. which he could sell for 4l. 15s.</p>

            . My house is No. 24, Spital-square, in the Liberty of Norton-falgate; it is extra parochial. On Wednesday, the 27th of May, when I came home, about half-past five or six o'clock, in consequence of information, I went to the warehouse, and found it broken open - a wooden window, which had originally been a door, and slides up and down, was taken down - I found every thing on the counter as I had left them in the morning, and did not examine the rest of my stock till Saturday morning, when I had to execute some orders, and the very goods I wanted to send out were gone - I reckon that above nine hundred yards of silk were gone; I was in the habit of seeing it every day, and am sure it was there on the Tuesday and Wednesday morning - I know it was there; I missed fourteen pieces, containing about nine hundred yards - the value is about 320l.; the shortest piece was worth at least 12l. - I am certain no piece was worth less than 5l. On the 7th of August I was going along the Quadrant, in Regent-street, and saw part of one of my pieces of silk in the shop of Mr. Poulson, a tailor; I went in, and asked the price of it - I examined it, and was sure it was mine; Poulson gave me a pattern of it, and on the 20th of August I went there with an officer, and found the piece in the same state as when I first saw it - I brought it away, and there was a short length of another piece; the officer has them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you any other name? A. No, nor any partner; I reside at the house - the silks were on the ground floor.</p>
               <p>Q. How does it happen that you did not discover the robbery the next morning? A. Being trustee to an estate I was obliged to go out next morning early - the property might have been stolen between the Wednesday and Saturday, for what I know; I was in the habit of seeing those fourteen pieces of silk every day before Wednesday - I was busy out of doors on Thursday and Friday- when I was at Poulson's I fixed on one piece of silk, which I said belonged to me; and it did not afterwards turn out that it had been in the shop for six months previous- I went to Mr. Shoolbred's and saw a good many pieces of silk, but none of mine; there were several young men there- I do not recollect seeing a little boy; I saw Mr. Shoolbred's brother - I fixed on a piece of silk there I thought was mine, but found afterwards it was not; no little boy spoke to me about it - there was a young man who said it had been in the shop six months.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you not ascertained that it had been there previously, and did not belong to you - would you not have sworn as positively to that as you do now to the silk in the indictment? A. No; because I found it was a different colour - mine was gold and blue, and that was yellow and blue.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182909100152"></xptr>COURT. Q. You saw a piece of silk at Shoolbred's which you first thought was yours? A. Yes; but I examined afterwards and found it was not; I speak to the two pieces found at Poulson's, because I only made one piece of the brown with the blue and white selvedge, and the other piece I can swear to by the selvedge.</p>

            . I was servant to Mr. Bloom at the time of the robbery - I went down stairs to answer the bell about four o'clock, and saw the wooden window of the warehouse was taken down; it had been safe when I saw it in the morning, about half-past six or seven o'clock - I had passed it after that, and had not observed it out; I had been by in the course of the morning, it was safe the last time I went by; when I found it down I informed Miss Bloom - the sash-lines were cut, and the window put down on the ground.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Your master was out? A. Yes; I do not know what time he came home - he was informed the shutter had been taken down and the rope of the window cut; there was no alarm made till he came home; I cannot say how many people had been to the house between half-past four and six o'clock - persons had been to the house; I was engaged up in the parlour, and Miss Bloom was up in the bed room: I was down in the kitchen from twelve o'clock to half-past four; I cannot see the wooden window from there - there is a middle door before you enter the place where the window is - my mistress was in the parlour and sometimes in the bed room from twelve to four; I had not seen any persons near the premises outside - the robbery was not committed before two o'clock, for I was down in the kitchen before two, and I know that Miss Bloom went into the warehouse about three.</p>

            . I am a tailor, and live in the Quadrant, Regent-street. I bought both these pieces of silk, which are claimed by the prosecutor, of Mr. Shoolbred, in Tottenham-court-road - I bought the brown piece on the 23rd of June, I cannot exactly recollect when I bought the other - here is the invoice of it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is the brown a common or uncommon pattern? A. Very common; I have purchased many silks of the same make, but never bought any of exactly the same colour; the manufacture of the silk is very general, there is plenty of the same material made - I know by the invoice I bought it of Shoolbred, and can swear it is the piece I bought of him - I had no other of the same colour; I cannot say whether it was delivered in my presence or that I received it myself; I have no knowledge of any other silk being in the house, and will swear I had it from nobody but Shoolbred, though I might not be at home when it was brought - I call it slate colour, some call it grey - it is quite a common description of silk; I have no other reason for saying I bought it of Shoolbred than I have stated.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. You had no other piece of silk in your possession? A. Not of that description.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Did you make any bargain with Shoolbred about it? A. I bought it at his house; I believe I made the bargain with his brother; it was sent to my house; here is the invoice.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Is there any brown silk mentioned here? A. No; here is ten yards and a quarter of silk.</p>

            . I am a mercer and draper, and live at No. 155, Tottenham-court-road. I had a piece of brown silk like this in my possession, and sold a piece like it to Poulson on the 23rd of June; I sold him several others; I sold him a piece like this other - one of the lengths I sold him was part of a piece I bought of Vanberg - I do not know this from any mark, but there was a brown piece of a very similar colour I bought of Vanberg - it is part of the length; I bought of Vanberg one hundred and fourteen yards and a half, and produce the invoice and the cheque I paid him; it was of various colours - I bought it as one hundred and fourteen yards and a quarter of balantine on the 12th of June; the colours of these two pieces are similar, but I have no mark on them, and cannot swear to them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You have been some years in the business? A. Yes; the silk produced are the most common patterns that are made - I would not take on myself to swear to the silk of this pattern, unless I had a mark on it: I can generally tell who I purchase silks of, because I mark all the rollers - I do not mark the silk; these rolls of silk were mixed with my stock - I have only been in this particular branch of the business two years, and have had from four to five hundred pieces of silk of this description, in that time - there will generally be a little difference in the colour; I was not at home when Bloom came to my shop, but came in before he left - my shopman is not here; one piece of silk was given into my hand - there was a piece, which I knew to be mine; Bloom said nothing about that in my presence - I did not receive the silks from Vanberg; he brought me up the silks one day, and I offered him 4s. 6d. a yard; he would not take less than 4s. 9d., and took them away - next day, when I was out, he came with them; I did not receive them myself - some of my servants attended before the Magistrate.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You sent him to ascertain the value? A. Yes, just to see what it was worth - that was after I made the purchase; it was a very common kind of silk from what I saw - I cannot say this is the same; Vanberg had it to sell on commission - I am sure of that; it was about the 7th or 8th of June - I cannot state the time particularly; I was examined before the Magistrate about a month ago, I suppose - it was in June I bought the silk; I think it was in June - I generally keep books, but sometimes do not use them, and did not on this occasion.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. How long had you the silk before it went to Vanberg? A. I cannot say; I dare say about nine or ten days - I sent my nephew to borrow 20l. of him to pay for them; he brought me a 10l. and two 5l. notes - that was the same day as I purchased the silk.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The day you purchased the silk of Joel you sent your nephew to borrow the money of Vanberg? A. Yes, that was the time - I sent him to make inquiries, to ascertain the price - I bought the silk about two hours after I got the money, but did not send them to Vanberg the same day; it was about two or three days after - when the prisoner came with the silk, my little nephew called me up to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at those two pieces - you are not asked whether they are the same, but are they at all similar or like what you bought of the prisoner? A. I cannot swear whether they are at all like; I saw the two pieces of silk before the Magistrate - I cannot tell whether these are the same they are similar to what were produced before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Were those produced before the Magistrate similar to what you bought of Joel? A. They were similar to them, but I cannot tell whether they are the same.</p>

            , JUN. I am the last witness' nephew. I cannot say that I know the prisoner; I have seen him pass many times - I saw him at my uncle's the beginning of June, when he came and told Mr. Israel he had some silks to show him, but what sort of silks I cannot say; I called Mr. Israel to him, what Joel said I cannot tell, because I never see business transacted; when I called Israel down - I went out of doors and never saw any business transacted; Mr. Israel sent me to Vanberg for 20l.; I got a 10l. and two 5l. notes, which I gave him - I cannot say what day that was; I believe it was the same day as Joel was there.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you know whether it was the same day or not? A. I cannot swear it was; Joel was not in the shop when my uncle sent me for the money - I cannot say what it was for; I told Vanberg my uncle wanted to borrow 20l. - I did not tell him what for; I did not ask him the proper price to give for silks.</p>

               <p>Q. Your uncle states he sent you there to inquire, recollect yourself, and say whether you can say it was on the same day? A. It was the same day, I am sure - I came back and gave my uncle the money in the shop; I did not see Joel then, and do not know what my uncle did with the money.</p>

             re-examined. I did not advance money to Israel - I lent him 20l. which the last witness came for; he sent me samples of the silk first, by the hands of his eldest nephew - I told him the value, and in two hours he sent his little boy for the 20l.; I received the silks a day or two afterwards - I took some samples about, and got the silk, I consider, on the 12th of June, the day I sold it to Shoolbred; that I think was two or three days after I lent the money.</p>

            . I am nephew and shopman to Isaac Israel, and know the prisoner. I saw him at my uncle's shop the beginning of June - he had a bag with him; I did not see what was in it exactly - I saw some silk in it; I took some samples of silk to Vanberg, by my uncle's direction - I showed him the samples, made inquiries of him, and took his answer back to my uncle; Israel gave me the samples - I did not see where he got them from; I saw Joel come in - I remained in the shop till my uncle gave me the samples; he cut them off the silk which he bought of Joel; I cannot take on myself to swear whether these two pieces were there.</p>
               <p>Q. Nobody asked you: I ask whether in the samples you took there was any of that description? A. Similar, but not the same; I cannot say it is the same, because it is out of my recollection - it is very near three months ago; I do not recollect whether it is the same.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Your master deals in silk, I suppose? A. Yes; it was early in June, but I do not know the day; my master has dealt with the prisoner several times in silks - I cannot give the date to any particular transaction.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Do you know how long before this transaction he had sold your master any silks? A. I cannot tell - I cannot mention any time.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You have stated these two pieces are similar, but not the same; do I understand you to swear positively they are not the same, or that you cannot take on yourself to say they are not? A. I cannot take on myself to say they are not the same - I mean to say I can swear they are not the same.</p>
               <p>Q. How can you take on yourself to say they are not the same? A. Because it is out of my recollection - they are similar but not the same; I mean to say positively they are not the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell me the difference between these and those that came out of the bag? A. I cannot tell: I mean to say they are not the same - I do not know the difference.</p>

            . I am a constable of Worship-street. On the 20th of August I went with Mr. Bloom to Poulson's, and took two pieces of silk from the window, which I produce; I apprehended the prisoner on the night of the 21st, in Petticoat-lane - I took him to a public-house, in company with the street-keeper, and asked him if he knew a person named Israel - he said No; I again asked if he did not know Israel, who lived within three or four doors of the Mint, on Tower-hill; he then said Yes - I asked if he had sold Israel any silk for waistcoat pieces; he said No; I think I only asked him that once - I took him to another<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182909100154"></xptr>public-house, and left him with Adams, while I fetched Israel - he was in a room with a dozen people, and the moment Israel went in, he said, "That is the man I had the silk of;" the prisoner made no answer - I took him to Worship-street.</p>

            . I am a headborough. I was present when the prisoner was apprehended - Brown's statement is correct.</p>
               <p>MR. BLOOM. This brown silk is mine - I know it by the selvedge; I generally make white selvedges, but having a remnant of blue to get off, I put this blue to it - the silk was made by my direction; I could tell you how many threads there are in this selvedge, and how many in that; the other piece is also mine - there are eight claret-coloured threads outside the selvedge; I remember manufacturing silk of that sort - I lost three pieces of this description at the time of the robbery; two of them were sixty-eight yards long, and the other thirty-five and three quarters.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many pieces of that description have you manufactured? A. I suppose one hundred of this pattern - the brown is a common pattern, but not a common colour; they are shots - it is brown and black, what we call a cane; I manufactured two of this description - one was a white selvedge, and the other of this colour; I sold the other two years ago - another manufacturer might put on exactly the same selvedge, but that is a hundred chances to one.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Had the piece you sold the same selvedge as this? A. No, that was a white selvedge - this is blue and white.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Is it not common to manufacture with a white selvedge? A. Yes; but not blue and white - I will not swear that no other manufacturer ever made with blue and white.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Had you ever manufactured any other with that selvedge? A. No, not of this colour; I sold twenty-five yards of this piece to Mr. Maund, of Corn-hill, and have got this piece back to prove it - I asked him to lend it to me; I sold it to him on the 2nd of May, and know it to be the same piece - I went there, and brought it away myself to compare; they are both one piece - they tally exactly in the selvedge; I am positive they are from one piece, and will swear it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Of how many yards did the piece originally consist? A. Eight-four; I sold twenty-five to Maund, and six and three quarters to Kestevens, of Milk-street; about fifty yards were taken out of my warehouse - the piece found is about seven or eight yards.</p>

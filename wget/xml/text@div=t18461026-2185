                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Spring. On the morning of the 19th of Oct. I left eleven sovereigns in my drawer in my bed-room—I discharged the prisoner at night—the next morning, before I came down, I went to my drawer—there were only eight sovereigns in it, and the drawer was unlocked—I had left my keys about down stairs, not designedly, but my keys are frequently wanted for different things down stairs, when I am not at home—I am sure I had not taken the three sovereigns out myself—I left them safe on the 19th, and on the morning after they were missing—the keys had not lain about all that time—when I came home from my business on Monday, the 19th, the keys were on the mantel-piece—I then went out, and left the keys again—the sovereigns were not marked—when I went out on the evening of the 19th I paid the prisoner 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for her week's wages, for her to go before I came back—I did not know of the loss of these sovereigns till the next morning—when I took the policeman to the prisoner's I charged her with taking five sovereigns—(I had missed two sovereigns before)—she said she had not, and said she had been to London that day, and had the advice of a gentleman, and he said I should have marked my money before I put it into the drawer—what led to her saying that was, I had sent for her, and told her what I had lost—I charged her with having taken them—she said she had not got them, and I might do my best and my worst.</p>

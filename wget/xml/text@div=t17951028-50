We then secured them of course, and took them away. We have got all the things away.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the first time, and where, that you see the other prisoner? - I did not see him till he was brought into the front room, in the custody of the other officers; he was naked also.</p>
               <p>Q. I would only ask you whether the cellar stairs, on which you met, or found the prisoner Bartlett, led to any other place? - Close to the cellar stairs there was a pair of stairs that went up stairs, but the prisoners on being asked did not deny that they came out of the cellar, they said, don't use us ill, and we will be civil, which they certainly did behave very civil, and very proper. Here is every thing here, a vast quantity of halfpence finished, a great quantity indeed. They were cutting that day, not finishing.</p>

               <p>In consequence of an information we went to this Dean's-court, in St. Martin's Le Grand; on entering the court I see a window a little open, I went to the window and flung it up, and jumped in, and went to the head of the stair case, where I heard the voice of some men, saying, we are here! we are coming!</p>
               <p>Q. Where did that voice come from? - From below apparently, from towards the cellar, to the best of my hearing. Immediately Bartlett comes up, first, without his shirt; after him (I am not positive whether the other man followed or the woman) the other man came up without his shirt likewise, and a woman apparently in the same way; the woman was without a cloak or bonnet. I immediately got a candle and went down stairs into the cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the light in the cellar when you got down? - Yes; two or three, or more candles burning on each side of the press.</p>

               <p>Q. What time of the day was this? - I believe it was after twelve o'clock, to the best of my recollection. I then see a vast quantity of copper round the press; I put my fingers into the cups, supposing them to be dies, and they were very hot; I then came up stairs, and was informed by one of my brother officers that they had found a die with a stamp; the prisoners were secured in the parlour, and I told the prisoners it would save us a deal of trouble if they would tell where they were, for we should not leave the house till we found the dies; they asked to be<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179510280085"></xptr>unhandcuffed, which they were, and went down into the cellar and discovered where the dies were, and helped us take up the press, and behaved very civil indeed; round the press I found a few halfpence that were struck, these are two, (produces them) these are the sort they were at work at (produces a blank) and a vast quantity more.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Duck-street, Lisson-grove, in the parish of St. Marylebone, and am the wife of Daniel Masters—I keep a chandler's shop. On the 17th of Jan., about five o'clock in the evening, I was sitting in the parlour behind the shop, and heard the window break—I got up, and went into the shop, and saw the prisoner's arm through the broken pane—I am certain it was him—I knew him before—I saw his face—I afterwards missed 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of cheroots from the window—I went out of the shop, and saw two more boys with him—they ran away—I followed them, but lost them—I returned—I knew where the prisoner lived—I went to his house, and told his brother of it, and about half-past eight o'clock the prisoner came to me, and asked if I wanted him—I said, "Yes, for taking cheroots and cigars out of my window"—he said it was not likely he was going to rob me when he was coming in and out of the shop every day—I sent for a constable, and gave him in charge—I had seen the window secure about three quarters of an hour before it was broken.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Duke-street. On the 17th of Jan. I was sitting in the parlour with Mr. Masters, and heard the glass break—I went out with her, and saw the prisoner at window—I am quite sure it was him—I have known him three years—his arm was through the window when I went to it, and I saw his face—it was light outside—I went to the door, and he ran away.</p>

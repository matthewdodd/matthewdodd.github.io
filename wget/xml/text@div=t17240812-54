The Defendant Oliver call'd two of his Brother Porters to prove, That a Person appearing like a Gentleman just come out of the Country, with a lac'd Hat, Boots, and a Whip in his Hand call'd Porter, and they ran, but the Defendant being readiest at Hand, got the Jobb. That they saw him pull some Papers out of his Pocket, and give some to Oliver, and that he afterwards told them what the Jobb was. It also appear'd by a Broker in Court, That the Defendant Oliver brought the Ticket to him from such a Gentleman to sell; and that he not bargaining, it was afterwards told to the Complainant. So that it plainly appear'd, That the Porter was impos'd upon, and knew not any Thing of the falsifying, and that he was only imprudent in endorsing it to the Buyer, and parting with the Money to the Person who sent him, without taking an Account of who he was, and a Receipt.

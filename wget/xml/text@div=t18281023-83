            . I am an officer of the Customs. I saw the prisoner at the carriage between three and four o'clock that morning, with something in his hand like a stick - I told him to return it to the carriage, and come away to his station, which he did; he had not left the carriage when I saw him with it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was it not a staff I had in my hand? A. No, it was something long - our staffs are two feet long.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a gardener, living at 5, Albert-road, Old Ford, Stratford-le-bow—my house is at the back of the defendant's butt, about forty yards from it—the butt is in a sort of garden or enclosed ground—there are three highways close to it, the Victoria-park-road, the Victoria-road, and the Albert-road—the Victoria-park-road runs right across the back the butt—the Victoria-road is about from thirty to forty yards from the butt, and the Victoria-park-road about the same distance again—the Albert-road runs immediately at the back of the butt—the nearest road from the butt is from twenty to twenty-five yards; I cannot say exactly—if a person at the butt, and the bullet passed to the right of the butt, it would most likely go into one of the houses, or into the Albert-road—there are ten houses there—immediately at the back of the butt the ground is open as far as the Park-road, and there is a footpath leading to the Victoria-road and the Victoria-park—it is not the defendant's ground between the butt and the Victoria-park-road; it is a piece of ground belonging to some other man, I believe—there is a kitchen garden at the back, belonging to Mr. Brown, of Marquis of Cornwallis public-house, then comes the Albert-road and the houses in the Albert-road—there are no gardens at the back of the Albert-road—the Victoria-road is a main thoroughfare into Victoria-park by Victoria-park-road—there is regular street in the Victoria-park; the houses stand at the back of the Albert-road—on the evening of 3d December I had just left my own house, and was passing No. 8, three doors off, when a rifle bullet whistled over my head, and entered Mr. Bartholomew's bedroom window at No.—that is the third house to the right of the butt, No. 10 being at the corner of the Albert-road—I have been in the army nine years—I know the whistle of a rifle bullet well—the sound of it rather astonished me for the moment—I was on my way to Victoria-park station—I hesitated for a moment whether to go on, when two more came over immediately, and fell into a small heap of gravel and knocked the stones about my feet—I then turned back immediately, and went over to Bow station instead of Victoria<lb></lb>park station—I should think this was about a quarter-past 8 o'clock—the firing was usually carried on from half-past 9 to 10—I only heard it one day afterwards—I never took much notice of the firing previous to 3d December—I knew the ground—there was firing going on, rifle shooting—persons were assembled there—the butt was there previous to 3d December—I have seen it—in my opinion it is not broad enough or high enough—at the top of the sand-bags, which are placed before the butt, there are some wooden faggots, placed, long ways towards the shot—a pound of candles would have about the same effect in stopping a rifle ball as that—if you walk at the back of them you can see through them—a cat could run between them in many places—I cannot give you the size of the butt at all, I daresay it can be given; but I should think from the top of the target to the top of the sand-bags which would be at all effective in stopping a rifle ball, it would be seven feet, as far as my judgment goes.</p>

               <p>where it entered? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The report came from towards the end of Mr. Beasley's ground, which I should think would be about 150 yards—it might be a little over, 170—the other two bullets that were fired that night, and came near me, came from Mr. Beasley's ground, I can be on my oath—there is a great danger, in addition to the person not hitting the butt, of the ball hitting the ground before hitting the butt—you can then hardly tell where the shot will fly; it is just as likely to fly into the street, or go back again—in a properly constructed butt an allowance is made for a shot striking the ground.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you speak from your own experience as a rifle shooter? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I can shoot a rifle as well as a great many—I have been engaged in practising rifle shooting—I have been an instructor in rifle shooting, and also in the artillery—I have just looked at the butt to tell the size of it—it does not want much looking at it to give an opinion upon it—this model (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is something like the rifle ground—the butt is situated at the end of a cutting, which is represented by that model—there is an archway at the commencement of the cutting, but I cannot say whether the riflemen always fire through it or not—I believe that is a correct rep<lb></lb>resentation of the construction of the cutting, 'the butt, and the arch through which they fire—I can't say whether there is a gradual descent from the grounds of the garden down to the place where they stand to fire through the archway—I have not seen that part of the ground—the 3d of December is the only occasion of which I personally complain—some rifle balls, pro<lb></lb>pelled from a rifle, will be carried 1,000 yards, some 1,200, some 800—the rifles which are ordinarily made use of by the rifle corps of London will carry a ball from 800 to 1,000 yards, a fair charge being in the rifle—that would be the regulation charge—that would be about half a mile—my house is about forty yards from the butt—it was not into my house the ball went; it was No. 8, three doors from me; my house is No. 5—there are sand-bags seven feet from the top of the target—I should think the target is about four feet high; I cannot say exactly—I saw the bullet afterwards that the policeman picked up—that bullet presented the appearance of having been recently discharged from a rifle—I can hardly tell you how soon I saw it—it might have been a fortnight; but you can tell for a twelvemonth, whether it has been fired through a rifle or not—a rifle ball recently dis<lb></lb>charged from a rifle would present an appearance very little different indeed from that which it would present a fortnight afterwards—I think it would take rather a clever man to tell whether or not it had been recently. discharged; all I can tell is that this ball had been discharged from a rifle, and had received the rotary motion from a rifle—the gravel was struck up at my feet—I will undertake to say that that was the result of bullets—the two bullets came right into this heap of gravel—I did not search for them; I did not think it worth my while—I was in a hurry to get to the train to go where I was going—all I can say is that two rifle balls came into that heap of gravel within, I should say, a couple of seconds; immediately, as fast as they could fire, one after the other—they were not the only ones that came into the street the Same night, only I was not there—the sound of the discharge of a rifle could not be mistaken for the whistling noise of the ball—it is a matter of impossibility—a man who never heard a rifle before could tell the difference.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I understand you heard the crack of the rifle and the whistle of the ball almost immediately, or at the same time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; 1 am positive that those two balls that lodged in the gravel came from those</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186105050019"></xptr>
               <p>grounds—I was not prepared for it, it took me by surprise but I know the report came from the direction of Mr. Beasley's grounds—I heard the first ball hit the window—the target is in front of the sand-bags; they are piled up behind the target, and rise up above it—the height of the sand-bags is, as near as I can tell you, eleven or twelve feet from the bottom of the cutting—I should think the depth of the cutting is about eight feet; so the sand-bag would be about three feet above the surface of the embankment, and above the level of the road behind, and then on the top of the sand-bags there are some of those wooden faggots placed—with the exception of the faggots, the top would be three feet above the surface of the road behind, where I was standing—I think those houses are properly represented on the model—I should almost fancy they came nearer towards the back of the butt—the Marquis of Cornwallis stands more that way—that would be the gardens, and a piece of kitchen garden—the kitchen garden comes right up behind the butt; the Albert-road comes up as far as end of the houses, and behind those houses is another road—you can go right into Victoria-park; right through, leading right into Victoria-park—there is no obstruction between the back of the butt and the Victoria-road, and the Victoria-park-road—there is nothing to prevent shots passing over there—the distance from the butt to the farthest road, the Victoria-park-road, would be about seventy yards—the whole range is 150, so that a bullet would range some 600 yards even beyond the Victoria-park-road—a bullet ranges 800 or 1,000 yards—I dare say it would destroy life at 800 yards—quite at 800 or 900, if it would not at 1,000, and it would range a little beyond that as a spent ball—there is a class of rifle that will carry 1,200 yards.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 8, Albert-road, Old Ford—that is three doors from the house of last witness—I remember the evening of 3d December—I know this butt—I had heard the reports of the rifles before that me, at night I had heard them on other days, in the evening, and have seen persons in the ground shooting at this butt about 8 o'clock—on the evening of 3d December, in consequence of something I was told, I went up into one of my front bedrooms, and my son gave me a shot that he picked up in the room—I did not see him pick it up—I did not observe the mark the wall at that time—I did next morning—it was dark when I went up at first—it was such a mark as might be made by a rifle bullet—I after wards saw Mr. Beasley with reference to this matter—he came round to my house—I went round there in the first instance—I met him and told him I had had a shot enter my window—I of course concluded it came from there, because I heard the firing there—he came round to my house—some gentleman who came with him from the rifle ground said that he shot picked up under the window, had been thrown through the window—I said, "No one could throw it through; it took a piece out of he Venetian blind"—I had observed the state of the blind—it was a Venetian blind, made of wood, and the ball had taken a piece right out of one of the wooden laths—the hole in the wall which I saw next morning was in a position corresponding with the hole in the blind—Mr. Beasley said he had no doubt the ball had come through the window—he did not say anything more—I did not see him again with reference to this matter—he has been round to my place once or twice, but I happened to be out.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-inspector, k</hi>). In consequence of complaints made to me, I went to the defendant's premises in august, and saw him—I said, "there have been frequent complaints made to me respecting rifle-shooting in your grounds; bullets have passed over the butt, and across into the Victoria-road, and unless the firing is discontinued, proceedings will be taken against you"—he said, "do all you can, do your best"—afterwards, in the month of September, I was standing in park-road, speaking to a Mrs. Walker residing there, and a bullet passed over my head; it seemed to come from the direction of Mr. Beasley's grounds; I saw persons in the grounds shooting—I went to Mr. Beasley s—they were then firing at what they call the short range, sixty yards from the butt; they were drinking ale, those that I saw firing, I said, "Mr. Beasley, I was standing now in the park-road, and a bullet passed over my head; you had better discontinue firing; or else some person will be shot"—I forget what he said; I think his words were, "I can't stop it," or, "you know I can't stop it, Mr. Kerrisey"—I am not certain to the words exactly—I was present when he was summoned before the magistrate—he ought to have been before the magistrate on 19th December, but he did not appear then—he was there on 28th December—I had not seen him before the magistrate before 3d December—there had been no change in the grounds between the 3d and the 28th—on the 28th he promised that if the commissioners of police would suggest what alterations should be made he would make them—I said to him afterwards, when before the magistrate on 3d January, "the commissioners will not take that responsibility upon themselves, but if you will make such alterations as will prevent danger no proceedings will be taken against you"—he promised to make alterations, and asked to be allowed till 17th January—that was granted—no alteration had been made then—he asked for a month longer—I saw him on the 16th—I called his attention to the state of the but then—he asked for further time—I told him he had better appear before the magistrate to-morrow, and he did so—a month further was then allowed him—no alteration was made then—he was allowed till 14th February, and then till 14th march—he promised to make the alteration by that time—no alteration was made on 16th march, and the magistrate then decided upon sending the case for trial—Mr. Beasley did not appear on 14th march, and the constable obtained a warrant—the indictment was found on 1st April.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sergeant in the Second Tower Hamlets' Militia—I know the grounds occupied by Mr. Beasley—I had hired them formerly for two or three days from Mr. Beasley—I hired them on 2d August last, and I gave them up on the 6th because they were not safe as regards the public—the butt has been altered since I gave it up—since the time I had it it has been raised above seven feet, but now, in consequence of the wet weather and so on, it is not above five feet—it is not sufficiently high in my opinion—I saw it in December last—it was not much higher then than when I had it—it was dangerous then in my opinion.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What does the danger arise from? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not altogether from want of height in the embankment behind, but from the bullets going right and left—I have taken a view of the ground since, and it is not safe—if a bullet went to the right it would perhaps go for half a mile, and perhaps rise a hundred yards—if to the left it would go in the same direction—if fired direct it would be perfectly safe, it might hit the target.</p>

                  </hi>. I am potato salesman in Copenhagen Street, Islington—on the 19th August my wife and I were at Fresh Wharf, London Bridge I saw the prisoner there—I had this handkerchief (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in my side pocket and afterwards missed it—I did not feel it taken—my wife made a communication to me—I saw the handkerchief in the prisoner's pocket, and we went up to him and took it out—he was then on the pier—he said "I have the handkerchief, but don't lock me up"—I gave him into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I was on London Bridge on the 19th August, when my husband lost his pocket hankerchief—a boy came and spoke to me, and said he knew where the pocket handkerchief was, and I then spoke to my husband—I afterwards went up to the prisoner and told him he had my husband's pocket handkerchief, he must return it or I should lock him up—he gave me the hankerchief, and said "Don't lock me up"—I took the handkerchief out of his pocket; my husband came up at this time.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I picked up the gentleman's handkerchief. He had an open summer coat on, and the wind could easily blow the handkerchief out of his pocket, which I believe to have been the case. When prosecutor's wife asked me for the handkerchief I was about to give it her when she thereupon took it out of my pocket. The boy that has been spoken of will prove that I picked up the handerchief, and the prosecutor would have brought him up as a witness but for this fact.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a manufacturer of mineral waten, Nassau Street, Portland Street—Antrim was in my service, and had been for thirty years—his duty was to take out goods, deliver them to customers, return at end of the day, and give an account of what he had sold—Chuter was also in my service—Antrim was principal man, having charge of the van, and Chuter always went with him—it was their duty to call on a customer named Mills—on the 4th of October, I sent them to Mr. Mills—they took with them in the morning twenty-four dozen of goods, including lemouade, soda water, seltzer and that sort of thing—it was Antrim's duty to deliver them to Mr. Mills, and he had no right to keep back any—I received a communication that same day from Mr. Mills, and had others on previous occasions—I called in Antrim, and said "I am sorry to accuse you of robbing Mr. Mills"—he said "Me, sir, no! I deny it altogether,"—I said "You know me well enough not to state such, unless I was certain of the fact; a trap has been laid for you, and you have been discovered"—I told him I had been to Mr. Mills and counted the goods—I told him the exact deficiency, which was one dozen of ginger beer, half-a-dozen lemonade, and half-a-dozen of seltzer water—he said "I have committed myself"—I said "I must see Mr. Mills on the subject"—Mr. Mills called the same evening and saw Antrim, and I left them together—I returned soon after, and Chuter was called in—Antrim some time after, said "If I am on my trial I must say nothing"—I said to Chuter, "What do you know of this disgraceful affair?"—he said it was true, and he what sorry—I said "Did you know of the deficiency at Mr. Mills', on the 4th October, he said "Yes"—I said to Antrim, in the presence of Chuter, "If you have robbed Mr. Mills of two dozen of goods out of twenty-four, how many goods would you take out of ninety-six dozen," and the reply was, "Two or three dozen"—ninety-six dozen is the largest quantity delivered at one time during the present season.</p>

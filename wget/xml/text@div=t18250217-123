            . On the 26th of January, a little after eight o'clock in the morning, I placed this print in the middle of the prosecutor's shop - I am his servant. I closed the street door, and went into the back room, returned in five minutes, found the door open, and the print gone. On the 29th, master directed me to go to the Bull Inn, Bishopsgate-street, and ask for Patmore - I went; the prisoner Patmore came in immediately - I told him I had come for the print: he said he had not got it, but knew where it was; he said he could not tell who took it, and asked if he had better go back with me to Mr. Fremont's about it - I said that would be the best way. He came back, and on the road said it was at a pawnbroker's - I asked where - he said very near, and he believed it was pawned for 15 s. - that he knew it was the one we had lost, because he was coming by at the time, and saw it come out of the shop. I asked why he did not stop the man; he said he followed him to the pawnbroker's, and went in with an excuse. When he got to master's he was taken into custody.</p>

            . I am a street-keeper. I was at Mr. Fremont's when Patmore came in with Jarmen. He seemed agitated at seeing me, and stepped back. I thought he was going to run out, and shut the door. I asked what he knew about the print. He said, he saw a person go into the shop and take it, and he happened to be at the pawnbroker's when it was pawned. I said, it was very strange that he should see a person robbed, and make no alarm; and still more strange, that he should be at the pawnbroker's shop when it was pawned. He said it was true, and he would show me the pawnbroker's. I said, I thought he had better go with me to the watch-house, and I would endeavour to find the pawnbroker's myself. I took him there; he then said, he would tell the whole truth. I neither threatened or promised him. He said, another person, whom he mentioned, had committed the robbery, and told me where to find him, which I did. He said, that person gave him 1 s. for pawning it; that he had been out two or three times with him, but had never done any thing.</p>
               <p>MR. FREMONT. Patmore had called at my shop to say he could recover my print, if I sent my lad to the Bull public-house. I sent him, he brought Patmore back. I called Adams out of the parlour; his account is correct.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Cameron, a pawnbroker. On the 26th of January, Patmore brought this print to pawn for one guinea. I offered him 10 s. He said, that was too little; he thought my employer would lend him more. I said, he would be in in an hour, if he would call again. He said he would, if I would give him 10 s. then, which I did. He said, it was his own; that his name was Patmore; but he would not take a duplicate till he saw whether Mr. Cameron would lend him more. He did not call again; but within an hour, Thomas came, and asked if I had taken such a thing in, and what the person had on it. I said, 10 s. He said, "Give me the ticket of it." Whether he said it was his, or he was going to buy it, I cannot be certain. I hesitated about giving him a ticket, till he said the person's name, who brought it, was Patmore, I then gave him a duplicate.</p>

            . I am an officer. I asked Patmore, how he came to know the print belonged to Fremont. He said, he saw a man take it out of the shop. I said, if he had been honest, he could have stopped the man. He said, at the watch-house, that the man who stole the print had got him out of his place, as porter, at the Green Dragon public-house; and he had been a few days about the street, but had not done any thing.</p>
               <p>PATMORE'S Defence, (written.) On the 26th of January, I was walking by the prosecutor's house, and saw a boy come out with a picture. I walked on: he came up, and asked me to pawn it for him, and he would give me 1 s. Is it seasible that I should go into the first shop I came to, if I had known it to be stolen. He waited at the door till I came out; I gave him the money, and he gave me 1 s. In the course of the afternoon, I saw Thomas, and told him what I had been doing; telling him, the ticket was at the pawnbroker's, if he liked to fetch it. I did not take the ticket, because they did not give me the money the boy told me to ask for. A few days after, I was uneasy about it, thinking it was stolen; I mentioned it to two or three people, who advised me to inform the parties,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182502170059"></xptr>and recollecting seeing a boy come out of this shop, I enquired if the prosecutor had lost such a thing.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector B</hi>). I have been in the police 20 years—my division is at Westminster—I now receive rather more than 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, but I entered as a constable—on 25th May I went to Cooke's coffee-shop, which is in Wilton Street, opposite Victoria Station—it is not a public house—the female prisoner lived there—she is the wife of William Cooke, and she assisted in managing the business—I went there soon after 8 a.m. with Sergeant Preston and Constable Blatchford—Ser<lb></lb>geant Preston found a chest of tea there which had been opened—we took possession of it, searched the house, and found a large quantity of jewellery in a movable safe, and a deposit receipt for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I made a list of the jewellery, which was worth between 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>, and consisted of watches, rings, bracelets, pins, lockets, and all manner of things, and the stones were pearls, diamonds, and other stones—I took the man Cooke into custody, and the woman was taken afterwards on the same day—they were both taken on that day before Mr. D'Eyncourt, the Magistrate at West<lb></lb>minster Police-court, and charged with receiving a chest of tea knowing it to be stolen—there was a remand to the 1st or 2nd June—on 4th June this deposit note for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was given up to Mr. W. D. Smyth, the solicitor defending Cooke—an application was made for it to the Magistrate, who said it was to be given up to him—this is the receipt Mr. Smyth gave for it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—on the 5th June the prisoners were before the Magistrate, and were remanded again—Mrs. Cooke was bailed, and the man remained in custody—after the examination, the prisoner Butcher came to my office in the police-station adjoining the Court—I have known him for a number of years—it was then about 3 o'clock—he said "There is a couple of hundred pounds for you if you will let Cooke out and bring nothing against him"—I said that I would see about it, and I went with him to a public-house and had something to drink with him—I did not communicate with</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188008030051"></xptr>
               <p>any one that day, as I had to go in the country—I returned on the Sunday evening, the 6th, and saw Butcher on Thursday evening, the 8th, at the station—he said "It is all right, but you cannot have all the money at once, unless you let us have some of that which you have in your posses<lb></lb>sion;" I said that I would see about it, and he left; the next day (Wednesday) he came again and said it was all right, he had got a <hi rend="italic">gent</hi> who would do it—I made an appointment to meet him at the Aquarium at 9 o'clock that evening to receive the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Preston and Blatchford were about the building, but were not with me—I met him there, and he said that his friend was there somewhere, but that he could not find him; I waited until 11 o'clock, but he did not come, and Butcher then made an appointment to meet me at 11 o'clock next morning at St. James's Park Station—I went there and waited some time, but Butcher did not come, and I went to the station—he afterwards came there, and said where did I promise to meet him? I said at St. James's Park Station at 11 o'clock; he said "I thought it was here; never mind, I have a <hi rend="italic">gent</hi> who will do it in about 10 minutes;" I said "Where;" he said "Under the arches at the Victoria;" I said "At the restaurant?" he said "Yes"—I told him to go on, and I went there and called for a glass of ale, and he paid for it—while I was drinking it I saw Butcher and Smith, whom I did not know before, but I had seen him about the Court—I afterwards found that he lived in Tower Street—Butcher said "This is my friend Smith"—I had a glass of ale, and he paid for it—after Butcher had finished his dinner he got up and went out just under the archway, and said "We may as well do that little job here;" I said "Tea, what is it that you wish me to do?" Smith said "Not to bring anything further up against Cooke, but let him get out, and there is another 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for you; there is only the tea, and that he will get out of, for we are going to subpoena Hill to prove that he was with him on the day"—Smith then gave me a white handkerchief tied up; it was very heavy—I asked him what it was—he said "There is 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I put it in my left trousers pocket, and he said "Are you going to give me a tip?" putting his hand behind him, and: I said "What do you mean?" he said "Half a <hi rend="italic">sov.</hi> for myself;" I said that I would meet him at the Aquarium at 9 o'clock; he said "That is all right;" Smith said "he" or "we are now going up to see Cooke, and bring nothing farther against him, and when he is out there is another hundred for you"—Preston was watching outside—we went to the police-station and showed the handkerchief and the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Inspector Foinett—I examined it—there were 100 sovereigns in it, and it was marked "M. A. Cooke"—I then informed one of the directors, and went to Mr. Wontner, who prepared the case—I communicated with my supe<lb></lb>riors from time to time—I had the jewellery in my office and upwards of 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. In bonds and cash, which was afterwards given up by the Magis<lb></lb>trate's direction—it was deposited in Tapsell's name; I did not trace the clock—that was about two years before—I took Smith at 6, Wilton Road—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a printed list of the property, which was sent round to all the police-stations—Blatchford was a plain-clothes man—he was on duty on the morning of the 16th June, and I have not seen him since.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi>. I have known Butcher's father for nearly 13 years—Butcher is many years younger than me—I have known him from a mere youth—I do not suggest that he is more than 25—I am very little over 40—his (Butchers) father is a licensed victualler—he</p>

               <p>keeps the Cabin vincent Square, Westminster, within 100 yards of Bochester Row—I heard that he had arranged to give up the Cabin, before the tea was put into the house—I have been on intimate terms with Butcher, speaking to him and meeting him—I have said he has been an intimate friend with me—that is true—while he was keeping the Cabin, which is next door to Westminster Police Court, he had the run of the place to supply refreshment to the prisoners, with the knowledge, I believe, of the people in authority at the police court—I was on such terms as to have refreshments brought by him into my office if I requested it, and also for the men; there was a little bill of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for drink supplied a long time before this, but I did not know that it had been run up for me—very likely some of the brandy went down my throat—I did not tell Butcher in my private office that I knew Cooke when I was with Serjeant Harris in the Borough—I did not call him Cooke—I have called Butcher <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi> some time since—Serjeant Clynch is not missing; he is all right—I made inquiry of Blatchford's wife the day he went away—I did not know of Clynch and Blatchford being at Epsom races on the Derby day with Butcher in the enclosure—I have no information on the subject—I believe Church is here to-day—I do not see him in Court—I do not know that he was with Butcher in the enclosure when the Derby was run—Butcher never told me that Blatchford had said that he might take refreshment down to the cells to Cooke—he never told me that Cooke wanted to see me, nor did I answer, "I am too busy, because I am not going to be seen going down there, you go yourself, and tell me what he wants"—I believe that you said, on the hearing at the police court, that I was the last person that any one would for a moment conceive it possible to bribe—that is right enough—I acted a part as though I was about to be bribed—my words were, "All through I acted the part of a police officer who was ready to receive a bribe"—anything that Butcher suggested to me I said, "Yes, I will see," and I agreed with him that I would meet him at any place, and so on—I did not ask him from time to time, "Have you seen Cooke? Have you been to Cooke's place?"—I did not say, "I saw a lot of money in Cooke's house;" he would know that by being in Court and hearing it given out what was found in the house—I do not know who told him to come into Court—I saw him taking refresh<lb></lb>ment inside—I never told Butcher that I was there for the purpose of decoying Cooke and his friend—Butcher said that the gentleman went in after plush; that means that he did not want anything disagreeable—I did not shake him by the hand and say, "As a man, you shall never suffer for anything you do for me." Nothing of the kind—I did not give him assurance upon assurance that he should not suffer—I acted the part of a person who was willing to receive the money—I did not tell Butcher that I was going to let my superiors know, or I should not have had it—I have not read the shorthand notes—I think something was said about going to Cooke's people, but I cannot remember telling him positively—I then called him Bill, but we did not meet every day—I once said that I would meet Cooke's people anywhere—I did not say "I don't like promises, and the money can be deposited;" but I think I said, "I don't like promises"—I gave him to understand that I should not get into trouble—I will not swear I did not say, "Bill, what you do for me you shall not get into trouble"—on Mr. Richards, one of the clerks at West<lb></lb>minster Police-court, taking down what was said, I nudged Butcher and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188008030053"></xptr>
               <p>made a gesture to call attention that he was there—I was acting under Mr. Wontner's direction as to Blatchford—Blatchford did not tell me that Cooke had complained of the charge made against him being false—I did not hear of it being imputed to be false until after this affair of the money—I had some notes at the police-court; these are them—the account I have given you of the interview between Smith and myself is truer—Butcher said, "We may as well do it here," and we went out under the arches—When he said, "This is Mr. Smith," the conversation all went on between me and Smith, and Butcher stood aside. He never asked me for a tip—I said at the police-court they were then going up to see Cooke at the House of Detention—I said that I was not positive whether it was "he" or "they," but according to my notes it is "they"—I will not say that it was not "we" are going up to see Cooke, meaning Smith and Butcher—I think I swore it again in my examination in chief in answer to Mr. Wontner—it was you who called my attention to it; you would not allow me to look at my notes—the answer was, "Smith said we are going up to see Cooke and tell him it is all right;" my note says "Smith said he was going up to see Cooke"—after going away with my 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I think I saw Butcher again in Rochester Row—I sent a message to him by a man named Davidson to say he was wanted—that was when I was going to apprehend him—It was arranged to find where Smith was and where Butcher was, as they had not been seen in the Court that morning—I never had an angry word with Butcher in my life—I didn't want him to go to the House of Detention to see Cooke, nor did he say, "No, I do not want to go there."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WILLIAMS</hi>. I knew Cooke as a returned convict—I have known him for two or three years as a coffee-shop keeper—he would use tea in his trade; I never knew what his defence was till you mentioned it at the police-court—I was asked if I knew a man named Lawrence—I do know him—he is a convicted thief—I do not know that Cooke's defence was that Lawrence had brought the tea there in his absence with the knowledge of the police—when Cooke was taken into custody he said, "I have been sold like a b—bullock"—I cannot say whether the prosecution was dropped by the Treasury, because Cooke was not present when the tea was received—I have tried to find Lawrence and cannot—I have tried to find Blatchford and wish I could find him—Cooke was taken in custody in May; out of this long list of articles I can only trace the clock and the tea as stolen—he was charged with stealing the clock, but they had not finished the evidence when the charge was withdrawn—I will not allege that it was stolen property, but we did not go on with it on account of it being stolen so long ago—he was remanded four or five times in custody—notice was given to attend and then the prosecution was dropped by order of the authorities—that was some time after Blatchford disappeared—Blatchford did not tell me that he would not go into the witness-box and support my statement by perjury—Cooke was liberated and he was then charged with keeping this place as a brothel—I knew that it was frequented by prostitutes; I do not know for what purpose, they may have gone in for a cup of tea—I do not say now that it was a brothel—I know nothing about it—they did not consult me; the warrant was issued for keeping a brothel, and I gave Preston directions to execute it—that was while Cooke was in custody—I knew that the warrants were going to be applied for, but I did not know</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188008030054"></xptr>
               <p>that the charge was going to be made until the warrants were received (<hi rend="italic">Parts of the witness's depositions were here read to him, to which he assented</hi>.) After I had sworn that the men were kept in custody five or six weeks, Cooke said that the tea was left in his absence, and I fancy it was—I have never changed my opinion if the prosecution have—I do not know whether he fetched soda and brandy into my office when Butcher was there—I am not positive if I told him whether I would see him to-morrow—I do not remember sending Blatchford to Butcher to tell him that I wanted to see him at my office—I will not swear I did not—I cannot say whether he came to my office the next day after the soda and brandy was had—Butcher may have come in when Detective Buxton was there—I did not send him out in order to speak to Butcher, but I will not swear that I did not send him out—I did not say to Butcher when Buxton had gone, "Have you seen anything of Cooke's people?" nor did he say, "No"—I did not say, "Go down to his shop and tell them from me that it is all right, there is nothing more against him more than the tea"—that is an invention—I very often saw Butcher talking to Davis, a jeweller—I will not swear that I did not say, "Have you seen Cooke to-day?" nor did he say, "No, he is down in the cellar; go and see him and tell him it is all right"—I will not swear that I did not say there were three persons there—I did not say, "I shall do no more than I am obliged to do"—I don't recollect it; I did not subsequently say to Butcher with regard to the cells, "I cannot come down, but tell him to tell you anything he wants to say to me"—I do not recollect saying, "I shall be over in my office, Bill"—I will not swear I did not—Preston's name is John—I do not say that I have not called him Jack—I do not remember saying, "Be careful not to say anything, now, as I don't want Jack to hear;" I will not swear I did not—I sent Deadman to find Butcher, but I cannot say that Butcher came—he was apprehended by Preston; I won't swear he did not come to my office—when I sent for him it was to lock him up—I do not remember his coming when I sent Deadman for him, nor did I then say, "Bill, what you do for me shall never get you into trouble. I will give you my word as a man and get them to meet me anywhere they line and let me know where you will meet them at half an hour's notice"—I do not remember any portion of that—I told Smith to tell him that I would meet him under the organ at the Aquarium, and I went to the Aquarium, and there was no Smith there—I saw Butcher there, he and I were in company during the evening—I saw him the next day outside the police-station, but did not see Smith—I did not say to Butcher "Have you seen Smith?" nor did he say "He has gone to the restaurant in Victoria Street"; I did not know who I was going to meet—I went to the restaurant in Victoria Street and drank one glass of ale by myself, and one glass with Butcher, which he paid for—Smith was sitting at the table—I did not say "Where shall we go," Smith wants to speak to me, does not he?"—I said that I would meet them at the Aquarium that night—I did not meet Blatchford that night; I met him the night previous—I told him to say that I could not come—I did not say to Butcher at the very commencement of the sugges<lb></lb>tion, "Cooke has got a lot of money and somebody ought to have some," nothing of the sort—the first suggestion of a bribe was made to me on the 5th June—it was introduced by something about the weather—Butcher knew me as a highly respectable officer—he said, "There is Cooke <hi rend="italic">rounding</hi> again, and there is a couple of hundred for you on the</p>

               <p>quiet"—there was nobody else in the office, he made that suggestion perfectly of his own free will—I was not very much astonished because it had been intimated to me by Poinett that the statement had been made to him by Blatchford—I communicated with Foinett on Monday, the 7th—I never said to Butcher that I was frightened at the matter, there was too much b—rounding going on—it is very seldom I use such language as that—I will swear I did not say so, even leaving the adjective out—I did not suggest that the money should be paid to me in gold; I know that notes are traceable.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. I will not undertake to say that I did not hear Cooke say to me at the station in Preston's presence, "You have done this for me, you have sent it to me"—I did not know what Cooke's defence would be—the tea was stolen from Mr. Fitzgerald's on 24th May about 1 o'clock in the day—I had no conversation with Preston about Laurence on any day prior to the tea being left at Cooke's—I did not know of the existence of Laurence on 24th May, but I told Mr. M.

Williams at the police-court, "I do not recognize him in the convict list" and that is what I say now—there might be half a dozen Laurences in the convict list, and I did not know when Mr. M. Williams was cross-examining me that he was inquiring about the Laurence who came out on 20th May—the convict list is for the purpose of carrying out the police supervision—I must have seen his name in the list before 20th May—I do not know that Preston saw Laurence on 22nd May, I have never heard it—I swear Preston never told me so—I do not know that Preston was in communication with Laurence on 22nd May—I never heard of it—the tea was lost or stolen on the 24th in the middle of the day—I decline to answer the question whether I saw Laurence on the morning of the 25th May about 8.15—I saw a man who I know by another name, but I know his name now to be Laurence—I saw him on the morning he was apprehended, that was 25th May—I do not know whether that was the man who put the ten in Cooke's shop, I cannot say for certain—I was in the neighbourhood of Victoria Station at 8.15 where Laurence was, to do my duty; that was to go to Cooke's house—I did not know that that was the man that left the tea there the day before—I met the man there—I went to meet him—I did not know at the time that he was the man who had left the tea there the day before—I may as well tell you at once I went there to receive information from him—he had told me the night previous—I did not know that Cooke was at the races when the tea was left, nor do I know it now—he did not tell me that he had left the tea, and that there should be no mistake he had broken the chest and taken some of it out, if he had I should have taken him in custody—he did not inform me who had taken the tea there, he said that it had been taken there, and that it was taken from Mincing Lane—he did not tell me who had taken it and</p>

I did not hear from White that Laurence had given him information as to who stole a watch from a mattrass six years ago, but he gave me instructions in the matter—I do not know that the police have had their eye upon Cooke two years, for the purpose of finding whether he was the receiver of stolen goods; but I have had instructions to keep observation on the place to discover whether he was—White did not tell me that Baldwin had made a communication about Laurence—I am sure he did not—I did not know that White had seen Laurence on the night of 24th May, till after I had been with White, and then I did not know it was Laurence, I only knew it was a man—I knew Blatchford was away—I have beard that his wife has made a statement to the authorities—I was at the police-court when the case of felony was withdrawn—I do not know that it was withdrawn because Blatchford had absconded, rather than give evidence against me and White—I never heard why it was withdrawn—I was never more surprised than when I heard it—I have no idea that it was withdrawn by the Treasury in consequence of Mrs. Blatchford's statement—I heard of her statement—I never heard that the prosecution had been withdrawn with reference to the felony because Blatchford would not give evidence against me—I have heard in conversation that Mrs. Blatchford made a statement, but it was not told to me, nor did I hear that White's name and mine were mentioned in it—a conversation was going on at the Regency, in Regent Street, and I overheard that she had made a statement, but I took no further notice than what I have told you—I heard it after the charge against Cooke was withdrawn—I did not know what statement she had made—it did not connect itself in my mind with the withdrawal of the prosecution, because whenever any of Blatchford's friends came I made it my business to go away—I did not shut my ears because I heard it, but I am ignorant of the statement she made, and I do not know now—I have not the slightest idea that the prosecution was dropped because that statement was made to the Treasury as to the <hi rend="italic">bond fides</hi> of the statement against Cooke—I did not hear the conversation between the man and White, and I did not know that White had an appointment to meet Laurence at 8.15 a.m. on 25th May; but I know that he did meet him—when I was going there I knew the object, but I did not know whether he was Laurence or McKenzie—I merely went</p>

            . I live in White Lion-street. On the 20th of June, about seven o'clock in the evening, I was in <placeName id="t18200628-80-crimeloc450">Rose-lane, Spitalfields</placeName>

I ran after them crying stop thief. I believe the prisoner is the man that took my watch - but I am sure he was one of the three. The people all made a fool of me, and would not follow him.</p>

            . I was in Rose-lane, talking to Read, and saw Kain with his bundle - two men in blue and one in green went up to him, the man in the green coat snatched his watch - it was the same coloured coat the prisoner has on. I think him to be the man by his appearance. I never saw his face before.</p>

               <p>JOHN MANCE. I am a constable. I apprehended the prisoner ten days after the robbery, from the description Kain gave me - there is another man who answers the description. I have not seen that person since. Kain said he had no doubt of the prisoner.</p>

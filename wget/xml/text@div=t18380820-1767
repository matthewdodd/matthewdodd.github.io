                  </hi>. I am a chair and sofa maker, and live in Clipstone-street, Marylebone. In March, 1837, I purchased a mahogany outside flitch of Mr. Roberts, of John-street, for making the back legs of chairs—it was what is called plum-pudding mahogany—it has a speck like plum<lb></lb>pudding—I employed a person named Warner to saw the wood for back<lb></lb>legs of chairs—it would be necessary to saw away some circular pieces-in April I bought the other flitch off the same log—that was all that Mr. Roberts had—that was cut into thirty-six back-legs—after these seventy-two pieces were cut up, they were put out on the front of the shop for seasoning—I had used some of them, but I never sold any—they are not turned—I only sell chairs entire—I thought about Christmas there did not seem so many as there should be out of door—on the 30th of May, Stadley's brother came to me-in consequence of what he stated I applied to Mr. Rawlinson, the Magistrate, and went to the prisoner Stud<lb></lb>ley's shop, in Castle-court, Castle-street, which is about a quarter of a mile from me-when I got there I saw the two prisoners, Studley and Bird, at work—it was a chair-maker's shop—I inquired for Studley and Bird, and they were pointed out to me—I asked if they had got such things as back-legs of, chairs cut out of five inch, or five and a half inch flitches of wood—they said they had got nothing of the kind—I cannot say which an<lb></lb>swered—I think it was Bird—I asked if they ever purchased such things—they said they did not, they always bought the plank and cut them out themselves—I saw about half a dozen legs standing behind one of their benches—I took up one of them, and said, "This is my wood." I then called up the officer, who was down stairs, left him in the shop, went to the office, obtained a search warrant, and returned immediately—I gave it to the officer—he searched the shop, and I pointed out all my wood to him that I could see—I found fourteen or fifteen back-chair legs, I should think to the shop, and sixteen that were cut into thinner legs—I have a</p>

               <p>piece of the wood that has been cut away from the semicircular part, and other legs to match—I told the prisoners I knew the wood—that I bought it of Mr. Roberts—they said they had bought it from Mr. Roberts—the other pieces were found, some behind the journeymen's bench, and some in a loft, and ten pieces put up in a rack out of the way—I think I lost about two dozen, or two dozen and a half—the quantity I found there would not make it up—there are some of the pieces not cut, and there are some of the pieces cut down—(<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>)—I never saw pieces for sale in this state.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable. On the 30th of May I accompanied Mr. Kerr to the prisoners' shop, in Castle-court—I waited in the shop while he went for a search warrant—I then showed it to the prisoners, and told them that I was searching for back legs of chairs—I found five pieces behind the bench of Bird—some of them were cut down, and some were entire—I found about nine under the bench, some covered the with other timber, and others exposed—there were some beams over the benches to support the premises, and I found about sixteen or seventeen there—I called both the men together, and said these pieces Mr. Kerr had iden<lb></lb>tified as his; how could they account for it; but they need not say any thing unless they chose, as they would have to go before the Magistrate-Studley said, "I bought the wood of Mr. Roberts"—I asked him how long since—he said about six or seven months-Bird said about five months, or thereabouts—Mr. Kerr went with me and the two prisoners out of the shop-as we went along I asked who cut these back legs out, and Bird said, "A man of the name of Warner"-Studley said "Warner" also—I asked how long they had been cut—they said, "About three or four months"—I asked where Warner lived—they said they did not know; they could not find him-Bird, upon a question put to him before the Justice, said he had a bill at home of this timber that he bought of Mr. Roberts—the Magistrate allowed him to go and fetch it—this is the bill he afterwards produced—(<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)-Warner was apprehended as the thief, but Studley's brother was not forthcoming, and he was discharged.</p>

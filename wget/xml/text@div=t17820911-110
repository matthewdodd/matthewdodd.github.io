On the 26th they sent to let me know that a man had been with a draft, who came from a gentlemen at the coffee-house; the note was shewn me, and I knew it not to be my hand writing; the waiter who saw him write the note, is here.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am clerk to Messrs. Drummonds; on Saturday morning a waiter brought a letter, which I gave to the person appointed to open letters; he said he was to have five guineas; Mr. Aston came some little time after, and said the servant had robbed him; I told him we had paid two drafts, and shewed him the drafts, which he declared were not his handwriting. On the Monday morning a person who is one of the witnesses came with an order for the payment of ten guineas; I have the order; I think Mr. Chaplin brought it, he wrote his name, at my request. (The order read as in the indictment.)</p>
               <p>Do you know Mr. Aston's hand-writing? - I thought I did, but I was deceived.</p>
               <p>Do you know it sufficiently so as to swear to it? - I think I do.</p>
               <p>Can you undertake to swear whether it is Mr. Aston's hand-writing or not? - No, I cannot, tho' at the same time I believe it is not.</p>
               <p>You are acquainted with Mr. Aston's hand-writing, are you? - I have seen him write several times.</p>
               <p>Why do you not believe that to be his hand-writing? - Because I have compared them, and the difference strikes me more forcibly.</p>
               <p>Did you pay the money? - I did not, we detained the person that brought it, and sent for a constable.</p>

               <p>Court. Is not there the waiter's name on the back of it, who wrote that? -</p>
               <p>Chaplin. It is my hand-writing.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Aston. Is there any body here that knows your hand-writing better than Mr. Smith; you are not competent to give that evidence yourself? - No my Lord.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Smith. Have you been used to see Mr. Aston's drafts? - I have seen several of them, but he did not draw often, it is very much like it especially the word Aston, I cannot say the two H's are so much like it.</p>
               <p>To Chaplin. I asked you before, whether you knew the contents of this letter? - I did not.</p>
               <p>It was sealed up when he gave it you, are you sure of that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you see the prisoner write any part of it? - I was standing very near him, I saw him write, and he sealed it up, and gave it to me; I believe that to be the paper he was writing.</p>
               <p>Then the letter he gave you was not finished? - He ordered pen, ink, and paper, I brought it; says he, stand by me till I have done, I believe that to be the paper he was writing.</p>

            . I am a Greenwich pensioner. I was at Walker's house on the 29th of December; they sent for the prisoner to get his rent; he came, and Mrs. Walker said,</p>
               <p>"Here is your rent, and 9 s. I have paid for land-tax." He would not deduct it. I saw the 15 l. promissory note, drawn by John Thomas. I cannot read, but I witnessed the note, as I know Thomas, and knew it was the note I witnessed; she pulled it out of her pocket book, to get the land-tax receipt, and put the note on the bedstead. The prisoner had been ordered out of the house; he came in again, and snatched the note up; I followed him out, and saw my mark on it. He refused to deliver it up. I asked him several times; he said he would see her d - d before he gave it her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you lodge in the same room with Walker - A. No. I sleep in the parlour; this happened in the parlour. I should know the note again by my mark. I saw it drawn; it was on a stamp. I have been to his house twenty times to ask him for it; he always said he would see her d - d first. He charged me with an assault at Clerkenwell, but they laughed at him. I have arrested him for money he owes me.</p>
               <p>Q. He has walked here to-day, not being in custody - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner, in his defence, denied having ever seen the note, and stated that the witnesses had combined together against him, because he had refused to assist Barrinton in personating a seaman who had a large property coming to him from Government.</p>

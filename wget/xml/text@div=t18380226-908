I was on duty on the 6th of Feb<lb></lb>ruary, about six o'clock in the evening, at a turning at the back of Ken<lb></lb>nington-common—I saw the prisoner coming along, with a pair of springs on his shoulder—I followed him to the common, and asked him where he brought them from—he said, from his master, Mr. Kesterton, of Camberwell—I said, "What has been done to them?"—he said, they had had a new plate on—I looked at them, but did not see any—I asked him where he was going to take them to—he said "To Vauxhall"—I asked him "Who to?"—he said, "To a steel manufacturer"—I said I thought it was not very probable—he then told me he was going to take them to Westminster—I then took him back to His master, and found they had been stolen.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Avery Baker, who keeps the Crown and Horse-shoe public-house, Holborn-hill, in the parish of St. Andrew, Holborn. Last Friday night, at eleven o'clock, I went up to my bed-room, on the second floor—I found the bed-room door open—I had locked it myself at four o'clock, and put the key into my pocket—I had it in my pocket when I got to the bed-room door—my husband also has a key—I did not go into the room, but I could see my drawers were open, and my clothes scattered on the floor—I immediately ran down stairs, without going into the room, and, on the first floor, there is a stair<lb></lb>case door which locks—it is kept locked to keep the parlour customers from the bed-room—I ran down stairs and locked that door after me, to keep the prisoner secure up stairs—I had not seen or heard any body up stairs, but the prisoner followed down the stairs close after me, and tried the door which I had locked—he then got over the banisters—I called "Stop thief" or "Thief"—he came through an opening on the stair<lb></lb>case, over the banisters, above where the door was locked—I seized hold of him by the collar, and continued calling "Thief"—he broke from me, and went into the front parlour, where he had been with two friends taking refreshment—the front parlour is on the first floor—I followed him into the parlour, and laid hold of him again, and kept calling "Stop thief"—he broke from me, and ran down the stairs—(there was no key in the bed-room door, when I saw it open—it must have been opened by a false key—there was no violence used to the door)—he ran down stairs into the passage—my servant and a witness stopped him in the passage—I went up stairs afterwards with the watchman, and found a hat on the second flight of stairs, beyond the door which I had locked, between that and the bed-room door—the prisoner had no hat on when he came through the opening by the banisters—I found a masonic apron of my husband's in the hat, and two handkerchiefs of my husband's—the apron had been in a drawer in my bed-room—a light-coloured silk handkerchief was also found in the hat, which did not belong to us—I went up to my bed-room with the watchman—I found all the drawers open, which I had left shut, but not locked—I saw my husband's shirts and things thrown on the bed, and some on the floor—two shirts and a shawl were picked up in the passage, when the prisoner was seized down stairs—I could not see any thing in his hands, when he passed me—the shawl is mine, and the shirts my hus<lb></lb>band's.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant at the Crown and Horse-shoe. The prisoner came there about ten o'clock that night, with two more men—they went into the parlour on the first floor—that is not reserved for particular customers—they called for a pot of half-and-half and two slices of bread—I took it up stairs to them—I did not go into the room after that, till I heard the alarm—I was waiting at the bar for some gin-and-water, and heard a cry of "Thief," about eleven o'clock, from my mistress—the two men passed me whom I had seen with the prisoner in the par<lb></lb>lour, (they had come in with him,) and the prisoner passed me in the passage, running through the passage—I laid hold of him—he had no hat on—I said nothing to him—when I stopped him, he had two shirts and a shawl under his arm—he dropped them at the time I took hold of him—they were picked up—I did not look at them—the party did not pay for their refreshment.</p>

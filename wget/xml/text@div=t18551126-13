                  </hi>. I am barman to the prosecutor. On the night; of 1st Nov. I was in the house, and about half past 12 o'clock I heard the shutter broken down—I listened for a moment, and heard him at the stair foot door—I ran to the door at the top of the stairs, and still heard him trying to force the door open at the foot of the stairs, which leads into the house—the skittle ground is under the house—it was formerly a kitchen—I called the policeman, and went down, and found the prisoner in the skittle ground, behind the door.</p>

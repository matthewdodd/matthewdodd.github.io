I came to London, and being a stranger, I enquired for a lodging in Whitechapel: a man directed me to the prisoner's house: I went in, and asked her if she had lodgings to let? she said, yes. I took the lodgings, and was to pay a groat: I had the things mentioned in the indictment tied up together: I was going to my husband the next day; I left my bundle with her, and went to Aldermanbury; I went out about eleven o'clock, and returned about two or three; and when I enquired for the bundle, she said, the man that directed me to her house, came and aske d for it, and she delivered it to him. She knew the man was a stranger to me, for I thanked him for directing me there: I never got my bundle again.</p>

               <p>I came to London to meet my husband: I asked for lodgings at that house; the woman let me live there: she is now gone into the country, and left me in charge of the house: this woman came with two men, and asked for lodgings: I said, my mistress is not at home, but you shall have a clean bed and sheets; the men staid above an hour with her. When she went out, she said she would come back again, and left her bundle; but she never gave me charge of it. About half an hour after, one of the men came and asked for the bundle, and I delivered it to him: the woman and the other man staid all Saturday and Sunday, and then they took me up on the Monday.</p>

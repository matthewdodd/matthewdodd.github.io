On the 13th of September he lost a piece of fustian, in the evening; I did not see it taken - the witness told me of it; I ran out, and saw the prisoner walking up the street - I went close up to him; he seemed to have something under his smockfrock; I went back to the witness, and said, "Is that the man?" he said Yes; I cried, Stop thief! he ran, and I pursued him - the Police-officer took him, and the fustian was picked up in the road; I did not see him drop it.</p>

            . On Monday evening, the 13th of September, I was on duty, and heard Stop thief! called I turned, and saw the prisoner running - he ran into a corner, and I took him; there was a stage-coach going by at the time - he crossed the road; this fustian was picked up.</p>

            . No, I said I could not stop from my business, and the Policeman said, "You will be paid your hire;" he did not say any particular sum.</p>

               <p>JURY. Q. What are you? A. A labourer; I wanted to return to my own country - the Magistrate said I should be paid my expences; I had only come to this country in July.</p>
               <p>JOHN BOARDS. I am a pawnbroker. I came here on another trial - I have known Sheehan by sight for three or four years; he has come to my shop - I think not this year.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Are you sure you are not mistaken? A. Yes - I thought directly I knew him; he has pawned things at our place.</p>
               <p>COURT to JAMES PARTRIDGE. Q. Was it possible for Sheehan to have taken this, and thrown it down where it was picked up? A. I do not know where it was picked up - I saw nothing but a stick in his hand.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to WILLIAM PEASGOOD. Q. Was it not possible for me to get away? A. If he had known the place he might - our serjeant did say I had done a good thing for myself; I have supported Sheehan ever since - he was bound over to appear, and there was no one else to support him.</p>

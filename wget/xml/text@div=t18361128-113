                  </hi>. I am a licensed hawker, and live in Cock and Hoop-yard, Houndsditch, when I am in town. On the 30th of November I went into the White Hart tap, at Cranford-bridge—I had a jewellery box, which I put on the table—it was shut, but not locked—the prisoner was there, near the table—I went to another part of the room, and was absent from my box about ten minutes—I then returned to it, and took it out—Royce spoke to me, and I opened my box, and missed six necklaces, which were safe in the box when I put it on the table—I went back to the house, and asked the prisoner if he had taken any necklaces out of my my box, and if so, to give them back to me—he was in a passion, and wanted to fight me, and said he had done no such thing—he went cut into the yard to look for them, but he jumped over the river there, and ran away.</p>

               <p>at the White Hart tap, and saw the prosecutor come there, and go out—when he was gone out at the door the prisoner said, "G—strike a b----hump on his back," and he put his hand in his breast, pulled out these beads, and said, "I have done the b----Jew"—the prosecutor returned into the tap—the prisoner went out into the dung-yard, and hid the beads, and then ran away.</p>

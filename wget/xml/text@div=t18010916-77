             sworn. - Q. How old are you? - A. Going of fourteen; Mrs. Miller asked me to go with this piece of veal; I went with it, and got up behind a coach; when I had got about half way to Sommers-Town, the prisoner called me down, and said I should make his meat all over dust; he said I was going to No. 5, Polygon; I said I was; he desired me to give him the change, and ask for the half-guinea at the house; he told me the person's name was Allen; I am sure the prisoner is the man; I could not find any such person there. About three weeks after, I saw him again in Wells-street, picking his nails; I told him I wanted him; he said, what for; I said for the half-guinea; he said I was mistaken in the man, it was somebody else; I said, no, I was not, I could swear to him; then he said, come to my office, in Oxford-road, and I will give it you; then he took me down Berners-street, and said, d - n your young blood, come along with me to the woman, that was Mrs. Miller; and as we were going along, he gave me a blow in my side, and knocked me down close to an area; if I had been an inch farther, I should have gone down the area; then he ran away; I called out stop thief, and he was pursued and taken.</p>

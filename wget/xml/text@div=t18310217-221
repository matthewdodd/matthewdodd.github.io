            . I am an apprentice to Mr. Peter Savage, Moore's-alley, Norton-falgate - he is a chimney-sweep. I have known the prisoner these five years; he was in the habit of bringing soot to my master, about six months before he was taken - when he was engaged in shooting the soot, I used to hold his cap, and I used to see a handkerchief in it; I observed it particularly - I noticed a tear in the corner, and three letters on it; I have had it twenty times in my hand - there was a cook-shop at the corner of Moore's-alley, which he used to frequent, and I have seen him use the handkerchief there; I remember on one occasion, we were standing at the corner of Cock-alley, and he had it in his hand - we used to call him by the nickname of Buss, and I said, "Buss, let me look at your handkerchief;" I looked at it, and said, "It is torn at the corner;" he said, "I know it is;" there were three letters on it in a straight line - this is the handkerchief, here is the tear; here are three letters in a straight line, and one below; I had not noticed the one below at that time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. When did I show you the handkerchief? A. I cannot rightly tell; it was about three days before this happened.</p>

            . I am a private watchman. I was at the corner of Fleur-de-lis-court, on the morning of the 15th of January, and saw two sweeps - one had a sack of soot on his back, and the other was following him; they came as if from Grey Eagle-street, which is about one hundred yards from there - I saw them return twice with empty sacks; I saw them afterwards in Blossom-street - Barnard was following them.</p>

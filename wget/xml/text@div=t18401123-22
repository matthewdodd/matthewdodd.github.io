                  </hi>. I am in Mr. Warren's employ. On the 24th of October, the prisoner brought Mr. Marsh's card, with an order on it for two dozen large bottles, and one dozen small—he took nine bottles, and said; "Master sends you 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and wishes you to send the rest in the course of the week"—he paid me two sixpences, and I entered it in the cash-book.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I gave him 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he asked how much I had, and said, "What do you want with 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.? 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. is enough for me"—he took 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I told him master told me to leave the other two for the other blacking. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> He only gave me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he was afterwards brought to me—he stared me out in the same way as he did Mr. Panel, and said he had paid me 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and Mr. Warren discharged me instantly, saying he believed the boy's straight-forward way—he swore me out through thick and thin—I did not send an invoice with him—I did with the carman—I credited Marsh with the 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> Mr. Warren said if I had gone there with 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and wanted 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of blacking, he would have been the first to kick me out of the place; and he said he had once put 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on a desk, and told the witness to put it in a box, but when he came home he had not done so. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> The value of the blacking was 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth was delivered to him, which was half-a-dozen, and three bottles I let him have on account of the dozen, as he said his master was out of them—we knew Mr. Marsh—the prisoner wanted to pay me 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. off of the other three bottles, but I would not take it, as it would have made the accounts <hi rend="italic">queer</hi>—I have been three or four months in Mr. Warren's service—I have endeavoured to regain my place, and have had a policeman in plain clothes to find out the prisoner's cha<lb></lb>racter, and see whether he kept company with thieves—I take my oath I received no more than 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

               <p>you delivered goods to a greater amount? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He believed the boy, being so young, and giving such a precise account of three sixpences and a half-crown, which he said he gave me—Mr. Warren said, "Mr. Monk, I believe the boy's straightforward way, and I shall not require your services any more"—I said, "Very well, but my friends will not let it rest here."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> Mr. Warren said he had taken things from him before. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> He did not, to my knowledge—he did not say my accounts had been wrong before—I cannot remember his saying he suspected me of two or three little things—there might have been a few orders posted up, which Mr. Warren scolded me for.</p>

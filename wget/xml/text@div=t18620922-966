                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Howard, a labourer, and have charge of the house, 25, Cambridge-terrace, Hackney, which belongs to James Pink—I reside there—on Sunday, the 7th inst., I left the house in the morning, about nearly half-past 10, just before Church-time—it was all secured then; no one was in it—I returned at about 20 minutes to 8—when I put the key in the door, I found the door was only single-locked instead of double-locked—I stood a few minutes, and then the prisoner, Johnson, came out—I said, "Oh, you wretch; what do you do in my house?"—I said that twice—he said, "Nothing, nothing"—I then said, "Oh, you wretch; you must do something"—he said, "I have done no harm," and ran past—I then ran across the road, and called, "Stop thief!"—some people from the next door came to my assistance, and ran across the fields, and then another young man pursued him—he was eventually caught—I then went to the door again, and heard footsteps—I said, "Oh, there is some one in my house now; what shall I do?"—then the door went open, and I saw a man going up the stairs—I cannot swear to him—I heard the window go up—I went into the kitchen, but would not have anything touched till the policeman came, and when he came he picked up the things; rings and jewellery—the door had been opened with a key.</p>

               <p>he ran across into the field—I did not see him and another man together at all—I did not, at any time, say that it was the other prisoner that I saw come out at the door—the next time I saw Johnson, after he went across the field, was at the station; that might have been about three-quarters of an hour afterwards—I saw him inside the Hackney station-house—Webb was there, sitting by the side of him—my daughter went to the station, but I did not see her speak to any boys—I cannot swear to Webb.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bootmaker, of 5, Wellington-street, Shadwell—on the evening of 7th September, I was going along Stanley-road, and heard screams of "Murder" and "Police"—I walked up about twenty yards, as far as the public-house at the corner of the road—I saw Johnson come up, and captured him at the corner—I saw him turn away from Cam<lb></lb>bridge-terrace, running at full speed; he turned into Stanley-road—three or four persons were following him—he threw away a great many things—Policeman 541 came up with Webb, and ordered me to take my prisoner to the station—I never let go of Johnson—I took him to the station, and gave him up to the inspector—I told the inspector the place where I had seen something thrown—a boy had picked up sixteen keys, a chisel, and a screw<lb></lb>driver; and a female brought in two keys while I was in the station—I asked the boy to pick the keys up, and I put them all in my pocket, and took them to the station—I did not lose sight of the prisoner at all from the time I first saw him.</p>

I am a commercial traveller, of 42, Pleasant-place, Victoria Park—on the evening in question I was in a house adjoining Mr. Pink's, and heard cries of "Thieves!"—I ran out into the back yard, and saw Webb jump out at Mr. Pink's back bedroom window on to the coal-shed into the next garden—I followed him, jumped over the wall at the back of the garden, ran, I should think, about twenty yards, and then jumped over another wall—I followed him over twenty-six garden walls till we got to the Duke of Cambridge public-house—he then jumped on to a coach-house in the Stanley-road, and there he was captured—I did not lost sight of him once.</p>

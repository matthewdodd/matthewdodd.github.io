               <p>which runs over the Great Northern lines—on Sunday afternoon 12th May, at 5.15, I was driving an engine attached to a passenger train running from Winchmore Hill to Enfield—about 400 yards out of Winchmore Hill station there is an incline on a steep embankment—as we were going down that incline I saw a number of boys; through watching them I lost sight of my road for a moment, and when my sight came back to the road I saw this large sprag or piece of wood lying across the rail; the life-guard caught it and threw it down the embank<lb></lb>ment—I then proceeded on to Enfield and reported the matter—about 15 minutes afterwards we returned on the up line, and on approaching the Same spot I saw the same sprig again lying across the line fixed against the sleeper in such a way that I do not think the life-guard would have removed it—I applied the steam break and the guard's continuous break, and stopped the train before we came to it, or it would have thrown the train off the line—I still saw the boys in the field, standing looking at me—I recognise Pritlove and Jordan as two of them, and Hollingsworth was swinging on the gate of the coal yard a little farther on—there were nine or ten boys—I sent the fireman to pick up the obstacle, and seeing a Great Northern servant coming along I sent him after the boys—there were a great many passengers in each train.</p>

I am a fireman—I was with Haydon—I noticed the piece of wood on the railway in going from Winchmore Hill to Enfield, and saw some boys in the neighbouring field, they were standing looking at us—I believe Pritlove and Jordan to be two of them—the life-guard knocked the piece of wood away, and coming back on the up-line I saw the same bit of wood with one end stuck against the sleeper inside, and the other on the railway—we pulled up as quickly as possible—I got off the engine and went and picked it up—I do not think the life-guard could have knocked it away—I saw the same two boys on that occasion—I should say that there were a dozen or more altogether—we halloed to them, and shook our fists at them—they said it was not them, and ran away—I saw a man lying in the road asleep, or pretending to be asleep, on both occasions, some distance from the boys.</p>

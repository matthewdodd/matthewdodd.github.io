On Sunday, 11th April, about half past 6 o'clock in the evening, I saw Kendall in Little Moorfields with a bundle—I stopped her, and asked her where she was taking those things to—she said she was moving them for a woman, and said she was d—d if she would carry them any further—I took her to Green Arbour-court, and saw Davis, who pointed to the house next to where he lived, and said, "This is the house she came out of"—I took her to the station, and examined the bundle—it contained eight bed gowns, two pairs of drawers, six pillow cases, three shifts, twenty-two towels, eight petticoats, four handkerchiefs, three gowns, three shawls, one pair of stockings, two pieces of calico, a glove, and a pincushion—I went back to 4, Green Arbour-court, and saw Perry on the staircase drunk, it was then about 7 in the evening—as I was going up stairs she said, "Here I am, my boy; I will go with you"—I told her I should take her into custody, on suspicion of stealing the things from the parlour below—she said nothing, but when we got outside the house she said, "If that d—d bitch has done anything wrong, I know nothing about it; I asked her home with me to have a cup of tea, and this is the way she has served me"—this apron (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is what the things were wrapped up in—Kendall asked me on the way to the station to give her her apron.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Neale - he travelled for a house in the City; he kept no shop.

               <p>Q. Did you see him, by any motion of his head, or in any manner showing that he understood what was going on, or what was being said, after that? A. No, my Lord, I did not; I told Miss Neale I thought it impossible for us to get him up stairs, and it was of no use trying - I thought it better to bring down some bed clothes; she immediately went up stairs and brought down two pillows - one pillow was placed under Mr. Neale's head, by me and Miss Neale.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he manifest by any signs, that he understood what was doing? A. No; he seemed inclined to sleep -Miss Neale put the other pillow on the side table in the parlour, for the prisoner; I then told the prisoner - he saw it was impossible for master to be got up stairs, and asked if he would be satisfied by sleeping in the parlour; he made no reply, but afterwards said he could not think of leaving Mr. Neale, he must stay with him all night, and Mr. Neale must write a note to his master in the morning, to account for his absence - he did not make use of any name then; he said, "Your master must write a letter to my master;" I then went up stairs, and fetched down two blankets, a counterpane, and a sheet; I removed the pillow off the table, put it on the ground and doubled one blanket for the prisoner to lie upon; I laid the rest of the clothes for the prisoner to cover himself; the prisoner appeared at that time to be in liquor - he appeared quite sober when he first came to the house; I insisted on the prisoner lying down before I left the room - he laid down, but said he must undress himself and take off his stockings, for he had got a very bad heel - I left the room, and as I was going out of the room he asked me "At what hour;" I thought he meant what time I should get up, and I said I would come up about seven o'clock in the morning, or a little later; he thanked me, and wished me a good night - it was then between two and three o'clock; I had a clock down in the kitchen - I went into the kitchen, and remained there all night; I continued awake till about half-past five, and then laid down - the kitchen is directly under the parlour, where I had left them; before I laid down I heard a noise like the sound of footsteps, or a person raising himself; I thought it was the prisoner turning himself; Miss Neale staid with me in the kitchen all night, and another servant, who had not been up stairs at all; that servant usually slept there - she is the family servant: there was no man in the house except Dr. Dennis, the lodger. I awoke a little before seven o'clock, and went up stairs: I observed the street door was unbarred, before I went into the parlour - I am sure it was barred the over-night; it was not open: the parlour door was standing open - I had left it shut; I went in - the prisoner was gone and master was lying in the middle of the parlour, not in the place where I had left him; he had one blanket and one counterpane over him; part of his face was covered, and he was quite dead - I did not feel his body to see whether it was cold; I put my hand outside the clothes, to feel if he had any breath, but I could not - the pillow under his head was not the one I had placed there, but the one I had given the prisoner; I observed the other pillow where I had placed it myself - it was rather pushed on the side; there appeared a stain of snuff on it from a former night;(he used to take snuff) and likewise there was the stain of some liquor having run out of his mouth; his body had been moved about a yard and a half from the place I had left it - his head was under a small sideboard; I removed the clothes a little off his face, looked at him, and noticed that his nose was bent a little on one side - his lips were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182904090022"></xptr>very black, and his face very much disfigured; I at first hardly knew whether it was him - there were black marks about his face, like wounds, but it seemed as if the blood was discoloured within; his face appeared to have been convulsed - his coat, waistcoat, and stock were gone; they had been taken off, and I found that his hat was gone- I did not observe any thing else; I gave an alarm; Miss Neale would not come up - she was too frightened; my fellow servant came up and opened the shutters; I had no candle - there is a work room behind the parlour, which shows a light; I could see all over the parlour - it had a very large sky-light, which lights through the parlour; my fellow servant went up stairs, and called Miss Scarborough, Mrs. Neale's sister; she did not come down before the body was moved, but Dr. Dennis did, and saw it in the state in which it was found; I went into the kitchen, and did not observe whether Miss Scarborough came down. (Looking at the coat, waistcoat, and other articles) these are what master had on when I left him; the gloves I know - I saw them on the morning he went out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did your master dine at home that day? A. Yes, and had mutton for dinner; he had no toasted cheese - he took no cheese that day; I am quite certain the wine was port; when the prisoner said he was to stay all night, master seemed to understand what he said, and seemed agreeable to it; I had never seen them together before - I thought the soldier seemed to know Mr. Neale very well.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Why, he called him by a wrong name? A. Yes, but I did not notice that at 
first.</p>


               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. He offered his assistance to get Mr. Neale to bed? A. Yes; I cannot say what quantity of wine had been drank; when it was proposed to get Mr. Neale to bed, the prisoner said Yes; and on his attempting to assist, they both fell - they appeared unable to stand from intoxication; when I heard the noise, I thought my master was too much intoxicated to rise, and that it might be the prisoner rising or turning himself; when I went into the room in the morning, the door of the wine-closet was open, and a chair, which Miss Neale had placed against it, moved, and a quantity of arrow-root spilled on the carpet; when I came down from fetching the key, I do not think there was any wine upon the table, except what was decantered - there were four bottles of port wine in the cupboard; I heard the noise between three and four o'clock; I do not know that Mr. Neale was in the habit of snoring, but the other servant heard a snoring, and Miss Neale said he was in the habit of snoring.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. There were four bottles of wine in the cupboard overnight? A. Yes; there was none in the morning - two had been decantered, and two bottles were gone quite away.</p>

            . I am the deceased's cousin. I saw him and the prisoner soon after they came in; my cousin appeared to be quite intoxicated - the cupboard had been broken open then, and wine decantered; the cold meat had been taken up before I saw them - the prisoner appeared quite sober; I asked my cousin if I should light him to bed; the prisoner asked me to drink some wine -I refused twice; my cousin said, "Yes, Jane, drink;" those were his words - I drank part of a glass of wine, and gave the remainder to Ann, the servant; it was the first time I went into the parlour; when I asked my cousin if I should light him to bed, he made no answer, but shook his head; the prisoner replied, "Yes, I must take part of your bed;" I asked my cousin where he had been to; he replied, "I have been to see my Old True Britons;" I had never heard him speak of any thing of that kind before - the prisoner called my cousin Dr. Dennis; I asked him where he met with Mr. Neale: he said he picked him up at Hammersmith, and he would have been dead if he had not met with him; he said Dr. Dennis knew his master perfectly well; that his master was a doctor in the army.</p>

               <p>Q. Did it appear to you, from the manner the prisoner spoke to your master, and of him, that he supposed him to be Dr. Dennis? A. Yes, my Lord; and he said he must stay all night, and Mr. Neale must write a note for him in the morning - he had then heard me call my cousin Mr. Neale; I left the room, came in again, and proposed that my cousin should go to bed - Mr. Neale sat in his chair, rather shaking himself about; I tried to place him right in the chair, and the prisoner said, "Come, Dennis;" he appeared rather tipsy, and being sleepy, he could scarcely sit in the chair - I placed him right in his chair, and then the prisoner said, "Come, Dennis, this is quite perplexing:" he spoke very spitefully indeed, and the servant endeavoured to lift him from the chair, to take him to bed - we lifted him off his chair very easily indeed; he could walk across the room with assistance, I should think: when I had lifted him from the chair, the prisoner asked me to allow him to take Mr. Neale's arm - he did so, and they both fell on the floor together; the prisoner at that time appeared to become intoxicated - my cousin was not raised from the ground; he fell with his head partly under the sideboard - I never heard him utter a word after they fell, nor saw him make any sign; I went up stairs, brought down two pillows, and laid one under Mr. Neale's head, the other I put on the table for the prisoner to lay his head on; before I left the room, I put the decanter, which was about half full of wine, into the closet, closed the door, and put a chair against it - I do not know whether one or two bottles had been decantered then; in the morning the decanter was found empty - these clothes are what my cousin wore that night; here is a memorandum-book, which I believe belonged to him, but I cannot swear to it - I cannot swear to his hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When you first saw them you thought the prisoner quite sober? A. Yes; he got intoxicated afterwards - my cousin fell under the sideboard, and was close to the cupboard; it is only a slab where we put bonnets; his head did not touch any thing - he fell rather on his side; there was nothing to impede his fall - they both fell together, unable to assist each other; I did not examine his features after he fell.</p>

            . I lodged at Mr. Neale's house- I was called to see him on the Wednesday morning; I found him dead, lying on the floor, with a counterpane and blanket over him; I examined him as he lay there, and saw that he was a corpse, there was a good deal of distortion on his nose, and his counternance rather swollen: I requested the family to send for their own medical attendant, and went down to arrange for removing my family from the house; his body was perfectly cold - he might probably have been dead two or three hours or longer - this was about twenty minutes past seven o'clock; he might have been dead five hours; his left nostril was much flattened on one side, and the point of the nose considerably compressed.</p>
               <p>Q. Would not pressing on the point of the nose, tend to throw the nostrils outward? A. The right nostril was considerably dilated: I made a more perfect examination an hour and a half, or an hour after; Mr. Kirton, the apothecary was present - there was a pillow lying by his side, snuff on the pillow, and a small quantity of liquor, as the other witness has stated; the body was dissected on the following morning, by Mr. Brooks, in the presence of myself and Mr. Kirton; the head was first dissected - there was no appearance of external violence, except on the nose; between the coverings of the brain there was a little secretion, coagulated, and in the brain were two small tumors; they appeared to have been some time forming, probably not sufficient to cause immediate death, but probably, by extraordinary excitement, they might have produced pressure on the brain, which would cause apoplexy; there was no further disease in the brain, except that the vessels were very full of blood, which they generally are in a state of apoplexy, but that does not always follow - they are more full than usual in apoplexy; the lungs were very much congested with blood: the right side of the heart, and its vessels, were very full of dark blood, particularly on the right side, and in a perfectly liquid state - this was at least twenty-four hours after death; we opened the abdomen, and examined the stomach, the lower part of which appeared to be a little inflamed, but not sufficient to cause death, I should think.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your whole view of the body, what, in your opinion, was the cause of his death? - A. From the external appearance of the nose I should consider that violence had been used; from the appearance of the brain I should give with great diffidence my opinion as to its being caused by violence or apoplexy; looking at that alone, I could not come to the belief that he had positively died by violence.</p>
               <p>Q. But taking the whole together, external and internal appearances, what in your opinion was the cause of death? - A. The pressure on the external part - suffocation. It is from those external appearances chiefly that I form my opinion; by external pressure on the nose and mouth I conceive, not on any other part of the head.</p>
               <p>Q. You have said the blood about the heart appeared in a fluid state? - A. Yes, the blood generally was so. In cases of natural death some of it would be a little coagulated generally; but there are instances to the contrary, even in cases of natural death from disease: my own experience does not enable me to decide whether, in a case of death by violence or suffocation, the blood is generally fluid. I never opened a person who had been hung, but in violent and sudden deaths it is generally found in a fluid state. I speak from having read books of science; my experience does not enable me to decide.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you had considerable experience in medical practice? - A. I have been in the profession sixteen or seventeen years; the blood of a person dying suddenly, whether from violence or otherwise, would he expected to be found in a fluid state even at that distance of time; persons dying from apoplexy are not generally cut off so suddenly; there is probably a few hours interval - my experience does not enable me to speak of persons dying immediately; death from apoplexy would follow in an hour or two, and I should not be surprised to find the blood in a fluid state - from the external appearances, and the internal examination, my belief is that violence had been used; I cannot say that death ensued in consequence of it; the violence to which I allude is suffocation, but I speak with great diffidence, taking the whole together: from the inspection of the brain alone I should probably have concluded there was enough to produce death from immediate excitement, without violence: there was a very slight extravasation of blood on the face of the brain, which is a very powerful indicative of apoplexy - apoplexy may be caused by suffocation; the nose was distorted: I did not see any particular discoloration; the other nostril was considerably dilated - death could not certainly be produced by compression on one nostril while the other was pervious.</p>


               <p>Q. You have spoken of the secretion of a coagulated lymph between the brain; was not that likely to be produced by the excitement of a considerable portion of drink? - A. Not immediately; I should think the secretion very different to the tumors; they might have been of long standing, but the secretion could not - tumors would certainly be likely to cause a pressure of the brain: finding the tumors there, I should consider the subject predisposed to apoplexy under any excitement - extravasated blood would produce the same effect; intoxication is very likely to be a fatal excitement to apoplexy; and a fall might produce fatal consequences when immediate assistance was not at hand - he had a double truss on.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not that very likely to have increased the fatal consequences of a fall to such a subject, having tumors on the brain? - A. No, I think not; there was no undue pressure there: it did not strike me as at all likely - trusses are not made to act against nature, but to act against undue pressure. I cannot see that his being left on the floor in a state of intoxication had any thing to do with the consequences.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any other apparent violence on the person to justify the conclusion that death had been the consequence of it, but when added to the appearance of the brain? - A. Certainly not: I must unite the two together.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182904090024"></xptr>I should not think a fall, and his lying on the ground some hours, likely to produce apoplexy without the pressure of the nose.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Assuming that he had fallen between two and three o'clock in the morning, and after that fall never spoke, nor indicated by sign or motion that he knew what was going on, a pillow having been put under his head, what should you conceive his state to be at that moment? - A. That would be the consequence of the fall - apoplexy had then began, very probably, produced by the fall, reckoning the state of excitement he was then under from drink: I mean to say, in that state of excitement apoplexy might have been produced, which would have ended in death by seven o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Both nostrils must have been closed for death to have been caused by suffocation? - A. No; but it must have been rendered impervious by some means, but whether it had been so I cannot say; it might have been done so with a hand or pillow, or any thing, but in the state I saw it one nostril was pervious.</p>

            . I am a professor of anatomy. I have not at present an anatomical school: I have been much acquainted with the dissection of the human body. I first saw the body of the deceased on Thursday morning, about eleven o'clock, immediately before the dissection began, and thirty hours or more after death: I remarked a compression of the left nostril; the point of the nose was a little compressed, and a trifling degree of contusion about the middle of the nose; the lips were rather firmer than they are usually found - I noticed a double padded truss, worn for a double bernia; the pressure of that could not have been attended with any consequences whatever; when the head was opened, on detaching the scalp from the skull, a great quantity of blood issued; and after sawing through the skull, between the under surface and the dura mater, was a considerable effusion of blood; we then divided the dura mater, and there was a small quantity of coagulated lymph secreted on the surface on half of the brain: after a minute dissection of the interior of the brain, I turned my attention to the basis, and in two large cavities called ventricles, was a small quantity of transparent fluid in each of them; there was a tumor on each side, about the size of a small marble; on the posterior part of the basis of the brain a slight extravasation of blood - these were all the observations I made on the brain; on opening the chest. I found the lungs much conjested with blood, and about two ounces of fluid on each side of the thorax; I laid open the membrane which contains the heart, and in that was about an ounce and a half of fluid - I observed the heart to be in a very flaxed state: I laid open the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery, which issues from it, and found a considerable quantity of fluid blood in each, of a dark colour, more than I have usually found: I then opened the left ventricle, where there was also a quantity of fluid blood, but not so considerable; there was nothing important in the abdomen except a morbid degree of inflammation, which might arise from various causes.</p>

               <p>Q. Considering the state of the body, both external and internal, to what do you attribute the death, taking the whole together? - A. If his death was not from suffocation, it must have been from apoplexy; there is no positive certainty with regard to the fluidity of the blood; no inference can be drawn from finding the blood in a fluid state: I say this as the result of several experiments; with individuals destroyed by lightning, drowning, or otherwise, the blood does not coagulate, and in natural death it does; but I believe it is not to be depended upon - it is fallacious. I am more inclined to think this death must have been produced by apoplexy.</p>
               <p>Q. If in addition to the appearances, you should be informed that the deceased, being in a high state of intoxication, fell on the floor, and after the fall, never uttered a word, or made a sign or motion by which he appeared aware of what was passing, though a pillow was put under his head, would that strengthen your opinion? - A. No doubt it would; but these symptoms are all trifling and uncertain.</p>

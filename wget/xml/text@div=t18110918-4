            . Q. Were you on board this vessel at the West India Dock - A. Yes. When I made the ship fast the captain asked me if I would put him on shore. The prisoner is the captain; I told him I would put him on shore; he asked me if I would put his trunk on shore; I told him yes; he asked me what demand I made; I told him a glass of grog, if he pleased; he said is that all you demand; I said yes; he looked over the ships side, and said there were two boats belonging to the dock, they were for the purpose of putting him on shore; I said they were not; he ordered a man into the dock boat to take charge of the boat, and said the first man that went into the boat he would blow his brains out; I said you must not do that; I went into the boat and ordered the man out, and the man came out of the boat; I went down into the boat, and called the remainder of the dock people, he shoved the boat off; about half the length of the boat from the ships side he ordered the musket up, and loaded it, and levelled it at me and the other three that were in the boat.</p>
               <p>Q. In the mean time did any thing pass between the prisoner and Gower - A. Not at all. Gower was in the boat, he aimed the piece at Gower and me, we were close together Gower was standing first; it flashed in the pan the first time.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance were you from him - A. About seven or eight yards.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Were Gower and you both in one boat - A. No. He aimed at me and Gower both the first time; I stood opposite of him; the second time he pointed at me only.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember turning round and putting your hand to your posteriors, and saying fire at that - A. I clapped my hand to my thigh, the second time.</p>

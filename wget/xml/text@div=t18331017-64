             (police-serjeant H 12). I was on duty that Sunday morning in Old Montague-street; I saw a man against some doors near Black Lion-yard; I asked him what was the matter as he was without shoes, and seemed to be in a great deal of pain; he said he had slipped off the pavement and hurt his ancle; I asked him where his shoes were, he said he had left them at No. 31, down below; he was about five hundred yards from the prosecutor's; I asked where he lodged, he said "At a publican's named Gill, past Whitechapel church;" I asked if it was near a public-house which a number of Germans used- he said, yes, it was at the corner of a turning; I asked if he had any money to pay for a cab, he said, "Yes," I sent Giles who was with me for a cab, and I assisted to get him into it; I told the cab-man where to go to - I had noticed the prisoner take off a hat with a small brim, and he had a blue jacket on - I received information about ten minutes after six o'clock the same morning; and went to the place where I desired the cab-man to go; I found the prisoner, he had this blue jacket on; this silk handkerchief was in the pocket of it; this hat and this handkerchief was by his side, as he laid on a bench - I asked if he had any keys, or any money belonging to the prosecutor, and he produced these four keys and 5s. 6 1/2d. which he said belonged to them - Buck then asked him in my presence where his things were - he said, he would find them all safe in the large engine-house, at Mr. George's; and he likewise said, "You will find my shoes there; a jacket of mine, and a hat;" I went and found it.</p>

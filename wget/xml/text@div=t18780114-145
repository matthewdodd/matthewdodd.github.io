                  </hi>. I am a checker at the London, Chatham, and Dover Railway, Blackfriars station—on 23rd October I saw Ridley's van there—this paper is a copy of the sheet given to the carman, who takes his sheet to the clerk in the office when he comes in—I checked his van about 8.30 p.m.—I looked for three crocks of butter on the van—I only found two.</p>

On 25th October the prisoner was out with a van—I received some information the following day about some crocks of butter, and I sent for him and asked him how many he brought in—he said "Three"—I said "There is one missing"—he said "I will swear I placed them on the bank myself"—"bank" means the platform.</p>

On 23rd October I found the crock of butter which has been shown to the witnesses—I took the prisoner on 4th November at his house on another charge—I told him he was apprehended for stealing two flagons of butter, the property of Messrs. Bowles—he said he thought his not coming to work would look suspicious, but his leg had been sore—he said nothing about the butter.</p>

The Doors of the House were open, and we imagine she watch'd her Opportunity to slip in and take it. But it being advertised, Mr. Smitherman the Pawnbroker brought the Prisoner to our House, and she fell down on her Knees, and swore she never took the Gown away.

            . This is the Gown which the Prisoner brought me to pledge on the 28th of Aug. She asked 4 Guineas upon it, and said it was a Gentlewoman's in the Neighbourhood, who knew me very well. I did not care to lend so much upon it, so she took it away; but in 5 Minutes Time she brought it again, and said the Gentlewoman would take 3 Guineas, I told her I would lend but 2 Guineas upon it, which she took, and I sent my Boy after her to see where<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173810110013"></xptr> she went. The Boy watch'd her into a House, and I was satisfied; but the Gown being advertised 2 Days afterwards, I went to Mr. Hayward's, told them I had the Gown, and they have it again. Then I set People to watch for the Prisoner, they sent me Word that she was at an Alehouse; I went and took her from thence and carry'd her to Mr. Hayward's. I am positive she is the Person that brought me the Gown. <rs id="t17381011-12-verdict63" type="verdictDescription">

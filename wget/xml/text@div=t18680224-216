                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Through an interpreter</hi>). I am a soap maker, of Zurich, and am living at Morris's lodging-house, Tower-hill—on the evening of 7th February, between twelve and one o'clock, I was in a public-house—I do not know the name of the street—I had two pints of beer there—I was alone—I saw the prisoners there, they seized me in the house, prevented my going out, and gave me some blows in the face, they then opened the door and threw me out into the street—I got up and they rushed on me again, McCarthy siezed me by the throat and held his hand on my mouth, Riley held me by my coat, tore it open and took my <hi rend="italic">porte monnaie</hi> out of my pocket, which contained a sovereign, a half-crown, a florin, and sixpence, they then struck me again in the face several times, and went back into the public-house—there were a great many people in the public-house who took hold of me as well, but I do not know their names—the landlord laughed at it—I had never seen the prisoners before—I was about a quarter of an hour in the house.</p>

On 8th February Blenchley came to the station, about 12.30, he said something I could not understand, but by his motions I understood that he had been robbed. I followed him to Rosemary Lane, to the Blue Peter public-house, where he pointed out Michael McCarthy, who has been discharged by the Magistrate—afterwards, from what I heard at the public-house, I went back there and took Ellen McCarthy and Dennis McCarthy, who the prosecutor identified at the station—I told McCarthy he was charged with being concerned in robbing a German: he said that he knew nothing about it—the prosecutor's coat was open—he was excited, but I do not think by drink.</p>

I took McCarthy to the station—he said "I am guilty but the female is not"—knowing the prisoners to be companions I apprehended Riley, between two and three o'clock, in Blue Anchor Yard, and told him the charge, he said that he knew nothing about it—the prosecutor said, through an interpreter, "That is the man who took the money out of my pocket."</p>

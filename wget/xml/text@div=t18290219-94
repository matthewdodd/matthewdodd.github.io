On the 7th of February the two prisoners came in to look at some gauze ribbons - being suspicious of them I watched, and while the person who was serving them turned his back, Jones took a piece and put it under her shawl; I let them stop till they were served, and told Gibbon, who asked them to walk up to the end of the shop, and in going along one of them dropped the ribbon- they had bought two yards and a half, and paid 2s. 6d, for it; I did not see the ribbon fall, but I saw it on the floor, and saw it taken about five minutes before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How far were you from the woman? A. About four yards; Heath served them, but he turned his back to get some more ribbon; I think there were four other young men in the shop, the rest were gone to their tea - there might be ten customers; we were not busy: when I saw them take the ribbon I went to speak to Gibbon, and they were still being served - I saw them put the money on the counter; I could not see who dropped it, but it was on the floor - it could not have fallen by accident; I did not tell the Magistrate she put it under her cloak - they were taken into the parlour in about three minutes; I went and told Gibbon, and followed about five or ten yards behind them.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Are you sure that the ribbon that was on the ground was the same you saw them take from the counter? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Whereabouts in the shop did it fall? A. About half-way up the shop - Mr. Williams himself was between me and the prisoners when it fell.</p>

Greaves gave me information while I was at tea; I came into the shop, and saw the pri<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182902190041"></xptr>soners and a young man serving them - after they had paid him, and the ribbon they bought had been put in paper, they were going away; I asked them to walk up the shop - they said they would; I walked a little behind them, the shop being narrow, and about the middle of the shop I saw this piece of ribbon fall down, but could not say who it fell from - I went to the other end of the shop with the prisoners and spoke to them, and then went and fetched the ribbon.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Greaves came and spoke to you? A. Yes - I did not leave them to go and call the prosecutor; it is a narrow shop, but one hundred and ten feet long - the ribbon could not fall off the counter; there was none on the part of the counter where this fell - no one was nearer to them than I was, when the ribbon fell.</p>

               <p>Prisoner HASEY. This witness went to call Mr. Williams, then picked up the ribbon, and said it was of no consequence, the ribbon was found. Witness. I called Mr. Williams to me when I went to pick up the ribbon -I did not say it was of no consequence.</p>

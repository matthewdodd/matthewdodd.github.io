            . On Saturday, the 1st of March, I was coming down Beech-street, and saw the prisoner and another young man - I thought they were going to do<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182804100125"></xptr>something; I waited and saw the prisoner leave the other at the corner of Beech-street - and in less than five minutes he came back with these kettles in an apron; the other crossed over to him - they went down King's Head-court; I went to them, and asked them what they had got; the other said he had brought them from his master, in Barbican; I said "It is but a little way, let us go there;" we went on; I said, "Where is it?" - he said he did not know, and I detained them; they had been left somewhere, for they had not them in their possession when I first saw them, and he had not time to go to Holborn.</p>

On the 14th of December I was at my parlour window, and saw the prisoner on the other side of the way; I saw him put his hand into a gentleman's coat pocket and take out a handkerchief, which I think had a green ground; he then crossed the road towards my house - I went out and charged him with the theft - he ran off; I pursued him about a yard - he threw the handkerchief at my feet, and was stopped within three yards of me; the gentleman had gone off - I did not attend to him; I do not know his name.</p>

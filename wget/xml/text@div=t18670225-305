                  </hi>. I am cashier to Burgoyne, Burbage, and Squire, wholesale druggists, of 16, Coleman Street—the prisoner was their clerk, and used to be supplied with money in advance for the purpose of buying stamps, which he kept in his desk under lock and key—it was his duty to give them out to the different persons in the establishment as they required them, and to cause them to be entered in this book, which I added up every week, aud struck a balance, giving him credit for the stamps which he represented by the book that he had given out—he would have money to go on with from week to week—I find here an entry on 8th January, "329 at 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. A. P."—those are the initials of Alex<lb></lb>ander Pride, one of the prosecutors' clerks—the whole of that is written by Pride—at the end of that week I added up the money, and it amounted to 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—that includes 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. instead of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—I did not notice that 329 at 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was wrongly carried out, and when I settled with the prisoner at the end of the week I gave him credit for the 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—on the 18th January here is "613 at 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.

A. P."—that week adds up to 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which includes 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. instead of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—it is apparently in Mr. Pride's writing, bat when it was brought to me I saw that the "1" in the shillings had recently been made aud blotted, and it is even now slightly different to the other figures, as if made more recently—I showed the entry to Mr. Burgoyne, who examined it, and the prisoner was given in charge—the officer searched his desk in my presence—it was unlocked with a key, which Mr. Burgoyne produced, and this is a list of the stamps found (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the aggregate is 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in different denominations—this is the book I kept, crediting him with money</p>

               <p>which he has expended in stamps—I struck a balance in it every week—we both settled the account in this book—crediting the prisoner with the stamps found in the drawer and the 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the last week, the account stands 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on the debit side, and 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on the credit side, which is a balance in the prisoner's favour of 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was the prisoner what is called invoice clerk? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—it was his duty to make invoices and check them—those duties would take him to different parts of the warehouse—this book is kept in a desk, and Pride could get it from there—it was not kept in the prisoner's desk where the stamps were kept—the clerk receiving stamps made an entry in this book; here are two entries in it, signed <hi rend="largeCaps">A. P</hi>.—Pride wrote that at the time he received the stamps—I am accustomed to mental calculation, but I do not know that I should notice what 350 pence amounted to; the object in showing it to me is to see that <hi rend="largeCaps">A. P</hi>. is against the entry—if I had cal<lb></lb>culated each entry I must have seen it, but I did not do so, and I never was instructed to do so—I only saw the book at the end of the week to see that <hi rend="largeCaps">A. P</hi>. was there—I do not remember how long it has been the custom to put <hi rend="largeCaps">A. P</hi>., but perhaps seven months, the book begins in June, 1866—here are no initials at the beginning—it is my duty to check the amounts every week, I do that before <hi rend="largeCaps">A. P</hi>. is put there—I have done so for twelve months perhaps, and, though it was no part of my duty, I cast out the amounts occasionally.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk to the prosecutors—it is my duty to send out the foreign price lists, for which I require stamps—I made a I memorandum on a slip of paper of the number I wanted, which I took to the prisoner, and he gave me the stamps out of his desk—I then made an entry in the stamp book and put my initials against it—this is the stamp book; this entry of 8th January is my writing, 329 at 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., as I wrote it, but it now stands 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I did not always keep the memorandums I made when they had answered their purpose, I put them down anywhere and treated them as waste paper, but I have found two of them—the entry of 19th January, 813 at 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., is my writing, but I made it 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., the I has been added since—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the memorandum I made at the time, 813 divided by 12, 67<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I found that among several other papers on my desk after Mr. Burgoyne spoke to me for an explanation—this entry of 6th February is my writing, 341 at 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., but I entered it 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the memorandum I made on that occasion, 341 divided by 12, 28<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; on the same day here is 100 at 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., that is correct.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am a bootmaker, and live in York-street, Church-street, Shoreditch. On Monday, the 27th of April, 1829, I apprehended the prisoner—I was at that time headborough—I am sure she is the person—I took her into custody for robbing Mr. Todd, on the Pavement, Moorfields, and another person—I was present at the trial, and produce a record of her conviction and judgment, from Mr. Clark's office—I saw it signed by Mr. Clark, the clerk of this Court.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer of Worship-street. In conse<lb></lb>quence of information I received on the 7th of last month, I apprehended the prisoner in Gloucester-street, Haggerstone in the street—I said, "Is your name Sarah Morris?"—she said, "No"—I said, "I believe it is, and you must go with me"—I told her she was charged on suspicion of having returned from transportation before the expiration of the term she was sent for—she said, "I am not the person"—I took her to a public-house at the corner, where I expected Hale to be—he had come with me, but was a little way off—he was in attendance there by my desire—I had received information from a man of the name of Walton—he also accom<lb></lb>panied me and Hale—I took her to the public-house where Hale saw her, looked at her in the face for a minute, and said, "That is the woman, I know her very well," and he pointed out a mark at the corner of her eye—I took her to the station-house in a coach, in going along she cried a great deal, and begged hard for me to let her go, and said she would give me all she possessed in the world if I would let her go about her business.</p>

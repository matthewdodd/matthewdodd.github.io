                  </hi>. I live at 26, Alma Road, Bow Common, and am A fishmonger—about seven o'clock in the evening of 13th September I was passing Bow Common Lane, and saw the prisoner with her husband about three yards from me, and twelve yards from the shed which was afterwards set on fire—they were having a bit of a disturbance—the prisoner said to her husband, "I will set it on fire"—she did not say what—they both went through the gate; the husband waited outside in the little bit of the yard</p>

                  </hi>. I am an oil refiner, of 76, Fernley Street, Bromley—this shed is built of wood and partly of iron—it adjoins the stable by a wooden partition—it is about half a mile from my dwellinghouse—the stables are built of wood, and there is a wooden building attached to them, on the other side of which is an oil refinery divided from the shed by a wooden fence—the division is merely the width of the wood—there is a quantity of oil there—there was a pipe of oil standing close to the fence at the time—there were some shavings in the shed for the prisoner's husband to sleep on, it was his dwelling—the prisoner does not live with him, and she has not done so for nearly four years—they were separated at Arbour Square—last Friday night, about seven o'clock, I was going home with a load, and received information of the fire—I fortunately had four buckets in the van; and, water being handy, I put the fire out with assistance, but the place was all in ablaze; the flames were coming out at the roof—the oil did not catch fire.</p>

                  </hi> (Policeman 169 K). I was called, and found the prisoner standing in Bow Common Lane with Phillips, about thirty yards from the shed—the fire was out when I got there—Phillips gave her in custody—she said that she did not set it on fire with the intention to burn the place down—she was quite sober—she said nothing else.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. I was not sober—I had been drinking a great deal, two or three drops of beer and a glass of ale and some rum—a tall gentleman gave me a good shaking, which sobered me.</p>

Harry! the whole place is on fire'—it was not done with the intention to set the place on fire."</p>

I went to ask my husband to give me a bit of food—he said that he would not—I went to the shed, to see if there was any food there—I took a match and struck it, and before I could see what I was doing the brimstone caught the shavings—I called to him, "Harry! Harry! your shavings is on fire"—he said, "Let the b/—/shavings burn"—it was more his fault than mine, for if I had been strong enough I would have put it out myself—I have a home of my own, and my children are suffering there ever since I have been here, but my husband has never been near them.</p>

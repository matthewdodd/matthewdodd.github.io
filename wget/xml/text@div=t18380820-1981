                  </hi>. I live at West End, Hampstead. The prisoner was in my employ—on the 3rd of August, I lent him a cart to get manure—there was a mare in it—it was in a perfect state when he went away-when he brought her back she had a very deep wound under her throat, cut with a sharp instrument—it appeared a stab—I asked him how he came to think of stabbing the mare—he said, "Lord bless you, Sir, I would not do any thing of the sort to the dear animal"—I took it out of his charge and gave it to another man—I told him he must answer for his conduct—I sent my son for an officer, and while he was gone the prisoner made his escape.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in East-street, Hampstead. On the 3rd of August, I saw the prisoner stab the mare with a knife—I crossed the road directly—I saw him hold the wound with his fingers, he said, "I am sorry for what I have done"—he was very drunk, but it seemed to sober him after he had done it.</p>

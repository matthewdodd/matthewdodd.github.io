On Friday, 9th May, about 11 a.m., I was called to 4, Euston Square, and found a body lying in the cellar; by the side of it appeared to be some pieces of a black silk dress, and there was a cloth cloak with a Lood; the hood appeared to have a silk lining, and there was what appeared to be a part of a black silk petticoat, and some brown coloured lace as if it had been a scarf or a shawl; the body was partly decomposed, there were two turns of rope round the neck, very tight, embedded in the flesh; I put the point of the knife in to raise it, it was rotten and broke; it was a light clothes line the sides of the neck were partly decomposed, but not the front, and there appeared to be the flesh with the clothes line in it—I left all the things that I saw on the body there—I examined the cellar with Inspector Hagan on the same day, and helped to find some small bones of a foot, close to the spot where the body had been lying—I saw the remains put into a shell—the foot was also put in, and the small bones which were taken up afterwards, and the remains of the clothing—they were then taken to the mortuary—I saw this brooch (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>), but not before Mr. Hagan showed it to me there.</p>

I am an Inspector of the Criminal Investigation De<lb></lb>partment—on Friday, 9th May, I went to 4, Euston Square, and found the body in the left-hand corner of the cellar—I saw embedded under the right jaw two pieces of clothes rope or clothes line, that was level with the outside of the flesh—I saw no knot, but the body had been removed before I saw it—there were also some pieces of rope lying about; I only saw two strands of rope under the right jaw; I did not see what was round the other side of the neck; I took it away—I broke one piece in two with my finger, and kept one piece of it; it came away like tinder; it was quite rotten; the piece I took was from 3 to 4 inches long; this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it has shrunken away,</p>

I live at 1, Euston Square—on Friday, 9th May, the police fetched me to 4, Euston Square, and I was shown a body in one of the front cellars—on going in from the light I could see nothing but a black mass, a black mound, but on more closely examining I found at the end of the mound the head of a female—the remains had coal-dust on them, from which they were quite black—the head was exposed, there was a very small portion of hair on the scalp at the back of the head, but I could not notice the colour then—the body was flexed and the back was uppermost—the arms were flexed across the breast and the body resting on them—the arms were attached to the body, but there were no hands—the legs were severed from the knees; the portion above the</p>

               <p>knees was attached, but the bones above the tibia were parted and quite denuded—the bones down to the ankle were bare—it is quite possible that the separation of the limbs from the body would be the result of decomposi<lb></lb>tion—there was nothing to show me that it was not—I gave directions that all the things should be "brought to the mortuary, where I made a careful examination on the 10th with my son—I found that the flesh was entirely absent from the whole of the face and from the front of the neck, I mean over the windpipe, as well as the principal part of the scalp, all. except the back, and at the back of the neck I found a very deep impression or indentation, in which I discovered the remains of a cord—the flesh was still remaining as far, as the ears—I could not remove it as a cord, because it broke at the touch—it was round the back of the neck nearly from ear to ear—I cannot say whether it had been fastened—it was such an indentation as would be made by a cord drawn very tightly round the neck either before or after death, it is impossible to say which—there was flesh at the back and tides of the neck, but it was highly decomposed; it was quite a substance and in a fatty condition, but all was gone in front from decomposition, at least that might have been the case—if any wound was inflicted in front of the neck it possibly would more easily decompose, it might or it might not—when I saw the hair at the mortuary I considered it a light brown; it was short, and it had half a turn round, as though it was disposed to a ringlet; it would probably have been short ringlets during the life of the wearer—there was no fracture of the skull or of any of the bones as far as I saw—the internal organs were as you would suppose some long time after death, they were passing away—there was nothing to lead me to a conclusion as to the cause of death—I carefully examined the spine; I presume there was a little tendency to curvature of convexity to the right side, a lateral curvature giving a tendency to stoop to the right side—that would cause an appearance of deformity; there would be a little prominence of the right shoulder and a bending of the head to the other side, as you see in old people—there would be a very slight stoop—Mr. Bond was with me—I can only come to the conclusion that the woman's ago would be from 50 to 70, the only indi<lb></lb>cation was from the lower jaw, and it might take place after 50—when the teeth go, the alvera sockets go also, and that gives an appearance of age which seldom is before 50 or 56—the height was about 5 feet 4 inches—Mr. Bond and I put the bones together with a view of ascertaining the height—we did it as carefully as we possibly could—the body had been clothed—I saw only one foot which was found, but there were some small bones be<lb></lb>longing to the wrist and hand—it strikes me that there was a boot on the foot and covered with coal-dust—I observed no unpleasant smell, but the coal-dust would be a deodorant, being carbon—if the woman had been strangled, most likely there would be a flow of blood from the nose, ears, or mouth; there would not be time for much, and there might be none—it probably would not be profuse, but I cannot say that I have had any ex<lb></lb>perience—if an artery in the neck was severed that would occasion a con<lb></lb>siderable discharge of blood; the quantity would depend upon whether the jugular vein was severed; if it was, the body would be emptied of blood directly.</p>

                  </hi>, F.R.C.S. I am a pathologist of St. Mary's Hospital—I made two examinations of the body at the mortuary, one on May 15 and the other on May 19, in company with Dr. Davis—I have heard his examination, and agree generally with what he has said—there was only presumptive evidence as to the cause of death; the deep mark in the neck showed what the cause of death might have been, but not what it was—the cord in the neck was at an angle of 45 degrees, which is consistent with death by hanging, and it is not the angle you would expect to get by death from strangulation—if the body had been tied round the neck by a cord after death and dragged, that would be consistent with what I saw—the groove was at both sides of the neck as well as at the back, and the higher part of the groove was at the back—it sloped from the front to the back backwards and upwards—all the flesh at the front of the neck was gone—there was no trace of the windpipe, but I may say that that is the first part of the body to decompose—there was a double lateral curvature of the spine, one curvature first to the right, and a second or compensatory curvature to the left—that must have existed during life; I examined the vertebrae, and found one side much deeper than the other—the main bone of the right leg, the tibia, was thickened; that would be caused by inflam<lb></lb>mation of the bone—that would almost certainly cause pain, which would be alleviated by rest, internal remedies, and warmth—a person suffering, from that disease might without medical advice resort to fomentation, and it might somewhat relieve the pain—the right fore arm was detached from the upper arm, but it must have been flexed on the chest before death—Inspector Hagan afterwards brought me a piece of carpet with several colours on it, and the stains were not very manifest on the upper surface, but on the under surface it was stained for rather more than a foot and a half very plainly, and nearly circular; it was caused by blood—I examined it by all the well<lb></lb>known tests—I can only say that it was the blood of a mammal, but I cannot say that it was human; we cannot distinguish between the two—I put some of the viscera in a sealed vessel and gave them to Mr. Luff, the analytical chemist—my opinion is that the body had been dead from one to two years—I do not think more than two years.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It was not entire; the left hand was attached, but all the bones were there except some of the small bones—they were broken off, and the foot was quite dry by a process called mummification—only the two large bones of the right foot were present; all the rest were missing—no bones were missing from the other foot—I found among some of the lesser bones of the head two bones which were not human; one was a leg of mutton bone, and the other was the foot of an ox, the femur, no small bone; I only saw one—strangulation would make a very considerable indentation in the neck, and that was consistent with hanging, and not strangulation, unless the person strangling was very much taller.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> It might be caused by dragging the body—the comunni<lb></lb>cation of the foot was due to exposure on account of the small amount of flesh—I found the long bones of both legs perfect, and the long bones of the arms, all of which probably belonged to the same body—the bones missing were of the feet and hands—the mutton bone and ox bone were</p>

               <p>quite clean and bare—they were the only bones I saw which were not human—the mutton bone appeared fresher than the ox bone; it is very difficult to form an opinion how long they had been there, as there was no soft material on them at all—I examined all the bones at the mortuary very carefully indeed.</p>

                  </hi>, F.R.C.S. I am assistant-surgeon at Westminster Hospital—I was directed by the officers of the Criminal Investigation Department to go to St. Pancras Mortuary, and went on 12th May with Dr. Davis—I heard his evidence at the police-court, but not to-day—we found the body in a state of decomposition by a process called saponification—most of the viscera were decomposed or missing; some parts were very much de<lb></lb>composed—the front of the neck had perfectly disappeared, but at the back and sides I noticed an oblique depression—I formed no opinion whether that had been done by hanging or strangling, but I formed the opinion that it had been done by a cord—I estimated that the deceased was from 60 to 70 years of age—I measured the height very exactly, and found it to be 5 feet 4 inches—all the bones were there excepting a few small bones of one foot—if a person were strangled there might be a flow of blood some days after death, not likely a very large flow; there might be an oozing of blood from the mouth and nostrils, but not so much as would be required to make the stain on the carpet—I should expect to find a flow of blood at some variable period after death from 24 hours to a week—the mark on the neck was higher behind than in front—if a dead body was dragged by the neck by a small cord it would leave an indentation similar to what I found, and the cord would get totally embedded in, the neck—I noticed a curvature of the spine, which in life would cause, a perceptible stoop—Inspector Hagan brought me a piece of oilcloth; I examined it carefully, and by the general odour it appeared to have been in contact, or to have been subject to the same process of decay—I cut some hair from the scalp, took it home, washed it most carefully, and examined it with a microscope, but found no signs of any dye; it was slightly brown, and there was an indication of grey at the roots—it was short and very much tangled, probably as if it had been curled—a piece of drugget was brought to me—it was coloured on one side, printed, and whitey-brown on the other—there was a stiff stain on it, which was much more apparent on the whitey-brown side—I tested the stain by the usual processes, and found it was undoubtedly the blood of a mammal; that is as far as I can tell you—I sent it to Mr. Pepper.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Judging, from the size of the bones, and the appearance of the flesh, I think the deceased must have been a heavy woman—from the stiffness of the blood on the carpet I believe it was undiluted—I have seen a person who died from hanging, but never saw one who was strangled and then fell on the floor—I do not think strangling a person in a recumbent position would would be more likely than hanging to induce a flow of blood—the flow of blood is caused by decomposition taking place—I see no evidence of this carpet having been washed; it is just in the condition it would be if it had been worn with the stain on it—it may have been washed on the surface, but not thoroughly—I am certain it has not been taken up and washed.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 9, Rochester Row, Kentish Town, and am an artist—I had a sister of the name of Matilda Hacker—in the autumn of 1877 she was 66 years of age—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are photographs of her; one of them is in an evening dress and the other in a morning dress—my sister was in the habit of dressing somewhat gaily, too young for her age—I should think these photographs were taken some 10 or 15 years since—up to about five years ago she was a resident at Canterbury; she had lived there all her life—her means were derived from rentals of houses at Canterbury—her income was about 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—Mr. Cozens collected her rents—she left Canterbury about two years ago; she left of her own choice—her sister having died, she chose to leave, and took a house at Brighton—after leaving Brighton she was living under assumed names—she lived at Brighton about two years or two and a half—I have learnt that she lived under assumed names in consequence of some dispute with the landlord; a claim which he made which she thought unjust, about some water rate—her height was 5 feet 4 inches, I should say—she got stouter after these photographs were taken; in fact, there is so much clothing here you can hardly see the stout<lb></lb>ness; but she appeared stouter latterly, and stooped and was round-shouldered—she called on me, perhaps, once in three or four months, other<lb></lb>wise I never saw her—I have never heard of her being alive since October, 1877—I always expected to see her once in four months, at Christmas time—the last Christmas she did not call—I thought it rather strange, and knowing there was some claim upon her which she seemed determined not to pay, I thought it possible that she might be in some trouble, and therefore I made it my business to go to Canterbury some two or three months after that, and I found she had not called for her rent—there was not the slightest quarrel or difference with me to make her keep away, except that I did not approve of her taking a large house, which I thought she had not the means for—she took a house at Brighton at something like 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year rent and taxes, and I did not approve of it—in May this year I went to the mortuary with Inspector Hagan, and there saw a portion of human remains—some hair was attached to portions of the skull—that hair was of a similar cha<lb></lb>racter to that of my sister's; it was rather light brown, and being in ringlets I identified it the more as being her hair—I have no doubt that this watch was hers, and that is confirmed by the fact of its having been made by Warren, of Canterbury, where I know her watch was bought—we were natives of Canterbury—the two watches were bought at the same time, and given by my father to each of his daughters—that was about 40 years ago—I have not looked inside the watch (opening it)—yes, I see it has the name of Warren, of Canterbury—it is precisely identical with the watch which my other sister had—this chain is similar to one I have seen my sister wear, but I have never taken particular notice of it—it was of a more recent date, which she purchased probably herself, but I believe it is the chain I have seen her wearing; it is similar to it—I know nothing about the locket—</p>

I live at 7, Mornington Crescent—on 7th May, 1877, I let apartments to Miss Hacker; she remained with me till the end of August—I think this photograph is like her; she passed by the name of Sycamore during the time she was with me; the letters came addressed to Miss Hacker, and were taken up to her by the servant—she was dressed very conspicuously; the eyeglass produced is like that I saw her with, and the watch and chain also; the links of it were the same as my own, that is why I noticed it—she wore a skirt with a black silk body.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in the service of Mrs. Honor in 1877—I remember a lady coming and residing there under the name of Miss Sycamore—this photograph is very like the lady; letters came addressed to Miss Hacker, which I took up to her in consequence of the orders she gave; she had a waterproof with a deep cape, and a large lace fichu, which came across the shoulders; she also wore a red flannel bodice; she had a basket trunk like that produced; I remember the hard leather handles which hurt my hand—I don't remember having often lifted one like it; it was in very good condi<lb></lb>tion then; it had a tray to it—she had a dream-book, I quite remember that; this is very much like it—she wore a black satin quilted petticoat the whole time she was with us, except she occasionally wore a white petticoat—I remember her using an eyeglass exactly like this, if it is not this—it was not cracked—I do not remember the watch and chain—I have posted letters for her to Canterbury—she used to complain of her leg being painful when she came in from a walk; I forget which leg it was; I never saw it—she used to ask me for a little warm water, that was the most I heard about it; she said it was painful—that happened very often; it was fine weather, and she was out a great deal, and when she came home she used to complain of its being painful, and I used to take up the warm water for her—on 17th May last I was taken to the mortuary, and there saw some hair on portions of a scalp—I thought it was very like Miss Hacker's hair in the length and colour, and it was, curled like hers—I saw the remains of a black satin quilted petticoat there; I know she wore one—I also saw the remains of a red flannel bodice.</p>

I am a merchant living in Brixton Road—in April, 1877, I went to lodge at 4, Euston Square, at the house kept by Mr. and Mrs. Bastendorff—I occupied the whole of the first floor till September, 1878; I took my own furniture there; the prisoner was the servant there all the time I lodged there, and waited on me, except with one interruption, when she went for a holiday; that must have baen at the end of August or beginning of September, 1877; I dc not remember a lady lodging above me on the second floor—I have a vague recollection of seeing an elderly lady in the passage at the time I had received a dog; I can't exactly tell the day; it was on a Sunday in October, 1877—while I lodged there I used to go out on week days between 9 and 10 o'clock in the morning, and return about 9 or 10 o'clock in the evening—on Sundays I used to go out in the afternoon about 12 or 1 o'clock, and come back about 10 o'clock in the evening—I remember the Sunday, the day of the French elections in 1877; it was the 14th October; it was a very remarkable election, and I took a great deal of interest in it—I went out about 12 o'clock that day, and went to see my partner, who then was in London, and a friend of his who had come over from</p>

                  </hi>. I am a warder at Westminster Prison—I was also in the cab, and heard the prisoner make the statement just mentioned—she said the second—floor lodger, Mr. Finlay, always carried revolver against robbers, and that he had offered her 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to keep a secret and she refused—she said Mr. Finlay wanted her to go to America with him.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">INSPECTOR HAGAN</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>). On May 12, 1879, in consequence of inquiries made, I went to see the prisoner; Inspector Gatling was with me—I made a memorandum of what she said to me—I first asked her "How long were you in Mr. Bastendorff's service at 4, Euston Square?—"she answered "About two years"—I said "Do you remember any of the lodgers that were in the house?"—"Yes, I do—severel of them"—at this time there was not the least suspicion attaching to the prisoner—I said "What were their names?"—she replied "Brooks, Kiggenbach, Lefler, and some more—I said "Were they ladies or gentlemen?"—she replied "Both"—I said</p>

               <p>"Do you remember any single ladies lodging there?"—she said "Yes"—I said "Do you remember one with short curls?"—she said "Yes, there was one on the second—floor front room"—I said "How long was she there?"—she replied "About six weeks or two months"—I said "How long is that ago?"—she said "About two years"—I inquired her age, and she said about fifty, or more; I said "What coloured hair had she?" to which she replied "Greyish"—I said "Was it not fair?"—she replied "No, it was grey; she wore it in short curls"—I asked whether she knew her name, she said "No, I don't know now; but I'll try and think of it"—I asked if she saw her go away, and she said "No, I didn't; because I had to go out sometimes with the children; I went once with them to Hampstead Heath, and I rather think that was when the old lady went away"—I asked how she used to dress; she answered "She dressed very smartly when she went out; she used to wear a blue silk dress, with a white hat and large feather in it; in the house she dressed very shabbily; she wore a black satin quilted petticoat; she wore a lot of lace about her head"—I asked if she had a waterproof cloak; she said "Yes, she had; she was a very mean woman, and would only have fourpenny ale; she used to send for a glass with three farthings; I did not like to go myself, so I gave the boy a farthing to go; I once had to ask her for the rent; Bastendorff"—told me if I did not like to go he would—I went, and the old lady gave me a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note to get changed—I don't know who went to change it, I or Bastendorff"—I said "Are you quite sure—the hair was grey and not light?"—she said "Yes; quite sure"—I asked her if she often went to the coal-cellar, and she said every day—I said "Did you ever notice anything wrong there?"—"No"—"Did you ever notice any bad smell there?"—"No"—I said "There has been a dead body found there; do you know anything about it?"—she replied "A body—a body in the coal-cellar! I am sure I never saw anything in there"—I said "Then you can throw no light on it?" and she said "No, I cannot;" afterwards I saw her again, and she said she remembered the old lady's name, it was Miss Hacker—"she told me she came up to collect her rents"—I said "Was not the name Huish?"—she said "No, it was Hacker"—I said "Had she plenty of money?"—she answered "I don't know; she had a gold watch and chain, which she wore on Sundays; I am sure now I was with the children at Hampstead; when I got back I was told she had gone, and had left a shilling for me"—I said "Who told you that?"—she said "Mrs. Bastendorff"—she continued "After the lady had gone I found her dream-book in a drawer, and I gave it to Mrs. Bastendorff; she used always to be reading that book"—on May 14th I took the prisoner to the mortuary—I told her she was going to see the remains of the lady; I asked if she was sure she was at Hampstead on the day the lady went away?—she replied that she was—I showed her the articles, and she said "Those are all like the things Miss Hacker used to wear in the house, especially the lace, but they are in such a state now"—I showed her the hair; she said "The hair is not Miss Hacker's; hers was decidedly grey"—I showed her the brooch and buckle, and she knew nothing about them—I said "Then you say the things are like what Miss Hacker wore, but the hair is not, hers was grey"—she said "Yes, that is it"—I received two watches and a chain from a pawn-broker, the cash—box from Mr. Bastendorff, also the dream—book and the basket—trunk—the buckle and brooch I found with the remains—I cut out a piece of the carpet in the second—floor front at No. 4; I gave it to Mr. Bond in the first instance, and afterwards to Dr. Pepper—I got some boxes rom Mr.</p>

               <p>Wright, and from those boxes I took the pocket-handkerchief and eyeglass—I asked Mrs. Bastendorff to point out to me the place where the bed used to stand—the stain was at the side of the bed—there was a stain on the floor corresponding with the one on the carpet.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It was in consequence of what the prisoner told me that I was enabled in a great measure to trace Miss Hacker.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">DR. PEPPER</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>). I saw the way in which the rope was embedded in the neck—I did not see the rope; I saw the wound; it was as broad as my little finger.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">DR. DAVIS</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>). I saw a portion of the rope in the flesh; it was over the back, and almost as forward as the ears—I could not judge how tightly the neck had been compressed, except from the deep depression—it must have been very firmly and tightly tied round there—that would be sufficient to produce death—it could not fail to produce death if it was kept on; it could not fail to cause strangulation.</p>

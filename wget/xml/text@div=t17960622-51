               <p>Examined by Mr. Cullen. On the 20th of May, I had a warrant to search Rogers's house; I went in consequence of that warrant; I believe the prisoners had a sight of the officers coming before we entered the house; Rogers and the young woman were up stairs, and Wheeler was in the passage; I ran and caught Wheeler in the passage, I believe he had hold of a key, intending to let himself out at a side door; I gave him to another officer; his shirt sleeves were up, and his hands in a working state; he had no coat on; I then went into the kitchen, to endeavour to go into the cellar; I found the cellar-door, and went to the stairs; it was all in darkness at that time; I came back, and had a candle lit, went into the cellar, found a fly standing, and all the implements for coining; a press fixed, and a halfpenny between the dies in the press; the press was quite in a working state, the oil was running down, I suppose it had been at work within an hour; there was a stool by it; the press is here; I found a vast quantity of halfpence and some blanks, the halfpence corresponded with the dies; we afterwards went up stairs, of which the other officers will give you an account; there was a trouncing sack tied up to the beams of the cellar, in a state to use to shake the halfpence in greasy saw dust, to give them the appearance of age: (The halfpence and sack were produced in Court;) here are some halfpence that have not been in the trouncing sack, of the same die; I found part of two bottles of oil, and a bottle with a piece of candle in it; one of the bottles was in the cellar, the other in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. The woman was found up stairs? - A. Yes.</p>

On the morning of the 15th of February, between five and six o'clock, I came down stairs, before it was light, I observed the glass over my parlour door, towards my bar, was broken; I alarmed my family, went into the parlour, and found two squares of glass at the bottom sash of the window, right and left, broken, in order to turn back the fastening that kept it down-the outside window-shutter was broken to pieces, and the iron bolt bent double; the shutter had been forced, and the glass taken out, I found a large ironcrow behind the parlour door, the sash of the window was up-any person might get in or out. I found my tills had been emptied, and the money gone. I also missed the articles stated in the indictment, which were on the table in the bar, the overnight, at eleven o'clock. The prisoner had often worked for me, he had painted several houses for me at different times. The crow was my property, and usually kept in the cellar of the next house, which is mine; I saw it there the morning before, and ordered my servant, John Hube, to take it into my own cellar, but he did not. The prisoner has often been in the cellar of the adjoining house, I kept paint and other things there; he has been there with me and by himself. He has not worked for me for sometime, but has been in the habit of being about my house, he was there the night before the robbery, I saw him in the tap-room; he came to my house again at night, and I charged him with the robbery. I gave him in charge.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Trend. I fastened up the house on the night of the robbery, I fastened the shutters of the back parlour window, and bolted them with two bolts - I am sure of it; I drew down the sash after me, all the squares of glass were in then. My master got up first in the morning, when I came down, I found the crow behind the parlour door and the shutter broken open. I saw the crow-bar in the next house the day before. I did not bring it into the dwelling-house. I took it into the cellar of the adjoining house, two or three days before. Mr. Daws lived in that house. My master used to keep his things in the cellar, it is not kept locked; if the prisoner said he was sent by my master, he could get into the cellar. I tried the crow-bar with the shutter, and the marks fitted, it appeared that the window had been broken open with it.</p>

            . I am a headborough. I was called to Mr. Trend's, about ten o'clock on Saturday evening. Mr. Trend gave the prisoner in charge; I searched him, and found a ring on him, he refused giving any account of it; I told him, it would be better for him to confess. The prisoner went with me, and pointed our Simmonds's, at the corner of Leather-lane, Holborn, on Sunday. I went there on the Monday, and Simmonds went with me to Mr. Alderman Cox, Little Britain, the spoons were produced there; Merchant took them - I also found two 1l. notes on the prisoner.</p>

On Saturday evening, between six and seven o'clock, the prisoner came to my shop, and sold me two table-spoons for 1l. 8s. 6d.; he came again in a quarter of an hour, and sold me some tea and salt-spoons, for 1l. 3s.; he said, he had an execution in his house, and wanted to make up the money. I sent my son to sell them at Mr. Alderman Cox's. I did not send the salt-spoons. The two 1l. notes that were found on the prisoner, are the same that I gave to him. I am sure, he is the man.</p>

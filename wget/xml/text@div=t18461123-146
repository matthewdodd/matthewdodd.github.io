                  </hi>, I live at No. 4, Phillip-street—the prisoner lives at No. 22. On the night of the 23rd of Nov. the prisoner, his wife, and I went together to a ball—we came home together—the prisoner rapped twice at the door—it was not opened—his wife then went to rap—I did not hear what the prisoner said to her, but they had a scuffle—whether he knocked her down or not I cannot tell, but she came to the ground, and I saw him kick her—the door was opened immediately she fell, and they went in—I went in—I had a baby in my arms—I went into their bed-room—the prosecutrix was lying on the floor in a gore of blood, and the prisoner was kicking her—I saw him kick her—the blood came from her head—he had had a little gin and beer, but was not drunk.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see Mrs. Benjamin there? - A. Yes; I saw her shove this bill of parcels under it; I asked her, in the presence of the prisoner, if it was her property, and she would not own it; then there was a Mr. Benjamin, her husband there; I asked him, and he said, he knew nothing about it, the prisoner did not deny that it was his room; I looked at the property, and searched them all, and searched the room for the wrapper, but I could not find it; then I took them to the office, and they were committed; I got the key of the room and went back again, and found a bill of parcels under the chair, which alludes to the remainder of the property.(producing them).</p>

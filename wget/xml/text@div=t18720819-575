About 12 o'clock on 3rd July I was with Fisher in Oxford Street, in plain clothes—I saw the three prisoners just about Arthur Street—the two Taylors were in a pony barrow; Joshua was driving—Kenyon was walking on the footway, about 10 yards behind the trap—Samuel Taylor pointed towards the Metropolitan Coffee House—Kenyon looked in, but did not go in—the Taylors drove on westward, and Kenyon followed, about 15 or 20 yards behind—when the Taylors got opposite 419 they <hi rend="italic">slowed</hi> again, and both looked round—Samuel pointed out the confectioner's shop and Kenyon went in—I saw him throw down a florin and receive some change—as he came out I went in—I was a florin, which I broke, and produce here to-day—Kenyon then</p>

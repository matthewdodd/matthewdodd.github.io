                  </hi>. I live at 5, South-street, Spitalfields, and am a potato-salesman. At the latter end of May I received a communication from Messrs. Cox, of Doddington, near Spalding, and some potatoes arrived by the Great Northern Railway—I told the prisoner, who was in my employ, to go and put the potatoes, which were loose in the trucks, into sacks, but he had no business to remove them off the railway premises—he never brought me any; if he took any away, they have not come to me—the potatoes are about 18 cwt. short by the bill of parcels.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk in the goods-office at the King's-cross Station of the Great Northern Railway. I produce two invoices, marked 197 and 1247—on the same day that we received them, we received 12 ton, 14 cwt. 2 quarters of potatoes, the quantity mentioned in the invoice, but I did not compare them—they are weighed at the country-station, and the invoice sent up—I communicated with Mr. Nokes on 3rd June—a man, I cannot say who, brought me an order from Mr. Nokes, which entitled him to remove them.</p>

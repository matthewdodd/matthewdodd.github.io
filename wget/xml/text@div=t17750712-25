            . Here is the gold watch, (producing it) I was informed by a woman who was in confinement, that the prisoners lodged at one Mr. Holmer's in Kent street, in the borough; I went with her in a coach, and found Mr. Holmer at home; I asked him, if two young men lodged there; he said, yes, up one pair of stairs. We went up, and found the door open. I went in with Mr. Holmer, and the woman; Mr. Holmer is here, there was a chest of drawers with five drawers in it; they were all locked. I asked. Mr. Holmer who had the key; Mr. Holmer said, the persons who kept the room. I then recollected, I had a key in my pocket that was found upon Girdwood, by Dinmore, at the office; with that key I opened the drawers; and in the first drawer, found this watch. I knew the watch as soon as I saw it, because I had taken the description from Mr. Bach's mouth before: I found two balls and some powder in one of the large drawers.</p>

M'Allester had lodged there four or five days, or a week; they both lay in the same bed; Girdwood paid for the lodging; they were never out after eleven o'clock as I know of. I was at home when Mr. Bond came; I went up stairs with him; he opened the drawers with a key he had in his pocket, and in the first he found a watch, I believe that is the watch, I was by when he found it.

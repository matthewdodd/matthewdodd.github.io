Two were from Frankfort, signed Michael Mantrig, dated 18th and 23d June 1861, directed to J. P. Hatton, and purporting to enclose the halves of notes to the amount of 2 l.; the other two purported to be from Monkstown, Ireland, from the prisoner's mother-in-law, and were dated 14 and 17 July, 1861, but contained no allusion to money</hi>)—Those are not the letters; there are others which I expected to he produced. All that I have to say is that I got the 201. note changed by Richard Black, whom I knew in America seven or eight years ago—I met him in the street; he invited me to his house, and he got the draft cashed for me and then the note—he gave me the note that I give to Mr. Sprague.

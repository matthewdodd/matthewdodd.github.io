               <p>Court. How old are you? - Turned of fourteen; I am servant to Mr. Miller I go out with beer; on Tuesday the fourth of March, the prisoner came and ordered two pots of beer and change for a guinea, I heard her and saw her, I was to carry two pots of beer to Mr. Cobham's, in Stewart's Rents; the prisoner had left the house before, and at the top of Stewart's-rents, she met me and took the two pots of beer, and the change from me.</p>
               <p>Are you sure it is the same person that is now at the bar that received the change, and the beer from you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen her before? - Never.</p>
               <p>What time was it? - Between nine and ten at night.</p>
               <p>Was it a dark or a light night? - It was quite dark.</p>
               <p>Was it light enough for you to distinguish the features of the prisoner at the bar so as to know her again? - Yes, Sir, it was.</p>
               <p>Did she give you that guinea? - Yes, I took the guinea to the lamp afterwards, I hallooed out stop that woman! and she stopped herself; I then said, either give me another guinea or give me the silver back; says she, are you sure it is me, yes, says I, I am; then says she, I will go to your master, instead of which she run away; the girl from the Horse and Groom, a public house, came and told us where she lived, and I went to the house in Wild-street, No. 5, where I found her; she then took and clapped her foot against the door, and said, can you swear to my dress, she had a bonnet and a long dark Bath cloak on, I am sure; with that she brought out a red cloak, which she has on now, she was got into the house, and had a young child in her arms.</p>

               <p>Court. Then she had no cloak on at the time of this conversation? - No, none at all, but when I said her dress was a brown one, she brought out a red one, she was brought up to our house, and my mistress sent for a runner, and she was committed.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the prisoner at the bar was the person with whom you had all these transactions? - It is the person, Sir, I am quite confident.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Boy, do you know what an oath is? - Sir, I never took but two or three.</p>
               <p>Do you know what an oath means? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Do you know the nature of an oath? - I suppose, if so be you tell a lie in what you are saying, you can think of going no where but to hell.</p>
               <p>Were this woman's apartments searched? - Yes, they were the next morning.</p>
               <p>Was her person searched? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What money was found on her? - None, but her husband came with her half way up Poppin's-court?</p>
               <p>What money was found upon her? - A sixpence, and two or three halfpence.</p>
               <p>Do you remember her telling you her name was Chambers, and that she lived at No. 5? - No.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178505110013"></xptr>Did not you say to her at first, you did not know it was her? - No.</p>
               <p>Have you never said so? - No.</p>
               <p>No brown cloak was found, was it dark brown? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Very dark? - Yes.</p>
               <p>As dark as your own coat? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You observed the cloak particularly? - Yes, I was standing at the window of the bar, and her side was towards me.</p>

               <p>I was standing at the bar window when the prisoner came to order the beer; I live within three doors, I generally go there, I saw her order two pots of beer to Mr. Cobham's, and change for a guinea, I am sure it was the same lady.</p>
               <p>What was her dress? - She had a brown or drab colour cloth coat, and a bonnet.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. They are very distinguishable colours? - People give them names according to their own fancy.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you ever seen the prisoner at the bar before? - No, I never did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do you call that coat you have on a brown one? - I call it a drab colour, some people call it a brown.</p>

               <p>I never was in the woman's house in all my life, I know nobody in Stewart's-rents, I do not know the sign, I never had a brown cloak on in my life; I was going down Stewart's-rents, that boy was crying out stop, mistress! I turned back, and said, do you want me, he said, no, he did not what he wanted, it was very frosty; he said, a woman had taken change for a guinea, there was immediately a mob of people; I said how could you be so foolish? I hope you do not think it was me, says he, I do not know whether it is or no; I said, to the woman at the Horse and Groom, says I, my name is Chambers, I live at No. 5, in Wild-street; I went home and told my husband the circumstance, presently there came a knock at the door, the boy came in, and said, I was the woman, he said, the woman had a long brown cloak, I immediately shewed him this cloak that I have on, I have witnesses to prove that I went out with this cloak, and came in with this cloak; I went to Mrs. Miller's house, she doubled her hand, and said, give me a guinea you wretch, or else I will prosecute you; and a constable was called, and the runner said to me, you bitch, have you one pocket or two? they searched me, and found sixpence and some halfpence; immediately my husband came in, they seized him, searched him, and took us both to the round house in Covent Garden, there we were till the next morning, and the Justice discharged my husband; then Mr. Miller came and swore that piece of money was delivered him by the boy, and that it had never been out of his possession, now Mrs. Miller had this piece in her pocket, turned out her money, and he damned her, and said, why did not she keep it by itself.</p>
               <p>(The piece of money produced.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. It has been in my bureau.</p>
               <p>Boy. It is the same piece I delivered to Mrs. Miller.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Miller. I put it in my pocket among my silver, I never keep my gold and silver together, it never has been out of my possession and my husband's.</p>
               <p>Did your husband ever carry it to Bow-street? - He did not, he was with me.</p>
               <p>When had your husband it? - Out of my hand into his, to give it to the Justice, in my sight.</p>

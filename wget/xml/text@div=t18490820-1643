                  </hi>. I live at 21, Well-street, Wellclose-square—I have one partner. The prisoner came to me and wished to have some clothes—I requested security, and he told me he would get his cousin to become security—I did not know his cousin at that time; I knew he had one—he said his cousin should send me security the next day—accordingly the next day I received this letter by post, purporting to come from his cousin—in consequence of this letter I let the prisoner have the goods—they were a pair of shoes, two pairs of stockings, and other things—I certainly should not have let him have the goods but for this letter—it is addressed to Mr. Pike, my partner—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"Haymarket, July 11, 1849,—Sir, I now write according to my cousin John's wishes, for he told me that you want a security for him in the way of business. I have pledged my word to him that I will stand security for him to the amount of 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and no more, because he is such an infernal fool with his money; yet I shall be most happy to see you any evening from six till eight. I have written this on purpose to satisfy John, and you can safely rely upon what I have said, for there is nothing wrong with John. Excuse the scrawl, as I have written this in a hurry for the eleven o'clock post. Do what you can for John, and see him righted with Mr. Chillpotts, and by so doing you will greatly oblige yours, &amp;c., Henry Cullingford."—When the prisoner came he said, "Mr. Pike have you had a letter from cousin Henry?"—I said, "Yes, I have"—he said, "I saw him last night, and he becomes security for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said, "Yes"—he said, "Are my clothes ready?"—I said, "No"—he said he wanted some shoes and stockings—it was in consequence of what he said, and this letter, I let him have the things.</p>

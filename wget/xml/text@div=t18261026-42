Roberts was in my service; I was absent at my country-house on the 10th of August, and left her in care of the house; Riley was in the habit of visiting her, which I thought improper, and I forbid him himself coming to the house, and threatened to discharge her if he continued to come; I came to town on the 10th, found the female prisoner out, and she never returned; on the following morning, I discovered my loss; upon going to the drawers for some linen, I found them in disorder, and upon examining, I found the back of the chest of drawers had been taken out, and put in again; I immediately went to the platedrawer, and missed most of the plate, and my wife's jewels; I missed all the articles stated in the indictment, and many others; I immediately went to Hatton-garden, and on the 12th, sat out with my brother-in-law to Monmouthshire, and found the prisoners at Newport, in Monmouthshire, cohabiting together, at lodgings there; an alarm had been given upon my arrival, and I found them at the top of the stairs; Roberts had my wife's black dress on, and a few trinkets; Riley had a silk handkerchief of mine in his pocket, a brooch of my wife's in his breast, and a pair of my nankeen trousers on; I found other property loose on the floor, with a box full of my plate; I said to Roberts, "You did not expect to see me;" she said, "Yes, I expected to be taken, and glad I am;" the man said he had nothing to with it, he knew nothing about it; I brought the property away; the prisoners were afterwards removed here by Habeas; here is the property in Court; the value of what I have lost, was full 400l.; many of the articles found exceed 40s. in value; here is a silver tea-pot, and a quantity of plate, I know it all to be mine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did not Roberts say she took it all herself? A. I do not recollect it - I believe she said the man had nothing to do with it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was it stated in the prisoners' hearing, whether they cohabited together in that room, and how long they had been there? A. Yes; it was stated they lived there as man and wife, and slept in one bed - and that the female passed herself as a travelling milliner, and the man as a jeweller; neither of them denied that statement.</p>

            . I am driver of the Hackney-chariot, No. 18. On the 10th of August, between twelve and one o'clock, I was called by the male prisoner to St. John-square, to the end of Badger-yard, which is a thoroughfare for foot passengers, and leads into Red-lion-street - the prisoner led me to that spot; I turned my chariot round; he got inside, and waited there till the female prisoner came to him - she ordered me to come and help her to fetch the boxes; he remained in the coach - she had a small parcel in a red handkerchief; I could not see its contents; I fetched some things to the coach, and a woman brought some after that - I drove the prisoners to Crown-court, Picket-street, Strand; the luggage was taken out there - I carried some up stairs, and both the prisoners assisted; I waited in Crown-court, by their desire - and in half an hour, they both came back with the same luggage, and put it all into my chariot again, except a basket; they got in, and ordered me to get a post-chaise to go to Hounslow - I said, I could go as well as a chaise; and when I got to Somerset-street, they stopped me, and said, a box was left behind; I returned and got it, and drove them to Hounslow, where they got into a chaise, with the luggage, and started to go further.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you certain of the man? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you now know where the prosecutor lives? A. Yes; my chariot was drawn up about one hundred yards from his house. I am certain of them both.</p>
               <p>MR. AUSTIN re-examined. Q. The first circumstance which attracted your attention was, finding the linen in your drawers disordered? A. Yes; the drawers were locked - there is a pannel back to the whole chest, and then a back to each drawer; I found that had been taken out.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 11th of August I went to Mr. Austin's house, and found the back of his drawers had been taken out, and half broken off; it was taken quite away from the room, and then the back of the drawers themselves were taken out, and put under Mr. Austin's bed, and under the servant's bed was the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182610260039"></xptr>pannel back of the drawers - there was a quantity of nails in it, which stuck into the bed by the pressure. I found two panch-ladles and a cheese-taster under her bed; the drawers were about four feet and a half square - it was one entire pannel back and nailed in; it would require some time and some experience to take it out.</p>

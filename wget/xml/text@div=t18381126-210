                  </hi>. I am single, and live in Perry-street, Somers town. On the 3rd of November the prisoner came to me—I was not ac<lb></lb>quainted with him, but I had seen him once before, twelve months ago, when he had brought me a letter from a friend—he did not bring any letter on this occasion, but he said since I had seen him last he had been a voy<lb></lb>age to Sierra Leone, and had seen my friend on board the <hi rend="italic">Dolphin</hi>, to which he belonged—he produced these papers to me, and said there was 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. due to him on them, which he was to receive at Somerset-house on the 15th of November, and asked me if I could advance him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. till the Monday, when he would repay me—my sister gave him 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. by my direc<lb></lb>tion—I cannot read myself, but the papers were read over to me by a friend in the prisoner's presence—I believed them to be genuine, and ad<lb></lb>vanced him the money in consequence of his representing that they were so, and that he belonged to the ship he named, otherwise I should not have dope it—he left the papers with me as security—he dined with me on the Sunday after, and on Monday I went with him to Somerset-house—he went into the gates, but whether he went into any office I cannot say—when he returned he said it was the 5th of November, which was a public holiday, and the money could not be paid till the Monday following—I went again with him next day—he went into the same place, and said the clerks were engaged, or gone to lunch, and he could be paid in an hour—these are the papers he gave me—I have never had any of the money back again.

               <p>Q. Had you any other servant. - A. No, only three washerwomen that were washing in the house, the prisoner lived in the house and had to serve them out with soap and every thing that was necessary when they wanted it.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was it the prisoner left your house. - A. She left it on the 7th of October at night.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember what day it was. - A. It was on the Tuesday; me and my wife went out to Sadler's Wells, we went off at four o'clock, when I went away I gave her particular care over the house.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time were the woman there washing for you. - A. Yes, I gave her the order before the women, I gave her an order not to open the door after nine o'clock, I told her not to open the door to any person after then; but to go up stairs and look out of the window as it would be late before I should get home; it was a long way from Brompton to Sadler's Wells.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you return. - A. I returned at one o'clock in the morning of the 8th. When I came to the house the door was fast, I got a barrow and looked over the window, I saw a candle alight, the door was locked, I went to the back door as I found the key was gone, I went backwards, there was a window left open, and there was a candle left burning in the kitchen, the room that we always live in; the back window was open that laid over the washhouse, there is a board that we lift up to let<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180610290013"></xptr>the steam out, I thought of going in that way, and I got in directly. I was very much afraid, I saw the light, I came down the stairs as quick as possible I could to my wife to let her in. I took the candle, I says you take another candle and see if any person is there to knock me down, we went through the house and through every room, and looked under the beds, we went into the room that we sleep in, we found nobody but the dogs, one large one and one little one that we keep. One of the women is in court that left the house at nine o'clock, she says that the prisoner bolted the door after her, and that she did leave Margaret Rrice in the house; when we went into the room my wife looked in the drawers, she says some person has been to the drawers, I went into the room with one candle and she with another; she says I have missed the caps.</p>

             sworn. Q. You searched the house. A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. What did you miss. - A. The first thing I missed was two caps, the next was two habit shirts, they were in my drawers, and two gowns.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you value the caps at. - A. The caps are valued at a shilling a piece I think, the two habit shirts they are valued at the same, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. There are two gowns, what do you value them at. - A. I value them at ten shillings a piece, the three petticoats at four shillings a piece, there are two pair of cotton stockings, they are valued at sixpence the two pair, the bedgown I cannot say what it is worth, a pair of stays at eight shillings, a bonnet at one shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. A woman's great coat, what is that worth. - A. I cannot say exactly, it is a very good one, I suppose it may be worth about twelve shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it worth five, that is what you valued it at. A. I dare say it is worth that.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The watch is mine, I had it new in January, I gave four pounds two shillings and sixpence for it, I valued it at two pounds, I have got the receipt in my pocket, and the particular marks it has in it.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately had you seen them before you went out in the afternoon. - A. When I came home again to town I gave she care of it to put it in the top drawers.</p>
               <p>Q. You were present when she was taken up Mr. Jones. - A. Yes; I traced her that night, I went in the morning to Bow street, at half after five to get an officer. I found her between nine and ten on the morning of the eighth coming out of No. 73, Great Peter street, Westminster; says I, there she is, with my wife's clothes on, she had got my wife's great coat on and gown and petticoat; she said master there is the watch, she took it out of her bosom. I said I have nothing to do with it, deliver it up to the officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search her, and find all the rest of your things. - A. Yes, they were found on her arm, she was coming out of the door, and going away with them, except one bonnet the officer found in the room afterwards that she came out of.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Barrow.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Jones, what parish is your house in. - A. In the parish of Kensington, in Brompton division, the gentlemen collect the money for Kensington parish.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that it is in Kensington parish. A. I do not know any further.</p>
               <p>Q.(to prosecutrix) How came you to be so particular, did you examine where these things were before you went out. - A. I had taken things out of the drawers before I went out, I did not take the things out one by one.</p>
               <p>Q. You took other things out of the drawer, and that is the only reason you have for recollecting these things were in the drawer. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw them together, did you not separate them. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.(to prosecutor) With respect to the watch, Mr. Jones, you gave her that to take care of. - A. I had broke the glass, it dropped down while we were at tea with the other women, I says, Peggy, take the watch up stairs, and put it on the top of the drawers, which she did. I went up stairs to take my hat, I saw it there then.</p>
               <p>Q. The officer found the bonnet afterwards in the room. - A. The bonnet was in the room, and he brought it afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. That is what the officer said, I believe you had a good character with this girl when she came to you. - A. Yes, I trusted her with a five pound note to take to a gentleman, I would have trusted her with any thing else in this world till this unhappy affair.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you suspect her. - A. No, not in the least.</p>
               <p>Court. If you call five hundred witnesses to her character, it cannot do away the fact, the girl goes out of the house, and the property is found on her.</p>

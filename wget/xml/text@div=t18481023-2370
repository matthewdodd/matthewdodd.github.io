                  </hi>. I keep the Rose and Crown, Broad-street, St. Giles's—the prisoner was in my service eighteen months—she used to act in the bar. On Thursday, 5th Oct., I marked six shillings and eight sixpences, and put them in two tills at each end of the counter—in about half an hour I missed a marked shilling and two marked sixpences—I sent for an officer, and asked the prisoner in his presence when I paid her her wages last—she said in May—I said, "Yes; what money have you in your possession?"—she said, "1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I asked if she could account for that—she said, "It is mine"—I said I suspected she had been robbing me, and I had put marked money into the till and missed it—I said if she would tell me the truth I would forgive her—she still denied it—her box was brought down from her bed-room after she was taken to Bow-street—I know it was hers, because she bought it of my wife—the officer broke the lock, and found 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold and silver—there were twenty-six sixpences, two of them marked, and three marked shillings; also this halfpenny—these are them—they are marked as I marked them.</p>

On Tuesday, the 21st of July, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came to my shop; my son served her. I was in the parlour behind the shop. She asked him how I was, upon which I went into the shop; she gave me a 1l. bank note, I asked her name, she said it was Brooks, and she lived in Mary-street, Fitzroy-square; my son immediately said that he had taken a bad note in December last, and he believed she was the person who gave it to him. She seemed very much agitated at the time, and said she did not live in Mary-street, but in Mary's-place, and then afterwards said that she had left Mary's-place, and had gone to live at No. 11, George's-street, Fitzroy-square. We asked how long she had left Mary's-place, she said about twelve-months; that her husband was a painter and glazier, and had taken a little shop there. This was after she had said she lived in George-street. I gave her 12s. 11/4d. which was her change; she had bought tea, sugar, and soap. I marked the note before she left the shop (looking at one), this is it. I wrote Mrs. Brooks, No. 11, George-street, Fitzroy-square, on it. I desired my son to follow her. My house is rather more than half a mile from Fitzroy-square; it is at the corner of Upper Baker-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. I put the note in my silver till; there was no other note there; I kept it by itself; I marked it as soon as I received it.</p>
               <p>Q. Your son told her she had passed a bad note before - A. Yes; she was agitated; it would have alarmed me to have been told so.</p>
               <p>MR. REYNOLDS. Q. When first she mentioned Mary-street, did she say she lived there, or had lived there-A. She gave it as her address.</p>

            . I am the son of the last witness. On the 21st of July, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came to our shop. I served her with one pound of sugar, a quarter of a pound of tea, and two ounces of pearl ashes. She then asked how my father was; he had not been ill. He came out of the parlour, hearing her ask for him. She offered him a 1l. bank note; he gave her the change before she gave him the note. She then handed it to him at the desk, he asked her name, she said it was Brooks, and that she lived in Mary-street, Fitzroy-square. I remembered taking a bad note some months before, of the same address, and told her I had taken a bad note of a woman so much like her, that I thought she was the woman. She changed colour, and appeared greatly agitated, and said she had formerly lived in Mary's-place, but now at No. 11, George-street, Fitzroy-square; that her husband was a painter, and kept<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181809090047"></xptr>a shop there. She faultered in her speech very much, and said if my father did not like the note she would give him another; he said it was quite a new one, and declined returning it, saying he dare say it was as good as any other. She asked me to cut the soap, as it was too large to go into her basket. She broke it herself and put it in.</p>
               <p>Q. After she left, did you, by your father's desire, follow her - A. Yes. When she got out of the New-road, I lost sight of her; I ran as far as the New Church, but could not see her. I returned and saw her go down Alsop's-place. She kept looking back, to see if any one followed her. She then crossed the top of Upper Baker-street, which is on the other side of the New-road, looked up the street towards our house, and went down Park-place to Park-street. I do not think she saw me. She came into Gloucester-place and the New-road again, and looked down towards our house. After crossing the road she ran all the way to York-street, Gloucester-place, I there met Slade, he joined in the pursuit; he kept behind her, and I kept at a distance, fearing she would know me. We followed her into Crawford-street, and through different streets into Marylebone-lane; she went into the Cross Keys there, Slade followed her in; she came out in about five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q.When she went in, had she her basket - A. Yes; she brought it out again. We followed her into Oxford-street, where she went into a chemist's shop by the Green Man and Still, came out in about five minutes, and we followed her through several streets to the Seven Dials up Longacre. I left Slade to watch her, and ran to Bow-street, got an officer, and found her in Lincoln's-Inn-Fields. The officer apprehended her there.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time did you leave your father's house - A. A quarter before four, it wanted about ten minutes to five when we took her. Her basket would weigh about six pounds and a quarter.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Your object was to see if she lived where she said - A. Yes. She became agitated when I said she was like the woman who had passed a bad note to me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. While she was going through the different streets, did she look back - A. Yes, as she ran down from the New-road to York-street, not after.</p>

            . I met White in Gloucester-place, and followed the prisoner through the different streets he has mentioned. I followed her into the Cross Keys, in Marylebone-lane; she had half a pint of beer there. She did not know me; she paid for it out of some silver and halfpence which were in her hand, and came out.</p>
               <p>JOHN TOWNSEND. I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner in Lincoln's-Inn-Fields. I took her to the office. While we were waiting for the magistrate she appeared agitated. I asked what made her uneasy, and told her if she had given her right name and address she had no occasion to be afraid. She said she had given her right name, as she had given her maiden name. I said I suppose then you have been married. She said she had. Whether she mentioned her husband's name or not, I cannot say. She mentioned some name which I do not remember. She said she had been an unfortunate woman, and had received the note from a gentleman; that the gentleman walked that way with her towards Marylebone, where he left her. She saw the shop and bought the things. I found a good 1l. note on her, 11s. 6d. in silver, and 4d. in copper.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. You did not find silver on her sufficient to buy the things without changing - A. No.</p>

I was going to the Edgeware-road, and went into the prosecutor's shop, where I had frequently been before. for grocery to take to my daughter. I turned towards the Edgeware-road, but thought it was too late to go, when I returned, and was making the best of my way to Blackfriars-road, where my daughter was apprenticed, and the officer took me. I told the prosecutor I had lived in Mary's-place, but now lived in George-street, Fitzroy-square. I did not give the right address, not wishing to disgrace my family, as I knew how I got the note. I did not know that I was being followed.</p>

             sworn. I am the wife of the last witness. On Sunday morning a knock came to the door, the prisoner at the bar said that he had brought a board, and he asked if master was at home, I said no, he asked me to let him leave it, which I did, he asked me for a shilling, and I gave it him; I asked him what I should say when master came home, he said half a crown, and he would call again; he called on Monday morning, and Mr. Sturdy took him to Marlborough-street. (The board produced.)</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the same board. - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. (to Sturdy) On the Monday when he came you took him to Marlborough-street. - A. Yes, I went to a neighbour of mine and asked him what was to be done, as I believed they were stolen goods, he advised me and said he would assist me in taking him to Marlborough-street, accordingly we took him there; that is the second-board that he left at my house, I should have taken him on Sunday if I had been at home.</p>
               <p>Q. (to Eaton) Whose board is that. - A. It is the property of Mr. Slade.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the worth of them. - A. We valued it at half a crown; Mr. Slade at Marlborough-street said he would give three shillings and nine pence a-piece for a hundred of them.</p>

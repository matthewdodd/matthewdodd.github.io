               <p>"You have robbed me;" the patrol came up, and she threw it on the ground; I had about 4l. 10s. - it was three half-sovereigns, one sovereign, and some silver; it was all in my right-hand breeches pocket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR.PHILLIPS. Q. Are you married? A. Yes, and have a family; I had been in Marklane all day, and had been in a public-house on business, in Mark-lane, and then to another in Crutched-friars, and had some half-and-half with some friends - I did not spend 2s. altogether; I was not quite sober; I cannot say whether I had any gin and water, or rum and water: I went down a dark passage, but for no improper purpose; I did not give her any thing. I live in Harvey-terrace, Commercial-road; she did not say I had given her 2s.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the night of the 13th of February I heard a cry of Watch! up Barleymow-court; I ran up; Ashdown had hold of the prisoner, and said, "She has robbed me;" I took hold of her hand, and said, "Have you robbed him?" she said No; I held her, sent for a light, and found a half sovereign, three half-crowns, a shilling, and six sixpences; the prosecutor said next morning that he lost 1l. 12s. 6d. I took her to the watch-house, and 18d. was found on her; she said he had offered her 5s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. In what state was the prosecutor? A. He was not sober; he gave us some beer after we had locked her up - he said that night that he had lost a considerable deal of money; he seemed too drunk to tell how much he had lost - he said he could not tell till he looked at his books - they were about ten yards down the passage.</p>

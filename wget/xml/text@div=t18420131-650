At half-past nine o'clock on the 11th of January, I was in the shop—the prisoner came in, and asked for some drab twist—I put the drawer up to him—he looked, pulled out a ball, and said that would do, he wanted a yard of it—he put his hand into the drawer again, took out these two balls, put them into his left pocket, and said he wanted some other silk—he was going out of the door—I caught him, and went with him as far as Sun-street, and there he got from me.</p>

I keep a coffee-shop at 8, Drury-lane—on the morning of 4th December, about 1 o'clock, I was awoke by some one going up my stairs—that person had boots on, but he came down without any; in about twenty minutes afterwards I heard the street door shut very gently—the prisoner had been lodging in my house from 5th November up to that time—he slept in the third-floor front room, where the two witness slept who are here</p>

On the 21st. of October I received a couple of axle-trees with mettal boxes, and placed them under the side of the shed numbered 3. At four in the afternoon I saw them safe. At eight the next morning, it was pointed out to me that they were missing, and I perceived that they were.</p>
               <p>Cross examined by Mr, Reynolds. There were no other axle-tree boxes in the docks I believe; if there had, I should have known of them.</p>

            . I am a Thames Police officer, attending at the West India Docks; upon the news of the loss of these mettal boxes, I searched for them, among other places, I made search on some piles of fustic wood;

             found one on the top, covered over with two or three pieces; we did not move it; but waited to see who would come and fetch it. We watched that pile by turns. Roebuck and I were on a stack together, and saw the prisoner go by; the prisoner walked by, and looked round towards the stack as he passed. The next time I saw him was at a quarter before four, and then he was looking round, evidently to see if any one was on the watch for him, or looking at him. He then got upon the stack and looked round again; we were concealed. He then moved two pieces of wood with his left hand, and laid hold of the box with his right; I jumped down immediately and went and seized him. This stack was about four feet high; he said he had got up there to ease himself; there is a privy within forty yards. He could not have seen the box on the top of the stack passing by because it was concealed with two pieces of fustic wood; he let the box drop before we seized him.</p>

            </rs>. The first Evidence was one Mr. Woodward, an Eminent Attorney in this City, who deposed, that the Prisoner had been his Client for several Years past, and about two or three Years since she came to him, and brought him a Bond to look over, and desired him that another should be drawn by it, which Bond was signed Robert Clayton, and had a Seal affixed to it, and the Names of four Witnesses subscribed to the same, and was of the Penalty of 40000 l. and dated in the Year 1687. or thereabouts, to pay 1200 l. yearly so long as Sir Robert should live, and after his Decease, for Payment of the Sum of 20000 l. Upon which she desired him that it might be kept a great Secret, and that his Servants should not know any thing of it, for that it was to be delivered up to Sir Robert, and she was to disclaim her Interest by a Bill in Chancery, and told him that she had received Money upon the said Bond, and did deny him to cast up what was in Arrear, which he did, <note>[Text unreadable in original.]</note> of the Bond to draw the other by, by reason it was a special Condition (which Copy he produced in Court) and said, that he did believe it to be a true Copy of the same, and afterwards he drew a Bond of the Penalty of 54000 l. for Payment of 27000 l. upon which he told her, it was a great Sum, and did require People of some Credit, to see it executed, and offered her to be one of the Witnesses to see it done himself; upon which she reply'd, that Sir Robert knew him very well, and did not desire him to be a Witness: Then she took the Bond and the Draught from him, and went her ways, and he did not know what she did with it afterwards. The next Evidence was a very worthy Gentleman, who deposed, that he was present when she was brought before my Lord Chief Justice Holt, and she did then acknowledge that she did cause the Bond to be made by one Lucar, a Scrivener in Bishopsgate-street, and owned that she did it her self, and directed him to make it by her Order. The Prisoner denied the Fact, saying, she was altogether innocent, and never did wrong Sir Robert of any thing in all her Life; she called People to her Reputation, but that did not avail her: The Jury having considered the matter, found her <rs id="t16991011-19-verdict99" type="verdictDescription">

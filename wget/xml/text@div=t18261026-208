On the 2d of September, about a quarter past nine o'clock at night, I saw him take an apron full of candles out of a box, and take them to his own premises - I gave information to Bain, the foreman, and he was afterwards apprehended - he had 12lbs. or perhaps 18lbs.; he took them from a place where candles are laid out for the men, who work at night; I was in the melting-house; he took a candle to take them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How long after this was he in Mr. Birke's employ? A. Eight or ten days - Bain said, "Why did not you stop him" - I said I could not; he said, "Let it lay, and we will catch him again;" he was taken to the office on the 14th and discharged, because I was not there - he did not give himself up on this charge.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How far was his house off? A. Not twenty yards - I went up-stairs and told Bain directly.</p>

            . Farrell informed me of this; I told him to he quiet about it - the prisoner did not surrender himself - I went to his house and found 6lbs. or 8lbs. of candles on the 14th - they were such as we make.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Why did not you go insantly and search his house? A. I had no authority; I believe there has been a charge against my master for smuggling, but not against me - I have no idea of the prisoner being a witness against my master; I do not expect it - the prisoner is married, and has one child.</p>

            . I apprehended the prisoner on the 14th of September, on a charge of stealing soap - I went to his house, and found a quantity of candles in a box, they were so broken, I have not brought them - he was discharged about the soap; I took him afterwards about the candles.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he give himself up? A. He would, I believe - he sent me word that he would give himself up, but he had been absent.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never took a candle; the officer let me remain at home all night, on promising to come in the morning, which I did - all the candles I had, these men gave me - Bain has called me up twice to work after the Excise officer came round.</p>

            . Q. Where does Mr. Birke live? A. In Fulham-road, about three-hundred yards froca the premises; I thought it not worth while to go and tell him; he was at home - I told his son of it - the prisoner never bought any candles; the men are not allowed candles - they were broken candles for the men's use.</p>

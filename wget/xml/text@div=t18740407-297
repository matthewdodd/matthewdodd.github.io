                  </hi>. I am a tobacco broker, at 2, Billiter Street, City—Vann was our duty clerk, and left our service in October last, giving no notice—I searched his drawer afterwards and found amongst a lot of documents these receipt forms, unsigned by the Customs—it was his duty to make them out and pay them in with the money which he received—I also found this slip, which gives the amount of duty payable in the course of the day—all these documents are in the prisoner's handwriting—if he had money for the duties, it would be his duty to take that money with the slip and pay it in to the Treasury, at the Custom House, and the receipt was passed on to another officer of the Custom House, who would then pass the duty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner has been in my service about six years—I have nine or ten clerks, mostly young men, about his own age—if he was away from business, Akam would perform his duties—I have no knowledge that Akam kept a shop—I have heard it since—we draw a cheque for the duties on our own bank, the National Provincial, and they draw a cheque on the Bank of England—the Customs will only take Bank of England cheques—and if that transfer cheque is not sufficient to pay the duties, we give an open cheque after—the Customs would take an open cheque, but they would send to the Bank to see if it was cashed—if the prisoner had had several warrants it would be within his power to keep some back, but it was his duty to pay them in—the large transfer cheque is sent down early, and as the duties are received from the docks in batches they are filled up and entered in our books and sent on to the Custom House, and it is either plus or minus to us at the end of the day—if it is minus, we give a small cheque, and if it is plus it is something to our credit for the next day—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187404070083"></xptr>
               <p>Akam would make the entries in Vann's book during his absence or illness—he was a subordinate of Vann's—Akam has been with us seven or eight years.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Vann made out the warrants in the morning—they are printed forms supplied by ourselves—they are taken to the docks where the goods are and are then sent up to the long room of the customs—the money is taken to the treasury, and the receipts are handed to the clerk who has the warrants, so that the two things come together; the initialled warrants from the docks showing the goods, and the slips showing that the Customs have received the money—it was Vann's duty entirely to see after the duties—he had no other duty except to see that the goods were sent home—if he allowed any other clerk to do it he was doing what was not his duty.</p>

                  </hi>. I am cashier to the prosecutors—on 3rd December, 1872, Vann asked me for excess duty to the amount of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I gave him a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note and 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, which it was his duty to pay to the Customs—there is an entry in this book in his own writing as having received it—on 11th December I gave him 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in cash, that is also entered in his own handwriting—I gave him a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold and silver—on 7th January, 1873, 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in cash at his request, and it is entered in his writing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have been with Mr. Wilkins about nine years—I have given three sums which I say I paid to the prisoner because his figures go to show it and he must have received them—I have paid Akam occasionally in that way when Vann has been absent, but certainly not when he was present, because he was the party to receive the cash—I always handed the amounts to him—I have known Akam perform Vann's duty—I did not know of Akam keeping a tobacco shop—during the time Vann was in the office he was tolerably regular and a good-natured pleasant young fellow—it might have been early or late that I paid these sums to him, it depends upon the number of warrants—they were the small sums to pay up the warrants to the customs—a man had no right to keep one or two warrants back from one day to another—a dishonest person might do it—after handing Vann the cash I troubled myself no more about it—we had one or two boys who went to the Custom House generally, bat Vann had charge of that depart<lb></lb>ment and I attended to my own duties—I could not tell you who went to the bank with the cheques but Vann had them handed to him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the principal clerks in the long room at the Custom House—the amounts paid by the prosecutors for duty would be payable in the treasury—the tobacco sheet of the 3rd December contains the items paid by Messrs. Bramble, Wilkins &amp; Co.—there is no entry of any sum of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on their behalf—there is no entry on the 11th of the same month of the payment of 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in their favour—nor is there any entry on the 7th January, of the payment of 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the receipt for the money paid, is signed by the cashier, and kept in the department—I have searched for six days after each of the dates named, and I have not found the receipts for any of those sums.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> On the 3rd December, Messrs. Bramble &amp; Co. paid in two bank transfers, one for 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and one for 320.—and at the end of the</p>

               <p>day there was a balance of 67<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. credited to them—there would be a running account—on 11th December, they paid in two transfers of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there was 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. over that day—on 7th January, they com<lb></lb>menced with a balance from the previous day and paid in 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by a transfer, and 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. there was no small sum—I can't tell you who brought the cheques—I know most of Akam—J saw him most frequently—he would not bring the transfer cheques to me—he would take them to the cashier in the Treasury, and the cashier forwards the receipt to me—I don't remember seeing anyone else besides Akam—I can't speak as to Vann at all—customers can't take the goods out unless the duties are paid—I know nothing of Akam keeping a shop—I believe that warrants could be kept back for a few days, but I don't know it for a fact.</p>
               <p>I. J. H. <hi rend="smallCaps">WILKINS</hi> (<hi rend="italic">re called.</hi>) If sufficient money is not paid into the Custom House they would not deliver the tobacco, and another transfer cheque would be drawn—if we paid 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and only 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. were wanted they would keep the 195<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to go on till the next day—this thing came to my knowledge from a customer, and I have found since, in the prisoner's drawer, letters which have been suppressed and never came before me; letters directed to the firm.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COOPER</hi>. Vann's drawer was not open to the other clerks in the office—I believe it was locked—I never went to Vanu's house—my attorney went and the father would not allow him to see my attorney, and an appoint<lb></lb>ment was made for him to come the next day, and he never came—I never knew of these sums being missing till recently—I did not tell the prisoner the books were wrong, because the moment I found it out he bolted—I knew where his father was and I sent for him and he came—he said his son would come and give an explanation when necessary, and when he came his father would not allow him to give an explanation and then I made an appointment, on two occasions, and he did not come—he offered to go through the books at any time, but I made two appointments and he did not keep either of them.</p>

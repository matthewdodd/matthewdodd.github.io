            . I am a smith, and live in Mitcham-street, Paddington. I have known the prisoner twenty years: he came to my shop on the 7th of August, to ask if I would go and give him a hand in the morning to do a job - he said he could pay me four or five shillings. and I could be back to my work by ten o'clock; I called him at three the next morning, and went with him to <placeName id="t18280911-256-crimeloc1311">great Chapel-street</placeName>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. What money have you received from the gentleman since my commitment? A. Sometimes I received 1s., and sometimes 2s. 6d.; I do not know how much in all - I called on you in prison, and you asked me to bring you a bit of tobacco; I never told you then what I had received - nor said that I was to go for more on Saturday; I certainly called on you on the 5th of September, but I was not drunk - I said I had received 2s. 6d. - you asked me why I had not gone away, and I said I could not; you said you would have gone on glass bottles to have got away - I did not, to the best of my recollection, want half a sovereign of you; I have been two or three times to you, but not to get money - you had been in the first regiment with me; I did not shew you my coat sleeve, and say I could not go into the country without a coat.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Have you been out of work? A. Yes; and I got some money of the parish.</p>

            . I am inspector of the parish of St. Ann's, Westminster. In the month of August I went with Clubb to Great Chapel-street, St. Ann's-court, Carlisle-street, and that neighbourhood - he pointed out places where lamp-irons had been taken from by him, and the prisoner; I had seen the irons there before, and I saw irons at Burrow's, which appeared to me to be the same.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that a man named Houghton of No. 6, Great Chesterfield-street, who represented himself as foreman of the gas works, had employed him to take down the irons and dispose of them.</p>

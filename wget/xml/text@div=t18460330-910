                  </hi>. I am a gardener, and live at Stratford, in Essex—on the 14th of March I was in Covent-garden-market—I had some flower roots there for sale—Jane Chappell came and bargained for a dozen roots, which came to 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she gave me a good half-crown, and I gave her two shillings and 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in coppers—I noticed the shillings I gave her—they were two old shillings, and I am sure they both had a man's head on them—when she received the money, she just turned her back to me, and I turned to speak to another woman—she then turned to me again, and said I had given her a bad shil<lb></lb>ling—I said I was confident I had not, for I had not a bad shilling about me—she persisted in her assertion, and showed me the shilling which she said I had given her—I took it from her—it was not one that I had given her—it was a Victoria shilling, and was not much worn—I gave her a good shilling in exchange, because she insisted that I gave it her—I kept the shilling that I exchanged for her apart from other money, till I gave it to Mr. Johnson—in about ten minutes Gadson came to me, and in consequence of what he said, I went with him to the police-station in Bow-street—I there found Johnson, to whom I gave the bad shilling—I found the two prisoners in custody.</p>

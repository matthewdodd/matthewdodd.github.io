            . I live with the prosecutrix. I saw the duplicates taken from the copper hole in the back wash-house.</p>
               <p>MARY M'CLELLAN re-examined. She confessed her crime after I had told her I was conscious of her having stolen articles. I had sent for an officer - she expressed great surprise at that; I had before that looked into her boxes - three of them were open, and the other was locked: I took her keys, which laid in the kitchen, and opened her box. I found a pocket with a pair of silk gloves, which I had missed for some time; I looked further, and found a silk pocket book, in which was a number of duplicates. I replaced the book in the pocket, and sent for an officer. I called her into the kitchen, and in the presence of the officer told her she knew I was in the habit of missing various articles, and while I had other persons about me I had not suspected her, but now I had no one to accuse but her. The officer then told me to search her boxes, which I did - but the duplicates had been removed. I said,</p>
               <p>"Where is the brown silk needle book?" she persisted that she had no such thing - I said I knew it was there, for I had had it in my own hand; she still persisted in not having such a thing; I then said,</p>
               <p>"It will be unavailable for you to conceal it, you and I shall appear in another place, and you will there be compelled to produce it." The officer then left the room, and she burst out crying, and asked if I would forgive her - I said,</p>
               <p>"I will make no promise - the law must take it's course; I fear you are a wicked girl;" she then, after some time, confessed that she had thrown the duplicates into the copper-hole in the back wash-house: I called the officer, and told him the duplicates were found. I went with the officer to the pawnbrokers, and saw the property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How came you to take the girl into your service? A. From a knowledge of herself and her family; I have known them four or five years: her sister had lived as servant with me. Her father lives about half a mile from my house. She had eleven guineas a year, but had had no wages; there was not any due.</p>

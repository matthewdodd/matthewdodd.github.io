            . On Saturday the fifth of January the prisoner came into my shop and asked to look at a black silk cloak; I took one out of the window and gave it her; she observed the shop was too dark to look at it, she would take it to the door; I did not take particular notice of her for the space of a minute till I was alarmed by some people in the shop that the woman had run away with the cloak; there was five or six in the shop at the time; I immediately ran round the counter to the door, and a young woman who was in the shop ran round with me; I observed she was four or five doors from my house, when she found she was pursued she turned into a pastry cook's shop; I followed her into the pastry cook's shop, and I found the cloak on her; she was walking when I first saw her, the cloak was tucked underneath two other cloaks which she had on; I charged her with stealing the cloak; she talked something, but I did not hear what; I opened her cloak and there I found it; this was after I had done charging her with it. I know it was my cloak by the paper that was on it of my own writing 1 l. 5 s. I can swear to it; I did not observe her to go out of the house.</p>

               <p>Q. Did she walk or run? - She walked; I followed her, and she went into the pastry cook's shop; Mr. Tyler followed her there and took it from her, it was under her arm all of a heap.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say any thing at all about it? - No, she did not; Mr. Tyler took it from under her arm.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I had been seeing a brother of mine that was come home from sea; I was got a drop of liquor, and there was a young woman standing at the window, says she, mother I want to buy a black silk cloak; she also said, she was ordered, as it was twelfth day, to buy a twelfth cake, and she would go in and buy one at the pastry cook's, say she, if you will come in with me I will go and look at it; I went in, the gentleman gave me the cloak out of the window, and I looked at it, the price of the cloak, as I thought he said, was 30 s. I went to the door and I saw that the young woman did not stand at the door, and I went to the pastry cook's, and it rained very hard, and I asked the pastry cook woman whether a young woman had not come in there to buy a bunn; and that is all as I expect mercy of God and you.</p>

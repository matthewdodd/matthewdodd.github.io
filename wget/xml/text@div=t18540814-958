                  </hi>. I am a labourer. In July last I was working at Lee, in Kent—about 7 o'clock on Monday evening, I went to lie down on the top of a load of hay, and was there till 10 o'clock at night with another man—the prisoner then came up, and asked who was there—we never</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185408140100"></xptr>
               <p>made any answer—he sat down hard by us for about five minutes, and then he laid down between me and the other man—he stopped there about ten minutes—he then got up, took a knife out of his pocket, and said, "If you don't come out of that, I will rip you open"—he made several attempts to strike me with the knife, and he ran the knife into my wrist—he made two or three attempts afterwards to stab me in the body with the knife, and began to kick me about, and I flung myself off the load and went to a surgeon's—I am able to go to work now.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I was working for Mr. Morris, at this place, for these two years; I never saw this man in my life, before the policeman came and took me; I had nothing to do with it. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I had never worked there before this day—I had seen the prisoner in the morning before he stabbed me, bringing out some beer to the people—I had not been at work that morning; I was standing about, looking for a job, as I was promised one on Tuesday—I got up on the load of hay for a bed—it was about 10 o'clock when the prisoner came up; it was middling dark then—I do not know the name of the man who was up there with me; he was a stranger to me—when this happened, I hallooed out that I was struck with a knife—a lot of men were lying down in the building, and they all got up—I found the pri<lb></lb>soner's cap on the load where I was sleeping, and I brought it down in my hand—I found it after I was stabbed, when I went up to look for my clothes, for I had nothing on but my shirt—after he stabbed me he went away, and went on the top of another load—when I brought the cap down, all the men that worked on the farm looked at it and said it was this man's cap—it was a cloth cap; I had never taken any notice of it before—I had seen his face; I was looking at his face before he stabbed me—I had him taken up in a few minutes, for one of the men ran for a policeman, and he was taken directly—the policeman kept the cap.</p>
               <p>---- <hi rend="smallCaps">FINCHANS</hi>. I am a surgeon. I saw the prosecutor—the wound was about three-quarters of an inch deep—it was along the wrist—it divided one of the tendons—such a knife as this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) would cause such a wound.</p>

I took the prisoner into custody on the night of 31st July, at Mr. Morris's farm, at Lee—I found him on the top of a load of hay—there were two men and a woman sleep<lb></lb>ing at another part of the same load of hay—he was alone in the part where he was lying—I took him into custody in consequence of the prosecutor identifying him as the man who had stabbed him with the knife—the prisoner said he had not removed from where he was, and he knew nothing at all about it—this knife was brought to me by a man who found it, on the load of hay being removed—that man is not here; I have seen him about the neighbourhood—I know Mr. Morris—the prisoner has worked for him some two or three months—I saw the cap that was found under<lb></lb>neath the waggon—the prisoner asked me to allow him to have his cap, and he picked out that one as being his—I found another cap on his head, but that was identified by a man named McCarthy, not the prosecutor, but a man who was sleeping on the load of hay, where I found the prisoner—the prisoner said before the Magistrate, at the first examination, that he and the prosecutor were quarrelling, and that the prosecutor struck him with a sickle—(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

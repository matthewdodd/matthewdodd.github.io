                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. Hodges, of Oxford-street—on 26th March, about 8 in the evening, the prisoner came and looked at a pair of boots—the young man was going to look for some more, but he said, "Never mind, these will do"—he spoke English; I could distinctly under<lb></lb>stand him—he took out his portmannaie, but said that he had not enough silver, and asked if I would change this note (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I identify it by this endorsement—it did not appear to be genuine, and I went and spoke to Mr. Hodges, and in consequence of what he said, I went out, crossed the road to get the opinion of a neighbour, from whose shop I tapped a police<lb></lb>man on the shoulder, who was passing, and directly I did so, I saw the prisoner outside the shop, talking to a second man about twenty yards from me—I had left the prisoner in the shop, saying, in his hearing as I went out, that I must go for change—when the prisoner saw me touch the policeman he started off running as fast as he could—from the first shop I went to I went to a second neighbour; and if the prisoner had been at the door of our shop, he must have seen all that I did—I immediately cried "Stop thief!" and the policeman caught the prisoner.</p>

               <p>me in the street, and said something, in consequence of which I went to<lb></lb>wards Mr. Hodges' shop—I there saw the prisoner—as we walked towards the shop Mr. Oakley shouted, "Stop thief!" and I noticed the prisoner run<lb></lb>ning from the pavement into the road—I had not noticed him before—I ran after him three or four hundred yards, and caught him—he turned out of Oxford-street into Union-street—I did not lose sight of him—he turned round when I got within a few yards of him, and said, "Me done nothing"—I took him into custody—I took him first to Mr. Hodges' shop; he was there charged with uttering this note, and then I took him to the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, of 384, Oxford-street—on 4th February, I came home and found the prisoner in the shop, being served with a pair of boots—I went up, fitted him, and then took the boots to pack them up—he was fumbling about with his portmonnaie, as I supposed getting the money to pay for them, and all at once he said, "Me not money enough," at the same time showing me his portmonnaie, which contained a few shillings and what appeared to be a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—he took the note out and presented it to me—I took it and said I would change it—I took it to the desk and en<lb></lb>dorsed my name on it, "J. Rice"—this is the same note; it has my signa<lb></lb>ture—this "Mr. Rice" on the back was written by another person—I gave the prisoner four sovereigns and 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change; 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was the price of the boots—he went away with the change and the boots—the note was returned to me on 7th February—I next saw the prisoner at the police-court, on 17th March, in custody—he was first shown to me the passage leading to the Court—it was very dark, and I did not recognise him—I afterwards saw him in the Court where it was light, and became certain, and I recog<lb></lb>nised his voice—I have not the least doubt he is the man who passed that note—I said in Court, "He has got on the same boots that he purchased of me at the time."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I believe when you heard his voice, it was after you expressed your uncertainty as to his being the man? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; but I saw him in Court ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after that, and recognised the general character of his person, though I was not sure of him until he spoke—it was not by his broken English that I recognised him, because he did not speak English at all, it was by the general voice, not the words—not by his voice alone, but by his general character as well—I did say before that I did not notice what dress he wore at the time he purchased the boots—I also know the marks inside the boots—they were made expressly to my order, by Mr. Hatton of Northampton—I do not think there are any others of the same class—I have a boot here which will match them—the marks on them are "7 C. S." which constitues the quality and the size—the private mark was outside and would be worn off—when I first entered the shop my shopman was serving—I had him at the police-court, but the Magistrate refused to hear further evidence, and he is not here to-day—the prisoner</p>

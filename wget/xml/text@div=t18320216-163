               <p>SHACK HUSSAN, (through an interpreter.) I live in Union-street. The prisoner was a particular friend of mine - I was coming from where I slept, with a girl, between ten and eleven o'clock at night, when the prisoner caught hold of my collar and threw me down - he had lived with the girl before he came to this country, and I believe it arose more from jealousy than a wish to rob me; he took off my turban, but whether my money fell out of my pocket or he took it, I do not know - I cannot say whether he run or walked away; as a mob came round, the people said he took my turban up, but I did not see it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman E</hi> 412). About 2.30 in the morning of 31st December, I was on duty in Grafton Street—I saw the two prisoners near the end of Grafton Street—I heard one say "There comes the <hi rend="italic">bloke</hi>"—they went down Grafton Street a little way, and returned with the prosecutor between them; he went into his door, No. 28, and then came and stood on the kerb-stone, almost opposite the door, the prisoners being a few yards from him—I saw Brian run at him—I can't say whether he struck him, but he knocked him down on the road—Sullivan immediately ran to him, I could see they were feeling about the upper part of his person—I ran to his assistance—he cried out "Thieves! I am robbed"—at the same time, I heard a sound like money jingling on the pavement—when I was about two yards from the prosecutor, the prisoners ran off—I gave chase through several streets, calling "Stop thief!"—a brother constable came to my assistance, and we apprehended them—I at once charged them with knocking down the man in (Grafton Street, and robbing him—Brian said "We only took 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.," and he held out his hand, showing some coppers, I could not see how much—Sullivan said nothing—I took them back to the prosecutor, and he at once identified Brian, and said "That is the man that knocked me down and robbed me."</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Luton, Bedfordshire—in 1872 I was a manufacturing chemist in Bethnal Green, and the defendant put up some gas and steam pipes in my factory—in February, 1872, he asked me to lend him 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to take some premises in Chicksand Street and start a sawmill—he went into possession, and about October, 1872, he met with</p>

               <p>an accident, and went into a hospital; I went to see him there—he after<lb></lb>wards gave me a mortgage for the money I had lent him, and I advanced him more money, amounting to 597<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I then advanced 202<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more, and got a mortgage from him for 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—I afterwards advanced him different sums as he required it—by the advice of my solicitor, in April, 1875, I cancelled the old mortgage, and got this new one in its place, which is to secure 1,160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. advanced—I went with the defendant to Mr. Frazer, the solicitor's, office, and was present when the deed was read over to him—he took it away with him unsigned, but it was executed a day or two after<lb></lb>wards—in December the same year he filed a petition for liquidation, and I was returned as a secured creditor for the 1,160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I retained the mortgage; I did not give it up to the trustee—after his bankruptcy I arranged with him that he should continue in possession of the premises, but there was no arrangement about the rent—he went on as before, paying me the interest on the mortgage money—my security was valued at 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. under the liquidation—in 1879 the defendant spoke to me about making an arrangement with the landlord for a new lease of the premises; he wanted some money for that purpose, which I agreed to advance him on a bill of sale, which was to include some of the movables, such as horses and harness—a draft bill of sale was prepared; he returned it, and would not execute it—ultimately, after trying to obtain some money from him, I in 1880 instructed my solicitor to commence an action for ejectment—I got judg<lb></lb>ment, and at the defendant's request I abstained from putting in an execu<lb></lb>tion for 14 days—I got into possession on 26th February, and then missed a large mahogany saw frame, 3 circular saw benches, a deal sawing frame, a metal travelling frame, and a saw-sharpening machine, value about 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have since seen the mahogany sawing-frame in Hollybush Gardens, at Mr. Vernon's—it was there last Tuesday—the prisoner's yard is an open one, but the shed and the gates are locked—I have not been able to find anybody—about three months ago, when the defendant was wanting money, I said "You are always wanting money;" he said "I have no one else to go to, and it will be to your advantage, because it is to place a better machine there than I have got now, and if it had been <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi> Peters he would have taken them all out and sold them"—I said "Why so?" he said "He did so, did not he?" I said "Yes, because I had no mortgage deed or security, and he could do it, but it would be felony for you to do it, you know, I have a mortgage deed"—I never gave him authority to move any of the things.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a greengrocer—the defendant employed me to move the machinery, and I took it to Hollybush Gardens, Bethnal Green Road, about four months ago—there were several loads. John Frazer. I am Mr. Pepper's solicitor—I prepared the first mort<lb></lb>gage deed of 1872—it was cancelled by my advice in 1875, and the new one substituted for it—the defendant attended at my office; it was read over and explained to him, and he took it home to read it—he brought it back next day, and it was then executed—he certainly thoroughly well understood it—I afterwards brought an action of ejectment for Mr. Pepper and got judgment by default on 10th February, 1880—a summons was then taken out to set aside the judgment, on the ground that he had made a mistake in the day, and was endeavouring to raise the money, and an order</p>

               <p>was made by consent to defer it for 14 days—I acted as the defendant's solicitor in 1875—I never heard any suggestion from him that these fix<lb></lb>tures were not included in the mortgage, and I have seen him frequently and pressed him for payment, and no suggestion of the sort has ever been made.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Towards the close of last year there was an agreement by Mr. Pepper to advance 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the security of the new lease which the prisoner then hoped to obtain, and also on the bill of sale—I supplied Mr. Widdicomb, the prisoner's solicitor, with the abstract of the title, of which this is a copy—there is no mention of these fixtures, but you will find it says "<hi rend="italic">inter alia</hi>" which shows that there was something else—the abstract was not prepared for this purpose—there is no mention of fixtures in it by name—about 24th January this year Mr. Widdicomb called on me and asked whether Mr. Pepper held any bill of sale on the machinery—I said, "No"—I swear he never asked me whether Mr. Pepper held any security other than that described in the abstract of title—I produce a letter from the prisoner's solicitor. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "March 3rd, 1880. Dear Sir,—I hear from the defendant that Mr. Pepper has taken possession of the mortgage premises and turned him out As you are no doubt aware there is certain machinery and effects belonging to Mr. Tushaw on the premises, I shall be glad to hear from you when Mr. Tushaw can remove the same.") I did not answer that letter, and on 6th March I received this letter: "Dear Sir,—I shall be obliged by a reply to my letter of the 3rd instant." I gave no answer to that letter—no one acted for the prisoner in 1875 when the mort<lb></lb>gage was executed.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I do not think Mr. Widdicomb attended at my office to verify this abstract; the lessor's solicitor came to examine it—I gave Mr. Widdicomb notice in June, 1879, that I had got the mortgage of April, 1875, which he could inspect at any time in my office, but he never came to inspect it.</p>

I did not go clandestinely. I made known who I was, and the business on which I had come—he made no reply.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, of 20, Metropolitan Chambers, Broad Street—since the commencement of last year I have acted for the defendant in several matters—in January or February, 1879, he instructed me to endeavour to get a renewal of his lease from his landlord, and to satisfy the freeholder I obtained the abstract which has been put in—about October last an arrangement was entered into for the advance of 2201. on the security of the new lease—I then received from Mr. Frazer, the solicitor, this draft bill of sale (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which was to be part of the' new security—the fixtures are set out in it—on 24th January I called on Mr. Frazer, after having a conversation with Tushaw as to his right to sell certain fixtures and machinery—he is a very illiterate man; he reads very imperfectly, and his writing is ten times worse—he consulted me as to his right to certain machinery, and I advised him upon that—the step which he afterwards took was the result of my advice—I called on Mr. Frazer on 24th January with reference to this very matter in dispute, and took the abstract of title with me—I said "Does your client hold a bill of sale?"—he said "No"—I held the abstract of title like this, and said "Does your pollen hold any security of this kind?" and disclosed the abstract of title—he said "No"—the words inter alia did not convey to my mint that the fixtures were included, because they were included in the bill of sale—I went to Mr. Frazer especially on that account, to clear it up—I wrote this letter the same evening: ("January 24, 1880. Dear Sir,—I have this morning seen Mr. Frazer, who stated that his client has no charge on the machinery at present. I can, therefore, see no reason why you should not sell the machinery if you desire to do so.")</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Mr. Thompson.</hi> I was negotiating merely for a new lease, it had nothing to do with machinery or fixtures—I gave notice in the abstract that there was an indenture of mortgage of 21st April 1875—I had distinct notice that I could inspect the mortgage at any time at Mr. Frazer's. office—I did not do so because it was the lessor's duty, not mine—it was by Counsel's advice that I allowed ray client to be com<lb></lb>mitted for trial when I could have given the evidence at the police-court which I have given to-day—it was not on a statement of Tushaw's that I advised him that he had a right to remove the fixtures; it was on Mr. Frazer's statement—I do not suppose I made use of the word "fixture" to Mr. Frazer, nor did I ask him whose the machinery was where there is an antecedent mortgage or bill of sale, a second mortgage or bill of sale would not necessarily recite the first, it might or might not—the second recital says "With chattels therein"—I never went to inspect them—I read the draft of the bill of sale, and I very likely read the word "chattels"—it was no use my going into the witness-box, as the Magistrate had made up his mind to commit the defendant—I have not brought the same Counsel here to-day—I employ what Counsel I like.</p>

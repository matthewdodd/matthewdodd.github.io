During the time the prisoner and his first wife cohabited I lived in the house—that was about 1855 or '56—I left some time before she left her husband—I was merely a lodger there, and after I left all acquaintance ceased—I subsequently met her one night in the street, in a most distressed state, in consequence of which I took her in as housekeeper, and she lived in my house—I recollect the prisoner coming to the house in 1862, when she was living with me—I think it was about the middle of June—I did not make any memorandum—he came and knocked at the door, and asked for the <hi rend="italic">Missis</hi>, and the servant, a little girl who was there, opened the door, and Mrs. Omer, seeing him, went out after him, and asked him what he wanted, and he then exhibited a knife to her, and ran away—he had been several times, and exposed us to the neighbours, and when the Missis has been out, she has been pointed at by the neighbours.</p>

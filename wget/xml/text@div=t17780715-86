Young, which she refused to give her; but to pacify the prisoner she went to market and bought dinner for better than half the money, but that did not satisfy the prisoner, and a quarrel ensued which continued the remaining part of the day;

             was dead.</p>
               <p>What time was the blow given? - On Wednesday; she died on Saturday morning; I found her dead upon the floor when I came down.</p>
               <p>Court. Who attended her? - No one; the parish sent a surgeon to examine her after she was dead, but she had no attendance while living that I could see, nor no manner of nourishment given her.</p>
               <p>What time on Wednesday did you see this? - The gentlemen gave me the money between nine and ten on Wednesday morning; at about nine or ten at night the accident happened.</p>
               <p>Then you did not see her fall? - No.</p>
               <p>How came you to call it a push before the coroner? - I said before I could not tell whether it was with a clinched fist or no; I saw her lift up her hand towards her, and with the other hand she shut too the door; the door being a heavy door and shutting too pretty fast, hindered me from seeing her.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the prisoner. What country woman are you? - My Lord, I am not come to inform the court of that; I beg pardon for lording you; (speaking to the counsel) I will not tell; it does not concern the cause.</p>
               <p>Are you ashamed of your country? - That is a matter of no concern.</p>
               <p>How long have you lodged in this house? - A fortnight and a day I believe.</p>
               <p>You say two quakers came to you? - There were.</p>
               <p>Are you a quaker? - I am not to tell.</p>
               <p>Court. If any of these circumstances should happen to be material you will be obliged to answer? - But they are not material my lord.</p>
               <p>Court. You are not to judge of that, if the court insist upon your answering, you must.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the prisoner. Because she has worn.</p>
               <p>Court. You took the oath very willingly and freely, you made no scruple? - None; because I have nothing to say but what is truth.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the prisoner. You lodged there about a fortnight? - Yes.</p>
               <p>This evening after this accident happened, did you go into the next door? - I did not; I went by the next door.</p>
               <p>Had you been at the next door the next morning? - I had never been within side the next door in my life till Rock was taken prisoner. I stood at the window, and had been speaking to them how cruelly Rock used the maid, and ill used me in scolding me, because I did not give her part of my money.</p>
               <p>How came you to swear now that the prisoner gave the deceased a violent blow, and before the coroner you said a push, can you reconcile that? - She lifted her hand, and gave a blow, I told his Lordship I could not tell whether her fist was clinched or no.</p>
               <p>Have you had a quarrel with the prisoner? - Never in my life.</p>
               <p>You speak warm against her? - Nothing but for justice; what I do is against my will that I was ever brought an evidence; I was kept prisoner some days in the Compter, but I must tell the truth when called upon.</p>
               <p>The steps are very near to the door? - They are.</p>
               <p>A small push I believe would push any body down at the door? - I don't know but it may; I am not to tell that, I never tried it.</p>
               <p>Whether a small push would not push a person down into the alley from that door? - I don't know but it may, but I never tried.</p>
               <p>You swear positively that there was a push? - Positively I swear that there was a push.</p>

             was in the kennel; I went to see her, she begged I would lift up her lame leg, as I knew which it was, I did; I asked her how she came to fall in the kennel, she said, Mrs. Rock had shoved her out of doors, that her leg was broke; and she was a dead woman; we got her in with great difficulty, we put her upon a settee bed in the room, and put her leg upon a chair; she turned to Mrs. Rock and said that she had been her bane, but hoped God would forgive her, and she did likewise; Mrs. Rock insisted upon e very body going out of her apartment, which we did, and I saw no more of her.</p>

               <p>I believe you are the watchman? - Yes; after some time I came; Young was then in the house; I was calling the hour of ten; Mrs. Sanday at the Swan said, Mr. Turner when you have done your hour I will be obliged to you to come to me; I did go there; she said Mrs. Rock and Mrs. Young had been drinking, and that Mrs. Young could not get up stairs; will you go and lend her a hand up stairs? I went; there was the prisoner and Mrs. Young sitting silent together in their own apartment. Young said, lend me a hand up stairs, I said I would if she would get up upon her legs; she got up, laid her hands over my shoulder and I helped her up stairs; she said undo my iron, which I did; she desired me to put some brandy upon her leg; I got her to the bed-side, pulled off her shoe and stocking; I said, for decency, pull off her petticoats and I will rub the remainder of the brandy upon her leg. I have known them three years, they were always loving and in unity like two sisters; there was always never no words; the prisoner was always very kind and humane to her.</p>
               <p>Court. What did you apprehend was the matter with her when you rubbed her leg with brandy? - She said something was the matter with her leg.</p>

               <p>Court. Did you think her leg was broke? - I did not think it was; I left her that night and went next morning again.</p>

               <p>To Mr. Benyon. Are you positive that there was a fracture of the leg? - I opened it and there was; it was a simple fracture, not a compound one; both bones were broken.</p>

               <p>Then as there was a great swelling, ignorant people might not be able to judge whether there was a fracture or not? - No man I think could be so ignorant as to over look it.</p>
               <p>Does it not frequently happen that an inflamation must be got rid of before the fracture can be dealt with? - By internal and outward applications.</p>

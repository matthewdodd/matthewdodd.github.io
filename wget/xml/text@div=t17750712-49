               <p>James Lane. I am clerk to the depute clerk of Edinburgh; I saw the prisoner at his office on the 25th of May, about five or six o'clock. Lewis came and acquainted Mr. Trotter, that he, with two others, who were at the George Inn, had committed a robbery in London; they were sent for, Lewis came in first, and produced a number of these things (a box of things shown to Mrs. Templer who deposed to them.) Lewis said, the reason for coming to Mr. Trotter's, was, he had been uneasy ever since the robbery was committed. I wrote the declaration, I have here brought signed by the prisoners, before Mr. Trotter. The declarations were read over to them; they did not attempt to alter or vary them in any part of them. Jackling was searched; and a diamond heart found upon him, and the wrench he broke open the bureau with.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body desire them to make these declarations?</p>
               <p>Lane. They were not told, they must do it. Mr. Trotter admonished them to do it, as the way to make reparation, and the more can did they were, it would be better for them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any promises made, that they should not be punished, if they would confess?</p>
               <p>Lane. Mr. Trotter gave

               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. As to Lewis, he was examined with a view to be a witness, you say, Lewis was the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177507120029"></xptr> person that came in and gave the information?</p>
               <p>Lane. Yes, the last time he came, he was brought into custody; but before, he came, being uneasy in his mind.</p>
               <p>Q. As to Muggleton, how came he before Mr. Trotter?</p>
               <p>Lane. An officer brought him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say?</p>
               <p>Lane. He made the declaration you have here in writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Before he made this declaration, what was said?</p>
               <p>Lane. He was admonished to say nothing but the truth; he was given to understand, that the information was given, and it would be of no use to conceal any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he threatened what would be the consequence, if he did not tell the truth?</p>
               <p>Lane. No, he was not, he was given to understand, that the crime was of a very heinous nature.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he to get by telling the truth? Was he advised to tell the truth, as if it would be of service?</p>
               <p>Lane. Yes, that it was better to tell the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. That could be of no service, if it was to be made use of, it convicts him.</p>
               <p>Lane. It was the Bailiff's mind to say what he did, I know no other reason for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they sworn?</p>
               <p>Lane. No, it is not the form to swear them.</p>
               <p>Q. All that was said by Mr. Trotter, was, that it was better to tell the truth.</p>
               <p>Lane. He was advised to tell the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. Then acting under the influence of the magistrate, he consented to be examined?</p>
               <p>Lane. Yes, he said, it would be better for him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing further said?</p>

               <p>Lane. Not that I remember.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there no circumstances of favour held out to him?</p>
               <p>Lane. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Any threats?</p>
               <p>Lane. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he told what would be the consequence if he did not tell the truth?</p>
               <p>Lane. That there was less favour to be expected, if he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How could he have less favour shewn him than he has now?</p>
               <p>Lane. The lady he has robbed would have had a much worse opinion of him.</p>
               <p>Q. You understood he was to have some favour shewn him if he told the truth?</p>
               <p>Lane. I did not understand any such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Who spoke to Muggleton?</p>
               <p>Lane. Mr. Trotter said, he was brought there for a heinous crime, upon the information of an accomplice, and it would be better to tell the truth, and that it would entitle him to more favour from the lady, the more candid he was in his declaration.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you say upon your oath, Mr. Trotter made use of that expression, if the lady had any favour to give him?</p>
               <p>Lane. I understood it so, I understood when he mentioned it, that it was meant of the lady only.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the same admonition given to Jacklin?</p>
               <p>Lane. He was present when Lewis made his declaration.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing said to Jacklin?</p>
               <p>Lane. Not that I remember, they were both present.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the signature at the bottom of the declaration Mr. Trotter's writing?</p>
               <p>Lane. Yes, I saw him write his, and the prisoners, their names.</p>

On Friday night, the 10th of March, I missed from my bed-room two silver watches, one mine, and one my brother's; two watch-keys, a tobacco-stopper, and a ring; they had been safe in my room on the Monday before—in consequence of information, I saw the prisoner in custody, and saw found on him a tobacco-stopper, two keys, and a ring—he said nothing—there is a door on the staircase of our</p>

                  </hi>. The last witness is my sister. I live at No. 28, Church-street. On Friday, the 10th of March, I saw the prisoner in Church-street, buying a handkerchief of a boy—I stopped at the opposite corner of Lau<lb></lb>rence-street and Church-street—he came over to me, and showed me the handkerchief, and asked if I thought it worth the money—he showed me a George II. sixpence, and then he showed me a watch, the moment hand was off—I asked him to open it—he opened one part—I suspected it was my brother's watch—I asked him to open it to let me see the maker's name—he would not, and went away—I gave information next evening, about five o'clock—I told my sister-in-law, not about the watch, but about seeing him with a quantity of money.</p>

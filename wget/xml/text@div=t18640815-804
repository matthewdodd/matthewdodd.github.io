                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Carthy, and live at 19, Essex-street, City-road-gardens—between 7 and 8 on the evening of 1st August I was passing along Essex-street—Holmes came behind me and tore my bonnet off—I did not see the prisoners till I was on the ground—I might have seen them before that day—I did not know them—I did not give any cause to</p>

               <p>either of them to assault me—Holmes kicked and thumped me in a very violent manner—I had two very bad black eyes, and I was bruised about the body—she dragged me along by my hair, and dashed my head against the wall—I then saw my purse in her hand—I had half a sovereign and some silver in it—my pocket was turned inside out—at that time Driscoll was trying to separate us—they then followed me, and just by the City-road<lb></lb>gardens they attacked me again—I told them they had my purse, and they then shoved me very violently, and Holmes took the earrings out of my ears—a policeman came up, and I gave them into custody—I have suffered very much from the violence—I have been bringing up blood ever since.</p>

Q.</hi> Were your ears torn? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, the wires of the earrings had only to be turned over—they had me on the ground—I had not been drinking with these two women in the Green Gate public-house—there were three of them when they came up to me, but one got away—I might have seen them before, but I was never in company with them—I did not know Holmes—I had not accused her of living with my husband—I have been in trouble, but since then I have reformed, and am connected with respectable people—I have been convicted more than once—I had eighteen months' imprisonment, and Holmes was there at the same time, I believe—I did not speak to her there—we were not allowed to speak there—I have not since I have been out accused her of living with my husband—these ear<lb></lb>rings were given to me by my brother, who lives in the Isle of Wight now—they were not Holmes' earrings—they were in my ears—I have a witness here to prove he saw her take them out of my ears.</p>

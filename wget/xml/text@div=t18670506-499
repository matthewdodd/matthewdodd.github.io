I am a clock-maker at Clerkenwell Close—on Sun<lb></lb>day morning, 7th April, between twelve and one o'clock, I was passing down Field Lane, and as I passed George Alley, Riley rushed on me, struck me on my breast, and knocked me down—the other two prisoners knelt on me, and with the assistance of others, who are not here, rifled my pockets—McCarthy and Carrick both knelt on me, and Carrick took my purse out of my waistcoat pocket—I was sensible all the time—I sung out, "Police!" lustily, which brought assistance—this is my purse.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a newspaper vendor, of 23, Field Lane—on 7th I April I was in Riley's company—I went out from my lodging-house about four or five minutes to twelve, and saw a row at the corner of Field Lane—Riley was then standing up against Gorman's, and this happened against I Green's, three or four yards off—he took no part in what was going on—after the <hi rend="italic">row</hi> was up I saw the prosecutor, aided by a tall <hi rend="italic">chap</hi>, not in! custody, who is called <hi rend="italic">Skinny</hi>—his real name is Charley Scrimmage—he I first asked Webb for a bit of tobacco—Webb said he had none, on which Scrimmage caught hold of him and <hi rend="italic">slashed</hi> him up against Green's shutters, aud then twenty or thirty boys rushed up from the ruins, but what they did I do not know—I saw Webb brought to the ground—Riley was then standing at a little distance with me, and I saw McCarthy standing at a little distance from us—he took no part in it—I heard a cry of "Police!"—Riley bid mo good night, to go to his mother's—he ran down Field Lane, and as he got to the top of the steps he was taken in custody—the cause of the first disturbance was a fight between two men—it was hardly two minutes after that, that Webb was attacked by Scrimmage—it was done in a moment.</p>

On the 27th of January, I was down stairs in my kitchen, and heard glass crash as if it was my shop window; it was about a quarter before six, the lights had been lit nearly an hour-it was quite dark. I ran up stairs and found my glass broken-it was a very thick plate glass. There were some watches hanging just by it. I ran out, and heard the cry of stop thief! I ran with the people, and overtook the prisoner within three doors of my house. Wilmot pointed him out to me. I laid hold of him and took him into my shop. There was a void between the watches. I did not know how many were gone - They were safe when I went down stairs. The prisoner's right hand was cut and bleeding. A person brought the gold case into the shop, which I knew to be mine; somebody else brought in the gold watch-the face and glass was broken, and it was bruised; the case was not hurt. It was worth twenty guineas.</p>

            . In the evening, of the 27th of January, I was in Oxford-street, it was quite dark, I looked at my watch at the time, it wanted exactly a quarter to six-the lamps were lit. I was near Holly-street, and heard a great crash, I turned round instantly to where the noise came from, and saw the prisoner running towards me; nobody else was running-there was a cry of stop thief! he instantly stopped and began walking towards me, there being a strong light from the shop; I stopped him, and told him he was the thief; he wanted me to let him go - I refused. I was going to take him to the place where the glass was broken, and heard something fall. A lady instantly said, the man had thrown something down the area, the sound was close to us; I returned and I saw something lay on the area railing. Mr. Dane came up, and I gave the prisoner up to him. I went to the railing and found it was a watch case, the lady picked it up and gave it to me, the case was open and lay across the area bar, it was three houses from Mr. Dane's; I gave the prosecutor the case.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you see me break the window - A. No, when I took the prisoner's hand out of his pocket, he made a great resistance-his hand bled very much.</p>

I am servant to General Robert Pynn, at Wool<lb></lb>wich—I saw a number of his tame fowls on Friday, the 14th of Feb.—they were all safe that day, and on the Sunday I missed seven—five of the hens are here, and I know them all—we had 1 cwt. of this oil-cake in a comer of the harness room, and some cloths and sacks put on it—it was there for a month or six weeks—the policeman brought some oil<lb></lb>cake, and I found some was missing—I compared it with what we had left, and they appeared the same—I have samples of both of them here.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Woolwich—the prisoner has been in the habit of coming to my shop for different things for the General, and knowing that he had two uncles who were little farmers, I said to him, "Do you know anybody who has got fowls to sell?"—he said, "Yes, the General does sometimes"—I said, "Well, I shall have an opportunity of speaking to the General"—he then said it was not the General, it was the cook—I said, "You can ask the cook if she has any"—next morning he brought me an old hen—I gave him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it, and 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for himself—he then brought me two others from his uncle, as he said—I gave him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for one, and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the other, and 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for himself—I said he need not bring any more, but he came and said a person at Sand Hill had two or three fowls, and he had brought another with an egg in his hand—I had said that the others were old hens, and would not lay—he brought the egg to show that this one did lay.</p>

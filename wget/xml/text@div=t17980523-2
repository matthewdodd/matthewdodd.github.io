               <p>Q. When the watchman took the prisoner, were you sure he was one of the men that robbed you? - A. Yes; he was carried to the watch-house, but was not searched; the next day, before the Magistrate, he was searched, and a knife and sixpence found upon him; the knife was a crooked one.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you perfectly sober at that time? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. How many minutes might pass while they were robbing you? - A. I suppose not three minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it so light that you could clearly see the faces of the men? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you pretty much frightened? - A. Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any other people in the street? - A. No.</p>

Then I turned round, and saw a man run across the road, and go into the Leaping-bar public-house; I told the prosecutor he had better go in and see if that was the man; he went into the passage, and he came out, and said, that is the man, I will take my oath to him; the prisoner had not got into the house then, I went in and took him by the collar, and told him he had robbed a man, and he must go with me; he said, no, I have not robbed a man; I said, the prosecutor says you robbed him, and drew a knife upon him; oh, says he, then hang me at once. I took him to the watch-house and put him into the cage; the next day I took him to Worship-street.</p>

               <p>Q. (To Ward.) Did you go into this public-house that May speaks of? - A. I went into the passage belonging to the house.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to tell me that before? - A. I forgot it.</p>
               <p>Q. He drew a knife upon you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the knife? - A. Yes; it was a crooked blade, very much like this, I believe this is the same knife; he said, if I did not give him my money he would cut my side, and then he took it from me; the other man held me while the prisoner robbed me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I had been at the Black-horse all the afternoon, and was very much in liquor, and fell down in Hatfield-street; I would not go home with my wife, and I fell asleep in the street, and she took my hat and carried it home; a man picked me up, and I said I would give him something to drink, and we went to the Leaping-bar.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Ward.) Did you observe whether either of the persons that robbed you had a hat on? - A. The prisoner had no hat.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The prosecutor came to me in Newgate, on Friday, and said, if I would give him a guinea, he would make it up.</p>
               <p>Ward. No, he offered me a guinea, and I said, I could not do it.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Did the prisoner appear to be in liquor at the time of the robbery? - A. He did not.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Why did you come to Newgate to see the prisoner? - A. I went to see another person, one Murray, a man that I had known a good while, and I saw him accidentally.</p>
               <p>Q. What was Murray in Newgate for? - A. For a felony. The prisoner's wife came to my house five or six times, and said she would give me a guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask to see the prisoner? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was not in the same yard, and he could not see me till he sent for me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Kirby. If the prosecutor did see him, he must have sent for him.</p>
               <p>Ward. A friend that was with me sent for him.</p>

I saw the prosecutor yesterday, at Hicks's-hall, and said to him, are you come to find a bill against Mr. Griffiths, and he said, yes, he had; I said, you promised to make it up for a guinea; he said, he did, but we did not attend on him; I told him we did attend on Mr. Wright, where he promised to come for the money; he said, if I had come an hour and a half before I did, yesterday, before he had thrown in the bill, he would have settled it.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Ward.) Is what this woman has said true? - A. It is not.</p>
               <p>Q. Is no part of it true? - A. She came to me yesterday with another woman, and asked me to make it up; I told them, I could not do any such thing, I was bound over to prosecute him, and could not; they staid a good while, and I told them it was of no service to stop any longer, for I could not do any thing in it. She first of all asked me if my name was Ward.</p>

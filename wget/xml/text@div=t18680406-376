                  </hi>. On the night of 25th February, between 10 and 11, I was in the Angel public-house, at Hayes—the prisoner was there—we were both the worse for drink—we had a quarrel there—we then went away together, and quarrelled again—after quarrelling some time, he said, "Baldwin, I will stab you"—I then felt him hit me in the breast with something sharp—I put my hand to my breast and found blood coming down—the prisoner fell down on his face, and I kicked him when he was on the ground—I was taken to a doctor.</p>

                  </hi>. I was at the Angel public-house on this night—I was not in liquor—the prisoner and prosecutor went out together, about 11—I heard the prisoner say something to Baldwin as he went out, but I can't say exactly what it was—Baldwin hit him first—Pearce pulled his jacket half off, and then said he would stab the b——.—I did not see any knife—I afterwards went with Baldwin and washed the wound—they had had a few words in the tap room—it was all about nothing.</p>

I am a surgeon, at Hayes—Baldwin came to me on the night of 25th February, about 1 o'clock—he had an incised wound on the right side of the chest—it must have been done by a sharp instrument—it was about two and a quarter inches wide, and about a quar<lb></lb>ter of an inch deep—it had gone through his clothes—he was not very drunk then.</p>

                  </hi>. I am barmaid to Mr. Dunt who keeps the Eastern Hotel public-house, in the West India-road—on 1st February, about 8 o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came there, and asked for a glass of six ale, which came to three-halfpence—I served him, and he gave me in payment 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had rather a doubt about it; but I put it in the till where there were other shillings, and I took the change out, a sixpence, a fourpenny-piece, and 4 halfpenny, to the best of my belief—I afterwards saw the prisoner and a woman at the bar, and he asked her what she would take: she said, "Two pennyworth of rum"—I served her with it, and he tendered for that a bad florin—I knew it was bad as soon as I saw it put down, from his manner—I then went directly to the till and took a bad shilling out, from the top—I am sure it was the same I put in—I took the two pieces to Mr. Dunt—the prisoner made an excuse that the woman had beguiled him in, and he was allowed to go—I kept the 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and the florin, and two or three days afterwards I gave them to constable Gray.</p>

I live with my brother who keeps a beer shop in the West India Dock-road—on 1st February, about a quarter to 9, the prisoner came to our house and asked me for a glass of ale—I served him, and he gave me a shilling in payment—I looked at it and found it was bad—I said to the prisoner, "This is a bad one"—he said he did not know that, and gave me another, I looked at that and found that was bad also—I then told him they were both bad—he did not say where he got them—I then sent for a police-constable and gave him into custody, and gave the two shillings to Sergeant Gray.</p>

I went in and called for the glass of rum, she came in, and then walked out again in a great hurry, and the lady detected it was bad. I then paid for the glass of rum myself and went out. On my way home I went into this beer shop, and called for a glass of ale, and gave a shilling which was bad. I did not know it was bad, and this policeman took me in charge. I did not know what I was doing.</p>

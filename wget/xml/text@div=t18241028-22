             in the City-road, near Wesley's Tabernacle. I was examined on his trial in this place, when he was convicted - he had a parcel under his arm. I followed him to the corner of Chiswell-street, where he met the prisoner; they walked together down Finsbury-street, and Hooper gave the prisoner the parcel at the corner of Chiswell-street - they separated in Finsbury-street: Hooper went away. I followed the prisoner - I saw him put the parcel into a bag; I followed him till he got to White-street, and then said,</p>
               <p>"What have you got there; he said, paper to make a book of, which he had received from a man, a friend of his, but he did not know that he should know him again. The parcel had not been opened. I took him to the Mansion House - he there said he was going to take the paper to be ruled, but I cannot tell who he said he was going to take it to.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you been at the prisoner's house - A. Yes; it is about half a mile from where this transaction took place, and about three quarters of a mile from Messrs. Keys. I examined the prisoner's house, and saw book-binding implements there. He has been at large since last Session - I met him in Little Moorfields; I did not take him up. When he took the parcel from Hooper he walked with it on his arm, in the public street.</p>

            . I saw this paper - it is our manufacture. Hooper was in our employ as porter for many years.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you not sold a considerable quantity of this paper before this transaction - A. Yes; I cannot tell in what direction it went - it might be sent out in town or country after it left our premises; it is made for printing on - it is not fit for books: it might be made into a book, but would not answer the purpose. The prisoner was discharged two Sessions ago, and has had an opportunity since of making his escape.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I received the paper to make a book of from a man whom I had seen before, at the Crown public-house, Chiswell-street; he called me to him at the corner of Chiswell-street, and walked with me - we were going to a man who was to rule it, when the officer saw us, and took me into custody. I was taken to the Mansion House; the officer went to my house - he saw bookbinding tools, and nothing else: I was taken at my own house. I have lived fifteen years in the parish. I was drinking in the public-house with a gentleman, who is here and heard the order given to me to make the book. I have ever since worked for Mr. Lee, in the City-road.</p>

I apprehended the prisoner; I know his residence: I called on him once before; he was not at home the first time I called; I went on the Thursday afterwards, and took him at breakfast; his house had the appearance of a bookbinder living there.

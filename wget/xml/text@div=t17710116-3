               <p>Tidmarsh. No; he came in and took a parcel off the counter; we had sold some of the lace about half an hour before; I called to Mr. White and he went in pursuit of him.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before he was brought in?</p>

            . I happened to be at Mr. White's at this time; his shop woman cried out somebody has stole something; the man ran up Goulston Square; we opened the door that goes into the square and run after him; the prisoner looked round at the corner to see if they were pursued; he pushed the other that had the lace away; I said to Mr. White, will you take care of him, I will pursue the other: he stood at the corner looking back to see if he was pursued. I pursued the other for some considerable time through many allies into Spital-fields; it was just at the duke of the evening. I lost him; a coming back I met the prisoner again; I said my friend, you are one of them; he asked me what that meant; I said you are one of the men that took the things, come back with me and I'll tell you what I mean; he began straggling; we struggled together, I believe, a quarter of an hour. Mr. White heard I had get him again, he came up. The<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177101160006"></xptr> prisoner knocked me down two or three times; we took him back to Mr. White's shop.</p>

               <p>They would not give me time to talk for myself before the justice; upon Tuesday morning I went into the country; I walked with an acquaintance from Bow to Goulston Square. I saw two or three men run very fast; there was a wooden entry in the square; the gentleman hearing me go through turned round and said, you robbed my shop, and knocked me down. A gentleman, a brewer, bid him run after the other men that were gone along; he let me go, and went to stop the other man. I went the rest of the way home; I met this gentleman; he said I was the man he run after; he said I robbed his shop; I said, search me; they dragged me all the way; they sent for a constable; the shop-woman gave orders to charge me; they took me to a back parlour, stripped me, and found nothing upon me.</p>

I lent him a hat; upon Thursday in the afternoon I met him by Bow; he said he was going home because the weather was so bad, so I went home with him: when we came almost by Whitechapel, I asked him if he would drink a pint of beer.

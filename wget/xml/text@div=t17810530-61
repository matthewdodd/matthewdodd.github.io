               <p>Did he at any time tender a note to you? - Some time in November last he came to my shop, and said he wanted about 50 l. worth of books for his library; and if I would let him have them, he would deposit in my hands, as a security, a note for 150 l. which had about six months to run. He said the gentleman lodged, and (I think he said) boarded with him.</p>

On the 16th of May, I think it was, I called upon Mr. Farril with it. Mr. Farril was not stirring. I left notice that I would call again next morning with it; which I did, and then saw Mr. Farril: he refused to pay it. I immediately went to Fiske with it, and told him that Mr. Farril had refused to pay it, and said that it was not his note. Fiske replied, that it was his note, that he had it of him, and he should be made to know it. I told him he must go in and settle that point with Mr. Farril, and wanted him to go with me; but he declined going then, saying, he would go soon. A day or two after, Fiske called on me with his attorney, and desired to know if Mr. Farril had charged him with a forgery. I told them what Mr. Farril had said; that the word forgery was not used, but expressions equivalent to it. Last Tuesday morning I again called on Mr. Farril.</p>
               <p>How many days was that from the last time you was there? - The 16th I went first, the 17th I saw Mr. Farril, and this was the 29th; when I called again, then Mr. Farril said it was a forged bill. Fiske was sent for, and came directly: he persisted in it, that it was a genuine bill, and that he had it of Mr. Farril; and said, that nobody was present but Mrs. Herbert when Mr. Farril gave him the note; but that Mr. Gray and

             was immediately called up; she said, that Mr. Fiske told her, that he had a note of Mr. Farril's, which he believed Mr. Farril did not think of; I think that was the expression. Mr. Gray was sent for, but could not be found; I did not see him, either there, or at the justice's. The prisoner expressed a great deal of readiness to go before a magistrate, and we all went to the office in Litchfield-street; Mr. Mercer and Mr. Crofts were sitting. Mrs. Herbert was sent for, and examined; she denied having any knowledge of the transaction.</p>
               <p>Cross-examination.</p>
               <p>I believe you have known the prisoner some time? - Yes, being of the same trade, I knew him of course.</p>
               <p>You had no difficulty in taking a note of his indorsement? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you know of Mr. Farril's living at the house of Fiske? - I took care to inform myself that there was such a gentleman lodged at his house.</p>

               <p>You say, when you first went to Mr. Farril, his servant told you he was in bed? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You afterwards went to the prisoner, and told him that Mr. Farril said it was a forged note? - Tantamount to it; that he denied its being his note.</p>
               <p>Did not Fiske, upon that representation, insist upon its being a good note; and that he would bring an action against Farril for saying it was otherwise? - Not at that time; that was afterwards, when he called upon me with his attorney.</p>
               <p>He told you he would go to his attorney about it? - No; he said, that it was a genuine note, and he should be made to know it.</p>
               <p>Afterwards he came with Mr. Lee, his attorney? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was you not desired to push Mr. Farril to make a positive assertion, that it was a forgery, for the purpose of enabling Mr. Lee to bring an action? - I was. They said they came to know if Mr. Farril had charged him with forgery, as it was intended to bring an action. I then told them what Mr. Farril said to me; that he had not used the term forgery, but had used equivalent expressions: that he never gave such a note, that it was not his, that he never owed Fiske any such money, I think, were the expressions.</p>
               <p>You could not be positive in your information to Mr. Lee, that Farril had charged Fiske with an absolute forgery? - I said it was a charge of forgery by implication; but that the word forgery had not been made use of by him.</p>
               <p>But the inquiry was directed to know whether he had said so or not? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>I think you have said, that Fiske never made any kind of difficulty about going to a magistrate, nor expressed any kind of apprehension<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178105300068"></xptr> of danger? - He expressed a great deal of unconcern about it.</p>
               <p>Do you know how long Fiske remained at home at his own house, after it was communicated to him by you, that he had been charged with this being a forged note? - From the 17th to last Tuesday the 29th.</p>
               <p>Did you see him at home, and in his business, as usual, on those days? - I never was there between those days. On the 29th I found him in his shop as usual.</p>
               <p>He said nobody was by when the note was given, but Mrs. Herbert and Farril? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know who Mrs. Herbert is? - I never saw her before that morning.</p>
               <p>When Mrs. Herbert came, Farril and Fiske were both present? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did she express any degree of amazement, that Fiske should demand 150 l.? or pretend that Farril could not owe such a sum? did she say any thing about it? - She said she did not apprehend it to be Mr. Farril's note. I cannot recollect her particular expressions.</p>

            , Esquire, sworn.</p>
               <p>I have known Mr. Farril some years.</p>
               <p>He is a man of family and fortune? - I believe, both.</p>
               <p>Do you know his hand-writing? - I think I do. I have seen him write, and have received many letters from him. I have seen the note before; and entirely agree with Mr. Chambers, if the note had come to me, without my having had any notion of it before, I should have taken it for his hand-writing: but, after examination, it is wrote, taking it all together, better than his hand-writing is in general; it is more uniformly well throughout.</p>
               <p>Cross-examination.</p>
               <p>Then, if this note had been produced to you, you say, at first sight, you should have had no doubt about it? - No.</p>
               <p>Are there not some parts so like, that no man alive could distinguish them? - Yes; like Mr. Farril's best hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Do you know Mrs. Herbert? - Yes; I do.</p>
               <p>Is she a married woman? - I apprehend she is.</p>
               <p>Perhaps you may know if Mr. Fiske, the prisoner, has accepted accommodation-notes for Mr. Farrill? - Yes; he has so, indisputably.</p>
               <p>As to what has fallen within your knowledge, how much money has he been accommodated with by Fiske, by those notes? - I believe, with very little more than 50 l. within my knowledge; I do not know how much out of my knowledge. When Mr. Farrill fell out with his friends, he was left in distress, without any money for support; he had been out of town; he could not very well come to town without money: he mentioned it to me and several<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178105300069"></xptr> friends: he applied to Fiske; and there was a note drawn for 150 l. accepted by Mr. Fiske, to accommodate Mr. Farril. None of the parties knowing any thing of the nature of drawing notes, it was so imperfectly drawn, that it was not fit to negotiate: in consequence of which, it was sent back; and another, I believe, drawn, that was not negotiated, because the credit of the parties was not sufficient.</p>
               <p>Is not Mr. Farril, at this moment, indebted to Mr. Fiske for board and lodging? have you not heard him say that? - No; I believe he discharged the debt when he left the house.</p>
               <p>Court. There were accommodation-notes passed between Fiske and Farril? - There was 150 l. accepted by Fiske to accommodate Mr. Farril, which was not successfully negotiated; and in return, three notes, of 50 l. each, given in lieu of it, in order to be negotiated; one of which I know to be out.</p>
               <p>Do you happen to know about what time it was when Fiske accepted these notes? - In October.</p>
               <p>Do you know, as Fiske accepted notes to 150 l. in accommodation of Farril, whether Fiske did not take Farril's note? - I do not know. I asked Mr. Farril if he had done it: he said Fiske made no difficulty about it.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether he was in town the 12th of October? - I know he was.</p>
               <p>Court. This note bears date at the very time of the transaction: it is not probable, but that, when Fiske accepted notes to accommodate Farril, he took Farril's note in return; which note this certainly is. Whether Fiske has done right in negotiating the note, is a very different question, and is the only consideration that will prevent my doing, what I should otherwise do, grant a copy of the indictment.</p>
               <p>If Fiske really is aggrieved, he will take such measures as he is advised.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the prisoner. I shall not ask for a copy of the indictment.</p>

On the 26th of February, about six o'clock in the afternoon, I was standing at the street - door, and the prisoner came into the shop, she remained there about five minutes, there were two men in the shop at the time; I did not see her do any thing; she came out in a great hurry, the men told me to stop her, and I took her by the door, when the cheese fell from her cloak-it was worth ten shillings at the lowest, I had seen it safe on the counter an hour before. Several people had been in the shop. The prisoner was at different parts of the shop; when she was taken into custody she struck the constable very violently.</p>

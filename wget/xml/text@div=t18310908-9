               <p>Simpson. Q.What are the stirrups stained with? A.

            . I belong to the Police. On Saturday, the 27th of August, about ten o'clock at night, I saw the prisoners in Portpool-lane, Gray's Inn-lane, coming in a direction from Jockey's-fields; Helmes was pulling a truck, and Simpson pushing behind - they had the articles now produced in the truck; I followed them into Cross-street, hatton-garden, about four hundred yards, then stopped them, and asked what they had in the truck - Helmes said, "Ask the other behind;" he did not mention his name - he said he was hired to assist him, and the other was to give him 2s.; I said to Simpson, "Hopeful, what have you got here?" that is the name I knew him by - I knew him before; he said, "It is my property, I am going to set up house-keeping;" I asked where he was going with it - he said into West-street, Smithfield; I asked where he got the property from - he said he bought it of a broker in Old-street; I asked the broker's name, and the number of the house where he lived - he said he did not know; I said as he could not give a satisfactory account where he obtained the property, I should take him into custody; I took hold of Helmes, but Simpson got away before I took hold of him, and I took him on the next morning, between eight and nine o'clock, in bed, at his mother's house, No. 3, New-court, Portpool-lane, which I knew before - Newcourt is about the middle of Portpool-lane; they were opposite that court when I first saw them - they might have been taking the things from that court, for what I know.</p>
               <p>Simpson. Q. Did you suspect the things were stolen when you first saw me? A. I did - I followed you down the lane, hoping to get assistance to take you both - Johnson, the Policeman, No. 18, came up; I then seized Helmes - Johnson did not hear the conversation between us; he came up just as I finished questioning him, and also Serjeant Barton; I stopped the truck about ten o'clock - they were not three minutes going from portpool-lane to Cross-street; they went very fast.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you go to Jockey's-fields? A. No.</p>

I gave my wife direction to buy these things for Mr. Hayter, and saw them repeatedly at the place in Jockey's-fields; there is no particular mark on them - I was at Jockey's-fields a fortnight or three weeks before they were taken, but not later; I have been in the habit of going there a great deal, but the groom was out of town - I passed by the place on Saturday, the 27th of August,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080012"></xptr>at ten o'clock in the morning, and seeing a person pass who I knew to be a bad character, I tried the door, and it was fast - I put my knee against it; I went there the next morning, (Sunday,) and found the door standing open, as if it had been opened with a key.</p>
               <p>HENRY FLATMAN. I am a farrier. On Sunday morning. the 28th of August, between eight and nine o'clock, I saw this stable - the door stood two or three inches ajar; I could not judge how it had been opened - there was no appearance of violence; I alarmed the neighbours, and a man went up stairs with me - I found the property gone; I was never there before - Jockey's-fields is all stables, and is much frequented.</p>

               <p>Simpson's Defence.

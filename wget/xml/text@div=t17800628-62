               <p>Was you at his house on Wednesday morning, the 7th of June? - Yes. I saw the prisoner very active in pulling down the wainscoting and shelves. I got out of my bed and went there between twelve and two o'clock; I found a great mob there, about eighty, as near as I can guess; they were pulling down Mr. Miles's house; I saw the prisoner pull down the wainscoting, the shelves, and the window shutters, and throw them into the street, where they were burnt in three different places.</p>
               <p>How long did you see the prisoner there? - The whole time I was there; he was doing this for about an hour and a quarter.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner in the house? - Yes; in the shop.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>What do you say you are? - I am a porter; I work for Mr. Harper at times, in Hatton-street, and for brokers, at different times; I did live with Mr. Williams, my brother now lives in my place.</p>
               <p>How came you to leave Mr. Williams? - I went to a job in the country.</p>
               <p>You did not know the prisoner before? - I might have seen the man's face before, but I was not acquainted with him.</p>
               <p>What day was he taken up? - I cannot tell the day he was taken up, I believe it was Thursday week.</p>
               <p>You was, I suppose, the person who made the information against him? - No; it was one Drew.</p>
               <p>Was he taken up last week? - I do not know, I saw him at the office on Thursday was a week.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178006280147"></xptr>Was he taken up before you heard of the proclamation? - I do not know what day he was taken up; I did not take him up.</p>
               <p>He was taken up on the 21st of June? - Very possibly I was at the Rotation-office; I went there about some other business.</p>
               <p>It was very lucky you went there for some business and saw this man there whom you was not acquainted with? - I know him very well.</p>
               <p>Had you never seen him before the fire? - No.</p>
               <p>The affair happened upon the 6th of June, you go to the office on the 14th, and there luckily see this man again? - I did not take him up; I said that I had seen the prisoner at such a place.</p>
               <p>What was you about at this fire? - I am a neighbour of Mr. Miles's, I live at No. 6, Marlborough-row.</p>
               <p>You was only a spectator at this fire? - No.</p>
               <p>This man you never saw before at all? - No.</p>
               <p>How was he dressed? - The same as he is now.</p>
               <p>Did not you describe him differently? - Never that I know of.</p>
               <p>When did you see him first? - At very near one o'clock.</p>
               <p>This is not the only man you are going to give evidence against? - Only one more, which is the man I went about when I saw the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Only two men you are to have the fifty pounds for? - God forbid! I do not get money in that way.</p>
               <p>At the time you was at the fire and these men were there where did you stand? - I stood just at the corner of Orange-court; on their throwing things out I was afraid I should be hurt; then I went opposite the house.</p>
               <p>You are sure as to the hour? - As near as I could guess it was about one o'clock, rather before one; when I went there first he was very busy at work.</p>
               <p>When you came there first was the fire burning? - I came away about two o'clock, as near as I can guess.</p>
               <p>Did you leave him there? - Yes, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to say you left him there at two o'clock? - I am not sure I left him there, I am sure he was there between one and two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Was he in his livery? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not you describe him to be dressed in a red cap? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Court. You said you did not go to the office on account of the prisoner, but of another man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How came this man there? - One Drew, that was a prisoner and a fellow who was an evidence against him, informed against him that he was in the house.</p>
               <p>How long before that had you heard of the king's proclamation? - I do not know how long I had heard of it.</p>
               <p>Before you went to the magistrate had not you heard there was a reward for every one who was apprehended? - I believe I had.</p>
               <p>When you saw Coulsell, there and recollected you had seen him before, did not it occur to you that you should be entitled to the reward? - No; I do not want the reward; I do not do it for that purpose.</p>
               <p>Do not you think you are entitled to the reward? - I do not know that I am.</p>
               <p>Have you not claimed the reward? - No.</p>
               <p>Where was you when you first saw the prisoner? - At the corner of Orange-court; then I went and stood opposite the house.</p>
               <p>Did you see him in the shop when you were at the corner of Orange-court? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is Orange-court on the same side of the way with the house, or on the opposite side? - On the same side of the way; the side of the house, which is at the corner of the court, was partly built of wood, and they had pulled a part of that down; I could see plainest on the opposite side of the way at the corner of the publick-house.</p>
               <p>Did not you see him, when you was at the corner of the court in the shop? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Which way did you see him, through the place where the wood was pulled down, or through the window? - Through the window which opens into the street. I went round and peeped in to see what they were doing.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178006280148"></xptr>What o'clock was it when you first saw him at work in the shop? - Between one and two; it was a little more than one.</p>
               <p>What light did you see him by? - The blaze of the fire, which was almost opposite the door; the window was quite pulled down; it is a large window.</p>
               <p>Did you see him out in the street at all? - No.</p>
               <p>You never saw him in the shop but by the light of the fire? - Yes, I saw him come to the window and throw the things out several times.</p>

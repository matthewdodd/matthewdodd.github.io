            . I am a watchman in Moorfields. On the 26th of March, about two o'clock in the morning, my brother watchman, Pippin, called out to me stop thief. I saw two men run by my box, I followed them across the quarters, he run round the quarters into the Broker-row and into Wilson-street; I called out stop thief, he was stopped by two gentlemen, I was close behind, I took hold of him by the collar. I am sure it is the same man, I never had him out of my sight.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any thing with him. - A. No, we put him in the watchhouse, and we went to Sash court, where we saw him run out; there we saw this quantity of lead laying on the dunghill.</p>

            . I am a watchman; at two o'clock in the morning I heard a noise of something scratching against the bricks, I walked towards where the sound was, and coming towards the corner of the alley the prisoner walked out, as I believe him to be the man, I did not see his face, with his hands in his pockets. he walked towards the quarters. I asked the other man that came out what they were doing there, he made answer that they were making water. I had suspicion that they were after no good; I went to shift the lanthorn into my other hand to catch him, in the mean time they made their escape; he run across the street to the quarters and went towards Bedlam wall. I lost sight of this man and the other both.</p>
               <p>Q. When they came out of the alley did they both go together. - A. This lad walked out first; my brother watchman went after this lad.</p>
               <p>Q. Now as to this man, how came he to be pursued. - A. This lad came towards us from Bedlam wall; there were three watchmen after the two thieves that ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you do not know that this is the man that came out with his hands in his pocket. - A. It is to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. When he came out he called stop thief. - A. Yes, and my brother watchman Winter and White pursued him. I lost sight of them both, and and this prisoner sprung out against me out of a dark place, he took to his heels and run into the same street and there he was stopped by some gentleman; after we had secured him we went back to the alley; we found the lead upon a dunghill.</p>

On the 6th of April, at twelve o'clock at night, I was alarmed by my dog barking - I looked out of my window, and saw one of my men, (who had been detained at work,) come out of one of stoves. I went to bed again, thinking the dog had been barking at him. I was alarmed about six o'clock in the morning, by one of my men, and found the back premises open, and these goods taken from the racks in one of the drying sheds, which is part of my premises - but not under the same roof, as my dwelling-house, but within the enclosure.</p>
               <p>ROBERT LOCK. I live in Chequer-square, Bunhill-row, and am a constable. On the 7th of April, about nine o'clock in the morning, I went to a house in Gravel-walk, Twister's-alley, with Brown, and knocked at the first floor front room, but could get no admission - we heard the window lifted up - I ran down stairs, and saw the two prisoners with another man, who has escaped - throwing this calico out of window, I told the prosecutor to stop there<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182705310053"></xptr>while I went up-stairs - I forced the door open, and took Court out of the room. Murray and the other got out of the window - I knew both the prisoners before - I found one piece of calico on the bed; I have delivered all the goods to Mr. Dymock, keeping the ends which I have torn off, as it would have spoiled the goods to have kept them in that state.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Who lived in that house? A. Murray; I seized him, but was obliged to let him go.</p>

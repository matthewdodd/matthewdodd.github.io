On Thursday, 11th March, the prisoner came into my mother's shop, between 3 aod 4 o'clock in the evening, and had some bread and butter, tea and eggs; he gave me a good shilling, and I gave him the change—he came again in about half an hour, and had some cofee and bread and butter, he gave me a florin; I gave him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and put the florin in my pocket, where I had no silver—the prisoner went out, and after he had gone I went to give change, and discovered that it was bad—he came in again between 3 and 4 o'clock in the morning, for a cup of coffee, and gave me a shilling, it was bad, and I gave it back to him (I had not then discovered that the florin was bad)—he said, "I will give you in charge, for you gave it to me"—he walked across the road wilh me, and said that he would rather be the looser of the shilling than be given in charge—I gave him in charge with the florin, and he gave the inspector the shilling; I marked them both, these are them.</p>

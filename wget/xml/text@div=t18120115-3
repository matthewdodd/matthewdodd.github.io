               <p>Q. In the month of October do you recollect the prisoner receiving any order from Wood and Cunningham in Bath - A. I recollect he had an order, I cannot say when it was.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of receiving that order did the prisoner give you any order respecting packing them up - A. I assisted in packing them up, he told me how I was to do them; I cannot recollect exactly what he said. Upon the bottles that he had filled with medicine I was to put on the stamps.</p>
               <p>Q. What directions did he give you for putting the stamp on - A. I was to cut out the center part with Jones, Bristol on them; I was to paste them on, and the sealing wax was to fill up the part where Jones and Bristol had been on it.</p>
               <p>COURT. What was the sealing wax to perform - A. To fill up the part where the words had been cut out, and the remaining part of the stamp was to be pasted on each side of the bottle.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Look at that stamp and tell me whether it was stamps of that description that you put on the bottles - A. Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect how many in number you were to put on - A. No, I cannot; there were many of different kind of medicines.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181201150009"></xptr>Q. Were they all bottle medicines - A. Some of them were lozenges, and Jones Bristol were cut out of the stamp, put on the boxes, and a label was put on the vacancy.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this the manner in which it was done - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any other medicines besides the bottle medicines, and the box medicines - A. No, I do not recollect any other.</p>
               <p>Q. After you put on the stamp by the prisoners directions what became of the medicines - A. They were packed up in a square deal box.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not know whether you saw any invoice that was made out by the prisoner - A. That is the invoice that was made out to accompany the box; I did not see it made out; it was put in the box, and the box was sent by the boy to go to some inn to go to Bath; I cannot say what inn. It was given to Joseph, a boy that lives in the house, for the purpose of being taken to the waggon. The prisoner was in the back parlour at the time, and he lifted it on the boy's shoulders.</p>
               <p>Q. Previous to this time when the box of medicines were packed up had he given you any information of the stamps whether they were genuine or not - A. I left Mr. Collicott nn the 17th of September, I returned about the 21st of October, he produced to me some stamps of this description.</p>
               <p>COURT. Was that the first time that you had seen stamps of that description - A. The first time I had seen some of that description.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. At the time he shewed you the stamps did he make any observation respecting them - A. He said he intended to use them instead of the real stamp.</p>
               <p>COURT. Was that the expression - A. It might not be the exact words, it is as near as I can say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he at that time or any subsequent time give you any instructions how you were to use them - A. He did not at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. In the month of November last do you recollect the officer coming there accompanied with Mr. France - A. Not in November; about the 6th of December I recollect Mr. France coming to master's house accompanied by some officer.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time the prisoner was absent was the house searched - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any stamps found - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you see produce them - A. Mr. Vickery.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the stamps found in your presence - A. No. I was up stairs at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to tell me whether the stamps that Vickrey produced were the stamps that were in your apron - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How came they in your apron - A. I put them there. I put the stamps in my apron after the officers came there.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know for what purpose the officers came there - A. Afterwards I did.</p>
               <p>Q. After the stamps were produced were these the stamps that were in Mr. Collicot's house - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Where did you take them from - A. From a back closet.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever hear any thing said by any other person respecting these stamps - A. Not by any person. I heard Mrs. Collicott request him not to use them; she requested him several times not to use them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. These things you call stamps, they never had the coronet of a crown affixed upon them - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Around the stamp there is a circle, and in the circle of a genuine stamp a crown is placed - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now these that are called stamps had not the crown, nor the sum payable as the duty - A. No.</p>
               <p>COURT. Before you put this label upon the boxes, and upon the bottles, where did you get them - A. I took them out of the back shop closet where Mr. Collicott kept them; he directed me where to get them, and after I saw them they were always kept there.</p>

Mr. Collicott informs Messrs. Wood and Co. he recently purchased some stamps, which have since turned out to be not correct, and not knowing whether any of them were used sent to Mr. W., should be obliged for him to remove every thing used by a stamp, and to be sent to London, they shall be returned free. If it happens that two or three respectable men call upon you shall be obliged by your telling them you are out of the article, but you expect a supply. Your obliged humble servant.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney, Q. to Mr. Wood. Did you receive this by post - A. Yes.

               <p>Q. Have you another of a higher price, value above two shillings and not exceeding four shillings - A. Yes, I have, that is it.</p>
               <p>Q. These stamps that I have asked you about, are they used by the commissioners in pursuance of the act, the 44th of his Majesty - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Marchant I believe is the engraver at the Stamp office - A. He is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Look at that, is that at the sides of it like it or different - A. It is not like it.</p>
               <p>Q. This is a counterfeit, value above two shillings and sixpence and not exceeding four shillings, look at that one of the smaller ones - A. The sides of that is different.</p>
               <p>COURT. Mention what the difference is - A. They are of no comparison to the stamp office labels.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181201150011"></xptr>Q. Do you mean that they have no resemblance - A. Yes, they differ in every respect; there is the same letters and the same writing, but they are in a different shape.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. That is a genuine stamp, is it not - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There is some from two shillings and sixpence four shillings - A. These are genuine stamps.</p>
               <p>Q. At the ends are not there all the same words and figures - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the ornament about these words, though not so well done, is it or is it not done so as to appear in imitation - A. In imitation of the genuine stamp, so that I might buy it myself.</p>
               <p>COURT. That is, you might take it for the genuine stamp - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Take that bottle in your hand, do you mean the imitation is such that any purchaser without an accurate observation might take it for the genuine stamp - A. I might buy them myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Then in your judgment, sir, these are not genuine stamps - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. to Vickrey. Open the box and take some of the medicine out - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Linley. Have you looked over all these in the box - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Just take some out, are they genuine or not - A. They are not the stamps of the stamp office.</p>
               <p>Q. Then they are not genuine stamps - A. No. Dalby's Carminative, that is not the stamp-office stamp.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Does not the stamp-office allow venders of medicines to-use stamps of their own form - A. Only of their own name.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You allow persons who take a certain quantity from you to have their name on the stamp - A. They apply to the board to have their own name on; it is made by our own engraver, and it is kept in my custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Are any of those which you have examined, the Dalby's carminative, is that a stamp ever authorised by the commissioners of the stamps - A. It is not.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it an imitation of the stamp of the stamp office - A. It is a very good imitation.</p>
               <p>COURT, Q. to Mr. Wood. What was the nature of your dealing with the prisoner Collicott in the sale of these medicines did you sell them on his account to receive a commission for such as you sold and to return them unsold to him, or were they charged to you and you debitted with them - A. I sold them on my account, and not on any commission; I paid the carriage down.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel, called seven witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

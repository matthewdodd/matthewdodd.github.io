He pulled out a handkerchief, in which there seemed to be a pretty deal of money, pulled out a 36 s. piece, and wanted change, and said he must have the change in half guineas. I had a bag of money, and in order to give him change I went up stairs, and he came up stairs after me. I poured the money into my lap, and the Prisoner put his hand into my lap, and took out a handful of guineas. I seized his hand, and made him drop them, and several fell upon the ground : said I, you villain, do you come to rob me at noon day? I desired my servant to stop him till I could tell the money, and I missed one guinea; and he offered me the guinea again. He was taken on Butler's wharf, and I carried him before Justice Dennett , and he offered the guinea then.</p>
               <p>Jury. How did you understand him?</p>
               <p>Stutwell. He spoke broken English: I am certain he did not want change, because he had 3 l. 10 s. in silver, thirteen guineas, and other money: when he came to me he spoke pretty good English, but when he came to Justice Dennett's he could not understand any English at all.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Aaron. My Lord, I have something else to say before I come to that. I happened accidentally to come this way. I keep a grocer's shop in Shoe-maker Row, and I believe deal in 900 or 1000 l. a year: I deal in oil, sand, and coals . I went to a wharf to get a load of sand, there was a little side box, and who should sit there but this gentlewoman [Mrs. Stutwell.] I asked her what the sand was a load; she said seven shillings; I said I gave no more than six shillings for white, and six shillings and six pence for red: she got up, and said, get down you Jew son of a bitch, and offered to knock me down, so I went to the next wharf. Ask her, if she did not serve me so; and if you will enquire into my character, there are enough here that know me. Now I come to the matter. I have known the Prisoner about four years, and have dealt with him for more or less; and I believe I have as good a shop as most people. He first bought necessaries for himself of me, and when he set up a little shop for himself, he bought goods of me.</p>

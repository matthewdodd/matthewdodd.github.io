                  </hi>. I am a partner in the firm of Dodd, Grueber and Rowsell, solicitors, of 5, Billiter-street—we are the lessees of the house, and underlet the ground-floor to the London General Pension Society—we occupy the first floor, part of the second, and an office at the back of the house. The prisoner Cooper was formerly in our service; I think he came in 1842, and was discharged about twelve months ago—I did not sleep in the house-Mr. Mence, to whom we let the upper part, does—the house is in the parish of St. Catherine Cree—on Thursday, 6th Dec, I left the office about half-past two o'clock—I went again about ten next morning, and was then told that the prisoners were in custody—I examined the premises, and found the door into the clerk's office had been broken open—in the second desk in that office, belonging to one of our confidential clerks, was kept the key of the iron safe and cash-box—the cash-box was kept in the safe-Cooper would know that—I saw marks on the desk which corresponded with <hi rend="italic">a jemmy</hi> that was shown me by the police—the other desk was not tried at all—I examined a closet under the stairs, and found a quantity of torn enve<lb></lb>lopes and papers there—the cupboard was large enough to hold two persons, if they wanted to conceal themselves—there was a little bit of string inside, apparently made from a piece of cocoa-nut matting, so that they could open or close the cupboard-door from the inside—I examined the staircase, and found that the persons got into the cupboard by putting their feet on a leaden water-pipe which runs along there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am secretary to the London General Pension Society, and occupy a portion of 5, Billiter-street, as tenant to Messrs. Dodds and Co. The Pennion Society occupies the ground-floor, and I occupy a part of the second, and the whole of the upper part On 6th Dec. I went to bed at twenty minutes to one o'clock in the morning—the house was then quite safe—the inner office door was closed—about half-past two in the morning, I was awoke by a loud noise which appeared to come from the first floor—I lighted a candle, and went out to the landing, and called to my servants; I thought the noise came from them—I called out very loud; I awoke them; they answered so as to convince me that they were not the cause of the noise—I then called out, "Take care; there are persons in the house who ought not to be," and I called out very loud indeed twice, "I am coming down; I am coming down"—I then ran to the bed-room window in front of the house, and shouted "Police!" as loud as I could—I then heard what appeared to me to be the street door open, and I saw two men run from it towards the top of the street; one appeared to run from the house, and the other to run under the eave of the house—I was only able to see them, not to identify them—I observed the one who ran on the other side had a lighter coat than the other—when I went down stairs I found the front room first floor door lock forcibly broken—that was the door I had seen safe at half-past twelve—part of the wood was splintered, and the bolt of the lock remained as if locked—when I went round the house, the cupboard was shut, and after the alarm it was open—when I went down, I let in the policeman.</p>

On Friday morning, 7th Dec., I was on duty in Leadenhall-street, and at a quarter to three heard a cry of" Police!" from 5, Billiter-street—I ran towards the house, and when I came within sight of it, I saw the two prisoners rush out from the door of No. 5—they stood for a few seconds until I crossed near them, and Cooper went to the opposite side—Rhodes stood still—I thought to secure him, and he made a side bounce out of the centre, and they both started off towards Leadenhall-street—there is a gas-light over the house-door—I have not the shadow of a doubt that they are the persons—I tried to catch both, and called "Stop thief!"—I met Sergeant Tregaskis at Leadenhall-street, and the prisoners were secured—I saw Rhodes taken; I am sure he is the person—I saw Cooper at the sta<lb></lb>tion afterwards—I searched Rhodes, and found on him a box of lucifers, a file, a bunch of small keys, a George the Second coin, a little bottle contain<lb></lb>ing oil—I knew Cooper directly he was brought in.</p>

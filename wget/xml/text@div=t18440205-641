                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable E</hi> 107.) In consequence of information, on the 6th of January, I went to Mr. Murray's house—I told the prisoner what I came about—he said he knew what it was about—I was dressed in plain clothes—he asked me to go down into the pantry—Mr. Murray was sent for, and cautioned the prisoner not to say any thing—I told him I should take him and his property to the station—he pointed out a large box, a carpet-bag, a leather hat-case, and a silk umbrella—in the trunk I found. thirteen knives, three pairs of socks, a jar of cold cream, a jar of snuff, a carv<lb></lb>ing-knife, fork, and steel, a pewter bottle, a fur boa, and four plate brushes, and at his lodging, a pair of candlesticks, snuffers and tray—I went from Mr. Mur<lb></lb>ray's to the station-house, taking the prisoner with me in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—on the way he said his wife had often said she would <hi rend="italic">do</hi> for him, but be never thought she would keep her word—I went to the lodgings in George-street, Foley-place, the same day—I saw the prisoner's wife there—she gave me thirteen dupli<lb></lb>cates, a piece of lace, and eight wine glasses—all the duplicates are in the name of a female.</p>

                  </hi>. I believe this carpet-bag to be Mrs. Keate's—I had seen it in use—it has been in the house for the last six years—I cannot exactly swear to it—it has every appearance of Mrs. Keate's bag, with the exception of her name, which was on a leather at the back—there is an appearance of a leather having been taken off—I have been eight years in the service—this carpet-bag was used to carry things when they travelled—I have often had it in my hand—it usually hung in a press in Mrs. Keate's room—I have every reason to think that these thirteen knives are Mr. Keate's—there is the same name on them as on one I have brought from home—I know nothing of the snuffers or the jar—I fancy I have seen the bottle, but am not certain—I think these are four brushes that the prisoner showed me when he was clean<lb></lb>ing the pantry drawer out, where they were kept—these socks are Mr. Keate's, and have "<hi rend="largeCaps">R. K</hi>." on them—these candlesticks are such as were used in the family two or three years ago—they were put up at the top of the pantry cupboard—I have no doubt they belong to Mr. Keate—I believe this snuf<lb></lb>fer-tray was used in the school-room—I have not seen the candlesticks for the last year and a half.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I suppose the policeman and you have talked this matter over? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I have not seen him since the last time I was at the station—I know that Mrs. Keate has not got her carpet-bag in the country, because I have had it in use for the young ladies—we went out of town on the 28th of October, and on the Monday before it was in use—I sent it to Mr. Keate's laundress with some dirty linen in it—I did not know of its coming back till the prisoner said to me at the station, on the Saturday, "Did not you send it to the laundress?"—I said "Yes"—none of his things were in the bag to go to the laundress, only the young ladies' things—they were brought home in a basket, and the carpet-bag with them—I did not see the bag brought home.</p>

            . The prisoner lodged with me for a week, about three months ago. On the 15th of January one of my tenants gave me information - I went to one of my houses in Mill-yard, Mill-alley, Whitechapel, where she lodged, and found the prisoner before the street door, with a bundle in her apron; I sent for an officer, and found in her bundle two pillows. a sheet, and a blanket - she had no business in the room, for I had the key: I asked what she had to do in the house - she said somebody told her to go and take the property out of the room.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. While I lodged with you did you find any thing wrong in me? A I received no rent, and told you to leave the room; that is the only fault I have to find.</p>
               <p>ALEXANDER ANDERSON. I am a patrol, and received the prisoner in charge with the property.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am quite innocent. I was robbed of 15s. in the house a few hours before, by a person who owed me 15s.; I went to ask her for it - I had some drink, fell asleep, and was robbed; they took me down stairs, left me at the door, and got me into this trouble.</p>

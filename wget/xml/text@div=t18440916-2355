                  </hi>. I am coachman to Mr. Munyard, of Woolwich—he keeps a stable-yard there. On the 1st of Sept. I was in the neighbourhood of the stable-yard, and saw a fight between one Glover and the prisoner's friend—I do not know his name—it was just before twelve o'clock at night—only two were fighting—the prisoner was not one of them—Glover was tipsy—I went up to him and said, "George, you had better go home; you will get taken to the station, fighting on Sunday-night"—I put my arm on his shoulder, and something catched me under the arm—I turned round to see what it was, and the prisoner catched me again in the side—I saw him stab me in the side—I did not see him stab me in the arm—he was standing behind the man that was fighting—one or two other persons were standing there as well, but they were in liquor—I turned round and saw the prisoner with a knife in his hand—I saw him shut it up and put it in his right-hand pocket—I did not see the knife in his hand before he stabbed me the second time—I gave him no pro<lb></lb>vocation—I bad only finished my work about five minutes, and came out of the yard—I had not known the prisoner before—he was backing his friend up—I heard him say, "Go it"—they were all saying "Go it"—when I found my arm was bleeding, I called the police—I did not know my thigh was bleeding.</p>

On the morn<lb></lb>ing of Sunday, the 6th of Sept., about one o'clock, I was called to the police<lb></lb>station, to attend the prosecutor—I found a wound on the middle of his right fore-arm, inside—I cannot say whether a person striking behind would in<lb></lb>flict a wound there—it was an incised punctured wound—I did not ascer<lb></lb>tain the depth—it was not severe, more than wounds in general—there was another wound in the upper part of the left thigh—that was a smaller wound—a little more than an inch in extent—I did not ascertain the depth—it must have been made with a sharp-pointed cutting instrument—it might have been inflicted with this knife—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the wound in the arm might have been</p>

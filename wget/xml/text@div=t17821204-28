               <p>I am a carpenter, and work for Mr. Allen, I took the prisoner with twelve pounds weight of lead on him at the corner of Long Acre, about five minutes after twelve in the day; he had got it under his smock frock, it was concealed; Mr. Allen and I took the place to build for a certain sum of money, and to make good every thing; we had lost a vast quantity of lead from the place before.</p>
               <p>Was this house inhabited at the time? - This was taken from the shop adjoining to the dwelling-house.</p>
               <p>Was it fixed? - It was nailed on.</p>
               <p>Then it was fixed to the out-house adjoining to the house? - We had lost several hundred weight of lead before; I caught the man with it myself, he had been at work there, he was a labourer to Mr. Norris, the bricklayer; I met him coming from the building, and I saw him have something under his smock frock, I judged it might be our property, and I stopped him; I took the lead from between his smock frock and his waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Did you charge him with taking it? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>What did he say? - He told me he found it, sometimes he said in one place, first in the shavings, and then at the bottom of the ladder; I matched it to the same place, and the nail-holes matched where it was taken off.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>As I was coming to dinner I found this lead at the foot of a ladder, under some shavings; this gentleman told me he would let me go if I would tell him about his lead; they were ripping off lead that very day.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness who gave him a very good character.</p>
               <p>Court to Wallis. Are you clear and certain it is the same lead? - I am certain it is.</p>

On the 10th of December, about half-past three o'clock in the afternoon, I was in the front kitchen, and heard some person trying a key or keys to the middle door in the passage; I sent Evans, the servant, to see who was there - I heard him call Stop thief! I ran up stairs, followed him along the road, and the prisoner was secured by a gentleman; he appeared dreadfully agitated, and begged I would not be hard with him - he seemed greatly penitent, and said he was in great distress; I had neither promised him any thing nor threatened him: two coats hung in my passage five minutes before - they belonged to my brother John - they were gone, and dropped near the outer door; he was brought back to my house, and in my presence three keys were found on him, two of which opened my door, also a strap and dog-collar, and a bit of scented liver, which is used to attract dogs.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I believe you have made inquiry about him? A. I have seen his parents and cousin; I believe they are highly respectable - he appeared very much distressed.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL EVANS. I am Mr. Baker's servant. I was in the kitchen - my master sent me up; I heard a noise in the passage, and when I got up I saw the prisoner run down the steps, and the two coats laying in the passage - he dropped them on hearing me come up stairs; I saw him about a yard from the door - he ran away: I gave an alarm, and pursued him; I had not seen him with the coats - he was never out of my sight; I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You never saw him with the coats? A. No - I saw them down in the middle of the passage, on the ground in the inner passage: they had been hanging up on pegs before.</p>
               <p>Q. A tall man rushing by in a hurry might brush them down? A. If he was inside the door he might. I had been in the passage half an hour before.</p>

            . I am Mr. Baker's servant. On the Thursday in question I was in the kitchen, and went up to let a lady out five minutes before this happened; the coats then hung up perfectly safe - when I opened the middle door I saw the prisoner trying the surgery door, and asked what he wanted; he asked if we wanted any leeches - I asked if master ever dealt with him; he said he had bought some of him before - I told him to wait, and called to master to know if he wanted any: I went to the door, and told him master wanted none - he turned away from the door, and I shut it; in five minutes I heard the door open, and there was a cry of Stop thief! I had latched the door - I saw the coats in the outer passage, after the alarm.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The boy says they were in the inside passage? A. It is his mistake - they laid towards the street door; he pulled the middle door after him when he heard us coming up stairs, and dropped the coats in the outer passage - I had let Mrs. Derbyshire out; I tried the door, and it was latched.</p>

            . Q.When the prisoner was brought back did not Mr. Baker ask if you had shut the door? A. He did; I did not say I did not know- I said I was most positive I shut it; I said that in the shop - master did not scold me, and say he was always telling me of it.</p>
               <p>MR. BAKER. I asked if she shut the door; she said, "I am most positive that I did;" I believe I said, "I am often talking to you about shutting the door, and hope you did shut it:" this was before the keys were found on the prisoner - I said something about its being a temptation, as she had at times left it open - it has been left open.</p>

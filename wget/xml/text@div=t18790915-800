The deceased child, Caroline Boon, was my daughter—she would have been 10 next birthday—on 22nd August, about 7.30, I was at home—in consequence of something I heard I went to the corner of Cliff Street, and found her there injured—I took her to the hospital—she lived a week—I saw her dead body on the Friday following.</p>

I am a grocer's assistant—on the night this happened I was about 50 yards from the place—I saw the deceased child lying on the pavement, and saw the hind wheels of a dray pass over her legs and body—the prisoner was driving the dray—he went on at the same pace—I had not seen the dray before—it came near the child—I ran into the road and put up my hands in front of the horses to</p>

I am a labourer—I was in Bridport Place, between seven and half-past on this evening—I saw the dray coming along before the accident happened—it was coming at about eight or nine miles an hour, getting into a canter—the prisoner was sitting on the box—there were two other persons in the van—there were tubs in it—I believe they were empty—I saw the child standing on the kerb—I saw the van strike her—she had not moved from the kerb before it struck her—she stood still—the near fore wheel caught her and drawed her down, and her legs went into the gutter and her body on the pavement; and the near hind wheel went over her—there was nothing in the way of the van to make it necessary for him to go so near the kerb—after it happened he drove on faster—I held my hand up and said, "Stop, look what you have done"—he made no attempt to stop—I ran after him and caught hold of the near side horse—I was about 20 yards before the child—he had got about 200 yards before I overtook him—he had gone on again—he was very drunk—a policeman came up and took him into custody.</p>

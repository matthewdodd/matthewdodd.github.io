On the 10th of October I went to bed about half-past ten o'clock, leaving the door on the spring-lock, and there was a spring-latch as well; Mr. Potter, who was out, had a key to let himself in; my wife alarmed me about twenty minutes after one o'clock; I saw a light go out of the shop: she called out that there were thieves; I called Stop thief! out at window, and awoke my cousin; he came down; the watchman came by, crying half-past one - we got a light from him, and found the inner door had been bored with a centre-bit, to admit a man's hand to undo the bottom bolt; I had not been in the bed-room, which is the middle room, more than ten minutes before I heard a rustle at the door, and a rapping at the shutters; then somebody whistled through the key-hole, and said, "Jem, Jem - Harry, Harry;" and before two o'clock a second rapping came, and the same whistling and hallooing was repeated, and a voice said, "What are you about so long?" my cousin and I dressed ourselves - I got behind the front door, with the latch in one hand, and the lock in the other - my cousin stood with a sword, and said if he approached in he would cut him down. When the watchman had called two, I heard a person come down the court, rap at the door, and call, "Jem, Jem - Harry, Harry - what are you about so long?" it was the same voice. I can swear the prisoner came up to the door, and repeated the same words; just as he had got Je out of his mouth, I came out, and turned the corner quick - the step of the next door projected, and he stumbled, and was secured; there was not another soul to be seen in the court. A coat and cap were taken away.</p>

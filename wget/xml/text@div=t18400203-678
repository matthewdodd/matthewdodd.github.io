                  </hi>. I am ten years, old I live servant with Mr. Samuel Dias, in Church-street, Bethnal-green. On the 17th of Janu<lb></lb>ary, about seven o'clock in the evening, I was sent out by my, master for two quarterns of flour, some lump-sugar, and some bakers' twists—I got them, and had them in a basket—when I got to the corner of Brick-lane, I saw the two prisoners, Curtain kicked my heel, and drew blood—the said to me, "Oh, my dear, did I hurt you, shall I carry your basket for you?"—I said, "No, thank you," but she dragged the basket off my arm—they then whispered together—they took me down two or three dark turnings—I then saw Toomes take one quartern of flour out, and one bakers' twist—I began to cry, Curtain clapped her hand over my mouth, and said, if I did not cry, she would take me to the girl—two ladies told the policeman, and he came running—Curtain had the basket en her hand when the policeman came up—I had caught hold of her gown—Toomes had a red bonnet on, such a one as the officer had in his possession afterwards.</p>

About seven o'clock, on the evening of the 17th of January, I was going down Brick-lane, on my way home—in consequence of something a female said to me, I went down a street, and saw the prisoner Certain by the side of this little girl—Curtain had a straw bonnet on, and a basket on her arm, which contained some bread, flour, and sugar—I asked the child who had robbed her, and Curtain said she had ran through the court—I ran, thinking to overtake her, but I saw no one—I came back, and saw Curtain give the basket to the child, and the child had hold of Curtain's gown—I took Curtain—she said the other girl's name was White, and she could take me to when I could find her—after the first examination of Curtain, Toomes who was there, asked me how Curtain got on—I looked at her very hard, and recognised her as being one who was often with Curtain—I said "I can take you to her"—I took her in, and the child recognised her directly—I found in the basket a quartern of flour, a pound of sugar, and a twist—I asked Toomes if she had a red bonnet—she said, "No"—I said, "No, a black one"—she</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my mother, Mary Ann Hooper, at 21, St. Mary's Road, Islington—on Saturday, 8th November, between 9.30 and 10 p.m., I was in the dining-room, and thought I heard a noise in the garden—I called up the dog, and it barked at the closet door inside the house—the back door leading into the garden was closed, bolted, and chained—the closet door opening into the hall was bolted on the outside—there is a window in the closet looking into the garden, and large enough for a man to get through—I opened the closet door and found the prisoner there, lying on the Root, and his boots were off—I said "What are you doing there?"—he said "Please to let me go; this is my first time"—I am not certain whether the I window was shut or open—his boots were lying at his side—I called somebody—I took hold of him and he asked me to let him go—I said "I shall not; "then he struggled and made for the back door, but it was bolted I—I caught hold of him by the shirt and it tore and he ran through the</p>

The prisoner was given into my custody and I charged him with burglary in the dwelling-house of the prosecutor—he made no reply and I took him to the station—I afterwards examined Hooper's premises—there is a wall in the back garden—the closet window looks into the garden, and is about seven or eight feet high from the ground—to get to it he would have to get up some lattice work—on searching him I found upon him these two knives and silent matches—one of the knives has a piece of cork stuck upon it—the other knife would go between the sashes of the window.</p>

                  </hi>. On Saturday, 8th November, about 8 p.m., I met you in Essex Road, Islington, and asked you to come and have is glass in the Three Brewers—I had an old shopmate with me whom I had not seen for about 18 months—I had not seen you for some time—we were drinking there from 8 till about 9.20 or 9.25—when we came outside I said "I shall have to take the bus now to get home by 10," and you asked me the nearest way to the Holliwell Road—I directed you, and got on the bus to High Street, Stoke Newington—it stops at the Clarence at the top of the street where I live.</p>

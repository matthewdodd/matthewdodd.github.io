                  </hi>. I live in Great St. Andrew-street—I sell riding whips—on the 11th of April Burns came into my shop, in the evening—he asked what I would make him a gross of fours for—I said I did not know; for I did not know what they were—a boy called out that there was somebody stealing the whips—(I bad fourteen whips at my door)—Burns turned round, and I saw he had a whip by his side—I said, "This is my whip;" and took it from him—he said, "Yes, it is; but I want to know what you will make me a gross of fours for"—I told my boy to fetch a policeman—my wife counted the whips, and said there were two missing—my son went soon after<lb></lb>wards to the Seven Dials, and came back with Carmichael, who had a whip, which I believe was one of mine—I told him it was one of mine—he said it was not; he had bought it—the constable took it from him, and both the prisoners were taken to the station—these are the two whips—they resemble mine; but I should be very sorry to swear to them positively.</p>

I am the prosecutor's son—I was in my father's shop—Burns came in, and asked for a gross of fours—I observed a whip under his arm—one of these whips looks very much like it—I know there were fourteen whips at the door before Burns came—I then saw them counted, and there were only twelve—I got an officer, and went to the Seven Dials—I saw Carmichael coming out of the Grapes with a whip in his pocket—one of these whips seems very much like it—I laid hold of him, and said the whip did not belong to him, and he must come with me—he said, "Very well;" and said he had picked the whip up—I took him with me—he afterwards said he bought the whip of a boy for 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

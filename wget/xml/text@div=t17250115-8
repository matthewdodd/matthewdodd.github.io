             deposed, that coming into Castle-Yard, he saw the Deceased lying dead on the Stone Steps, his Lantern with a lighted Candle in it, and his Staff standing by him, and the Prisoner walking to and fro before him. He asked the Prisoner if he knew who it was that lay there, or how he came by his Death; to both which Questions the Prisoner answer'd in the Negative. He (this Deponent) then went away, and coming that Way again soon after, he found the Deceased lying in the same Place; but neither his Lantern, Staff, nor the Prisoner, were then to be seen there. Other Witnesses confirmed that Particular of the Prisoner's owning that he saw the Deceased fall, and that he (the Prisoner) was a very abusive quarrelsome Fellow. Mr. Keatly the Surgeon depos'd, that on the Wednesday after the Death of the Deceased, (which was on Saturday Night) he view'd the Body, and making an Incision cross wise on the Left Side of the Head, he found a Contusion about the Breadth of a Shilling. He then took off the Pericranium, but found no Fracture in the Skull. There was also a deep Bruise in the Left Shoulder but he thought it very unlikely for a Contusion in that Place to prove mortal. As for the Bruise in the Head, he thought it might probably be the Cause of his Death; but he could not be positive. It appear'd, he said, to be done by a Blow with a Staff: But it being demanded if it was not possible that such a Bruise might be received by a Fall, he answered, Yes.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner in his Defence said, that the Deceased had been subject to the Apoplexy; that he had often seen him fall into such a Fitt, and that it was in such a Fitt that he dropt down at Dr. Lad's Door. That soon after, a Gentleman coming up the Yard, he went to light him in at Doors; at which time 2 or 3 Fellows coming out of Holborn, took up the Deceased's Lantern and Staff which stood by him, and ran away with'em, which he (the Prisoner) seeing, ran after'em thro' Magpye-Yard, and cry'd, Stop Thief. They finding that he pursu'd 'em, threw away the Staff and Lantern, and got off. He took 'em up and brought 'em back, which was the Cause of his being seen by several with 2 Staves and 2 Lanterns. Mr. - depos'd, that coming up Castle-Yard, he saw the Prisoner walking about very drunk, and the Deceased lying on Dr. Lad's Steps, whom he at first thought to be drunk too; but the Prisoner assured him that he was really dead. The Prisoner then lighted him to his Door, and 2 or 3 Men coming by the Deceased, took away the Lantern and Staff. The Prisoner pursu'd 'em, and as drunk as he was, brought the Lantern and Staff back again; at which time some other Watchmen (whose Depositions have already been mentioned) met him with the 2 Staves and 2 Lanterns. He added, that he believed that these Words, I'll smash you by G - were spoken by the Prisoner to one of the Men that took the Deceased's Staff and Lantern. Mr. Steel depos'd, that his Boy Jos. Wait had told his Wife, that he knew nothing of the Matter, but gave his Evidence before the Coroner by the Maid Anne Hall's Persuasions: That he knew the Boy to be much addicted to Lying; for which, and some other Misdemeanors, he had since turn'd him away. Anne Hall was then called up again, and said, that as she had no Reason to do it, so she never did, in the least, persuade the Boy to say any thing about it; but that the Boy said she persuaded him, merely to escape a severe Whipping, which his Mistress and young Master threatned him with. The Boy was then called up a second time; He said his Mistress was going to strip him stark naked; and that Robert steel (his young Master) took the Horse-Whip, and Struck him once with it, threatning not only to whip him then in a terrible Manner, but afterwards to send him to Bridewell, except he would confess that the Maid had persuaded him to swear, as he did before the Coroner; and that the Fear of such Treatment made him say any thing that they desired of him.

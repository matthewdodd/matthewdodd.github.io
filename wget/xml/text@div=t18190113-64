            . I live in the parish of Stoke Newington. On the 7th of January, I went out between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, and fastened the house up quite safe. I secured the window with a nail, and saw all the articles stated in the indictment safe in the house when I left. One pair of boots were almost new, and worth above 10 s. - there were two pair of shoes also, worth 10 s. I was the last person in the house. In consequence of information which I received, I returned home between twelve and one o'clock - I was the first person that got home. I found the door and window open; the window was broken, and the nail with which it was fastened laid under it. All the drawers were opened, and the property taken out.</p>

            . I am a journeyman baker. On the 7th of January, between twelve and one o'clock, I saw a donkey, with a pannier on his back, come out of the lane where the prosecutor's house is. I saw the prisoner come out of the house with a pair of top-boots in his hand; he ran down the lane as soon as he saw me. When I had got about a hundred yards he returned, and went after the donkey. There was another man with the donkey - they came down the street, towards the town, which leads to the common. I saw a bundle in the pannier, and gave the alarm, but could not follow.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Why did you not stop me - A. They ran from me. I am sure the prisoner is the man - I gave the alarm. In about ten minutes a man stopped me, and wanted to detain me.</p>

            . I am a journeyman baker, and live at Stoke Newington. About half-past twelve o'clock of the 7th of January, I saw the prisoner by the engine-house, with a companion and a donkey. The prisoner stopped the donkey, and covered the bundle over in the pannier with some hay. It was about a quarter of a mile from the prosecutor's house, and leading to the common.</p>

            . I am beadle of Stoke Newington. I heard the alarm, received information, and went in pursuit. I saw the prisoner running on Newington Common, and followed him across a field - he went through a brook into a garden, and was taken there. I asked him where the things were? he said they were in a ditch at the bottom of the lane. I sent a man, who was a stranger, there for them - he brought the pannier, with the property in it, to the Three Crowns, public-house, in the prisoner's presence - the prisoner said nothing about them.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gleed. Q. What are you? - A. I am an officer belonging to the Thames Police, Wapping.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 10th of April last, did you, in company with Perry and Cox, go any where? - A. I did; I went in company with Perry and Cox on board the Essex lighter; she was then driving up past the New Crane, at past ten o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. That is in the county of Middlesex? - A. It is, and it is below bridge, in the parish of Shadwell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you and the other two officers go on board? - A. Yes, and I observed Gray walking on the same side of the deck that I went on board.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see either of the other prisoners there? - A. I did, I saw Hall.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts was Hall? - A. Hall had one of the oars conducting the lighter up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any observations on the deck? - A. I did; I saw one of the half-hatches off; it was taken from its place, and the two half-bars off, which confines the hatchway; I then asked Gray what he was; he told me he was a Custom-house officer, and Hall told me he was a watchman.</p>

               <p>Q. After observing the hatchway was taken off, did you go down there, or what did you do? - A. I perceived Gray going forward.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time did you see any other person there? - A. Yes, a man by the name of Taylor.</p>
               <p>Q. You observed Gray going forward? - A. Yes, I followed him, and went down in the fore-scuttle; Gray was upon deck.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went down the fore-scuttle, did you observe any thing? - A. I searched there, but did not find any thing, it being dark under the deck; I came up again from the fore-scuttle, and coming aft, where I had been before, a man got into a boat that was hanging a-stern.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you near enough to know who that man was? - A. No, it was a short man; I asked Taylor who that man was; he said, that was the lighterman; I then called out, but he made his escape in his boat, and got on shore; after that, we took the three prisoners that were then on deck into custody; we took Gray, Hall, and a man of the name of Taylor; these were the three persons that were on deck when we first came on board; I searched Gray, and did not find any thing on him; I searched Hall, and found a lighter-key.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any search about the lighter afterwards? - A. Yes; we then took the charge of the lighter ourselves, and put her in safety; we got a light, and went below, and we observed two bags, which are now produced here, sewed up with twine; I then looked round, and saw a third bag that was not sewed up, with the mouth open, close alongside of a bag that had been cut, apparently by some instrument.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that bag, upon which it was lying close by, open enough for you to see what was contained in it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did it appear to you to be? - A. Spanish wool, and apparently a great deal was gone out of it; there was a great hole in it; we then made a strict search, for there was very little room, suspecting there was somebody concealed in the hold of the vessel under the hatch, and under the deck, and after some strict search we found M'Carthy, he was stowed away close by the side of the lighter, on one of the bags; we brought him into the hatchway; I asked him how he came there; he said he had got a cast up; I secured him, and gave him into the hands of my brother officers, and I suspected there was some person farther on board.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason had you to suspect that? - A. There was a great coat on board.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the great coat? - A. Not till afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know M'Carthy before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What is M'Carthy? - A. I hardly know what he is.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You are a Thames Police officer? - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. You had a great many officers at the time you went on board this lighter? - A. There were four or five of us.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had taken the prisoners into custody, did you fasten down the hatchways? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I shall expect from you fair answers - we know there was a great deal of pressing on the River at this time? - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course, and so there is at all times? - A. Not hot pressing then, not to break out from all protections.</p>
               <p>Q. Now the man that you found on board was a sailor; he was not particularly employed; you took him below; it is no uncommon thing for a man when he is on board a ship, and sees only two men in a boat, to conceal himself, as it was at night? - A. It was as light as it is now.</p>
               <p>Q. About ten o'clock as light as it is now? - A. It was very moon-light indeed; we could see the people, and how many on deck, as well as we could now.</p>

               <p>Q. Then the man on board could see the boat coming, and he hid himself; that happens to you every day; you did not wonder at finding a man concealed on board? - A. I will prove to you that he is not pressable.</p>
               <p>Mr. Curwood. Q. When you went first on board, where was Hall? - A. On board, at the stern.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray was that a suspicious situation for a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180504240063"></xptr>watchman? - A: What led us to have suspicions was to see the hatch open, and to find a key upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. At the situation where you described Hall to be standing, could he see the hatch open? - A. It was as light as it is now; if ever he turned his head down, he must have seen it.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether he, being on board, could see what was doing under deck? - A. Yes, he could.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go down, if you could see so well where you were, to look for one of the prisoners? - A. We knew M'Carthy was stowed down there, and there we found him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had M'Carthy any occupation on board that ship, or was he a perfect stranger? - A. A perfect stranger, and had no more business there than any other person had.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gleed. Q. Did you go with the last witness and Perry on. board the lighter? - A. Yes; Perry was taken very ill last week, and cannot attend; I went on board about ten o'clock in the evening, and saw Hall, Gray, and Taylor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the hatchway? - A. I observed the half-hatchway open, and the door taken off, and laid over the other hatchway; there are two bars that go across to fasten them down; these bars and two locks were taken off, and the bars laid on one side; Mr. Gillman went down the fore-hatchway, and I remained on deck with the three prisoners; before Gillman went down, he saw a man push by; he ran up, and said there was a man gone away with a boat; he called after the man, but he did not return; he called out to him to come back, or he would fire at him, and he did fire at him; we then called to Perry, and a lighter-man of the name of Legg, to come round the lighter, and after we had got a light I took these three men in charge, Hall, Gray, and Taylor.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present with Gillman when he went down the half-hatch? - A. I observed some bags on the deck that Mr. Gillman found.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you able, by looking down, to see the bags? - A. Yes; when the bags were put on deck, Gray was asked how those bags came to be marked; Gray said he had marked them himself, they were sweepings; an observation was made to him that we were very sorry to find him in such a situation; he said he took charge of the lighter, and there was nothing gone out; that it was as he had taken charge of it, and there was the lighter's bill, and he produced the lighter's bill to prove it; I went into the hold afterwards and found three bags cut with a knife, apparently right across in a zig-zag; about twelve or fourteen were there cut; I am speaking of the original bags.</p>
               <p>Q. What does that bag contain? - A. Spanish wool; the bags that are now in Court were removed by Gillman.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a lighterman, I was employed by Messrs. Salter and Cooper; I went on board the Essex at Blackwall Reach, on Wednesday morning, the 10th of April, about seven o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. You came here in custody? - A. Yes; Fieldhouse, Hall, and Gray, went first on board.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did M'Carthy come on board? - A. About a quarter of an hour afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know M'Carthy before? - A. About a twelvemonth.</p>

               <p>Q. What was he? - A. I know nothing more of him than he was a lumper.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us what happened, as well as you can recollect? - A. When he came on board, he proceeded to take off the half-hatch from the lighter, and then M'Carthy and Fieldhouse went down below; there was a handkerchief chucked out of the boat before M'Carthy came in, tied up as if it was a bundle.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what that handkerchief contained? - A. I believe it contained bags, but I am not certain; then I chucked the bundle down to Fieldhouse and M'Carthy in the hold of the Essex; I saw no farther, than I saw them put the wool in the bag; I did not see them cut the bag.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when the wool was found? - A. No; I did not see any thing farther till the Police officers came on board.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the Essex lying at that time? - A. She was coming up the River; at the time they came on board, she was at the New Crane, Shadwell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the three bags that the officers found? - A. I saw them after they were brought into the Police-office.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them after they were undone in the lighter? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any body bring them up from the hold? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you at the time the officers came on board? - A. At one of the oars along with Hall.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Gray? - A. Along with Hall; M'Carthy went before the officers came into the hold.</p>
               <p>Q. How got you the hatch open? - A. They were unlocked, I did not see them unlocked.</p>
               <p>Q. Who unlocked them you do not know? - A. My back was towards them at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had the key of the lighter? - A. Each of us lightermen, in the service of Salter and Cooper, had a key to unlock the hatch.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in the employ of Messrs. Salter and Cooper? - A. I was at that time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You came from prison? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. While you were there, you were out of mischief<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180504240064"></xptr>- you have said you were at the oar - when the hatch was open, you could see what was going forwards? - A. I turned round, and then I could see they were putting it in bags.</p>
               <p>Q. You thought they were packing it up for greater security? - A. I cannot say what they were packing it up for, I did not give it a thought at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you apprehend they were making it more secure? - A. I cannot say I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not give it a thought, therefore you did not think there was any harm going forward? - A. I understood they were to be put out at St. Catherine's.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not think it was any harm? - A. I did not think it was right; I was upon deck at the time it was transacted, I certainly knew what was going forward.</p>
               <p>Q. You would not have countenanced a wrong thing; you thought there was no harm in it? - A. I cannot say that.</p>
               <p>Q. You can say it if you try; this I can say, by your giving evidence you get your own neck out of the halter? - A. I hope so.</p>
               <p>Q. And had not you given evidence, I take it, my dear friend, you might have got your neck into the halter? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. You must not say, I do not know again; were not you afraid that you might come to the gallows before you intended; were not you afraid that your worthy life might be cut short; were not you afraid society would lose so good a man as you? - A. I was afraid at the time the Police officers took me, I did not know what might follow.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Where did you take M'Carthy on board? - A. At Blackwall.</p>
               <p>Q. It is no uncommon thing to give a person a lift? - A. I did not take him up, I was not in charge of the craft at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not a common thing to take people up? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. And put them down in the hold -</p>
               <p>Gillman. I produce one of the bags.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there any more than that? - A. Yes, two more; these are them that Gray said were sweepings; they are all about the same size, I have had them ever since.</p>
               <p>- SALTER sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp.</p>
               <p>Q. You are one of the proprietors of the Essex lighter? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You sent your servants to bring up the property from the Young Joan? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That is your lighter, and the Spanish wool is consigned to you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Gillman.) Did you compare that wool in the bags with that which was in the packages that were on board? - A. Yes, it is of the same quality.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Salter.) Q. Are there any sweepings in the lighter? - A. There are sometimes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you allow sweepings? - A. They are not allowed; there were sweepings of the ship, after the cargo was taken out, which were put in the lighter-bill, twenty pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they come to you in such bags as these? - A. No, larger and different bags from those, bags containing 200 pounds weight.</p>
               <p>Hall's defence. I am a poor man, I have got a wife and five small children.</p>
               <p>Gray's defence. May it please you, my Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury. On Tuesday, the 9th of April, I went up with the craft belonging to Mr. Fawcett, containing forty-two bags of wool; I left the ship, about ten minutes past five, in charge of the King's watchman; I then went home to my family, and went to-bed; on the 10th, at three o'clock, I walked down to Blackwall, and took charge of this said Essex lighter; I was not there upon the craft to see this cargo come in, and it was unknown to me what might be concealed in that craft then going up; this said

            , and me, rowed upon each side at Blackwall, the tide running very strong; we were afraid that a ship would run against the lighter; at that moment he took the key out of his pocket to get a pole to prevent the lighter from being run against; these lightermen have keys, and have a right to go to what part of the craft they like; my duty was to prevent any thing going out of the craft; that was all that I had to do.</p>

               <p>M'Carthy called one, Hall called one, and Gray called five witnesses, who gave them a good character.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to a manure manufacturer, and live at 26, James-street, York-street, Walworth—on 19th February, about I or half-past in the morning, when I was in bed, I heard a noise, as if somebody was breaking into my premises—I got out of bed, opened the window, and saw that the parlour shutters were wide open—I had fastened them before going to bed—I called "Police!" as loud as I could—my housekeeper hearing the noise, came into my room—I told her to look out of the window while I put my trousers on—I put my hand out of the window and touched the top of the shutters and put them to—they were gently opened again, and a head came out—my housekeeper said, "Short, here they are"—I looked out, and saw the prisoner—he looked up at me, and said, "Short, Short, don't be frightened; it is only Dudley"—I had known him previously—I said, Oh, you vagabond!" and he got out of the window, made use of some filthy expressions, and went away—a policeman came, and I went down and looked about—a lot of my papers were spread over the floor, a tea-caddy that I used to keep my cash in was moved on to the carpet, and a window was broken, and next day I missed from a drawer a silk pocket-handkerchief, which I had</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and act as housekeeper to the prosecutor—on the night of 19th February, I was disturbed by his getting out of bed and moving about his room—I went to his bedroom door, and asked what was the matter—he said, "Come in; somebody has broken into the house"—before I could get in, I heard him call "Police!" three times—he told me to watch the window while he put on his clothes—I did so, and I saw the parlour window gently open, and something come out—Short said, "I will have you, whoever you are"—the man carelessly put his hand on the window-cill, and said, "Don't be frightened, Short; it is only Harry Dudley;" and as he got out of the window, I distinctly saw his face—he said, "You vagabond, to break into the house"—he said, "Go to b—y," and ran from the window right round the corner—I have not the slightest doubt it was the prisoner—I had seen him once or twice before, coming backwards and forwards to Mr. Short's house to work—I had seen him about 4 o'clock that afternoon—I did not go into the parlour that night; but next morning I saw the papers all scattered about, and the box they had been in empty—the tea-caddy was broken open, and the middle pane of the window was broken close at the bottom bolt of the shutters—the shutters had been fastened the night before.</p>

About half-past 1, on the morning of 19th February, from information I received, I went to the prosecutor's house—I found that an entry had been made by forcing open the shutters—they open outwards—there is a bolt to each shutter, and one of them had apparently been pulled away from the hole—the window was open—a square of glass was broken in the centre close, to one of the bolts—I examined the room—I found a number of papers scattered about, and marks of a dirty footmark on the table under the window—a drawer in a chest of drawers had been broken open, apparently by a chisel or jemmy.</p>

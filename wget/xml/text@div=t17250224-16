He (this Evidence) knockt Lloyd down, and seized Jones by the Collar. Loyd got up again and ran away, but being followed with a Cry, stop Thief, he was soon taken by John Pitman an Excise Officer, who was then on Duty. The other two escaped. Lloyd confessed in the Watch-house, and before the Justice, that he was in Company with the other three when the Robbery was committed, and that they all agreed to take the Wig. He promised the Prosecutor, that if he would be favourable, he should have the Wig again; and accordingly the Wig was soon after sent by the Penny Post, with the following Note: Sir, enclosed is Richard's Wig that was lost, which you are desired to give him forthwith, from your Servant unknown, A. B. The latter Part of this Evidence was corroborated by Watmore and Pitman. The Prisoner Jones, in his Defence said, that he met Page accidentally in Bishopsgate-street; and having been formerly acquainted with him, (tho' not knowing that he followed ill Courses) they resolved to drink together, when it unluckily happen'd that neither of them had got any Money: But however, rather than two old Friends should part with dry Lips, Page very generously pawn'd his Wastecoat, in Hounsditch for three Shillings, and away they went to spend it at the London Spaw, where the Prosecutor lived. Here they met with Lloyd and Kemp, the Latter of whom, as they were going Home together, snatch'd off the Prosecutor Wig, and ran away. Lloyd said in his Defence, that he had formerly lived a Servant at the Maidenhead at Windmill-Hill; but being out of Place, he went with Kemp to the London-Spaw to enquire after a Service: That when they came from the Spaw he and Jones pass'd the Prosecutor, to whom he heard Page (who was a little behind) say, Honestly, will you give me a Pot? The Prosecutor answered, Not so much Honesty as you think for. At this Discourse he turned back, when Kemp said, Let us take his Wig off. He (this Prisoner) asked him why he would do so? But Kemp, without making any Reply, did what he proposed, and ran away. The Jury found them both <rs id="t17250224-16-verdict83" type="verdictDescription">

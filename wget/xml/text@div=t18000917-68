             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Routh. I am an officer belonging to Whitechapel,(produces a letter); I received it from Mackintosh; before I took him into custody, he said, that was from the person for whom he was employed to draw the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had it ever since? - A. No; the next morning it was delivered into the hands of the clerk at the office, Mr. Smith; it was delivered to me again when he was fully committed.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe that to be the same letter? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Cutler.) Look at that letter; is that the letter that was produced to you by the prisoner, when he produced the order for which you gave him a draft? - A. I am not certain that it is.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Osman.) Is Mr. Smith here? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say that it is the same letter that you received from Mackintosh? - A. I did not make any mark upon it, but I believe it to be the same from the direction.</p>
               <p>(The Court were of opinion, that the letter was not sufficiently identified).</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. The prisoner told you he was employed by Mr. Young? - A. Yes; and rather dared me to detain him.</p>
               <p>Q. He told you where Young lived? - A. Yes; but not till the next morning, when I fetched him from the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him the day before where Young lived? - A. Yes; and he would not tell me.</p>
               <p>Q. This letter, of itself, tells you where he lived? - A. Yes; Mr. Young came forward.</p>
               <p>Q. You took him into custody, and he has been in custody ever since? - A. Yes; the prisoner said he had delivered the money to Young.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner was discharged, was he not? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. Q. And taken up again? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember, in the month of August, last year, a letter coming, directed to your husband, from Petersfield? - A. Yes; I received it in August, 1799; I cannot say the day.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner at the bar in your house at the time? - A. Not that I recollect; I opened the letter by my husband's direction, and when I opened it, I found it was a blank paper, there was nothing contained in it at all.</p>
               <p>Q. When you opened it, and found it to be a blank, was Mackintosh present? - A. I cannot recollect; Mr. Young was very ill.</p>
               <p>Q. To whom did you deliver it? - A. It laid about for two or three months afterwards, for any thing I know.</p>

               <p>Q. You have a paper to produce, I believe? - A. No, Mr. Dawson has it. On the 30th of July, I found a small parcel lying on the table in my kitchen, tied up in a brown paper with a bit of string; it was a kind of a book, tied up in the same form that I found it; I put it by in the kitchen drawer till the Friday evening, and then I gave it to Dawson, and he read it.</p>

             M'CARTY sworn. - Examined by Mr. Raine. Q. Do you remember any parcel being left at your house? - A. Yes, the end of July, I think the 30th; the prisoner had some rum and water in the kitchen; he called for a pen and ink, and I saw no more of him; I went about my business, and when I came back into the kitchen I saw a kind of pocket-book or a memorandum-book lying upon the table; I supposed it to be his, and let it lie for some time, thinking he would send for it; I left it on the table, and did not meddle with it; there was a string round it; when Mr. M'Carty came home, he took it off the table, and put into a drawer.</p>
               <p>Q.(To M'Carty.) The parcel that you put into the drawer, was it the same parcel that you delivered to Dawson? - A. Yes, three days after.</p>
               <p>Mrs. M'Carty cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. This kitchen is a room appropriated for all guests that come? - A.House-keepers come in.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. How long was it from the time you left him writing at the table, till the time you came back again? - A. It might be a quarter of an hour; there had not been any body else in to my knowledge.</p>

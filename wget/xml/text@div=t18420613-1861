                  </hi>. I am a partner in the firm of Hawkins and Payne, grocers, in Bethnal-green. The prisoner was our shopman for about three weeks—having lost some money, I marked three half-crowns, and one shilling—I gave them to Livermore—on Tuesday, the 24th of May, I called the prisoner in, and charged him with robbing me—he said "No, I have not"—an officer was there—we asked him if he would have any ob<lb></lb>jection to our searching his boxes—he said no—we went into his room, and the officer asked him what money he had in his box—he said he did not know, he thought 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—in searching his box I found ten half-crowns, and some other silver and copper—I picked out one half-crown that I had marked the night before, and given to Mr. Livermore—the other two half-crowns I had marked and given to Mr. Livermore, were in the till—the prisoner and my partner had access to the till.</p>

Booth and Ingleby,—the last situation he filled was in town—I never said the housekeeper was in the habit of going to the prisoner's box—that is my deliberate. answer—I never said anything to that effect, or that she used to go and look into his box—I have not seen the marked shilling since I gave it into Mr. Livermore's hand—my partner went to the till to see the shilling—he is not here.</p>

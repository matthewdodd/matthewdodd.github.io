            . The Prisoner and I used to drink at Maddox's Ale-house. We went from thence the Beginning January, two Years ago, between 7 and 8 at Night, and walk'd about till 9, when we came to the Prosecutor's House. The Window-shutters were put to, but not fastned. I pull'd 'em open, hoisted up the Sash, went in, took 5 Tea-spoons, a pair of Tea-tongs, and two silk Birds-eye Indian Handkerchiefs, and handed them out to the Prisoner, who stood at the Window to watch. He has been concerned with me at other Times in robbing the Prosecutor. We went back to Maddox's. The Prisoner sold the Tea-spoons and Tongs for 8 s. and the Handkerchiefs for 4 s. and gave me 6 s. for my Share.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He said before my Lord Mayor that I enter'd the House.</p>
               <p>Oak. That was in another Robbery that I charg'd him with.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord Mayor's Clerk ask'd him if I had been in any other Robbery with him, and he said no, tho' now he charges me with several. - And then he mention'd nothing of the Handkerchiefs.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Pray let his Information be read?</p>
               <p>Then the Clerk of the Arraigns read Oaks's Information taken before the Right Hon. the Lord Mayor, Jan. 8, 1733-4. Oak therein gives an Account of van Numbers of Robberies committed by himself and several others, for 4 or 5 Years past, and among tho rest, those which he charged the Prisoner with.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Where did I live when this Robbery was committed?</p>
               <p>Oak. I don't know, - but he told me in Black-fryars.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It's strange we should be so well acquainted as to go a thieving together, and yet you not know where I liv'd at the same Time.</p>

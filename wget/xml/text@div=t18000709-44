               <p>- HENLEY sworn. - I am an apprentice to Mr. Easterby: I was on board the Hope when Barnes was discharged; I saw him cut some canvas off the top-gallant-sail; the top-gallant-sail was in the forecastle; there was about five yards of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it an old sail? - A. No, I saw him put it in his breast, and he went ashore with it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long ago was it? - A. Three or four months.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not your master correct you when he found the canvas cut out of the sail? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Your master thought you did it then? - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he correct you for? - A.Because I did not tell the captain.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Easterby.) Did you correct the boy upon the supposition that he had done it? - A. No, I corrected him for not telling the captain.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. We were very short of canvas on board in coming from Shields, and the mate cut a piece of an old fad to put round the cable to keep it from chasing; afterwards when I came to London I was discharged and received my wages; and if I had had the canvas in my bosom, then Mr. Easterby must have seen it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

                  </hi>. I am packer to Messrs. Le Maitre and Bergemenn, of Cannon Street, dealers in clocks and bronzes—on the 4th of January, about five o'clock, the prisoner came and purchased a timepiece up stairs—a person named Davis brought it down—he paid for it, asked to have it packed up for him to take away, and told me to put it down on the counter close by the door—there were no other articles on that counter—I pretended to go down stairs, as his movements raised my suspicions—he was pretending to put on his gloves and rolling his eyes about, but did not offer to go out—I watched him along the flooring, and saw him take a musical box which was wrapped in brown paper with a ticket to it, and give it to a woman outside—he then came in for the clock, but I took it away—it was nothing like this box in shape, it was a timepiece under a glass shade—I said, "What have you done with that parcel you have just taken out?"—he said, "I have taken no parcel"—I insisted on having it—he said, "Come outside with me, and you shall have it"—I went out with him, and walked to the bottom of Bread Street—he wanted to leave me, but I would not let him—I took him back, and my employers gave him in custody—I afterwards went to his house with a constable—we waited there till nearly ten o'clock, when the woman came home—she denied having the musical box at first, but we found it on the bed—the prisoner was under the influence of drink, but not so bad as he pretended to be—the woman was locked up, and discharged next morning by the Magistrate—this is the box (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is worth 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

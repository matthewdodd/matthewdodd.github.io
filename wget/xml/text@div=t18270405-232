On Saturday evening, the 10th of March, I was applied to, to attend at the hospital - some property being lost - I went, and saw the prisoner and her box was examined; Priscilla Morley, who is dead, was sister of one of the wards - they have three persons under them, and the prisoner had been one - it was stated that some property belonging to the deceased was found in the prisoner's box - there was a silk purse, twenty-five sovereigns, and a silk gown - I thought it right a further search should me made, and her box was brought into the deceased's room - I had the things taken out, and some shawls and other things were found - the prisoner said they were her property, that she had the silk gowns made at Loughborough, and the piece of cloth she had bought - she said the sovereigns were her own - she had been saving them from the time of her husband's death. I believe she had 6s. or 7s. a week and her food.</p>

I saw the prisoner's box opened, and some bundles laying on the top, about a fortnight after Morley's death - two silk gowns were in it, and the rest of the articles stated in the indictment - the prisoner had been in that ward about five weeks - she had borrowed 6d. of me, and had every appearance of being poor - she said she had saved this money - that the gowns were made for her at Loughborough; but when she was first examined, she said Morley gave her the gowns.</p>

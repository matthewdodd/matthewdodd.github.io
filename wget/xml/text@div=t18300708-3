               <p>JOHN LOW. I live in the parish of St. John, Hackney, and rent the house. On the 13th of May, about five o'clock in the evening, I went out, leaving nobody in the house; I locked the door myself - I left the articles stated as mine in the indictment safe; two of the coats were in a drawer with the handkerchief and shirts - I saw them there about a quarter to five o'clock; I left the key with my sister. who lived opposite - I returned on Saturday, the 15th, found my box broken open, and my things taken away; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183007080008"></xptr>had left 30s. in half-crowns and shillings, and lost that - the locks of all the drawers were picked; I had left them locked - I went to Worship-street on the following Wednesday, and saw some of my property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do you keep the whole house? A. Yes - I pay the rent; a cousin lodges with me - he pays rent to me, and not to the landlord; I am a <rs id="t18300708-3-viclabel19" type="occupation">dealer in cattle</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18300708-3-victim137 t18300708-3-viclabel19"></join>; I have no partner - I have found all my property: 1 value it all at about 4l., besides the money - I was absent two days.</p>
               <p>EDWARD LOW. I am the prosecutor's cousin, and lodged with him; I had some things there. I left London on the 1st of May, and returned to the house on the 16th; I missed a top coat, a silk handkerchief, two snuff boxes, a pair of gloves, and a bracelet - I saw my property on the following Wednesday at the office; I had seen it safe the morning I left - they were locked up; the top coat was in a drawer in the front bed-room, and the rest in a chest in the back bed-room - the drawers and chest had been opened when I returned.</p>
               <p>FRANCES LOW. I am the prosecutor's sister, and lodge opposite his house. I recollect his going away in May - he left the house shut up: I went over to his house about half-past eight o'clock that evening - the house was quite safe then; I had the key - I locked the door, and went home; I went over again with my two brothers, about nine or a quarter-past, as they were going to sleep there -I then observed the parlour door open, which I had locked a short time before; that is just by the street door - I opened the street door, and observed nothing wrong there; I had a candle with me - I heard somebody up stairs; it was two persons - I heard them open the front window, and saw the two prisoners jump out of that window - I was outside the house, against the paling; I called out for assistance - Mr. Adams came first: my brother William took hold of Cushway first, but let him go, and Adams took him; he ran after him, as he had got a few steps from the house - my brother Stephen followed Taylor; I did not know the prisoners before, but am certain Adams took one of the persons I saw jump out of the window - I saw Taylor in custody in about ten minutes; none of the outer doors or windows had been broken open - I am sure I left all secure at half-past eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Did you leave any body in the house when you first went? A. No; I went all over the house, and am certain I left nobody there - when I returned the outer doors were locked, as I had left them, and all appeared safe, till I heard the prisoners open the window; it was the top window the prisoners opened - there was no window opened before that; I am quite sure no window was left open - I do not know such a parish as St. Mary, in Hackney.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM LOW. I am the prosecutor's brother. On the 13th of May I went with her to

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It was dark? A.Just dusk - I had not time to go to the top of the house before I heard them; my sister did not go up stairs - she went back to the house after they were taken, to see what was lost; I saw the up stairs front window open after they jumped out.</p>
               <p>STEPHEN LOW. I went with my sister and brother, and saw both the prisoners jump out of window; my brother and I were round the paling, keeping them in the garden - Taylor said if we did not let them get over he would knock our brains out; they both got over - I caught hold of Taylor's coat: he turned round, and threw me down - I followed him round Russell-place, and did not lose sight of him before he was stopped by Turner.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM ADAMS. I was present, secured Cushway, and delivered him to Wood, the constable, at Hackney watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Are there two parishes in Hackney? A. No - I have lived there twenty-five years.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM GLYNN. I live opposite Low. On the night in question I saw Cushway in Adams' custody - I also collared him, and on the road to the watch-house I saw him make a motion with his right hand, and throw something behind him across to the paling - it rattled very lond, and he said, "Mind what you are after, flinging stones here;" I did not see what it was he threw away - the palings are about one hundred yards from the prosecutor's house.</p>

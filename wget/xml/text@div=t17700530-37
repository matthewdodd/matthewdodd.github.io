I went and lay upon her bed, and got a little sober: when I awaked she was gone from me; my waistcoat, hat, and shoe-buckles were gone; this was in the forenoon.

He told me they had taken his keys and every thing. The next day they delivered his keys and his pocket-book. The girls told me his coat was pawned for three shillings, his waistcoat for eighteen-pence, and that all his things were pawned. I was angry with him, and told him he wanted cooling, and I thought he had got one. He was a little in liquor, having been removing some goods in Westminster.</p>

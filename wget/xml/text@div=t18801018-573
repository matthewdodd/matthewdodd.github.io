                  </hi>. I am a licensed victualler, of 82, Euston Street—in the early morning of the 7th October I was in High Street, Camden Town walking home—a man spoke to me opposite the Britannia public-house,—I went in and treated him to a glass of ale—the prisoner and another young man followed—I attempted to go out—the prisoner stood against the door to prevent me—when I got out the prisoner and the other two men followed me about ten yards, took hold of me, and one of them put his hand in my pocket, and took my purse containing 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I took hold of his hand, but he swung round and got away—the prisoner was brought back by the constable two minutes afterwards—I had not seen him before I saw him at the Britannia.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman S</hi> 89). Early on 7th October, about 12.15 a.m., I went to the Britannia public-house, High Street, Camden Town—I saw the prisoner and two men with the last witness come out of the Britannia—Newport was under the influence of drink—I watched them 150 yards—I saw a scuffle and the men run from the prosecutor—I pur<lb></lb>sued them 300 or 400 yards, and overtook the prisoner—as soon as I came up he said "I know nothing about the man's purse"—I said "You will have to come back with me"—I took him to the prosecutor, who said "That is one of the men that has been stealing my purse"—I found a purse containing 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on the prisoner.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner.</hi> I did not say "This is one of the men"—you were the last of the three men running—you did not call out "Stop thief."</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman S</hi> 125). I saw the prisoner and two other men walking in front of the Black Cap public-house—the prisoner said "Look out, we don't want to be locked up"—at the moment I came up to the other constable, and they all ran away.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I was walking from the Britannia to the Black Cap, when I saw two men running from the prosecutor, who stumbled—I jumped forward to catch him under the arm.

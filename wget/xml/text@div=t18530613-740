                  </hi>. I am a cooper, and carry on business at Stratford, in Essex. I employed three pairs of sawyers, including the prisoners—the prisoners were employed in cutting staves at so much per dozen, for the use of the coopers—there are two cuts down each stave—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a cut stave—I paid the prisoners at the rate of 14<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for a dozen cuts—the uncut staves are kept out in the yard, and are generally deposited in piles forming a solid square—when the sawyers are in want of work they are told to go and take in so many cuts, but on this occasion we were unloading the barge, and they shared a number of staves out as we were unloading it—we generally tell them to go and set up so many dozen, and they do it, and we come to see the quantity, and mark them—we generally mark them with a hammer—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the thing I mark with—I marked the prisoners' staves with it—the mark is called zigzag or Vandyke—on 11th May I delivered to the prisoners a quantity of uncut staves—there were 51 dozen and a half cuts in them—I believe I delivered about 309 staves—they were marked—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the account I received on the Saturday following—I believe Woodward presented it, and took the money for it—the account is for 54 dozen, but that included some other work—I paid them the whole amount of that bill—the cost of the 51 dozen and a half cuts was 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and a 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—(<hi rend="italic">the account was here read, and amounted to</hi> 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.)—there was no work done by the sawyers in my yard during Whitsun week—on Sunday, 22nd May, I went round the yard in company with Mr. Geddies—we examined the piles of timber—I observed that marks had been obliterated—the stock I examined was of uncut timber—the marks have been erased by hammering them—this (<hi rend="italic">pointing to it</hi>) is the place where I mark them—I found I was deficient of somewhere about 12 dozen and 8 cuts, but I thought I would be under the mark, and said 10 dozen—on the Tuesday following I saw Mangham in the yard, and accused him of trying to obliterate the marks on the staves, and putting them on the pile again—he said, "I did not do it; my mate Woodward got here early in the morning and obliterated the marks, while <hi rend="italic">me</hi> and Rayner were talking in the chimney corner"—that is where the coopers fire their casks—it is a rule in our trade to pay for work before it is accomplished—these sawyers had drawn 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. beforehand—I cannot tell to a stave how much I paid beforehand in this instance.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman in the prosecutor's employ. On 22nd May, in company with the prosecutor, I examined the pile of uncut staves in his yard—I observed there was an unusual appearance of mud on the ends of two or three of the top tiers—they are piled crossways—I got on the pile» brushed the mud off, and there I found marks had been attempted to be obliterated.: some effectually, and some partially—I did not at the time count the number of staves that had not the mark upon them—ultimately, on the Monday morning, I threw them off the pile, and found them to be two dozen</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185306130077"></xptr>
               <p>—that would be four dozen cuts—I was with Mr. Groat when Mangham was in the yard on the Tuesday or Wednesday following, and heard him tax him with putting the staves on the top of the pile—he said, "Mangham, how is it you have not cut the staves, and have endeavoured, by bruising, to injure the marks, and place them on the pile without cutting?"—that was on Tuesday or Wednesday—he said, "I know nothing about it, my mate Woodward took the marks out with a hammer."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sawyer, in the prosecutor's employ. I work with Harvey—I received a lot of staves from the prosecutor at the same time as the prisoner, on 11th May—they were what we term Dantzic hogsheads—my staves were marked "No. 2"—they had not the zigzag mark—I and Harvey did not cut all the staves we had to cut—we left them on the pile—I never saw either Woodward or Mangham up to the time I was there.</p>

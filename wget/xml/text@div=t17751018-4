I believe the stockings to be mine; the prisoner first said, he bought them of a smuggler, afterwards he confessed he took them from me. He first confessed it to a Mr. Howard, while I was gone for the constable. I don't know that any promise was made to him; I gave Mr.

            . I am the prosecutor's wife; I was present at the searching of the prisoner's box. I found in it twelve neck-cloths, and eight pair of stockings: he took them out himself; they were delivered to the constable. I believe them to be the property of Messrs. Needs and Strutt; my husband sells for them; they are like what we had in the house. The prisoner was our porter; the prisoner said he bought them of a smuggler. Mr. Harris and I went down, and left Mr. Howard with him: my husband went for a constable. When we went up stairs, Mr. Howard said, he had confessed that he took them out of the warehouse. I asked him it he had? he said, Yes, I took them all out of the warehouse. When the box was first searched, Mr. Harris said, he would be as easy as he could; he would endeavour to send him for an East-India soldier.</p>
               <p>Robert Row. I am a constable; I was sent for to take charge of the prisoner. When I went into the garret, I saw the stockings and neckcloths lying on the floor; the prisoner said, he took them all out of the warehouse. I was sent for on the 13th to take charge of Lloyd for receiving part of the goods: as soon as I came to him, he said, if I would go to his house, he would give me all the things that belonged to Roger. We went with him to his house at Lambert Hill; he there desired his wife to go and get the things that belonged to Roger. We went with her to College Hill, and there she produced a box with ten pair of stockings, and six neckcloths in it: he said, he bought one pair of stockings of him.</p>
               <p>The stockings were produced that Lloyd said he bought.</p>

            . I am eleven years of age. On the 25th of May I lost a 6d.; I stood crying at my mother's door - the prisoner came up, and asked what was the matter; I said I had lost 6d., which my mother gave me to get some potatoes - he said, "Never mind - bring me 4lbs. of rags, and I will give you 2d. for them;" he came into my father's passage, and I gave him my own coat and two waistcoats - he said that was not enough; I then brought my father's two pairs of breeches and two pairs of trousers; he gave me 2d. for them - I then brought him down one pair of drawers, two frocks and a gown, and he gave me 2d. more; I then brought him two petticoats and another frock, and he gave me 1 1/2d. for them - he asked me if I should have any more to-morrow; I said No - I am sure the prisoner is the man.</p>
               <p>HUGH COX. The things were worth 1l. to me, at least - my wife went after the prisoner, and found him; I went to him, and asked if he was not ashamed to induce my boy to sell him all this property for 5 1/2d. - he said, "I am not ashamed - I sold one pair of the trousers to a man for 1s. 3d., and the rest were torn up in rags."</p>

            . I live in Silver-street. I keep the house. I let out two rooms; the prisoner was a stranger to me. I was informed that a man had ran into the lodger's room, and I saw the prisoner come out - he left his hat and coat in the room - they were found there. I never saw him in the room before - the street door stands open. The last witness took him out of the passage.</p>

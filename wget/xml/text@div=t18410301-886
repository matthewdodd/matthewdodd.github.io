                  </hi>. I am the owner of a number of omnibuses from Highgate, along Kentish-town, to the City. I have some stables at the Angel at Highgate—Humberston was ostler there—I have also a stable in Cress-street, and one at Kentish-town, at Mr. Morgan's, who keeps the Anglers—in consequence of the appearance of my horses, I set a police<lb></lb>man to watch my premises—I have white oats and black oats, beans, and clover-chaff for them at Highgate—it is sent from Gress-street to Highgate and Kentish-town—it was the business of Humberston to send a horse to meet the omnibus to take it up the hill, night and morning—when he sends the horses to Kentish-town he has no right to take them into any body's stable there—I have my own stable there, but he does not come down within half a mile of that—there is no occa<lb></lb>sion to go to any stable at all there.</p>

I received information, and watched the prosecutor's premises at the Angel at Highgate—about half-past six o'clock, on the 22nd of February, a pony and cart, driven by Pearce, came to the inn—it drove into the yard, and in about ten minutes I saw Watts and another female—Pearce, Watts, and the other female went into the prosecutor's stable—shortly after, I saw Humberston come up Highgate-hill—I did not know Pearce—i have seen Watts—I know nothing against her—she lives with her father, in a cottage at Kentish-town, at the back of Holmes'<lb></lb>tcrrace, about half a mile from the foot of the hill, and about 200 yards from Mr. Bardell's stable—Humberston went into the same stable—after some time, I saw Watts come out—she looked about the en<lb></lb>trance of the yard, in company with the other female—they then returned to the stable—I saw some beer taken to the stable—they were all in the stable, and remained there about twenty minutes—I went and changed my dress, and on my return I saw them all in the stable drinking—after that, Pearce came out of the yard in the cart, accompanied by Watts and the other female—I did not see any thing put into the cart—if there was, it must have been while I was away—they went down Swain's-lane with the cart, and I made the best of my way down Highgate-hill to the other end of Swain's-lane—they shortly after came out of Swain's-lane—I stopped the cart, and asked Pearce what he had got in the cart—he said, "Nothing"—I went to the back of the cart, and took up a horse-cloth that covered some sacks, and said, "What are these?"—he said, "Some empty sacks"—I put my hand on a sack which contained some corn, and said, "You don't call this an empty sack?"—he said, he knew nothing about it—I then asked Watts what it was—she said, she knew nothing about it—then she said, she bought it—I said, I thought it was corn—she said, "I bought it," and seemed very confused—immediately after, she denied all knowledge of it again—the other female said, she knew nothing about it—the other female was taken to the police-court, and discharged—I said, they must consider themselves my prisoners—I found in the sack a bushel and a half of mixed grain, black oats, white oats, clover, chaff, and beans, and a nose-bag con<lb></lb>taining about half a bushel of the same mixture as the sack—I showed them to Mr. Bardell—since then I have been to Mr. Bardell's stable at Highgate, at which I saw the prisoners, and have brought a sample from the bin there, and from the stable in Gress-street—another officer took Humberston.</p>

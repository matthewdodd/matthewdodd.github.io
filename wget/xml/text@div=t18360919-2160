                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry Archer, a currier, in Rathbone-place. I knew the prisoner's wife, Elizabeth Brodrick, between five and six months—she lodged in the same house with me, and was thirty years old—on Wednesday afternoon, the 14th of September, I was called to see her by Mrs. Reid—when I went into a fit—she was dressed and alone—the sticks in the fire were burning, as if it was just lighted—we lifted her up, and in a few minutes she recovered, and was placed in a chair—I observed that she had a black eye—I remained with her about ten minutes—on the Monday evening before last I heard somebody fall on the floor of Mr. Brodrick's room three times, and heard Mrs. Brodrick cry twice—I did not go up stairs, and do not know who was with her—on the Wednesday morning I saw the prisoner, about five minutes after eight o'clock—that was the morning of the fit—I told him his wife was poorly, and had been in a fit—he said he supposed it was from her excessive drinking—he went up stairs—I was called again that morning by Mrs. Reid, to assist the deceased—I found her lying across the bed in the same sort of fit—her husband was out then—he is a carpenter, and works out—a message was sent for him, and came soon after—she recovered from the fit, and her</p>

               <p>husband came and fetched the doctor, who bled her—went into a fit again—the doctor left her, and some medicine came—the prisoner remained there about ten minutes with her, and then went to work—she was about half an hour in another fit after that, and then had another fit—we sent again for the prisoner, and he again fetched the doctor, and another medical man—she got worse, and died at three o'clock that day, that was the Wed<lb></lb>nesday after the Monday.</p>

I got a certificate from the War Office that he was alive on the 24th of June, 1810. I then took another wife, thinking my first marriage was not legal. As to the last wife, her father and mother did not make any enquiries about me; they thought I was a man of property. Finding I was not they are seeking their resentment on me. And the last wife said that she has known a gentleman in the army, a lieutenant, and that if I did not support her as well as the lieutenant she would go and live with him, Since our separation she has been living with the said lieutenant.</p>

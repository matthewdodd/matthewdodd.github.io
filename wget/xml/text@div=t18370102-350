                  </hi>. I am a porter at the Bull and month Inn. On the 16th of December I went to Oxford-street to meet the Wincester Sovereign coach, and came with it into the City—I sat at the him part of the coach till I got to Chancery-lane, and then got in front-them was a carpet bag on the roof—it was about a quarter past nine o'clock in the evening—when I got to the end of the Old Bailey in Newgate-street, I stopped to set a gentleman down; and when I got down I fount the pri<lb></lb>soner lying along on the top part of the hind boot of the coach—I said, "Yes have no business there, get down"—he did not seem much inclined to get down, but called me a fool—I took hold of him to put him off, but a per<lb></lb>son with a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> drove up and said, "Do not part with that man, do not put him down, pin him, he has robbed your coach of a carpet bag"—I turned my eye and missed the bag, and secured him—he gave me three or four very tremendous blows about the head: and three or four others came and assisted him, and jumped on me—I do not know who they were there were seven or eight upon me at once—I was on the ground holding the prisoner—several attempts were made to get him from me—I believe they all intended that—I was compelled to let him go for a moment, being over powered, but another person secured him—I am certain he is the man I saw on the coach—the bag belonged to a gentleman named Marshall—I have not seen it since.</p>

I am a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> driver, and live in Galway-street, St. Luke's. was going up Fleet-street, near St. Bride's Church, when the Worcester coach was coming along, on the 16th of December—I saw the prisoner behind the boot of the coach, between the two seats—he took a carpet-bag off the roof, got down on the near side, and I lost Bight of him—I followed the coach, and saw it near the top of the Old Bailey—I am sure it was the pri<lb></lb>soner who took the bag—I pasted close by him in my <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I could see him distinctly, there was a good gas light, so that I could distinguish his features and dress—I followed the coach—it stopped previous to my getting to it—overtook it at the corner of Newgate-street, and found the porter tell<lb></lb>ing the prisoner to get down, saying he had no business there—he was on the coach then—he must have got on again—I said, "Collar him, or <hi rend="italic">pin</hi> him, for he has robbed the coach of a carpet-bag"—directly they came down, he knocked the porter down three or four times—he fought most desperately, and knocked the porter about most shockingly—a man jumped on the porter when he was down—I forgot to mention, that directly the porter and the prisoner got off the coach, the prisoner threw something down which appeared to be keys—I felt on the ground after the scuffle was over and found a key which the constable has—it is capable of opening the boot of a coach.</p>

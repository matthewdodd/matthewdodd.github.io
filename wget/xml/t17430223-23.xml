            . On the 16th of February, I dined at Mrs Paterson's in Church Court, with one Brown, who came in the Ship with me from Portsmouth, and this Woman; I belong to a Man of War: This Brown, and another Person, wanted me to go to Lancaster's, it was about Eight o'Clock at Night; Mr Johnson, and I went there, and the Prisoner got a Bottle of Rum and Brandy, and made a Bowl of Punch, and after the Bowl was drank out, I said I must go, and threw down half a Crown for it; but she would not let us go, I told her the Punch was very strong, and that if she made it so strong, she must drink it herself; she made another Bowl, I told my Friend, I had got a Charge of Money about me, that I must not be too free in drinking: I pulled out my Money, which was Nineteen Guineas, and counted it upon the Table; she desired to count it, and did count it, and said, Here is Nineteen Guineas sort enough : She took the Money up, and went from the Table with it in her Hand; I asked her for my Money, she said I need not be afraid of my Money, for she would not take it away, if there was a Thousand Pound, or something like it: I asked here where she was going, she said, to make a little Maid's Water, and I heard something make a rattling like Water, when that was done, I gave her a little Time; then I looked for her, and she was gone; said I, She has flung us; there was a little Girl about Eight or Nine Years old, that belonged to her, said she was gone to buy a Fowl and Bacon. I went to one Mr Kirkpatrick's, and informed him of what had happened, and he went along with me; she came back in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174302230019"></xptr> about an Hour and an Half, and was asking for her Child; says the Woman of the House, Don't you know the Woman that robbed you? That's the Woman: Mr Kirkpatrick, desired me to go to Justice Frazer's and get a Warrant, and he kept her in the House till I got a Warrant, and they carried her to the Round-house, and took her up Stairs to search her; the Constable said, You must not burt the Woman, you must be gentle with her; she wanted to go to the Little-house, but the Constable would not let her, she was searched, and the Money took from under her Arm-pits; then I told her, she might go to the Little-house, and she said, You be d - d, Sir, I do not want to go to the Little-house, any more than you; she said, the Money was mine, and desired I might have it, there were Eighteen Guineas, and she said, she would give me a Bond, or Note, for the rest.</p>

            . I was with the Prosecutor at Lancaster's and had a Bowl of Punch; after that was out we had another; Brown pulled his Money out and counted it, and she counted it, and took it off the Table; says he, What have you to do with my Money? says she, Sir, you need not be afraid of your Money, if it was ten thousand Pounds: She said, she wanted to make Water; he gave her Liberty to go, and it was not 2 Minutes before she made off: She was taken up, and I saw the Money taken from her, there were 18 Guineas, it was concealed somewhere about her Breast. She told the Justice if he would take his Money again and make it up, she would give him a Note for what she had made away with; and sometimes she said, he lent it her. - He was not disguised with Liquor.

I offered her one Guinea, and at last I came up to two, rather than have any farther Trouble; she said she had borrowed it for two Days, and she would give it him again when she was able and willing. She said she did not mind a Warrant; we took her to the Watch-house, and kept her till the Beadle came, and then she was searched, and eighteen Guineas were found about her Breast. When she came before the Justice, she was in a Swoon; and she fell down upon her Knees, and said she would give Bond for any Thing he would, to make Satisfaction.</p>

            . I was Constable of the Night, the Prisoner was brought to St Martin's Round-House, and was very abusive; I desired her to go up to be searched, but she would not; the Beadle said if she would not go up, she must go down, so he went down Stairs with her; she desired to go to the Vault first; I had not Presence of Mind just then, but I presently recollected myself; Thinks I, she has certainly got this Money, and wants to convey it away. She said she had something to do that was not proper to be done before Men. I told her I would not suffer her to do it till she was searched. She was very unwilling to have her Gown pulled off. I found she was guilty by her Looks. The Beadle untied two of her Petticoats, and I told her I would search her to her Smock, if she would not confess; she seemed to pull something out of her Pocket, and went to conceal it, as<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174302230020"></xptr> I suppose, under her Arm Pits, but the Beadle caught it in her Hand before she could convey it there - She did say she borrowed it of the Prosecutor, and that she would trounce me for robbing of her.</p>

Said I, Did you know the Woman before ? Yes, said he, I know her very well at Portsmouth, she used to come on board the Ship with Goods. Said I, How came she to get your Money? said he, I left it with her because I thought to be out all Night upon the Rake; says he, I knew my Money was very safe, because I knew she was to receive some Money in a little Time, and that she could not run away. He told me, that a Friend or two of his and her's came to Town to be Goods, and that their Acquaintance had laid out 40 or 50 Pounds at Pawnbrokers Shops, and other Places that the Prisoner had taken them to.</p>

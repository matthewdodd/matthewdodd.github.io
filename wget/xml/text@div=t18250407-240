            . I saw the prisoner Barton between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, of the 12th of March - the other prisoner was not then with him; I had been introduced to Barton, and had been talking about bad money, and asked if he could get me any - he said his partner was out, and he did not know. He sat some time, and then went out and returned, and said, he could not find his partner, but he was always to be found at the Ship, public-house, in Duck-lane - I went to the Ship, and met him there between nine and ten o'clock - Barton and I went into the Ship, Barton said the money would soon be forthcoming; we drank at the bar and I changed a sovereign - before I got the change, Barton called me out to the door, and said in Ward's presence, that they had been only able to make up ten bobs-worth - he said there is twenty-five bobs and five spuds - I took the coin and gave Ward the money; I then left them, they both ran after me and said, I had given them a tinker, meaning a bad sixpence - I changed it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner BARTON. He came to me and asked me to sell some plate for him; I told him I could not - he said he had a great quantity of silver candlesticks, and spoons and forks, which he had brought from the country; and if I could sell them for him, he would take some bad money and some good. He then told me he would meet me on the Saturday following, which was the 11th of March - he shewed me a duplicate of four candlesticks, pawned for 3 l., and said he had got the rest of the plate concealed - and said, if I could sell it, he would rather sell it than pledge it; he then said,</p>
               <p>"Have you got any bad money for me yet;" he pulled out two or three shillings, and said,</p>
               <p>"Like these" - I said I should be at the Ship, in the evening; he said he would call again - from that time I never saw him till I was taken into custody - he had another man with him, who cannot be found. Witness. This is not true. I had another man with me, named Smith - he introduced me to Barton, and Barton introduced me to Ward.</p>
               <p>Prisoner WARD. Q. What time was it when you saw me and gave me the money? A. It was near eleven o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say at Hatton-garden that you never saw me before, and only knew me by my waistcoat? A. No, I did not, but I described you as wearing those clothes.</p>

In consequence of some conversation with Limbrick, and some information which I received from Elledge and some officers - I took the prisoners at the Ship, in Duck-lane, about eleven o'clock at night on the 19th - they were together, and in company with about thirty other men - I found on Ward this fur waistcoat, by which I distinguished him.</p>

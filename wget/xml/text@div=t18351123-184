                  </hi>. I live in Pickett-street, Strand, and am a boot-maker. I had a pony and chaise to sell—I advertised it, and on the 14th of October a person came to me for the purpose of trying it—he said it was for his sister Mrs. Wilks, who lived four doors from Acre-lane, Brixton—I showed him the poney and chaise, and he agreed to purchase them—I went with them the same day to the house at Brixton—I saw Wilkes—she said she was very ill; that she was just going to take some beef-tea, and she could not try it then; but if I would call to-morrow morning she would settle with me—In consequence of that I left the poney and chaise—I called again the following morning—I saw Mrs. Wilkes again—she had just been out—she told me she thought her brother had agreed to give too much money for the chaise—I said that was the agreement be<lb></lb>tween me and her brother, and she must be bound by it—she then said would I take a bill for it—I said no, a bill was of no use to me, I wanted my money—she said she was without immediate cash, as she had had no remittances from some property she had in Hampshie; and she had paid the landlord (I think it was 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.) for fixtures—I was induced to leave the poney and chaise with her; but it has been sent back to me.</p>

I know Kinner—In June last I let him that house—I have seen him a the house, several times—he represented himself to me, as a retired brewer from Lincolnshire—he said he should like to speculate in mines, and he had money which he should like to investin various ways; and was very rich—they was in July or August—It afterwards occurred to me, that I Knew of something that might be of advantage—I called on him; and he said he had lent a great deal of money to some party, on land—that</p>

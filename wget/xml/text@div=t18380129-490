On Saturday night, the 20th of January, I was driving my cart in Shoe-lane, and the prisoner came to me—I did not know him—I am sure he is the man—he said, "Mr. Reickers, Mr. Hook the baker calls you"—I then left my cart, to see what Mr. Hook wanted with me—I found he did not want me—I came back to the cart, and missed the property stated, it was all in one basket—I looked about, ran down a court in Shoe-lane, and saw the pri<lb></lb>soner with the property—he dropped it—I am sure he is the man—I have no doubt at all.</p>

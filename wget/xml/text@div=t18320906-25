The prisoner was in our service between four and five years, and on the 9th of July, as he was going home to dinner, in consequence of suspicion, we brought him back, and charged him with stealing leather, which dropped from his person at the time; we sent for an officer, and asked where he lived - he said in Newcourt, Bell-alley; we went there and found his wife and family kept the room on the ground-floor, and in that room, I found a pair of boots, and two pair of shoes; the daughter took a pair of shoes from the drawer, and was concealing them under her clothes - we took them from her, and one pair off her feet, and another pair we found in the room; they had all been worn - I knew them by our marks remaining on the sole leather and the lining; one is a stamp, and the other a mark in writing - he never bought shoes of us, nor charged himself in our books with any.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You keep a shoe-warehouse? A. We do; the clickers write on the inner leathers - we sell shoes with the mark on them, but do not sell by retail; I might accommodate a friend - such a thing may happen eight or nine times a year, and my brother might do so - we never allow our work-people to sell to their friends; the prisoner's daughter is sixteen or eighteen years old - he came to me with a good character; the leather had been decreasing some time - he had 22s. a week; ours is entirely shipping and country trade - his wife or daughter bound for us, and would come into our passage for goods, but not where the goods are deposited - I knew where he lived before.</p>

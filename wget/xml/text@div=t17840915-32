               <p>I am a weaver, I live in Nicholls-street, Bethnal-green; I received a quantity of unwrought silk from Mr. Berry, but I cannot tell when, for we never keep any memorandum; I received about eighty yards if it had all been made out in one, which it was to do; I made about fifty-five yards, I left it, as usual, on Sunday the 25th of July in the loom, at three o'clock.</p>
               <p>Court. Was it silk or sattin? - It was sattin, it is all silk.</p>
               <p>What became of it after you left it? - I was out the 25th of July, and being informed about five in the afternoon that my work was lost, I saw it afterwards with Mr. Wood, I know it is the same; the silk is here. (The silk produced.) There are some threads out, and the other part answers to it; at the beginning of it there are a few shoots of pale pink.</p>
               <p>Court. Is that mark so clearly your own, as to enable you to know it if you had seen it any where else? - I believe I could.</p>
               <p>Is the pale pink the usual mark? - They mark with different colours, but I cannot swear to it from that; I swear to it positively from its sitting the remnant that is left.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd, Prisoner's Council. Where does the prisoner live? - In the same house, and worked for me in the loom.</p>
               <p>Court. Whose house was it? - Mine; the loom was in my part of the house.</p>
               <p>Did you sleep there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>In that half of the house you rented? - Yes; there was one room and a shop to work in; the shop was two pair of stairs higher than the room.</p>
               <p>Who occupied the intermediate rooms? - A person that is at the door, one Mrs. Larden.</p>

               <p>Do you recollect at any time in July any circumstance of the prisoner having any quantity of silk? - The 25th of July, in the afternoon, between four and five, I went up stairs into my own shop, there are two shops on one floor, the other shop belongs to Mr. Stillwell, and I saw the prisoner with this silk on the bed in our shop, and a bit of it hanging out, and the rug thrown over the work, and he upon the rug; he was asleep.</p>
               <p>What did you do in consequence of that? - He told me it was some sattin; and Mr. Stillwell went up into the shop, and missed the work.</p>

               <p>Court. What coloured sattin was it? - Black.</p>

               <p>On Sunday the 25th of July, about half after four in the afternoon, I heard some silk was lost; I live in the same house that the robbery was committed in; I saw the prisoner go out with something very bulky about three, this was about two or three minutes before the alarm was given, and in about five or six minutes after he was taken; I saw him a prisoner within ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Court. You did not see what he had about him? - No.</p>
               <p>Was it wrapped round him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Where was you? - I was in my own room in the kitchen; my door was open, and the street door was open; I saw him pass.</p>

               <p>Was he sober? - I do not know that he was right sober, and I cannot say he was drunk, he had been drinking part of a pint of beer or so, but he was in his senses, I rode with him to Clerkenwell.</p>

            . I live with Mr. Smith, at Woodcock-hill - I have been with him about half a year. I have seen Wells at his house, but I did not know his name; I saw him there on the 16th of December - he came about half-past six o'clock in the morning with a black mare; he was there three or four days - he was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183201050019"></xptr>there on the Wednesday before Christmas-day, but I cannot say whether he remained there from the 16th till that Wednesday, but I think he did; I remember he was there that Wednesday night, and Freeman was there- I went up to bed between nine and ten o'clock, and a short time afterwards, apparently, they came up stairs after me; Freeman and Wells had been at Smith's house before then; I have seen them came together - I did not see Wells on the Thursday morning, but I saw Freeman about nine o'clock, as near as I can recollect.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PAYNE. Q. Your master is a large farmer? A. He has about fifty acres of land. I believe - he has taken in harses and cattle to keep; I cannot tell whether he has taken a licence to sell beer, since the new beer act - Freeman was there at the time Wells came with the black mare; they did not came together that morning - Freeman was in the habit of coming there; I do not know where he lives - I have been about that neighbourhood all my life; I do not know that Freeman is a man of that neighbourhood - I lived at Mr. Child's before I lived with Mr. Smith, which is about a mile from Mr. Smith's: there may be four or five or six fields between them - Mr. Smith's and Mr. Child's fields are together; the field the heifers were in is three fields from Mr. Smith's house - other persons drink at my master's.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. Q. Did Wells ever come with cattle? A. Not with droves of cattle - I did not know him by the name of Wells; we used to call him Shepherd.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You had seen before that Wells and Freeman together, drinking as friends who knew each other? A. Yes - Wells brought the mare, and Freeman was there at the time; I think he had been there a day or two - when there they lived at this beer-shop; I believe they slept together - they both slept in the house, and up stairs, I believe; I slept up stairs - I cannot tell how many bed-rooms there are in the house; I have slept half a year in a room at the top of the house - I cannot say how many rooms these are at the top of the house; I have never been all over it.</p>

            . I am game-keeper at the Rev. Mr. Thellerson's, at Elstree. On the Thursday before Christmas-day I was out early, and heard a gun fired - I came into the road, and met Freeman, coming along before some beasts; I wished him good morning, and he crossed out of the road - I was by the side of a wood; I believe the road is in Bushy parish - there were two heifers behind Freeman, and Wells was behind them; Freeman had a stick down by his side - he put it down as if to conceal it, and he let it drop; the man who was out with me picked it up - I wished Wells a good morning, and asked if he had heard a gun fired; he said, "I think I did;" I think Ereeman was fifteen or twenty yards before the beasts - it was a very light morning; the clock had just gone one.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. All you saw of Freeman was that he was walking fifteen or twenty yards before the beasts? A.

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at Rose-cottage, Shooter's-hill, in the parish of Plumstead, in Kent. On the 29th of December I saw both the prisoners—Palmerine asked me to buy some pictures—I told him I wanted none—I had a gown hanging in the garden, at the back of the house—they could not get there without passing the door—I saw Palmerine go out of the gate a minute afterwards, with something in his right hand—I was not near enough to see what it was—I went out after them, and saw Thomas standing at the gate—I asked what he was doing there, and what the other man was running for—he said he did not know the other man, he had only passed him at the gate—I went back and missed the gown directly—it has not been found.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pensioner's wife. I was at Marshall's house that day, and saw Palmerine come and ask her to buy pictures, and in two minutes I saw him go past the door towards the gate, with the gown in his right hand—it was frozen, and he could not bend it—I went after him, but turned back and called to Marshall, who went out and spoke to Thomas—I went to the watch-house, and picked up a picture that I heard fall—Thomas took the picture—when the officer got Palmerine, he said he was sorry he did not take two instead of one.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Thomas</hi>. When I saw that woman come with the picture, I said it was one of mine—I staid there two or three minutes, and then they did not know what they had lost—when I saw Palmerine again, I asked him if he had taken a gown or any thing, and he said, No.</p>

I went after the prisoners to Woolwich—I found them in Thomas's lodging—they laid they knew nothing about this, but acknowledged being there—I took them to the station, and the two witnesses recognised both parties, and in conversation Palmerine said he was sorry he had not taken two instead of one.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. HEATON. Q. Where had you been? A. To Lambeth, taking a pair of shoes home to a young man - it was half-past twelve o'clock at night; I gave over work at ten, and had to go to Lambeth - I was not in any public-house; I had nothing to drink before I left work - I had part of a pint of beer with the young man I took the shoes to at Lambeth.</p>

               <p>Q.Was either of the men smoking when they came up to you? A. Yes - I did not ask him for any tobacco; the prisoner was searched immediately he was apprehended - he is the man who put his hand into my pocket, and took the money out: they all ran away directly - I did not hear any communication between the prisoner and the other two, nor see any thing pass between them; when he was searched I believe some halfpence were found on him - I did not search him myself; I was not tipsy.</p>
               <p>Q. I am told you went away for ten minutes, and afterwards came up to the prisoner and charged him with robbing you? A. No, you are told wrong; I had never seen him before - I never said I would hang him if possible.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you lose any tobacco? A. Yes, a quarter of an ounce - I had just bought it, and had it in a paper.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. My attention was called by a cry of Police - I went into Wentworth-street, and saw the prosecutor and the prisoner in contention; he had secured the prisoner when I came up, and accused him of picking his pocket - they appeared as if they had been running; I took the prisoner into custody - the prosecutor was quite sober; he did not appear to have been drinking at all - I searched the prisoner, and found a sixpence, and 3 1/2d. in copper on him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You say positively he was not drunk? A. Yes - he was struggling with the prisoner; he was not holding the prisoner - he could have got away if he chose; there was a contention between them in words - he was denying the charge; I found no half-crown, tobacco, or comb on him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The prosecutor was right intoxicated - when first he took me to the station. he charged me with robbing him of 2s.; I was locked up, and on Monday morning he charged me before the Magistrate with robbing him of half a crown, a comb, and tobacco, and when he went up stairs the short-hand writer said to him, "You seem a very vicious sort of a man:" he said,"Yes, and I will hang the prisoner if I can."</p>
               <p>One witness gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

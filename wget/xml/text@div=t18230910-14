I called Price. my partner, who shewed them to him. I asked Price, in his presence, who they were for. Price had the permit in his hand, and said they were for Francis and Child. I said I was surprised at a truck coming from them, for I never knew them send<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182309100012"></xptr>a truck before. The prisoner said that the carts were gone another way: he put the chests on the truck, and went away with them; he was alone. In about three hours the prosecutors sent for them, and we found they had been improperly delivered. I saw him in custody about a fortnight after, and am certain of him - his face was familiar to me.</p>

            . I am surveyor of the Thames Police. On the 23d of August, I received information, and went with a search-warrant, to a stable in Seven-star-alley, St. George's in the East, and found a man there named Whitall; and in one corner of the stable I found a chest of green tea, not opened, and another standing on it, which had been opened, and only about 14 lbs. in it. I left it in charge of an officer, and went in search of the prisoner, whom I found at a house in Elbow-lane, and asked his name; he said Craig. I asked where he got the two chests of tea which were at Whitall's stable; he said he would tell me when he went to the stable; I took him there, and he said he bought it of Mr. Norman, of Sun-street, Bishopsgate, and hawked it about in a cart. I said the stable was an improper place to put tea; he said he was going to enter it on the Monday, and that he had lost the permit. I took him to the office. The chest weighed about 84 lbs.</p>

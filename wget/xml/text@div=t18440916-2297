                  </hi>. I am a cabinet inlayer, and live at No. 38, Short's-gardens, Drury-lane. On the 24th of Aug., I arose about half-past five o'clock—I looked out of my window and saw the prisoner on a building under my window—I saw him roll up the lead and throw it into the yard—as soon as I could get my shoes and stockings on I went down and heard something very heavy roll down the kitchen stairs—I came down and told Mr. M'Carthy—t e prisoner came into the passage and said he would make it all right—he said he had been running after the man—I know the prisoner, and I know he is the person who was rolling up the lead.</p>

I live at No. 40, Short's-gardens, and am a green<lb></lb>grocer—I am tenant under a lease of the premises—Bidgood came to my window on the 24th of Aug.—he knocked me up and told me what had hap<lb></lb>pened—I went up to the landing of his house, and out of the window by the side of the landing, I saw that a quantity of lead had been ripped from a flat on the house which I inhabit—I was going down into the entry and saw the prisoner in the street—I asked him what made him up so early—he told me he had been running after the person that took the lead off the house—Bid<lb></lb>good came up and said, "You are the very man that pulled the lead off"—I called the policeman, and he asked him where the lead was—he said it was down in the cellar, and they found it there—the lead that was found was fitted to the place it was taken from, and it fitted it—it had been fixed to the place.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable F</hi> 139.) I was on duty near Short's-gardens about half-past five o'clock in the morning of the 24th of Aug.—I went to the prosecutor's house—the prisoner came in the passage just as I got in, and the prosecutor came in a little time after—Bidgood fetched me, and told me in the prisoner's presence that he had been taking the lead off M'Carthy's house—the prisoner said he had been after the man that had done it—the prosecutor gave the prisoner in charge for taking the lead—I told the prisoner I had seen him at twenty minutes before five, and if he had gone home this would not have happened—he said he should not have done it if he had not been drinking—I saw the lead at the bottom of the kitchen stairs, at No. 38, and found a jacket, a waistcoat, and cap on the ledge near where the lead had been—I brought them to the prisoner and he claimed them and put them on—I saw some marks of shoes on the water-butt—the lead corresponded exactly, with the place where it bad been taken from—the house is in the parish of St. Giles-in-the-Fields.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Kent, of No. 39, More-street, Chelsea. On Sunday evening, 14th Dec., I was going to my mother's lodgings, in Princes-street, Chelsea—I knocked at the door, and a man came up the steps—I. made way for him to pass, supposing him to be a lodger; he put his hand on my side, and attempted to take my chain—I had on this watch and chain (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I screamed; he ran away, and I found my chain broken—I saw him about a quarter of an hour afterwards, but can<lb></lb>not say whether the prisoner is the man; he had something light on—I pointed out to Norman the direction he took.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 8, Princes-street. I was sitting down stairs, and heard Mrs. Kent cry out—I went in the direction she pointed out, and saw the prisoner running forty or fifty yards in front of me—I pursued him, and only lost sight of him as he turned the corner—I came up to him in about three minutes, opposite Mr. Hinchliff's factory—he was quite out of breath, and asked what I wanted of him—I said that I would let him see in a few minutes—he said that he was not going to be <hi rend="italic">hum<lb></lb>bugged</hi> in that manner, he would go home; I said that he should not—a constable came up, and I told him that he had attempted to steal a watch—the prisoner said nothing.</p>

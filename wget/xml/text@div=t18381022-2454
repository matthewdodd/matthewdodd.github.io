                  </hi>. I am in the service of Elizabeth Boyce—she has the business of the yard at the White Hart, Romford—she horses coaches, and has stables at Ilford. The prisoner was horsekeeper at Ilford—he had four horses in his charge every night—it is usual with me to send him at the beginning of the week, enough corn for the weekly consumption of four horses—on Tuesday, the 18th of September, I sent four sacks of mixed corn, chaff, oats, and beans, for the weekly supply of four horses—that should have lasted them till the following Monday—on the Tuesday he always gets more—this was sent in sacks—"Elizabeth Boyce, Romford," was on the sacks—in consequence of suspicion, I ordered another servant, named Wyatt, to watch him—on the following day, the 19th, I received a message from Wyatt to come up to Ilford—about seven o'clock in the evening I sent for the prisoner to open the door for me—the stable was locked, and he had the key in his pocket—I went into the stable, and asked him, was that all the corn he had—he said it was—there was one sack of corn standing in the sack, and a bin about half full—the bin holds about one sack, when full—I asked him what he had done with the rest—he ought to have had three sacks, besides what was in the bin—he said the horses had eaten one sack, and he had sent the sack back to Romford by the coach—he said he had borrowed a sack, or nearly a sack, of the Cog<lb></lb>gleshall housekeeper—that was a man of the name of Holder—he said he had repaid him, and Holder had got the sack in his stable—I sent for Holder, and presented him before the prisoner—I then asked Holder if he had got any of Mrs. Boyce's sacks in his stable—he said, "No"—I asked him if the prisoner had borrowed a sack of corn of him—he said, "No," that I was welcome to see what sacks he had got, and I did—but there was nothing like ours.</p>

                  </hi>. I am horsekeeper to Mr. Freeman, at Ilford. On the 19th of September Mr. Harding sent for me, and in the presence of the prisoner put some questions to me—I did not receive any sack of corn from the prisoner on Tuesday, the 18th of September, nor on the 19th—I had no sack of Mrs. Boyce's in my stable—I received three sieves of the prisoner, which was not quite one bushel.</p>

            . I live in Cock-alley, Norton Falgate, and know Monksfield by her coming down that alley to see Mullins. On the 8th of August I was in Camberwell-road, and saw the two prisoners together, a good way from Mr. Dutton's shop - they asked me where I was going; I said I was going home - Monksfield said she was going to the shop to get some shoes to bind; Mullins and I waited - Monksfield went to the shop and brought out six pairs of shoes, and gave them to us to mind, on the step of a door; she said she had to go back in half an hour - that was some distance from the shop; I did not see the shop - she then brought out some more, and put them altogether in her lap; and as we were coming over London-bridge, Monksfield said, "Mullins, how you tremble, if there is any thing amiss I will take it all on myself" - we went home and counted the shoes on the bed; there were seventeen pairs, which she said she had from Mr. Dutton's to bind - they were bound, and I said they did not want binding; she said they did - we then went out with them, and she pawned some; she said she wanted 1l. 12s. to get a young man out of prison - she pawned one pair at Mr. Cotton's, and one pair further on, and then we stopped at the corner of Old-street, and she said she pawned some, but I do not know how many - I pawned one pair at the corner of Long-alley, and gave the money to Mullins; I went to pawn another pair in Aldersgate-street, and there I was stopped.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. How long have you known Monksfield? A. About two years - we were at a considerable distance from the shop; I did not see it - we watched her as far as we could see; as we were coming past the shop, she said that was Mr. Dutton's - I thought it must be wrong when I saw the shoes were bound; it was the first time I had been with her - Monksfield was at the door when I was taken; I did not partake of the produce - Monksfield bought a penny pie, and gave us some of it; I met them casually on the road.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where was Monksfield? A. Behind a bedstead - she went into hysterics; I put her into a chair, and told her not to be frightened, nobody would hurt her - Birch was below stairs when I took her; she said she was pregnant.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 7, High-street, Shadwell—on 28th May, between 1 and 2 in the morning, I was disturbed by a noise at my door—I opened the door and saw Martin Gertz, a man who belonged to the house, lying on the ground, and two men and a woman beating him—I said to them, "Let him get up, what are you trying to do with him?"—I put my left arm out and tried to drag him in-doors, and I got a cut on my left arm from a man named Robinson—I tried to catch him, and I caught him by his coat-collar, and at the same time I got a stab from William Francis on my right side—I called "Police!" and gave him in custody—I did not see the instrument he did it with—I am sure he is the man—no one else was there but Robin<lb></lb>son and the girl.</p>

               <p>men and a woman—they gave me a shove with the arm—I looked round and told them to leave people alone in the street, and go off to their own busi<lb></lb>ness—a big man, not this one, came up and hit me—that was the man, (<hi rend="italic">Robinson</hi>)—I began to run, and the two men and the woman ran after me—Francis was the other man—I knocked at my door and sung out for the man that was upstairs—the two men knocked me down at my door, and then Will came and opened the door, and caught hold of me by the coat to draw me in—he sung out, "I have got a cut"—I then caught hold of the big man, and Will afterwards sung out, "I have got another cut "—he had collared the big man when be got the first cut—when he got the second cut the prisoner was by his side—I saw him—I saw no instrument—they dropped a brass knocker before the police-station door.</p>

I am a surgeon, residing in the Commercial-road—I examined the prosecutor at the station—I found a small punctured wound immediately below the last rib on the right side—a sharp<lb></lb>pointed instrument like a penknife would produce such a wound—it was not deep—it penetrated his clothes—there was not much blood—it was fortunately immediately over the liver—if it had gone much further in it might have been fatal.</p>

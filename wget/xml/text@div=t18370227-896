                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at Norwood. The deceased, Emery Haywood, had lodged with me twelve months, and was twenty-five yean old—on Monday, the 23rd of January, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner brought him home—they walked together, and did not seem in ill humour with each other—I went into the room, and Haywood's wife came down with a candle—the prisoner said, "Is this your husband?"—she said, "Yes"—the prisoner said, "Then I desire you to keep him at home"—he then went away, and just as he got out at the door, he called Haywood out, and said to him, "Now you mind, don't let me see you on my premises any more"—Haywood and his wife then went up stairs—I went up also—I picked two shots out of his back, but they were very small—he complained of having been wounded—I did not learn that any body had been present when he received the injury—there were some shots round his loins, but I could not get at them—he did not go to work that week—he went to work on the Monday, Tuesday, and Wednes<lb></lb>day and on Wednesday night he was confined to his bed—he died on saturday morning, the 4th of February.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police-sergeant. I heard of the death of the deceased, and went to Norwood on Sunday, the 4th—I found the prisoner of the south Monday, the 6th, at the Horns, at Norwood—he is clerk of the grounds the South Metropolitan Cemetery—I asked him if his name was Morrison</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183702270196"></xptr>
               <p>—he said, "Yes"—I said, "I am in search of a person of that name who I hear has shot a person on the ground works; a man of the name of Hay wood"—he said, "Unfortunately, I am the man"—I took him into custody—he said he was quite willing to go with me any where, and I took him to Mr. Hillyard, the Magistrate, at Streatham, who took down in writing what he said—he was allowed to go at large, on his own recognizance, to appear at the inquest—I heard him make a statement in the presence of the Magistrate, but that was taken down.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181302170035"></xptr>4th of February, between six and seven o'clock, I was passing along Long Acre. I saw four boys together; the three prisoners and another. I saw two of them stand at the hat shop, and two at the butter shop, next door to it. I saw two of the least prisoners standing against the window, Foster and Price. I saw Price go up and down, as if he was cutting the putty, which induced me to stop, though they are so little boys. I drew back and watched, and then I saw Foster and Price run to the other two. In about a minute the other two went, and the former two remained behind. The other two went to the window where they came from, and I saw them pull something from the window, as if they were pulling glass from the window; then they started off again, and came back to the window. They then had their hands to the window, as if they were jobbing something at the window. The other two returned, Foster and Price. Then I saw them draw something out of the window. When I saw that, I ran up to them: they ran away as fast as they could. I saw that they had got a hat in their hand.</p>

               <p>Q. Which of them had a hat - A. The little one, Foster. I believe they made a stop in Queen-street. Foster gave Hannan something wrapped up in a handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see what it was - A. No. That was in Queen-street. Foster gave something to Hannan, and instantly, as it was tied up, they ran into Holborn.</p>
               <p>Q. What was tied up - A. The hat. When they got to the corner of Little Turnstile they began to cut the putty away from a cracked window.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was that - A. Price. They started from there, and went lower down Holborn, and they sent Foster to pawn the hat. I stopped Foster. I asked him, what he had got there. He said, he had got a hat that his mother sent him to pawn for a shilling. I then took him into Berrison's shop, and detained him there until I fetched the other two. There were three more outside. I fetched the other two prisoners in. One got off. I took Hannan and Price. Upon Hannan I found one pair of new stockings. I asked him how he came by them. He said, they were his mother's. On searching Price I found a bit of a knife that they cut the putty away to get the hat out. I kept them in custody. I told him, I knew where he brought the hat from out of Long Acre.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. It is my hat. I know it by the trimming. It is my own trimming. The hat was drawed through the window, and the stand left naked. The square of glass was broke before, and a paper put over it.</p>
               <p>Hannan and Foster said nothing in their defence.</p>
               <p>Price's Defence. The knife was not to cut the putty. I never cut the putty with it.</p>

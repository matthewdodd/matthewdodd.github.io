                  </hi>. I am fourteen years old, and am errand-boy to the prosecutor, who lives in Houndsditch. I had the brooms and brushes to take out—as I was going along Houndsditch I saw the prisoner Lee—I am quite sure of him—I lost sight of him then, and saw him again in Finsbury-square—when he got to Whitbread's brewery he spoke to me, and said he had been to my master's, and that he was to have the goods be<lb></lb>cause they were wanted particularly, and I gave them to him—he took them off my shoulder—(I thought it was right,) and he gave them over to the other prisoner who was with him—he heard what Lee said to me—I am quite sure of both of them—Nightingale carried them when Lee gave them to him—they walked away fast.</p>

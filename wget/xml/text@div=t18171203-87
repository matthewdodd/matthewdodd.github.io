The prisoner was there, and asked me to drink with him - I refused - He called for my beer himself. About half-past nine o'clock I got up to go to my sister's, in Bainbridge-street, which comes into George street. The prisoner said to a young woman that sat between him and me, "Is that man going home?" - They appeared to be strangers to each other. I pulled out my watch to see what time it was, and got up to go; he and another man followed me out. There are two doors to go out, and while I was opening the first door they passed before me; about twenty or thirty yards from the door they turned back to meet me; the other man pushed me violently against the wall with his elbow, and at that instant the prisoner snatched my watch out of my fob in a moment - He drew it through my hand; I said,</p>
               <p>"You villain, you have robbed me of my watch;" he ran off, the other man came behind me, and pulled my arm and coat; I got away from him, and followed the prisoner up Buckeridge-street; he turned to the left into Carrier's-street, I lost him. I told the watchman, and described the prisoner to him - He had a blue jacket and trowsers on, and a sore mouth. I went home, and was fetched to the watch-house in about an hour, where I saw the prisoner, and knew him to be the man immediately. He was then disguised, he had a smock frock over his blue jacket, and white trowsers-his mouth was sore. I am certain he is the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BARRY. I was quite sober - I am not used to London-there was a boy, with a violin, in the room.</p>

            . I live in Church-lane, George-street. I am an unfortunate girl. I was in the street, and met the prisoner, and went into the Black Horse to drink with him; I only knew him by sight - We had two pints of beer. The prosecutor came in, and called for a pint of beer, they did not hear him; the prisoner called again for it - He sat over it about an hour; I sat between them. About half-past nine o'clock, the prosecutor went out-the prisoner asked me if that man was gone? I told him he was; he and another young man immediately followed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181712030039"></xptr>him out. I did not know the other man - They had been whispering together about five minutes; the prisoner paid when the liquor was brought. I remained in the public-house about an hour, with some other women. The watchman, patrol, and prosecutor came in about an hour after; he said he had been robbed of his watch by the man who sat by me; they asked if he said any thing to me after the prosecutor went out? I told them that he asked if he was gone, and I said, Yes; I understood he was in custody; I did not see the prisoner again, but I saw him at the office the next morning. He then had a white smock frock and white trowsers on, over his blue jacket and trowsers. When he was setting with me he had a blue jacket and waistcoat, and blue trowsers on. I knew him directly - I have known him by seeing him pass for five or six weeks, but had nothing to do with him; he had a sore mouth that night; I did not observe it before - I have no doubt of his being the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I gave this account before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>BENJAMIN WYATT. I am a patrol of St. Giles's. I received information from some girls, went into George-street, and told the watchman; as we were returning we met the prisoner in the street, and took him to the watchhouse-it was about half an hour after; he was dressed in a smock-frock and trowsers-nothing was found on him - He had a sore lip. The prosecutor came into the watchhouse, and immediately swore to his being the man.</p>

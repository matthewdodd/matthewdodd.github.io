               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Are you a widow? A. Yes; I am quite sure I did not charge two other men with this - they were searched because they were lodgers - I do not know their names; I know the names of my regular lodgers - I have four regular lodgers, and had two casual ones that night; they were all searched on this subject about an hour after I missed the watches - the lodgers are not here: the watches were in my bed-room, which is the back room on the first floor; the prisoner occupied the second floor back room - there was as much access to my bed-room for the casual lodgers as for others; I had seen the watches at half-past seven o'clock in the morning, and missed them at twelve at night, when I went to bed; to the best of my knowledge my bed-room was kept locked - it is my dwelling-house; I have a lease of it - I do not recollect the gentleman's name to whom I pay rent, just now- I have had the house two years; I pay half-yearly - my husband took the house a year and a half before he died: we took it from Mr. Greaves, who had the house before - I think the landlord's name is Wickers; he did live in Aldersgate-street, but he comes for the rent - my husband left no will; I have not administered.</p>

Never before; if I took particular notice of a person to-night I could swear to him to-morrow - I have the two duplicates, for I left the shop after giving him the money, and when I came back he had left his duplicate on the counter; it is in the name of

            . These watches are my property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where did you get this one from? A. From my husband; I have not administered to his effects - I have nothing to administer to; when my debts are paid I have nothing left - my husband has been dead six months.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. They were yours? A. Yes, and I might have disposed of them as I pleased.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. There were four or five strangers in the house; I happened to be out that night with some friends - I was in the habit of going past the bed-room door, but I am innocent of taking these things.</p>
               <p>STEPHEN WHITAKER. He bought this ring of me, I am positive of it, at the time he pawned the watch, and a waistcoat and handkerchief at the same time; I deducted the value of them from the watch; he picked this mourning-ring out of the window, and then the waistcoat and handkerchief - I gave him 3l.0s. 6d.</p>

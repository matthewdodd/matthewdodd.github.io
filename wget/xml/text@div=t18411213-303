                  </hi>. I occupy a farm at Heston. One Friday, in August last, the prisoner was in my service, harvesting—he had been reaping corn for me, and had not done it to my satisfaction—I told him I wished him to alter it, and do it in a workman-like manner—he said, if there was any alteration required, I might do it myself—I told him I should not pay him until he had done it—he was at work with another man, his father-in-law—I then went into my house—this was about two o'clock—about nine, he came to the house, accompanied by his fellow-workman—I said I should not pay him till it was altered—he said he should not leave the house till he was paid—I went in, leaving him there, and closed the door—shortly after he rapped very violently at the door—I went out, and found him at the door, with his companion—I told him it was no use his stopping there, for I should not pay him till I saw his work done properly; if he would meet me in the field at five o'clock in the morning, if the work was then properly done, I would pay him for it—his companion heard what I said to him, seemed perfectly satisfied, and was going away—on his being about to go, the prisoner used some very bad language, and said he was a fool for leaving; he was not to be afraid of that fellow—he did not appear in the least intoxicated—his partner left, leaving him alone, and then he fol<lb></lb>lowed him—there is a gate before you get off my premises after leaving the door—when he used the bad language going out, I asked him what he meant, and followed him to the gate, and at the gate he said he would knock my b—brains out—he had a hoe in his hand, and swung it over my head at the time he used the expression—I had not offered any violence to him, or attempted to strike him—I did not observe any reaping-hook at</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184112130011"></xptr>
               <p>the time, if lie had one—he did not strike me with the hoe—I went up to him to take the hoe from him—Mr. De Carr, a friend of mine, who was there, came and drew the hoe from both of us—I was struggling for the hoe, and closed with him, in my own defence—I was within two yards of him when he swung it over my head—I merely went up to get the hoe, to protect myself, to prevent his injuring me—while we were struggling for the hoe, Mr. De Carr took it from us, and the prisoner then struck me with the reaping-hook—I felt a blow on my leg—I had not noticed the hook—I am quite certain I felt the blow on the leg before I fell down—I felt a sort of numbness in my leg, but did not know the nature of the wound—the blow did not cause me to fall—after the hoe was drawn from him, in the struggle, we fell together—the struggle continued after the hoe was taken, and I fell in the course of the struggle—it might be two minutes, or one minute, between my receiving the blow and falling—we had a pretty smart struggle after I received the blow—it was while the struggle was going on that he struck me with the hook—I did not see him strike me, or see the instru<lb></lb>ment he struck with at the moment—when I fell, I put my hand down, and felt the blood—the injury was two or three inches below the knee, in the upper part of my calf—I was wearing thin summer clothes—I am certain I did not receive the injury in falling, nor after I had fallen, but, in my judgment, a minute or two before—when I observed the nature of the injury, I turned round, and said to the prisoner, "You rascal, you have cut my leg, the blood is running"—he said, "Oh, no, it is not blood, it is mud"—it was not muddy or dirty where I fell—the blood was plainly to be seen—we had a light, which was brought up—I had got up when this conversation happened—Mr. De Carr put me into a chaise, and took me to a surgeon—the prisoner went away, and I passed him on the road—I met a policeman, and told him to take him into custody, but he was not taken till next morning—I am confident the cut did not happen accidentally in the scuffle, from the manner in which he spoke to roe before, and the way he threatened—the hoe being taken from his right hand, he had the hook in his left—after the hoe was taken from him I endeavoured to throw him down, to extricate myself from him—it could not have happened in struggling—I cannot say where his hands were in the scuffle—I have been totally unable to go about since—Mr. Emmett has been attending me.</p>

               <p>think it could have pricked my leg without a blow being made at me, from the nature of the wound—the wound was in the back part of my left leg—I cannot tell which leg was foremost in the scuffle—I never saw the reaping-hook myself—I cannot say who picked it up after the scuffle.</p>

I did not follow him off my premises, nor till after he struck at me—when he walked from the door to the gate he used very abu<lb></lb>sive language—I followed him about four yards—he had got through the gate—I was between the posts in the gateway, leaning against the posts, when he struck at me—I closed on him the moment he struck at me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a friend of Mr. Peto's. I was at his farm at Heston on the 27th of August—I was at supper when Mr. Peto came in—after he was in doors there was a knocking, and he went out again—I heard some words at the doorway and went out—I found the prisoner and Henry Andrews there asking for money—Mr. Peto said he would pay them in the morning, after he had seen the work done properly, not before—the prisoner said he would be d—if he would not have the money that night before he quitted the premises—he placed himself by the water-tub oppo<lb></lb>site the kitchen-door—the other man seemed to be contented, and was going away—the prisoner used some abusive language to him, which I did not exactly hear, and when he was against the gate he called Mr. Peto a b—s—thief—Mr. Peto said, "What is that you say, you rascal?" and went towards the gate—I could not see whether the prisoner had any thing in his hand at the time, as it was dark—I heard him threaten to knock Mr. Peto's brains out—Mr. Peto went up to him, they struggled, I went up and took the hoe from the prisoner's hand, and threw it in the road—in about half a minute Mr. Peto fell on the ground—when he arose he said to the prisoner, "You villain, you have cut my leg"—I saw no instru<lb></lb>ment till after they got up—I then saw a reaping-hook lying on the ground, very near to where they had been struggling, and where they fell—it was not so near that they might have fallen on it—it was out of reach of where they fell—I put Mr. Peto into a chaise and took him to have medical advice.</p>

In consequence of information I received on Friday night, the 27th of August, I went in search of the prisoner—I was not able to find him that night, but found him, about nine o'clock next morning, at the King and Queen beer-shop at Heston, on the Bath road, about a mile from Mr. Peto's—I asked him if he had not been working for Mr. Peto the last few days—he said, "Yes"—I asked if he had not had a bit of a <hi rend="italic">tustle</hi> with him over night—he said he had—I asked him if he did not give him a chop with a reaping-hook—he said, "No, I gave him a chop with this hoe"—(he had a hoe in his hand)—and he said, "It served him right"—he did not say why—I told him he must consider himself a prisoner—I took him hoe" to Mr. Peto's—on our way to the station he said he did not cut him with the reaping-hook, but gave him a chop with the hoe, and he was very glad of it, for he would have to suffer as well as him—I said, "You would not mind whose life you took away then, so that you had your revenge"—he said he should not mind being hung for it, and he was sorry he had not cut his head in two—I am sure he said that—I produce the hoe.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, in partnership with Mr. Frogley—the prosecutor was brought to our surgery on Friday the 27th of August, shortly after nine o'clock—he had a wound on the back, and upper part of the left leg, below the knee, transverse, across the leg—it was not a circular cut, but a flat cut, and very deep, about two inches deep in one point, but not in all—that irregularity of depth was not caused by the roundness of the leg—it was deeper in one point than you would expect from that—the deepest part was on the inside—it was not a wound which, in my judgment, would be caused by drawing such an in<lb></lb>strument as a reaping-hook across—I should think it more like a wound done with force—it might have arisen from a fall on a reaping-hook, if he had fallen directly on it—the first sensation, upon receiving a blow with a reaping-hook, would be numbness, from the violence of the blow—it is very probable that such a wound may be received, and numbness follow, and the party not be aware at the moment of his being cut—nothing is more common, and probably he would not for a moment or two be sensible of any violent pain—I have had some experience in such wounds—the cut divided the muscular fibre of the calf of the leg, and the integuments be<lb></lb>tween the muscle and the skin, and the fascia underneath the muscle, so as to get very deep into the fleshy part, especially in the one part I have alluded to—it was certainly a wound calculated to inflict grievous bodily harm, and to maim the party receiving it—Mr. Peto has never been able to use that leg since, except with crutches—I believe he now bears a little on the toe of that leg, but it is quite as much as he does—up to within a few days of this inquiry his life has been in imminent danger, from the</p>

               <p>time the wound was inflicted—it is only within the last week or ten days that he has been at all out of danger—I do not suppose this hoe could produce the wound, and for this reason, that, with that depth of wound, the external wound would have been larger when a wound is received in a fleshy part, especially in the calf of the leg, it gapes—I should say it is impossible this hoe could have done it—it was a more penetrating wound, especially in one point—more of a stab than a cut across—if it had been done with the point of this hoe, the external wound must have been much larger to penetrate two inches, because, to get the hoe in that depth, the surface would have been much broader than it was—it was certainly such a wound as might have been received from the point of a reaping-hook; and, from the testimony I have heard, I believe that was the instrument with which the wound was inflicted.</p>

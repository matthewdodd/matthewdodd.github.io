               <p>FRANCIS CAVANNAH. I am a policeman - on the evening of the 30th of December, I met the prisoner at the corner of Red Lion-street, Spitalfields - I stopped him and asked what he had got - he said, "Nothing" - I found it was lead - I asked where he was going with it - he said over the way - I asked where he took it from - he said from his father's - he wanted me to go back with him, which I would not, and took him to the station-house - I found the lead was fresh cut and wet - I went back to his father, and afterwards told the prisoner that his father had told me he had not seen him all the afternoon - he then said he had taken the lead from an old house in Fashion-street - I asked him if anybody was with him - he said not - I asked where he was going with it - he said he was going to sell it where he sold the last - I went to Fashion-street next day, and found some lead had been cut from No. 19 - he told me it was opposite to a public-house, which that house is - I went on the roof, found the lead fresh cut, and the lead found on the prisoner exactly fitted the gutter.</p>

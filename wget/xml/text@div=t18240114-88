On Tuesday evening last, on looking over a quantity of linen, I missed some at different times; I knew nobody ever entered the warehouse except Monday, who was a porter in the neighbourhood, and had brought things to our warehouse for somebody who kept their furniture there. I missed eight pieces of linen, and concealed myself behind a bale of blankets, and about half-past five o'clock, he came and knocked at the door; the servant let him in, and went up stairs - he unlocked the warehouse door, went to the pile of linen, took a piece, unlocked the street door, and called to Lawrence, gave it to him, and told him to be quick and turn to the left. My friend secured Lawrence, and I knocked Monday down.</p>

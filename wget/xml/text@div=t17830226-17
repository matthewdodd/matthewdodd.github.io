               <p>Court. Before she said this, had you given Hart any reason to suppose it would be better for her? - She said it of her own accord, nobody asked her any questions.</p>
               <p>Had you threatened this woman? it is very extraordinary that she should say so voluntarily, unless you had given her some reason to expect favour. - She said so to me and the watchman, who is not here, I did not think it necessary to call him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Hart. He took 15 s. 6 d. out of my pocket in the watch-house, and three farthings and a penny.</p>
               <p>Brady. I did, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Court. The only material matter is, whether you confessed to him that you took the man's money.</p>

               <p>What was the description he gave? - He described her as having a patch over her eye.</p>
               <p>Then he only mentioned one woman? - He mentioned two, but he particularly described this person; we found Hart at Smith's house, which is a public house; she was standing to a table, and after she was in custody, she put her hand into her pocket, and took out silver and halfpence.</p>
               <p>Was there any gold amongst it? - I saw no such thing; the landlady came and said, she should take seven pence out of it; then the prisoner Hart said, you take care of the rest: then she was taken into the watch-house, and the gentleman took out of her pocket to the best of my knowledge, to the value of fifteen shillings.</p>

               <p>Did you see any gold? - No, but when she threw down some halfpence and silver, she handed something over to Mrs. Smith, but I did not see what it was, nor I did not see the prosecutor.</p>

               <p>On the 30th of September, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, a man took hold of my cloak, and wrenched it from my shoulders; and when I put out my hand to lay hold of the cloak, he immediately<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178810220054"></xptr>held out his arm to give me a blow; there was a man coming up, which scared him, and I held out my hand again, and he ran up <placeName id="t17881022-50-crimeloc225">Neptune-street</placeName>

               <p>I was going up, out of the highway, I saw the prosecutrix, and the prisoner, coming out of the public-house, the woman was rather first, turning to her left hand, I saw the cloak on the woman; the prisoner turned to the right hand; I saw her cloak disappear off her back, and she began to make a noise for it; I cried, stop thief! the man run up the street, it is forty-four steps up the street, I measured it since, to be particular in my evidence; he run against the bar, at the top of the street, he knocked himself down; I took him to the King's Arms, Neptune-street, which was kept by an officer; the cloak was fetched into the house; the prisoner was kept in custody; the darkness of the night hid him from my view, but not long.</p>
               <p>AL. BIRDSHAW sworn.</p>
               <p>I heard the cry of, stop thief! and saw a man run, he run against the bar, threw himself backwards, and cut his mouth, he got up, and I collared him; and to the best of my knowledge, he put his hand under his coat, and took something and shied it away; I got a candle and went out, and picked up the cloak, about two yards and a half from where he fell down; I brought it back, and delivered it to the constable.</p>

               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>This woman asked me to drink, for she liked sailors; we had a pot of beer, and she called for six or seven quarterns of rum hard running; she was intoxicated, and asked me to go home with her, and pass for her cousin; and then she would not go home; we were both very drunk; she hauled me one way, and I her another, and the cloak slipped off; and then they sung out, stop thief!</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

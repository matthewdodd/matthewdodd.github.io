               <p>Court to Lowson. What sort of a ring was it you gave the prisoner to look at? - A hair device ring, I never looked particularly at it, but I know it again; it has letters round it, I never read it, I saw the letters round it, it was lotted and had a ticket on it; it says a hair device ring, the letters I know nothing about, it is a lock of hair, I know nothing of it, but from the description of the catalogue.</p>
               <p>Is that the ring (shewing him a ring)? - No, this is not the ring, the ring lost was a larger ring.</p>
               <p>Look at that then? - No, that is not the ring, it had no letters in the middle.</p>
               <p>What think you whether that is the ring or not? - This is the ring; I know it by the hair in the middle.</p>

               <p>I am a physician, I live in John-street, America-square; I have know the prisoner some what about two years, I have attended him in the character of a physician, I cannot speak to his character at all, only attended him as physician; I was called in to him about two years ago, under a great delirium; he had every symptom of insanity; I have not attended him since; but after attending him four or or five weeks, his fever yielded to the treatment we administered; but there was a degree of idiocy which remained, a perfect fatuity, absolute fatuity.</p>
               <p>Court. You attended him; how long did you attend him after his fever had abated? - His fever intermitted and returned with as much severity as at the first: I attended him after his fever was removed, and there was a degree of fatuity remained, and idiocy, and a want of recollection in his conduct that convinced he was not recovered.</p>
               <p>Is it not common for a state of weakness and wandering of mind to remain for some time after a fever, for a delirium to remain? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Were you able from attending him for a week after his fever had left him, to form any judgment whether his disorder was of a permanent nature or not? - From his having been deemed incurable by other professional men, I was convinced his disorder would not yield to the treatment; I believe his disorder was of the kind called idiocy; I frequently met him in the street, and he appeared the same; he had a ticket I believe from St. Luke's, to which I recommended him.</p>

               <p>Court. Do you mean that he was so frightened, hearing that there were thieves on the road, that he lost his senses; did you lose your reason by being frightened? - I know the reason why we were frightened, because there were thieves on the road; I did not lose my senses, but he was frightened out of his wits; I desired him to be blooded, and ever since he was so.</p>

               <p>I attended this young man with Dr. Meyers; I attended him four or five weeks, I found him in a state of delirium, when that delirium went off, he was quite an ideot; it appeared quite a perfect idiotism, I looked upon him incurable, not only me but Dr. Meyers pronounced him so; I have seen him lately, he was then in that state.</p>
               <p>Court. You saw him lately did you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Where? - At his house.</p>
               <p>How long were you with him? - Not long.</p>
               <p>How long? - It might be about a quarter of an hour; his wife was ill, and I went on that occasion, his wife sent for me, he was in the room at the time I was there.</p>
               <p>What conversation had you with him? - I asked him how he did, and he did not give me a proper answer, and I judged his mind was the same.</p>
               <p>What answer did he give you? - Upon my honour I cannot take upon me to say the exact words, but I know he did not give me an answer agreeable to what I asked him, I cannot tell you what sort of answer.</p>
               <p>How came you to judge it not a proper answer? - I knew he did not give me a proper answer.</p>
               <p>Why not? - I remember it was not, and I have seen him since that in the street.</p>
               <p>Had you any conversation with him? - None at all, I judged of the state of his mind, by his raving about, jumping about the street; not walking in a manner that a man in his senses should do, he walked in a harum scarum manner.</p>
               <p>Now describe a little? - Just as a madman does.</p>
               <p>I really do not know how a madman walks till you tell me; I want to know? - By his raving and jumping about.</p>
               <p>Did you see him jumping? - Yes, about the street.</p>
               <p>In what manner, do describe a little? - Why, jumping from one place to another.</p>
               <p>By himself, or with anybody? - By himself.</p>
               <p>Where was he jumping? - Why, it was at Bethnal-Green that he was jumping about.</p>
               <p>What to try how far he could leap? - I do not know, I do not recollect that anybody was with me, but I know he was by himself; I had no conversation with him then, the last conversation I had with him was at his own house; I asked him how he did, and I do not recollect what his answer was, but it was not a direct one.</p>
               <p>Do you think that every man that does not give a direct answer is mad? - No, certainly not; I think that the answer he gave me was not a direct one.</p>
               <p>You cannot tell us anything like his answer? - No, I cannot.</p>

               <p>I am clerk of the Portuguese Synagogue, I have known him many years; I never heard anything at all against him, his character was good about two years ago, he had been deranged in his mind; he has continued in a state of insanity, after the first violence was over; and was put on the lift of the poor, because from his idiotism he was not able to support his wife and family, and once they brought him to the synagogue, and he ran about and threw himself down like a madman; that is about eight months ago, and he continues so still.</p>
               <p>Jury. What was he before? - He used to deal in drugs, to the best of my knowledge.</p>

               <p>Did you observe any thing particular in his behaviour different from other men? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>When he was before the justice, how did he behave himself? - Just the same as he did in the room.</p>
               <p>Court to Cox. In what manner did the prisoner behave? - I did not observe him, till they were going to stop him.</p>
               <p>When they did stop him, in what manner did he behave? - He stood still and said nothing till I asked him what he had done with the ring; and he said he had returned it back, he had not got it, so he said to the constable, I observed nothing in his behaviour that had the appearance of either a madman or an idiot; I was present before the justice, when he was examined, he behaved the same as he did in the room; Sir Sampson asked him what profession he was, he said no profession; his father was a jew, and he was born in Gibraltar; he said very little more.</p>
               <p>Jury. How long was he examining these articles before you missed the ring? - About three minutes, he had in his hand a catalogue and looked at the catalogue.</p>
               <p>Did he behave like any other person? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Were there rings of more value? - There was no diamond rings.</p>

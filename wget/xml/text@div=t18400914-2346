                  </hi>. I am single, and live in Silver-street, Lisson Grove, I was at the street-door about one o'clock on the 11th of September—the prisoner came up and spoke to Ann Pickering, and asked to go backwards—I saw her come out and go away—I afterwards missed my shawl off a chair down stairs—it was brought back to me in half-an-hour.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow. I saw the prisoner come out of the house—Twyford then missed her shawl—she asked me and Pickering to go to the pawn-shops to stop it—we then saw the prisoner coming out of a public-house with the shawl under her gown and her hands before her, as if she was in the family-way—I went to her and took up her gown, and found the shawl tied in one knot, with the two ends in front of her—I gave her in charge.</p>

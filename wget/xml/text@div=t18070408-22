            . On the 29th of March, about eleven o'clock at night, as I was passing along <placeName id="t18070408-22-crimeloc130">Duke street, Manchester square</placeName>

               <p>Q. Did you express that you meant to give her sixpence. - A. Yes; having no sixpence in my pocket, I told her I would give her a shilling if she could give me a sixpence, and in putting the sixpence into my pocket which she gave me, I found the rest of my money was missing. I charged her with stealing it.</p>
               <p>Q. You had felt your money there some time before. - A. Yes, I felt it when I put my hand in for the shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the rest of your money. - A. Three half guineas, and a one pound note.</p>
               <p>Q. You missed all of them. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you put the sixpence in your pocket you charged her with it. - A. Yes, and she denied it. I told her if she would give me up the money I would not charge the watch with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give it her by way of charity. - A. Yes. She begged that I would not charge the watch with her. I told her I must if she did not give it me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you charge the watch with her. - A. I did. We took her to the watchhouse; she was stripped and her clothes looked over, but nothing was found in her clothes. I saw her hand clenched, I laid hold of it, I gave it into the constable's hands that keeps the watchhouse; and before he opened her hand I described the money to him, that two of the half guineas were of the old coin and one of the new die; and upon his opening of her hand he found it correct, as I had stated.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards make any search for the note. - Q. Yes, I went back, and with the assistance<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180704080016"></xptr> of two watchmen's lights. I picked up the one pound note, near about the place where we had been standing.</p>

            . Q. You are the constable that was charged with this woman. - A. Yes, I was at the watchhouse when she was brought in.</p>
               <p>Q. You searched her did you. - A. Yes, we found nothing about her clothes; I had her there so often, I was sure I should not find any thing about her clothes; before I opened her hand the prosecutor told me that two of the half guineas were of the old coin, and one of the new die; she had it in her left hand clenched; she swore solemnly she had nothing in her hand.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. This man picked me up in the street, he took me down a gateway, and gave me sixpence; I pulled out my handkerchief, I heard something fall, I stooped and picked up something, not knowing whether it came out of my pocket on his; a little while afterwards he told me I had robbed him. In taking me to the watchhouse he said he would forgive me, and say nothing about it if I would give it him. I did not, I was taken to the watchhouse, they searched me in a very indecent manner; and when I found it did not belong to me, I gave it up every farthing to the constable.</p>
               <p>Howell. She denied having it. I had hard work to break her hand open.</p>

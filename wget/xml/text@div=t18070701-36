On the 1st of June they came on the over night to work at twelve o'clock, when our family go to bed, leaving them up to work. Some little time after five in the morning my wife and I thought we heard our bar window open; we both got up, and my wife saw the prisoner Kendall get out of the bar upon her hands and knees; my wife asked her what she wanted there, she said that she had been into the bar for a bit of cheese; I dressed myself and came down and opened the bar, to see if I could find any thing missing; I found by the print of the saw dust that somebody had been in my bar I next examined my till, I found there were more more halfpence taken out of the till than there were left in the till. There was sixteen or seventeen shillings left in the till.</p>
               <p>Q. How much do you suppose there were taken out. - A. About fourteen or fifteen shillings, I cannot<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180707010035"></xptr> exactly say.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any silver. - A. There was no silver; we took that up the overnight with us; I desired my wife not to take any notice of it to the prisoner, but to let them finish their work. I sent for Ray the officer, and he searched the prisoners; there were nine or ten shillings found upon Kendall, and about three or four shillings upon Moulder; she said she received them from Kendall, she never was in the bar in her life. Ray the officer asked her how much money they had when they came into the house; they said they had only two or three halfpence; they said they had sent some liquor home to their lodgings. We searched their different lodgings.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Monday the 1st of June, about eight o'clock in the evening, I went to Mr. Manwaring's house, where I found both the prisoners; I took them both into custody; I searched Kendall first; in her pocket was nighteen shillings of half pence and penny pieces and farthings; there was one paper done up; she seemed very much alarmed, downed upon her knees, and begged for mercy. On the other prisoner Moulder I found about three shillings in penny pieces and farthings; she said she was very sorry, and begged that Mr. Manwaring would not hurt her. I went to Moulder's lodgings, where I found a bottle of vinegar, and a bottle of rum and brandy, it seems to be mixed; she said that it belonged to Mr. Manwaring, they had taken it out of the bar. Then I went to Kendal; there seemed to be just the same quantity found there.</p>

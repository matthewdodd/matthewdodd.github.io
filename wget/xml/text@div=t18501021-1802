                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Alfred Davis and another, at 59 and 60, Houndsditch—we are foreign and Birmingham and Sheffield merchants—the prisoner was in our service about eleven months, at wages about 27<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 28<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—he was given into custody on another charge about 19th Sept.—I had his address at home—I asked him at the station if that was his correct address—I went with the officer to the place he told me—immediately on entering the place I saw a number of goods that were ours—I took possession of them—here are three musical-boxes, worth 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., four port-moniers, eleven rings, seven hair-bracelets, ten brooches, a locket and guard, two pairs of earrings, a gold breast-pin, and other things—this Swiss view, bears my mark, and another article bears our private mark—if these articles had been sold by the prisoner it would appear in this book</p>

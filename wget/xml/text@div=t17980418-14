               <p>Q. Did you see the guinea in her hand? - A.No, she threw it away some how, I could not see it; she whipped her hands behind her, and what became of the guinea I cannot say; I accused her with it, and she said she had not got it; I desired her to return the guinea, or I should charge the watch with her; I sent for the landlady up, and she desired her to return it; she said, she had got no such thing, it was only a halfpenny; Mrs. Smith sent for the watchman, and the watch was not set.</p>
               <p>Q. Is she here? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there no other witness here but yourself? - A. No; I kept her till the watch set, and then she was taken to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find your guinea? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you in the room with her? - A. Near three quarters of an hour; by that time the watchman came.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you there before the watch was sent for? - A. Ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give her any money? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you no connection with her? - A. No, no connection at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you drunk or sober? - A.Perfectly sober.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. He came down to me this morning, and gave me some beer, and said he would not say more than he could help, as I had not the guinea; I was searched twice, and I never had the guinea.</p>

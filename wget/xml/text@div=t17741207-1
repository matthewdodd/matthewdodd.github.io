As we were walking from Ball's Pond turnpike towards Kingsland turnpike, at about a quarter before nine o'clock, the prisoner Rogers came to me and demanded my life or my money; I jumped off the causeway into the road and told him I did not know what he meant, I had no money, and I called the watch; he told me if I called the watch any more he would knock my brains out: I told him if he would not hurt me I would give him all my money; he said he would not; I gave him some halfpence, he said this is not all, I told him if he would have patience I would give him all; he said he would take it out if my pocket himself, I said he should not do that, but I would give him all; I took out 4 or 5 s. he said he would feel whether I had not more, then another man came up and stood at my side or held me, I can't be sure which, while Rogers felt in my pocket, but he found no more; then he shook hands with me, said it was necessity had drove him to it, and wished me a good night. There were three men in all. Mr. Gill was a few yards from me at the time. I think I know all the prisoners, but I can't be positive to any but Rogers; I knew Rogers again as soon as I saw him, he was dressed in a darkish, reddish great coat with a velvet collar; he wore his hat cocked up on each side and flapped before.</p>

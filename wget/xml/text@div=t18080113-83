On the 8th of January, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner was in the tap room; my fellow servant saw her go down in the kitchen and take the things; she went out and took them from her. I saw the gown and apron in about three or four minutes afterwards; I know them to be mine, I keep my clothes in the kitchen. I have lost a great many things. I lost a new gown out of the wash some time before.</p>

            . Q. Are you a servant at the Bull's Head. - A. Yes. I was in the bar, I saw the prisoner go down stairs into the kitchen, and I saw her go out in the street. After she came up I followed her in the street about the distance of an hundred yards from the house. I asked her to come back with me; she said - child, who wants me? and she came back with me. When I got her in the house I asked her what she had got under her gown. I saw my fellow servant's apron in her pocket, I took it out, and the gown fell down; it was tucked under her gown. She then said she would do any thing in her power to make me amends. I knew the gown and the apron to be my fellow servant's.</p>

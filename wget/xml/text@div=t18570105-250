                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">a prisoner</hi>). I am at present a convict under sentence of transportation for life; that is under a conviction for uttering a forged bankers' cheque—I am one of the persons by whom a robbery of gold was effected in May, 1855, on the South Eastern Railway Company—I know the three prisoners—I have known Pierce I should think about five years; it might be more—he was not in the employment of the South Eastern Railway Company when I knew him—I have known Burgess between three and four years—I knew him employed as one of the guards of that company—I have known Tester I think somewhere about the same time—he was in the employment of the company, in the superintendent of traffic's office.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did you first have any conversation with either of the prisoners upon the subject of this robbery? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The first time I had any conver<lb></lb>sation was with Pierce about four years since, I should think—I had been to the United States of America—I saw Pierce upon this robbery after my return, but I knew him previously to going—when I returned he was a clerk at Clipstone's betting office, in King—street, Covent-garden—I met him in King-street accidentally—I had conversation with Pierce on the subject of this robbery before I went to America; it was then proposed to commit the robbery provided we could, and I declined it—I did not think it was practicable to be done—I then left and went to America, and when I returned I met Pierce accidentally; he asked me if I thought anything more about the robbery; I said I thought it was impossible to be done, unless an impression of the keys could be got—he said he thought he could get them, if I would undertake it—I had several meetings with Pierce after that; the conversation was generally how to obtain possession of these keys—upon his telling me he thought he could procure impressions of the keys, I said if he could do so I would have no objection to undertake to complete the robbery—the matter was then left—he said he would endeavour to see Tester, and when he did he would let me know—Tester and Burgess were the two names he mentioned as being connected at that time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How was that stated, in answer to any question of yours, or how? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Merely stating, was he sure he could get the impression, it was no use my waiting if he could not, and he said, "No doubt in course of time he could do so;" that was the conversation that passed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was anything said about how many persons were to be concerned in it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, four, three besides myself—that was in answer to a question of mine—I asked him if he could get the impressions how many parties would be connected with it; he said there would be four, naming Tester, Burgess, himself, and myself—this was the subject of conversation several times when I met Pierce—this was about four years ago, when I first came</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185701050097"></xptr>
               <p>back from America—I went down to Folkestone about twelve months be<lb></lb>fore the robbery—in the interval I had seen Burgess—I had seen Pierce several times—I had seen Burgess, but Tester I had not seen up to that time, although I knew him—I had not seen him about this robbery—before I went to Folkestone I had conversation about the robbery, at which Bur<lb></lb>gess was present, and also with Tester before I went to Folkestone—I could not state the number of times I had seen Burgess before I went to Folke-stone, it was so many—I used to meet him at Sterne's, being the usual house he went to, and I have seen him at his own house—on those occasions when Burgess has been present, I did not see Tester—I had seen Tester before I went down to Folkestone—I saw him at Margate, he was station master there, I went down there to see him—when Burgess was present with Pierce and myself, the conversation was that Pierce had communicated with Tester, because he had more control over Tester than I had—Pierce stated to me that Tester was at Margate and wished to see me, that he could show me the impression of the cash box if that would be any criterion for me to go by to make the keys for the bullion chest—I went down to Margate and saw Tester—I went with him to his lodging, took some tea with him, and I stopped there that night, and returned to London in the morning—he showed me the iron safe that was in the office at Margate; and in the morning he showed me the key belonging to a cash box that comes up the line with the money for the different stations, and he asked me if that would be any guide for me to make the keys of the bullion chest by—I said not the least—he said it was a great pity that Pierce had not named it to him before, for when he was clerk at the harbour office at Folkestone he had the keys in his possession, and that induced me and Pierce to go down to Folkestone—I should say, as near as my memory will permit, that it was about six or seven months after seeing Tester at Margate, that Pierce and I first went to Folkestone—when I returned from Margate I saw Pierce; I saw Burgess, I believe at night, or when his train came in—I went round and saw him and communicated to him what my opinion was upon what reports Tester had made to me at Margate—they asked my opinion upon it, and I said the only thing would be to go down to Folkestone, take an apartment and stop there and watch the tidal trains in and out, and see if the keys were there according to the report that Tester had given—it was arranged that that should be done—I and Pierce then went to Folkestone—that was about a year before the robbery and about six months after the conversation with Tester at Margate—Pierce and I hired two bed rooms and a sitting room at Folkestone—I do not know the name of the house, it was on the right hand side going from the up station towards the town—I went by the name of Adams there—I do not know the name that Pierce went by—I do not know whether he gave any name or not—I took the apartments in the presence of Pierce—I should think we stopped at Folkestone probably a fortnight—I could not say the time exactly—we stopped there till Pierce was driven away by the inspector of police—we used to go down to the harbour on the arrival of the train from London and the boat from Boulogne, watch the iron safe and see whether they unlocked it or what was done—we did not succeed in seeing them for some time, and by being down there so often the police took notice of us—the inspector at Folkestone followed Pierce—I told him that he was looking after him—I supposed he thought he was there for picking pockets or something of that, and Pierce took him through the town and got away from him in some way, and went to the lodging, I went to the lodging to have my tea, and met Pierce there—in consequence</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185701050098"></xptr>
               <p>of that, Pierce came up to London that same day, leaving me there—I either remained a week or stopped till the week was up, I cannot say which—I noticed on one occasion the way in which the safe that brought the bullion was—before Pierce left, we noticed generally the way in which it came—we were always there to notice whether the bullion safe was opened or not—we had not seen it opened.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You said you saw it opened on one occasion? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, on one occasion which I will mention.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was that on the occasion of a parcel coming? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; it was before Pierce came up; a chest was going to be sent up to London empty, it was placed on the platform, and a man named Sharman, I believe a ticket porter, came out to lock the chest; and he used one key and there was another key suspended, which I supposed was the key of the other lock—I saw that done, and when he had locked it I followed him into the office, to see where he put the keys; and he put them into the cash till, a drawer under the desk that is at the office where the tickets are distributed at the harbour station—when I came up to London I saw Pierce and Burgess—during the time I remained at Folkestone after Pierce had left, I frequented a house there kept by a man of the name of Meadows, or some such name, in the upper part of the town—Chapman and Ledger, the two clerks, used to go there, and I used to go there to play at billiards with them—I did not succeed in getting any information from them—they gave me no facility whatever in the object I had in view—Pierce was living in Walnut-tree-walk, Lambeth, at this time—I mentioned to Pierce what had happened at Folkestone during his absence—I named to him that I had been down there seeing the trains in, and the policeman was always there looking for him—I stated to him that I thought we should be able to get the im<lb></lb>pressions, provided I had an introduction to one of the men, of the name of Sharman I think it was but, being a stranger, I could not make myself acquainted with him—it was then arranged (Pierce made the arrange<lb></lb>ment) that he should see Tester and make an appointment for Tester to meet me at Folkestone, and introduce me to this Sharman to walk about the station with me—Pierce met Tester, and made the arrangement to meet me there—I did not see him meet Tester—he told me that he had done so, and I was to go down to Folkestone, and stop there, and Tester was to meet me there as it were by accident—I went down alone—I should think that was something like eight or nine months previous to the robbery—I cannot speak correctly to dates—I stopped at the Pavilion Hotel that time—I only remained there two or three days, to the best of my recollection—I saw Tester at the up station on the Sunday, and we walked together down to the harbour station, and walked about—when I met him he merely asked me how I was, and such like, or if the parties were there—I said I had seen them, but I could not introduce myself to them—he said, "I will make it all right for you"—we walked arm in arm together down to the harbour station, and went into the office—he showed me about the office, and the, telegraph, and such like, and there we saw the man named Sharman, the ticket clerk—Tester introduced me to Sharman as "a friend of mine, stopping here for some little time"—when he introduced me to Sharman, it was proposed that we should go to the Pavilion to have a glass of wine—Sharman consented, and brought a friend with him—Sharman, his friend, and me and Tester went into the Pavilion—I called for some sherry and biscuits, which we partook of—Tester and Sharman were in conversation about how business was going on there, whether they had much bullion crossing, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185701050099"></xptr>
               <p>such like; the principal of the conversation was between Tester and Shar<lb></lb>man, I merely sat there as any other person—I believe Sharman to be the name of the man, the ticket clerk, or something similar to that name—Tester dined with me that day at Folkestone—it was on a Sunday, I do not know the date—no one but Tester dined with me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was anything then said about this robbery? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He asked me what my opinion was; I said, I thought it was very likely, as I had had an intro<lb></lb>duction to Sharman I might go with him at the time he was issuing out tickets, and get an impression of the keys—Tester came up to London on that same day—I stopped at Folkestone—I used to take a walk on to the beach, or round about, to pass away my time—I generally endeavoured to throw myself in the way of Sharman, but he was a very sedate young man—I could not get further than the time of day with him; I could not get at all intimate with him—I did not see anything more of the chest, or the place where the keys were kept—finding that I could not get any way familiar with Sharman, I came up to London—I saw Burgess and Pierce—I told them that I could not make any impression with this Sharman on account of his being so sedate, but we would let it remain a little while, and we would go down again when the police had forgotten Pierce, which was consented to—during this time the key of the bullion chest was lost—Pierce communicated it to me—he told me that he had received a letter from Tester, stating that one of the keys was lost, and the bullion chest would have to come up to Mr. Chubb's to be repaired—after Pierce had made this statement to me, he stated that Tester had told him he expected the box up, and to let him have some wax to take the impression—I objected to that—I said, "No, I must take the impression myself"—he saw Tester, and commu<lb></lb>nicated that to him, and then the arrangement was made between Pierce and Tester for me to be at the arcade,—near the terminus, at a given hour of the day, and if he had the key he would let me take the impression—I went there accordingly, and met Tester—he stated that he had not got the key then—I met him the next day, and the same took place for two or three days or more—eventually I told him that I did not like standing under the arcade so much, and an appointment was then made to be at a beer shop at the corner of Tooley-street, kept by a man named Waller, or some such name, Wallis—I went there, and met Tester and Pierce—Tester produced two keys; they were new keys of Chubb's make—I told him that I must take one of them up stairs for a few minutes, at which he rather hesitated for a moment; he said, could not I do it there?—I said, I should prefer going up stairs—I rang the bell, and asked the waiter if I could go up stairs and wash my hands—he called the chamber maid, and she showed me up into a bed room; and I there took the impression of one of the keys; both keys were alike—I should say they were both for one lock, they were duplicate keys—I took two or three impressions on some wax—I then came down stairs, and returned the keys to Tester, and he went away, and I and Pierce went.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> At this time, were you in the habit of see Burgess? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; we were in the habit of meeting Burgess; we always knew what train Burgess was upon, and if we had not any appointment made with him, we used to go to Sterne's and meet, and when he came in, if we had anything particular to talk about we used to go out into the dark—Sterne kept a public house in Tooley-street or a turning into Tooley-street, frequented by the servants of the company—I saw Burgess after taking the impressions of the key, I stated to him that we had one, that was half way, but the one was very</p>

               <p>little use without the other—the first time of my going to Sterne's beer shop was with Pierce; I met him there several times afterwards—I and Pierce and Burgess talked the matter over, how we could obtain the second key—it was proposed that I should go down to Folkestone and stop at the Pavilion Hotel, and Pierce was to send a letter to me in the name of Archer, stating that he would forward a box to me containing 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was possessed of money at that time, I advanced, I think, between 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for that purpose, in sovereigns—I went down to Folkestone on a Saturday, and stopped at the Pavilion—I received a letter from Pierce through the post—I destroyed that letter; it stated that he would forward a box down to me in the care of either Ledger or Chapman—I do not know which, and that he had insured it to the value of 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I forget which—it was to be sent in a small box, to be insured at the London terminus in the usual way and directed for E. A Archer, to the care of one or other of those persons at the Folkestone station—I received the letter on the Saturday—I went to the office in the harbour, produced the letter to Chapman or Ledger, I do not remember rightly which it was that was in the office, and asked them if they had a box for me—they said it had not then arrived; and I told them I was stopping at the Pavilion if one should arrive—I inquired again on the Sunday; it had then arrived—I went to the upper station to see the train arrive and the iron chest put out—it was taken out in the ordinary way—it was then forwarded to the lower station—I walked down to the lower station and showed my letter to Chapman; Chapman stated that he believed he had got the box for me—I saw Chapman open the safe—he only used one key—there were two locks on the safe; but by unlocking one the safe opened, there was only one key used at that time—I noticed that he took that key from a cupboard at the back of the office, on the left hand going in—he took the box out and told me I must sign a form for the receipt of it—I told him that I was not able to do so as I had met with an accident and hurt my finger, and I would trouble him to do it for me, and he did so; he filled it up for me and said, I must get you to sign it, and I signed it in the name of E. R. Archer (<hi rend="italic">looking at a paper</hi>)—this signature is my writing; the other part is in Chapman's—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>: "South Eastern Railway—Specie and Finance Way Bill, London to Folkestone, Oct. 30th, 1854; received the under—mentioned case in iron chest, J.

               <p>that we got there—we went there to watch the arrival of the boat from Boulogne—we waited till she came in, and went down to the harbour—I noticed that Ledger and Chapman generally when the boat arrived left their office, and went out to search the passenger's luggage—when the boat arrived we were down on the harbour, and we saw Chapman and Ledger leave the office—I and Pierce went to the door of the harbour master's office where the clerks kept the key—I stood at the door—there is only one door—it is facing the water—Pierce went in to the cupboard, and brought the key to me—I took the impression of it, and gave it to him back, and he put it into the cupboard again—the door of the office was on the latch, not locked—I cannot say whether the cupboard from which Pierce took the key, was locked, but I supposed it was not, or he would not be able to get the key—I did not take any notice of the cupboard door; I was looking to see that Chap<lb></lb>man did not come back—we returned to Dover the same day, and had our tea at the Rose, and after tea we returned to London by the train—after I had obtained the impression of the second key, I met Burgess in London, and communicated to him the success we had met with in getting the second key, and we said that it was a very good job we should be able to com<lb></lb>plete the robbery, and he said that he would do all that lay in his power to do so—he lived at New-cross at that time—there is a house near there called the Marquis of Granby, parting the road from Lewisham to Green<lb></lb>wich—I met him there on one or two occasions—Pierce was with me, and I think Tester, but I will not be sure—I met Burgess there several times—I next proceeded to make keys for the bullion chest from the impressions—as I had not the convenience to make them at Pierce's house, I and Miss Kay made up our altercation that we had, and I got the keys made at Cambridge villas—I finished them myself—I filed the blanks to the impression—at this time Pierce lived at Walnut-tree-walk—I began the filing in an empty room over the gateway in his house—there was a difference between me and Fanny Kay—she was living in Harleyford-road, Vauxhall, and I used to go backwards and forwards there—she was living as my wife—I had had a child by her—we made up our difference, and I took a house at Cambridge-villas, and she went to live with me—it was there that I went on finishing the keys—Pierce at that time lived at Walnut-tree-walk, and from there he removed to Crown-terrace, or Crown-place, Hampstead-road—I cannot rightly state the time I had been at Cambridge-villas before Pierce removed to Crown-terrace—after he removed there, he was in the habit of coming to Cambridge-villas—he assisted me to remove there from Harleyford-road—he was at Cambridge-villas, and assisted me to make a file, and any little thing I wanted him to do he did—we used to do that in the wash house adjoining the garden—the tools I used were files, and a ham<lb></lb>mer and chisel, whitesmith's tools—they were my tools, and were kept in a wooden box painted green, and also in a small wainscot box—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and here are some of my took—here are two in particular which I know—while the filing was going on, and after the keys were finished, an arrangement was made between me and Burgess and Pierce to go down and try them with the safe—we used to com<lb></lb>municate to Tester, as we proceeded, what progress we had made—I was to go down with Burgess, and if he had the chest, to try them—I went down seven or eight times to try them; I travelled by the train as a second or a first class passenger, and if he had got the chest, I used to get into the van and try the keys, at Reigate, or any other place—I tried them five or six times, and altered them if they did not fit, and they at last</p>

               <p>opened it—Burgess was always the guard, I never tried them except when he was guard, he saw me open it—after I had succeeded, I met Pierce and Tester at Burgess's house often; and it was stated to him that the safe was all ready, and that they were waiting till Burgess got on to the mail train—the tidal train is the train by which bullion is generally sent, but at cer<lb></lb>tain times it would go by the mail train; any bullion that came after the tidal train had gone, was sent on by the mail—it was the mail train that was robbed—we had a meeting at Burgess's, to state what was to be done with the property, and how we were to go down to complete the robbery—I can speak to Burgess, Pierce, and myself being present—it was 12, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of gold we thought, and we were to get shot to make that weight—we calculated that the 12, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of gold would weigh about two cwt.—12, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was spoken of, as we thought that would be as much as me and Pierce would be able to carry—I and Pierce went to the shot tower, over by the Suspension-bridge—Pierce went and bought one cwt., placed it in two small carpet bags, and brought it to the gate, he had one, and I had the other; we walked across the Suspension-bridge, got on an omnibus, and took the shot to Cambridge-villas—Pierce repeated the visit to the shot tower, and bought 50 lbs. twice again, making two half cwts.—I did not go the second time, or the third time, I only went once, and he bought the half cwts. at two different times—the bags were at first placed in the par<lb></lb>lour, and afterwards they were taken out of the canvas bags in which they were, and placed in my trunk; they were brought in canvas bags—we after<lb></lb>wards weighed it into 8 lbs. and 4 lbs. parcels, and they were placed in some blue check bags—Fanny Kay was at home when I arrived, and a servant named Charlotte Paynter—they were the only persons, except my child, who lived in that house—my trunk was in the first floor bed room; the house consists of two rooms on the ground floor, and three on the first floor; there are no rooms above the first floor—the room I speak of was that in which I and Fanny Kay slept—the trunk always remained there until I came away, but the shot was taken from there, and placed in the wash-house in this box (<hi rend="italic">the one produced</hi>) for the convenience of weighing it into 8 lbs. and 4 lbs. parcels—I do not think Fanny Kay had any opportunity of seeing us put the shot up in parcels; if she had opened the box she would have seen it, but I do not think she had curiosity enough to do so; at times it was open, and at times it was locked—I had the key—after that had been done, we had about 10 lbs. or 12 lbs. of shot more than we required, and me and Pierce carried it out in our pockets, and distributed it, in the fields, and the road, in the neighbourhood of Pierce's house, in Crown-terrace—we then had four leather courier bags made with a strap to sling over the shoulder, and go under the arm—Pierce and me ordered them together, at the corner of Drury-lane and Queen-street—we fetched them, and then tested them; we carried them with the shot to Cambridge-villas, and in so doing a few of the stitches came undone—I made some wax ends, and sewed them up at my place—they were made of drab leather—they had such a strap as this round this box, but this is not one of them—the shot was removed to Pierce's house, Crown-terrace, in carpet bags, by a cart and horse which Pierce got—the courier bags were placed inside the carpet bags with the shot—one bag, a black leather one, was made on purpose for Tester, I had it made for him; we four met together and asked Tester to come down to Reigate, and take part of the gold up, which would lighten our load, on his return to London—he con<lb></lb>sented, and I got that bag made for him, and placed it in the carpet</p>

               <p>with Pierce a little while, and then I took apartments in Stanley-place, Paddington-green, where I resided at the time I was arrested upon the charge of which I was convicted, which was on 15th Aug.—I lived in Pierce's house with him about a week, or it might be a fortnight—during the time I was there Tester and Burgess both came there by appointment which I had made—when we were all four together it was named what money there was, and a division took place—I and Pierce and Tester received 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, and Burgess received 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was the produce of the gold that had been sold and the American coin—they received it in notes, all of it—we had received it in gold, and Pierce took the gold to the Bank of England and obtained notes for it—the notes that I received as my share 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. were in my trunk at Stanley-terrace at the time I was arrested—Pierce had the remainder of the gold—he made a hole in the pantry at the bottom of the stairs of his own house at Kilburn-villa, and there he buried it, under the steps which go into the house from the front garden—there is a fore court to the house—you ascend to the house by four or five steps—the pantry is underneath those steps, and he made the hole in the pantry—we were together for some time on the evening that the division was made—I stopped there rather late, all the <hi rend="italic">busses</hi> had gone—I walked with Tester and Burgess to the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> stand by the canal bridge that runs across the Paddington road, and they got into a <hi rend="italic">cab.</hi> and came to town.</p>

I speak of Mr. Weatherhead who is now governor of Newgate—he was then station master—I remember Mr. Chaplin bringing three boxes On the evening before the robbery; they were like those produced—I knew that they were supposed to contain bullion—they were placed on the side of the scale which is outside, on the platform, close to the door of the superintendent's office—the weights were taken by me—the box like this which is marked P. D. 184 weighed 1cwt. 1 qr. 16 lbs.—the box of Mr. Spiel man's weighed 18 lbs., and the other 2 cwt. 2 qrs. 15 lbs.—after they were weighed they were put on a truck or barrow, and taken into Mr. Weatherhead's office, where they re<lb></lb>mained</p>

I cannot speak to a few minutes—I went down with the train, having walked along it to see that the doors were shut, and everything right—it was going from London to Dover—I have seen Agar several times—I did not know his name to be Agar, but I saw the same man at the Mansion House—I had before that seen him with Burgess in Duke-street, that was in the latter end of April or the beginning of May, 1855, probably a fortnight or so before the robbery—it was at a public house—I do not know the name of it, but Mr. Bolton is the proprietor—there were several persons round the bar, but I know nothing of them—Burgess and Agar were talking together for perhaps five minutes—I said, "Good morning, Mr. Burgess," and he said, "Good morning"—I said nothing else at that time—I have not seen them together at any other time—I did not say just now that I had seen them together several times—I said that I bad seen Agar several times—I have seen him on the platform at the London-bridge Station—I have not seen him go down by any train—I have seen him about 8 o'clock—that was about half an hour before the train started—that has been the general time, from a quarter to 8 to 8 o'clock—Burgess was the guard of that train.</p>

                  </hi>. (through an interpreter). I am employed in the Customs at Boulogne. I was present at the arrival of the Lord Warden, on 16th May, 1855, between 12 and 1 o'clock, and went on board—I saw the cash box opened, and I took out the small box—there was only one that I took out—I only arrived in time to take one out—I saw two on the cart, and took one myself—they were taken from the boat to the Douane, by persons employed by the Customs—the same parties that took the others took mine</p>

               <p>along with them—a plank was laid down from the quay to the deck of the vessel, up which the luggage was taken—in unloading one of the boxes, I noticed that it was open the width of my fingers, and I remarked, when I removed it, that there was a bag moving about in it—it was black and white, speckled, just the same as these produced—I stopped there till Mr. Major arrived—I gave the box two knocks with ray heel, to close it—it was placed in the Custom House, in the same place where they deposit all the luggage coming from the boat, which has to be examined—on entering, the scales are to the left, and the other boxes were placed two or three feet from that place—the boxes continued in that state till Mr. Major came—I was there, and saw them all the time until his arrival.</p>

                  </hi>. I am agent at Boulogne to the Society of the <hi rend="italic">Messageries Generates.</hi> The South Eastern Company have an agent at Boulogne, Mr. Barnard—it is usual for the way bill to be produced to the broker for general merchandise, but I receive the way bill of the bullion from Mr. Chapman, and Mr. Barnard receives one from the company in duplicate—I remember the bullion chests arriving on 16th May, and their being taken to the Custom House—they were not opened there; bullion paying the highest duty it is not necessary, and it was late in the day—they were weighed at the Custom House in my presence—one box, marked P. D. 184, weighed, in French measurement, 54 kilogrammes 500 grammes—they weighed together 190 kilogrammes—the third box being so small was put on the others, and it produced then 198 kilogrammes, being 8 kilogrammes more—after they had been weighed, the large box being in bad condition, I had it nailed by the labouring men attached to the Custom House, and had it put on a truck, and had the small box put into a safe place in the truck, and the second one outside with other bales and packages, and dragged to my office—I happened to see them all the way, but I do not generally do so—when they got to my office they were unloaded, and remained there till they were sent to the rail under the charge of our guard—they were weighed separately at my office—the box P. D., 184, weighed 54 kilogrammes 500 grammes; the other, 136 kilogrammes 500 grammes, and the small box of Spiel man's, 7 kilogrammes 100 grammes; the total was 198 kilogrammes and 100 grammes—I had no idea of anything then—I afterwards received the weights taken at the London bridge terminus—I have reduced the English measures to French—the English weight of the box P. D., in London, has been sent to me as 1 cwt. 2 qrs. 16 lbs., which I calculate and represent in French measure as 70 kilo<lb></lb>grammes 725 grammes; that is, 71 all but one quarter—in the French weight it is 16 kilometres, and a trifling fraction; less in London than in France—I have not calculated what the English weight of 16 kilogrammes 620 grammes is, but 1 cwt. is 70 kilogrammes; there are 2 lbs. avoirdupois to a kilogramme—I was informed also of the weight in London of the other two boxes, and found that the weight of them in France was something more—I went with the boxes to my office, and joined them as they were going into my yard, and went in with them immediately, as I was busy—they remained in my office under my eye all the time—the two large boxes were before me and the small one behind me, and about half past 6 o'clock or a quarter to 7, they were put on the same truck, and taken down to the railway—I did not see them down there, but I have people who generally go with them—I saw them on the truck—I saw the one marked</p>

               <p>P. D., 184, afterwards at Paris, open, on 18th May—the others had been delivered and opened by the consignee—it had not been opened when I saw it on 18th May; it was in the same condition as when I saw it at Boulogne—I saw it opened—I was present when it was weighed—I insisted on its being weighed before me—the box and contents were weighed together, and weighed 54 kilogrammes 700 or 800 grammes and a fraction; it was a few grammes more than my weight, but substantially the same weight as mine, or little above it, but not anything of importance—the deficiency was not greater, but our scales in the office were used—it was all put in together with the lid and all, and then, of course, it was weighed to a very great nicety, and produced nearly 200 grammes more—when the box was opened, it was completely full of bags of this description, containing lead—one bag in the middle had been cut through with a knife; the box being apparently too full for the lid to lie down, and the shot had spread, and was mixed with the bags—there were two sizes of shot, the bag that was cut was the same size, I believe, but the Commissary of police found two sues.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Custom House agent at the Harbour station at Folkestone. On 28th Oct., 1854, I was married, and went away from my duties for a short time, from Saturday, 7th, till I think the following Wednes<lb></lb>day or Thursday—I was absent on 30th Oct.—I do not know Agar by that name—I have seen a man go through the Court that I have seen at Folke-stone—I do not know his name—I saw him, previous to my marriage, at the Rose Inn, kept by Medhurst—I saw him there twice—I do not think that house is frequented by the servants of the company—I only know one who frequents it besides me, that is Mr. Chapman—I have seen the man sitting there, but not conversing with anybody—I do not recollect that I have spoken to him—there is a billiard room there and a smoking room—I recol<lb></lb>lect once Agar was introduced by the landlord when I and a clerk in the Provincial Bank were in there to supper, before my marriage—the landlord brought him in, and in consequence of what the landlord said, he came and had supper with us—after my return from my wedding trip, I saw Agar again—I now distinctly recollect seeing him on the harbour, he spoke to me, and told me that during my absence he had forwarded a valuable parcel to my address—I do not think that was many days after I returned—he did not invite me to go anywhere at that time, but I must have seen him afterwards, because he asked me if I would go to the Pavilion and take wine with him, which I declined—a person there named Conden, made a com<lb></lb>munication to me in consequence of my being with Agar—my office is close upon the harbour on the pier—I had a key of the bullion chest—I cannot say for certain the exact place where I kept it, but it must have been either in</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector of police to the South Eastern Railway Company, at Redhill; in 1854 I held the same appointment at Folkestone harbour—I know the three prisoners—In 1854 I saw Fierce at Folkestone harbour in company with the witness Agar; I believe it was in May, 1854, they were on the pier, standing near to where the passengers were going on board the steam-boat which was in connection with the tidal train—the tidal train had just come in—I should think they were there on that occasion about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour; I cannot say the exact time—I believe they remained there until the boat had sailed—I then saw them leave the pier and go in the direction of the town—I had some reason for noticing Pierce more than an ordinary person—I did not see what part of the town they went to after they had passed the pier—I did not follow them into the town—I cannot recollect whether any bullion was shipped on that day; it was frequently shipped about that time—I saw them together about ten or a dozen tames after that, usually on the pier at the time of the departure of the boat for Boulogne, and the arrival of the boat from Boulogne—I made a communication upon this to Mr. Steer, the superintendent of the Folkestone police—I pointed them out to Mr. Steer, and also to a man that he sent to me—I saw Agar at Folkestone in Oct. 1854—I saw him go into the booking office of the station at Folkestone harbour—he was there aboutten minutes or a quarter of an hour—he brought nothing out—I went in while he was there, and saw him looking round at Mr. Sharman, the booking clerk, whilst he was making up his money in the inner office, adjoining the booking office—Agar was in the outer office—he could see Sharman, by going to the doorway; he could look round the corner at him; he did so—I saw him again on the following day, on the pier, I think between 11 and 12 o'clock—he was with Tester—the boat was then getting ready to start for Boulogne—nobody was with him when I first saw him, but a very short time afterwards I saw him with Tester—I knew Tester perfectly well—I saw them go from the pier in the direction of the Pavilion Hotel—I did not watch them much beyond the station—the Pavilion Hotel is close to the station—I should think they must have been in my sight altogether for twenty minutes on that occasion—I believe Mr. Ledger was away at that time; his marriage was about that time—I saw Tester again that day at the harbour station—he came and went up by the train which left Folkestone harbour at half past 7 o'clock in the evening.</p>

                  </hi>. I am at present a guard on the South Eastern railway. In May, 1855, I was a porter at the London terminus—I was on duty there when the 2 o'clock train from Dover arrived in London on 16th May, 1855—it was my duty to unload the milk cans from the luggage van—to my recollection, none of the passengers had luggage in the luggage van that morning—I noticed three of the passengers, two walked up the platform together, and the other followed a minute or two after—I am not able to recognise the two that walked together—I noticed that one was rather taller than the other; very trifling—I cannot say what sort of covering they had on.</p>

In April, 1855, I was guard of the 7.30 evening train from Dover—I continued on that for the succeeding month of May—it is unusual to continue longer than one month—that train is due at Redhill at 9.25—the 8.30 train from London is due at Redhill, at 9.4—I remember, on one occa<lb></lb>sion when I reached Redhill, seeing Tester there; that was in May; it was before I heard of the gold robbery—he was just coming out of the refresh<lb></lb>ment room door, on the up side—I knew him very well as a person in the employment of the company—he had a black leather bag with him—to the best of my recollection it was about twelve or fifteen inches long—I saw him afterwards in a first class carriage—that train did not stop between Redhill and London—I did not see anything more of him that night—I know Pierce and Burgess; Burgess I knew as a guard—Pierce I have seen at Folkestone in 1854—he was there in company with some one—I do not know the man—I have not seen him since, that I know of—I have seen Agar, but I do not recollect him—J saw Pierce and the other man on the pier at Folkestone, about four or five times—I have also seen Pierce in London; I have seen him at the Green Man, in Tooley-street; and Burgess was there at the time—that was in 1853—J have not seen him there since that.</p>

                  </hi>. Some years ago I was an assistant at the refreshment bar at the Tunbridge station, and while there was acquainted with Burgess, who introduced me to Agar, that was in 1853: some time after which I became intimately acquainted with Agar, and had a child by him—I lived with him at several places, and in Dec, 1854, went to live with him at Cambridge-villas, Shepherd's-bush—before that I had seen Pierce in Agar's company, in Harleyford-road, Vauxhall, and at Greenwich, where I lived, and at Tooley-street, at the Green Man public house, I think it was—I have seen them very often together, and taking meals and refreshments together—so far as I saw, they were well acquainted with each other—I did not see Burgess in Agar's company from the time he introduced me till we went to live at Shepherd's-bush—Pierce went by the name of Peckham—on 7th May, 1855, my child left me to be weaned; Charlotte Painter was then a servant of ours—one Sunday, a fortnight after that, I went to see the child—I remember Mrs. Bessel's death, our next door neighbour, she died on 18th May, 1855—it was after that that I went to see my child—on the Tuesday or Wednesday night before that, Agar was absent all night—he was away the week after, and a few days before—I saw him next day, in the afternoon part—I cannot say exactly the time—he came with Pierce, in a cart; they had two bags with them—I think it was two—they carried them into the washhouse—I did not see them opened—after their return Pierce was there generally every day—after 21st May, he and Agar were in the back room, first floor—I looked into that room once when they were there together, and saw that they had got the stove out and a very bright fire in the chimney—when I opened the door they both ran to it and shut it, but I do not think they said anything to me—before that they had been much in the washhouse, but I do not know what they had been doing, I never went in while they were there—sometimes they were there for the course of the morning, and I heard them hammering very often—they also brought into the house shooting bags, made of drab lea<lb></lb>ther, and one black one—when I peeped into the room up stairs I heard a loud noise, a furnace, it was like the roaring of a large fire—I heard that going on for several days—I saw what appeared to me to be square pieces of stone brought down from that room by Pierce, one end was in a pail and the other he held with a duster—after I had heard that noise, they came down to their dinner and their meals, very hot and very dirty—I inquired what they were doing, and they said, "Leather apron weaving"—they gave no other answer but that—I have heard them speak of Burgess and of Tester—I have gone into the room after that noise has ceased; the stove has been replaced and blackened, and the floor burnt in a few places—about the time that my child was weaned, they wore the fashionable capes, shortish cloaks; Agar had his about two months before my child was weaned—I never saw Pierce looking otherwise in respect of the colour of his hair than he does now—I have seen him with more hair about his face, but his own hair I believe—some short time before Agar's arrest, he left me, and I re<lb></lb>mained at Cambridge Villas a short time—he went to Kilburn, but I did not at that time know that he was there—he came to see me before I heard</p>

               <p>that he was arrested; the child was not with me at that time, he was at Rotherhithe, with a cousin of Agar's—after I had left Cambridge Villa, I saw Agar at St. George's-road, the day before his arrest; before that I had not seen him for a considerable time—after he went away I remained in lodgings in St. George's-road for some time, Pierce provided the money for that up to January—I cannot say how much he gave me, it was different sums; he was to have allowed me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week, but he did not do that—I went to live at his house in January, and remained till the latter part of April, the child was with me—I left on account of words with Pierce—while I was at his house there were two trunks of Agar's there, there were his clothes in them and a box of tools, I do not think there was anything else—I saw no money which I knew belonged to him—I saw his watch there, and a set of shirt studs, and a diamond ring, but no money or notes—I have seen Pierce with a great deal of gold before I went to live at his house; he had a little bag of sovereigns about this size—he once told me that he asked Agar to lend him a sovereign, and Agar would not; some<lb></lb>times he said he could get money out of him and sometimes he could not—he has only once told me that he had asked Agar to lend him small sums of money, that was during the early part of the time that I was at Cambridge-villas—Pierce asked me to lend him a shilling when I was at Greenwich, in 1854—previous to the gold robbery, Agar used to sell his old clothes to Pierce; I suppose he sold them, I have seen Pierce take the old clothes away, and have heard them making a bargain for them—I have seen notes as well as gold in Pierces possession after the robbery, I cannot tell to what amount; I have seen a roll of notes in his hand—after I left his house in April, I had no means of support, and made application to Pierce for money, I got it, and I applied again and got it, I applied to him again and was refused—after that, I saw Mr. Weatherhead, the Governor of Newgate, and made a communication to him; I afterwards saw Mr. Rees, and made a communication to him.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 8, Southampton-street, Vauxhall. I am fifteen years old—at one time I lived with a Mr. and Mrs. Adams in the Harleyford-road—I have seen the man Agar who has just left the Court—he is the person that I then lived with as Mr. Adams—I was not long in their service in Harleyford-road, about two or three months—I was there when they moved—it was very cold weather when they moved—it was about Christmas time—they moved to Cambridge-villas—during the time I was with them in the Harleyford-road, I saw Pierce there—I have not often seen him there—he came to see Adams—he was there at the time of the re<lb></lb>moval—the furniture was moved in a van—Pierce helped to move the things out—I slept at home at that time, and went there to look after the child—I did not accompany them to Cambridge-villas—T went there to live with them—I was a good while in their service there—I remember hearing of the death of a Mrs. Bessell next door to us—I had been there two or three months before Mrs. Bessell died—I saw Pierce at Cambridge-villas as I had done before—he used to come there oftener than to the other place—I was mostly out with the child in the day time—I slept in the house at Cambridge-villas, in the back room up stairs—Mr. and Mrs. Adams slept in the front room—there is a washhouse at the back of the house—I have</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cab proprietor, residing in Hawley-mews, Hawley-street, Camden-town. I drive one of my own cabs, No. 3016—I remember being out with my cab in the spring of 1855, and being called by some man, and driving to somewhere near the Prince of Wales; it was about 7 or half past 7 o'clock in the evening—I stopped about 200 or 300 yards from Crown-terrace, at the corner of the high road—the man who had called me, then went away towards Crown-terrace; he afterwards returned with another man, they had two or three bags with them—I cannot swear which, one I think was leather, and two carpet bags—they ordered me to drive to the Brighton station—when I got over London bridge, they stopped me by the Bridge Hotel, on the right hand side—one of the men was, I should say, four or five inches taller than the other—when we got to the Bridge Hotel, one got out, and went towards the station, or to<lb></lb>wards Tooley-street, the one who remained in the cab, ordered me to St. Thomas's-street—I went there, and stopped against Guy's Hospital—I was told to pull up there—the men had mantles of some description; they had not got them on when they went in, they were on their arms then, but they placed them on when they got out, at least one man did—I could not hear anything that passed inside as I went along, I merely felt the action of the cab was very different to what it out to be, as if somebody was standing up, or moving about—I never felt the bags, and could not form any opinion whether they were heavy or light—the man who got out of the cab was away, I suppose, a quarter or half an hour—when he returned they ordered me to drive back again to where I had come from—when I got up to Hamp<lb></lb>stead-road, I was ordered to turn up towards the Mother Shipton—I did so, and they discharged me there, and went away with their bags—that is about 200 or 300 yards from Crown-terrace—there are two ways by which you can go to Crown-terrace; those are the two ways. I have mentioned—I saw the men again, I cannot say whether it was a week afterwards, or it might not be so long: they came and fetched me off the rank then, near Chalk Farm; I was not on the rank the first time—it was the same man that fetched me, the shorter man—he took me to the same place, went away, and brought another man with him, and the same lug<lb></lb>gage—I think it was the same person that he had fetched on the former occasion, but I cannot swear to that—the two were of different heights—I cannot swear that the tall man was the same, but I know the shorter man that hired me was—I drove them then to St. Thomas's-street, on St. Thomas's Hospital side—I stopped there, and the shorter man got out—I noticed the same sort of action of the cab that time—they seemed to be rustling or moving about in the cab, as if they were looking out or something—after the shorter man had been away about half or three-quarters of an hour, he returned; they had some conversation, and then they ordered me back again—on that occasion they had cloaks on their arms when they got in—I then went to the Prince of Wales-road, on the Hampstead-road side—I was ordered to set them down at the other end—they got out there, and took their luggage away; I could not carry it, because you cannot get down that road—that is about 200 yards from Crown-terrace—I saw them again; it might be a week after, but I cannot remember how long it was—the one man fetched me again from the rank, the short man, the same that had fetched me on the two former occasions—he took me to the same the Hampstead-road, the Prince of Wales's corner, left me, and</p>

               <p>fetched the same man, I think, as before, but I could not swear as to that; he was of the height of the man that had come on the former occasions—they brought their luggage and cloaks just as before—they told me to drive to St. Thomas's-street, in the Borough—I did so—I pulled up, I think, on the St. Thomas's Hospital side—the short one got out, and went away; he seemed to bend his way to the left, as if he was going towards Tooley-street; I do not know whether there is any way to the station that way—on that occasion I lifted one of their carpet bags; it was heavy; it weighed, I should say, a quarter of a cwt., or more—the man returned to the cab the third time, got in, and ordered me back to where I had come from—I should say this was the latter end of April, or the beginning of May; it was somewhere about that time, it was always dark when we returned in the evening.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 143, Grove-street, Camden-town; I drive a cab, and have done so for twenty years. I remember being hired by two men at Camden-town—from the time I first spoke about it, which is nearly two months ago, it was about fifteen or sixteen months; it might have been more—Pierce was one of the men, and Agar was the other—it was in the evening part—they both came together; I was on the rank in High-street, Camden-town—they brought some bags with them, two, if not three; by the way they put them into the cab, they appeared to me to be heavy, because the cab rather sounded at the bottom—they got in, and desired me to drive St. Thomas's-street, in the Borough; I pulled up on the left hand side, at the bottom—I believe there is a way there to the arch of the railway terminus—Agar got out of the cab, and the other one remained—Agar went to the left, towards the arch—he was gone half an hour—when he returned I heard him say to Pierce, "It is not a going down to-night"—he then got into the cab—I drove them up to the top, on the near side, and I believe they had a glass of ale; one of them had, I know—they then ordered me to drive them to the Mother Shipton—they got out there—one got out first, and went into the public house, into the doorway—they took out the bags, and paid me my fare—when I was crossing the road I looked round, and saw them both going along Prince's-terrace, towards Crown-terrace; they had their bags with them—I did not take any notice of the way in which they were dressed—I had seen Pierce before, up and down Camden-town—I have seen Agar and Pierce both together, but not to know them, to have anything to do with them, before that time—I have seen them coming along together, and pass the rank in High-street, Camden-town, which is my usual place of standing, and has been for the last twenty years.</p>

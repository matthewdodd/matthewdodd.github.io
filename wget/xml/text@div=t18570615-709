                  </hi>. I am a house painter, living at No. 28, Gifford Street, Caledonian Road. I occupy the ground floor there—the prisoner occupied the whole of the second floor of that house—on the morning of 7th April, about half past 2 o'clock, I was awoke by some noise—I got out of bed, and unlocked the door—I was in the dark—when I unlocked the door I heard Mr. Scott's voice—he said, "Mr. Silence, come up stairs"—I partly dressed myself, and went up stairs, and saw Mr. Scott and the prisoner together—I had no light—there was no light up stairs when I got up—Mr. Tripp said, "Mr. Silence, can you get a light?"—I went down stairs, and got one—it was not more than two or three minutes before I came up again with a light, and I gave it to Mr. Tripp—they were on the stairs during that time, within a stair or so of the top of the landing—they were both on the stairs; not on the same step, but one above the other—Mr. Tripp was above—that was their position when I took the light up—they were both quite dressed—before I gave Mr. Tripp the light he unlocked the front door, on the second floor—it was his own door—I passed Mr. Scott on the stairs—Mr. Tripp was in the room when I gave him the light—I went into the room, and gave it to him—I had heard a noise before that, but I could not say what they said—it was a loud talking—I was in bed when I heard it—I did not hear any loud talking after that—it might have been quarrelling, or talking, I cannot say; I could not understand a word that was said—there were two flights of stairs between my room on the ground floor and the room in which Mr. Tripp lived—when I gave Mr. Tripp the light he lit his candle, and turned round and picked up the sword, and stabbed Mr. Scott—I cannot say whether the sword lay on the table or on a box; there were a lot of things lying about the room—I cannot exactly say where he took it from—it was lying about with other things—I believe this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the sword; it was one very much like that—I cannot say whether it had any sheath on it at the time he took it up—when he picked up the sword he stabbed Mr. Scott—he was in the room when he picked up the sword—Mr. Scott was standing just outside the door at that time—he was about two or three steps from Mr. Scott when he picked up the sword—I was between them—he had to pass me to get to Mr. Scott—he stabbed him in the left side, between the ribs and the hips—Mr. Scott was then standing still, in the attitude of reading a paper—it was a small bill; I cannot say what it was; I saw it afterwards—when he was stabbed he staggered back against the hand rail, and said, "I am stabbed"—the prisoner made another strike at him, which I warded off by holding my hand up—I assisted him down stairs, and when he was in the passage he asked me to take him to the doctor's; I did so—I left Tripp up stairs—I did not see him again after that till I saw him at the station house—I did not say anything to him at the station—I had no conversation with him at all—I never had any conversation with him since about the reason of Mr. Scott coming to the house—I have known him in that house for very nearly twelve months—he was in the habit of coming home at all hours of the night—Mr. Scott was the landlord of the house—he had a latch key, and could come in at all times.</p>

On 7th April, about 3 o'clock in the morning, in consequence of information that I received, I went to No. 28, Gifford Street, Caledonian Road—I went to the front room on the second floor—I knocked at that door—some person inside asked who was there—I replied, "Police"—he said, "Open the door; my door is not locked; come in"—I went into the room, and found the prisoner there alone—he was sitting in a chair, smoking a pipe of tobacco, by the side of the fireplace—there was a lighted candle in the room, but no fire—I noticed the sword standing upright against the wall, close by his side—it was sheathed as it is now—I asked him what disturbance had taken place between him and Mr. Scott—he told me that Mr. Scott was his landlord, and that he owed him some rent—he said that he came at a very unseasonable hour; that he told Mr. Scott if he would come again on Saturday he would pay him; that Scott said he would not wait till then—he said, "Mr. Scott tried to force his way into my room; I tried to push him out; he would not go out; I tried to per<lb></lb>suade him to go out, but he would not; I then stabbed him"—I asked him what he stabbed him with—he said, "With a cutlass; and I hope I have gave him his death wound; if it had not been for Mr. Silence, I would have cut his head off"—he asked me what I was going to do with him, if I was going to lock him up—I told him I merely came to speak to him; I told him I wanted him to go with me to see Mr. Scott—he said he would go—I said</p>

               <p>that to get him quietly out of the room—there was another officer standing on the landing—he did not come out of the room; he kept his seat; he asked me how Mr. Scott was, if he was hurt much—I told him I believed he was hurt very much—he asked me if he was dead—I told him, no, I believed he was not dead—he said, "I am sorry for that; I am sorry I have not given him his death wound"—he repeated that several times—he asked me several times if he was in my custody, and I would not satisfy him until I had secured the cutlass, and also this knife, which was lying on the table—I seized them, and then I told him he was in my custody, and must go to the station house—when I got to the station house I examined the cutlass; I found marks of blood on it; I went back to his lodgings, and found some marks of blood on the stairs, but none in the room—he was not drunk—I had seen him the night before, about half past 11 or 12 o'clock—he was standing at the corner of Gifford Street, Caledonian Road, talking to Mr. Scott; they were talking and jangling together—they were talking angrily; I did not hear any threats made use of—I did not hear anything that was said—I judged from their tone they were quarrelling about something—I left them there—it was on my beat—I returned there in course of my beat—the prisoner was then gone—I saw Mr. Scott again about 2 o'clock, in that street, by himself—he made an inquiry of me—I did not see Mr. Scott after that, till after this occurred, when I went to his residence.</p>

I did it"—I told him it was my duty to caution him that anything he might say would be noticed, and might be used in evidence against him—he made no reply to that—he afterwards said that, had it not been for a lodger inter<lb></lb>fering, he would have given him a right one and a left one, that there would be no occasion for our taking him to the hospital; that he was justified in doing it; that Mr. Scott had no right to come at that unseasonable hour for his rent—the witness Silence then came in to the station, when the prisoner turned towards him, and said, "If it had not been for your interference, I would soon have made a finish of him"—I then inquired as to the nature of</p>

On the morning of 1st April Scott was brought to my place between 3 o'clock and half past—I had known him slightly, living in the neighbourhood—I had him taken into my room, and removed his trowsers and belt; I then found a severe penetrating wound in the side, about an inch above the hip bone; it was bleeding somewhat freely—he complained of being sick and in great pain—I sent him home in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and followed him immediately—I had him put to bed, and then made a more perfect examination of the wound—I could not say positively at that time that it had penetrated the bowels, but from symptoms that came on shortly afterwards I suspected it must have done so—I saw him every hour during the day, perhaps oftener—he gradually became worse—he became delirious a very short time after I first saw him, and died about half past 1 o'clock on Wednesday morning, the 8th—I afterwards made a post <hi rend="italic">mortem</hi> examination—I found that the weapon had penetrated two portions of the small bowel, one lying next to the other—the sword had passed completely through one, and penetrated the one lying next it—such an instrument as this sword would cause such a wound—I have no doubt that wound was the cause of death.</p>

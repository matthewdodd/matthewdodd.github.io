                  </hi>. The deceased David Emmons was my husband—we lived at Stratford. On Wednesday evening, the 22nd of April, between six and seven o'clock, there was a quarrel between Lancaster and my husband—he gave my husband only one blow on the back of his head with his fist—after that my husband was dragged out of the house by the prisoner and Lancaster and Wilcox—I followed them out a few minutes after, and saw a scuffle outside between Lancaster and my husband—I did not see any blow given—he fell from their throwing one another down—Wilcox picked him up—Wilcox and my husband then scuffled, and both fell down—I only saw him fall twice—I did not see anything done to him by anybody, while he was on the ground, but he received the wound while he was down—I saw his face bleeding very much—I heard Wilcox say, "D—n your eyes, keep off the man, or you will kill him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at Marsh-gate, Stratford. On the 22nd of April, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I heard a "scream from a house in Marsh Gate-lane—I went to see what it was, and saw two men lying on the ground, one upon the other—the deceased was uppermost—Wilcox was underneath—the prisoner was standing up—I saw him kick the uppermost man on the nose, hard—the <hi rend="italic">blood</hi> flowed immedi<lb></lb>ately—he rolled off the man he was upon, and that man got up and picked him up—I took hold of the deceased's hand and said he had better come away, but he pulled away from me and made towards Lancaster, who was coming towards him, and they had two scuffles after he had received the kick—I did not see any blows struck—they were only struggling together—he fell down again, and after that I persuaded him to come away with me—he came to the ditch and washed his face—there was a great cut where the blow had been, and blood coming from him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was not he struggling and fighting with Lancaster and Wilcox when you came up? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I did not see struggling—I saw him on the other man on the ground, outside at the back part of the house where the yard is—I did not see the prisoner do anything to him but kick him—I did not hear him call out to him—his wife was there after he received the kick—she was calling out to him—she was outside in the yard screaming when I came up—she asked me to get her husband away—his nose was sore across the bridge—it looked like a great piece knocked off—I lent him a handkerchief to wash it.</p>

                  </hi>. I saw the deceased on the 23rd—there was blood flowing from his nose at that time down his face—I saw the prisoner about a month before that—he had been speaking to me about the deceased—he said he (the prisoner) was going to be removed from one length of work to the other, and that it was Emmons's doing, and he said his garden-ground was down one way, and it was done for that, that he should be removed away from it—he said he was a hog of a fellow, but if he could not get him out by fair means he would get him out by foul.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer on the Eastern Counties Railway—on the 22nd of April, in the evening, I was at my lodging—the deceased came into my room, he inquired something concerning a sixpence, and asked for George Evans—Evans came into the room while he was inquiring for him—the prisoner and Wilcox and deceased were there—a quarrel took place, in consequence of my taking Evans' part—he attempted to hit Evans—I took Evans' part, and then a quarrel took place between the deceased and me—we had a scuffle together in the room—I struck the deceased—the pri<lb></lb>soner took him under his arms to clear his house, and with our assistance we put him out at the door—we all got into a small court—the prisoner came and scuffled with me again, threw me down, and fell on me—they pulled him off me, and I got up as soon as I could—Wilcox tried to pull him away from me, and being a powerful man, they both fell down together—Wilcox was under<lb></lb>neath, and the deceased upon him—I did not see the prisoner do anything then—I do not know how the deceased got up, but he got up as quick as he</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. On the night of the 22nd of April the deceased came to my house—he had a contused wound on the bridge of the nose—the bone was not observable—the skin was completely cut through—the wound might have been inflicted by a kick—it was a fresh wound—he had no other wound or bruise that I saw—it did not appear to me to be important—he called occasionally, and had his nose dressed by my assistant—the next time I saw him was on the Thursday—I found him labour<lb></lb>ing under symptoms of tetanus—I tried everything, but he died on the Friday—my opinion is, that tetanus arose from the wound—a wound of that nature might occasion such a result—a contusion might produce lock-jaw, but wounds are more liable to do so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I believe tetanus is commonly called lock-jaw; that proceeds from many other causes than wounds? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—a violent cold producing inflammation of the bowels, might occasion it—worms will occasion it—if a person received a kick in the body irritation of the bowels might follow that, and tetanus from the inflammation—it is possible that a strain in carrying a heavy weight might occasion such irritation, as might terminate in lock-jaw, but it is not probable—I would not undertake to swear in this case that the locked-jaw was the result of the wound on the nose—it would be the probable result.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Could you trace any connexion between the tetanus and the wound? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The first symptoms of tetanus came on about the time that it is usual for tetanus to appear after a wound—there had been no inflammation of the bowels—I examined the body after death—the stomach was inflamed—I have no doubt that followed from the tetanus—there was no symptom of inflammation of the stomach that I am aware of previous to the tetanus—I had not seen him for a fortnight—there was nothing in the state of the body to which I could refer the tetanus, except the wound—in cases of tetanus we are generally able to ascertain from what it has arisen—I should find on examining the body some cause to which to refer it—there was in this case no cause to which I could refer it, except the wound—a concussion of the brain might occasion inflammation, and inflammation might produce tetanus—there was a slight inflammation of the membrane of the brain—that was the cones<lb></lb>quence of the tetanus—I believe the wound to be the cause of tetanus, but admit that inflammation of the brain would produce tetanus.</p>

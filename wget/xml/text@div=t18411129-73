                  </hi>. I live in Oval-road, Park-street, Camden-town, and am a builder. The prisoner was in my employ a month or five weeks at a house I am building—he is a carpenter—I had information that he had robbed me—I watched him, and on the 1st of November, about half-past eleven o'clock, I saw the prisoner's boy, who was at work with him, loaded with this wood—I went after him, took him back, and sent for his father, who said it was his first offence—he had never done so before—the boy is about twelve years old—the prisoner was then at work in my build<lb></lb>ing—the boy was going from the building, and I detected him when he had got a few yards from it with these fourteen pieces of wood—I had seen the boy and the prisoner together in the building at work—when I sent for the father, I asked him how he could send the boy away loaded with wood, and be robbing me continually as he had done for the last month—he said this was the first time he had done so—this is the wood that the boy took that day, and it is mine.</p>

If I understand you rightly, you said that the prisoner said, "This is the first time I have done so?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, that is the form of expression he used, as near as I can remember—He might say "This is the first offence."</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Whether the answer was "This is the first time I have done so," or "This is the first offence," are you sure that was the answer to what you said, "Why did you send the boy with the wood?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes as near as I can recollect; and then he afterwards wrote me a letter, which I have here—I am sure this is his handwriting—I received it on the even<lb></lb>ing</p>

               <p>of the 1st of November, after I had charged him with this—he was not taken till the following morning.</p>

I gave it to the prisoner some days before—I have matched these pieces together—it was not cut up as it is now—it was two long pieces, twenty-one feet long, when it was given him, and these pieces all matched when they were put together—I have no private mark on it, only the width of the wood—I can swear to it—we do not usually mark wood.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he say anything, and point to any wood? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—on the following morning he said, "I admit of taking them," pointing to these fourteen pieces, which were then on the table.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it on the Monday that the wood was taken from the boy? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That I am not able to say, only from what I heard Mr. Crutchley say—I do not know where the prisoner was on Monday night—I apprehended him at the corner of Brewer-street, Somer's-town—he was at liberty from Monday night till Tuesday, for anything I know—he was at liberty when I appre<lb></lb>hended him—I have no reason to suppose that from Monday till Tuesday he was in custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you told us all he said when he pointed to the wood, or what further passed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am sure I cannot tell—I heard him say, pointing to the fourteen pieces, as they laid on the table, "I admit taking them"—they were then in Mr. Crutchley's back room—I cannot say exactly what he said.</p>

                  </hi>. I was formerly a seaman, and live at No. 1, Windsor-terrace. On 25th July, about 20 minutes past 8 o'clock in the evening, I was walking with a young woman in Ratcliff-highway—as we passed the Cock and Neptune public house, the prisoner came up on my left side, and struck me on the back part of my head with a piece of sharp-pointed wood—it did not knock me down, I just staggered—I was going to lay hold of him, and he put his right arm round my waist and pinned my hands to my side—he then made a grab at my gold watch-chain—he broke off two of my waistcoat buttons, and broke the chain, but the policeman and others came up, and be made off, and went into the Cock and Neptune—I bled very much from the blow I received—I was quite insensible after the prisoner was given in charge.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman</hi>). The prisoner was given into my custody by the prosecutor—he was stunned and partly insensible at the time; his head was bleeding very much—the prisoner came out of the Cock and Neptune as I was speaking to the prosecutor, and he directly pointed him out, and said, "That is the man"—I told him he was charged with stabbing that man—I thought at the time that be had been stabbed, from his bleeding so—he said, "I did not do it; I was in the public-house, and when I came out I saw his head bleeding"—I have done my best to find Wilson, but have not been able to do so—I did not see any other black man but the prisoner about there—the Cock and Neptune is a house that is frequented by a great many black men.</p>

No, I was tipsy, but not insensible - I fell asleep in a very few minutes after I got to bed; I cannot tell what I paid at the last public-house I had been at - there were two or three of us in company; we had two or three glasses of gin-and-water - I paid about 1s.; I put my trousers under my pillow, and left my clothes on a chair - Robinson did not get to bed till after the money was stolen; I do not know what house it was - I had not put my money among the chips; I had not been into the yard at all, till the morning - I had left my watch on board my ship, and forgotten it; I had given Robinson about 2s.; I should know a sovereign from a shilling in the dark, by the weight of it; I had not had the sovereigns in the same pocket with the silver.</p>

I took Hutchins between seven and eight o'clock in the morning on the 29th of March; I found a 6d. in her pocket and 4s. 6d. in a trunk in the house - she denied its being any part of the money that was stolen, and said it was her own; I took her to the station, and then to the office; before she was examined she said she would tell the truth; thatafter Robinson took the money from Taylor she came into her room, and they both went out, and hid it among the chips - that Robinson had changed one sovereign, and she had returned the man 4l. 12s. of his money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did she not talk of a daughter of Robinson's, who had shown her where the money was? A. No; there was no one present when she said this.</p>

            . I apprehended Robinson on the 29th of March, about three o'clock, about two hundred yards from the house; the prosecutor charged her with robbing him of five sovereigns; I went to the house and found Hutchins there, but could not find any money - Robinson wanted to make an arrangement to give the prosecutor 3l. or 4l. in the morning - she said she would get a friend to lend her the money.</p>
               <p>Robinson. When the prosecutor met me he said all the money he had was three sixpences and some copper.</p>
               <p>JOHN TAYLOR. I said I had about 2s. in silver; I cannot exactly say whether I had 2s. or 1s. 6d.</p>
               <p>Robinson. He told me, previous to going before the Magistrate, that if I would make him up half the money he would not prosecute, and it was under that impression that I said the money should be made up.</p>

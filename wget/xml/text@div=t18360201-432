I was in Rosemary-lane on Friday the 15th of January, at the Hampshire Hog, public-house—the prisoner said he would mind my horse and cab while I went into the house—I had a coat on the horse—I left him in charge—I came out in about five minutes and missed my cot, an he was gone—I am sure the coat was in the cab when I left it.</p>

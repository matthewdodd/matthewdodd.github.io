The Prisoner was a Customer, and she came on the 6th of September about Noon, under pretence of paying a small Matter that she owed me. She came boldly thro' the Shop into a little back Parlour, and the Spoon lying upon the Table, I put it into a little Cupboard in her Presence. My Husband and I were both in the Room, but while our Backs were turn'd to the Cupboard, she whipp'd the Spoon out. I heard the China rattle, so I went to look for the Spoon, - and 'twas gone. I charg'd her with taking it; she denyed it; so I got a Constable and carry'd her before Mr. De Veil, where it was found upon a Couch that she was sitting upon. Mr. De Veil had order'd her into a Room, to be stripp'd and searched, so she sat herself down and slipp'd the Spoon between her and the Couch, then she got up and call'd me a vile Jade, for says she, you have brought the Spoon with you and have put it here your self.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you search her before?</p>
               <p>Chapman. She would not be searched without a Constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your Oath, - did you put it under her?</p>
               <p>Chapman. Upon my Oath I did not.</p>
               <p>Mrs Victor. When the Prisoner was brought before my Master, she deny'd the Fact; the People were positive she must have taken it, so I was ordered to take her into a back Parlour and search her; while I was putting a Blind before the Window, she sat herself down on a Couch, and I saw her take something out and put it under her; we look'd under her and found the Spoon.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I don't know what to say to it, I am sure I never touch'd it; indeed I was very much fuddl'd, but I don't know that I meddl'd with it.</p>
               <p>C. This Gin is made a common Excuse for Felony.</p>
               <p>The Constable confirm'd what the former Witness had said.</p>
               <p>A Witness, (the Prisoner's Father.) The Prisoner several Times has behav'd as if she was Lunatick, and that very Morning the Fact was committed, I believe she was drunk. <rs id="t17370907-59-verdict306" type="verdictDescription">

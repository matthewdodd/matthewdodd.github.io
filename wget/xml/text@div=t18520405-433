On 22nd March I was in bed asleep—I was awoke by the last witness screaming "Murder! rise up and save me, for he has got a knife"—I did not see a knife—I took up her linen and saw a great deal of blood flowing from her—I saw a wound which gaped open—I only saw one wound—when I awoke, the prisoner was stand<lb></lb>ing up—Sweeney had run out of the room and left him behind—I did not see him go to the window; it was shut—I did not leave the room—I did not see him do anything to the window, but I was blind with fright and with the blood.</p>

                  </hi>. I belong to the London Hospital. Mr. Bell, the surgeon, is unwell and cannot come—I am one of the dressers—I examined Sweeney on 22nd March, and found two punctured wounds, one below the last rib on the right side, two inches deep, from which upwards of half a pint of blood came; and another on the right side of the abdomen, two inches and a half long—if the instrument had gone in a vertical direction it would have punctured the abdominal cavity, and death must have ensued—an artery was cut—it was arterial blood which was flowing—this knife would produce both these wounds—they were rather wider than this knife—it must have gone is the full length of the blade.</p>

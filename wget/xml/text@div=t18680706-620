                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Henry Shepherd, and live at 2, Morris Road, Bromley—the prisoner is my sister—on 25th June, she was living in the house with me—between 6 and 7 in the evening we were quarrelling on the staircase—she was in liquor; I was sober—I threw a poker at her first, down the stairs, which did not improve her temper—I am a very bad temper myself—my husband came out, and tried</p>

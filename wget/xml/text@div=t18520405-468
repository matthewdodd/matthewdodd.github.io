                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, G</hi> 212). On 10th March, I went to 25, Martin-street, Blackfriars, to endeavour to apprehend Fowler. Neale, another officer, knocked at the door—it was opened by Fowler—I told him I wanted to take him into custody (it was on another charge)—there are only two rooms in the house, one on the ground-floor and one above—I sent the other officers up-stairs—I followed with Fowler, and when I got up, I found the other two prisoners there, and a boy in bed—the female requested to be allowed to go down stairs, as she was taken very ill, and wanted to go to the closet—I said I could not allow any person to leave the room—I thought she was endeavouring to conceal something, I told Evans to see what she had in her hand, and something fell from her, containing a quantity of base coin, which Evans picked up—she had got out of bed, and it fell from under her clothes, where she held her hand—the man White was putting his jacket on the bed; some copper money fell, and he said, "Do not meddle with that; that is good money; you have got enough bad"—Fowler asked to be allowed to put his coat on, and it was picked up off</p>

               <p>a chair in that room; and he also asked the boy to give him his cap; and the boy picked that up in the room—I told Fowler what I wanted him for, and he said, "Oh, no; I know better than that;" and the woman said that he was there all the last night—at the station I told Fowler the other charge, and he said, "That is right enough"—the down stairs room was dirty and filthy, apparently not occupied by any one, there was no furniture—it was about eight o'clock in the morning.</p>

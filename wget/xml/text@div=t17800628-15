On the 7th of June, between six and seven o'clock, a great mob surrounded my house, some with swords and some with bludgeons. They came into the tap-room and had what liquor they wanted. They examined my books and were going off satisfied.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner among the mob? - Not at that time. After giving three huzza's in the house they went down the street some way. One Clark and his wife called the mob back, and said I was a Papist, and they must down with my house. The mob returned immediately, and began pulling down the house.</p>
               <p>When did you see the prisoner? - About half an hour after they began he was in the bar, drawing the liquor and drinking it.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen the prisoner before? - Yes; he had been several times at my house; I am positive he is the man.</p>
               <p>Did you see him do any thing else? - I saw him break part of the bar down.</p>
               <p>What was the rest of the mob doing? - Pulling down the house and drinking the liquor.</p>
               <p>Court. Whether the mob were pulling down the house during that hour in which you say the prisoner was in it? - Yes, they were.</p>
               <p>Be particular in describing what they did to the house, the wainscoting, and window frames? - They had iron crows beating them down.</p>
               <p>Had the prisoner any thing in his hand?</p>
               <p>No, to my knowledge he had nothing in his hand.</p>
               <p>What did they cut down? - The sashes in the front of the house; the prisoner did not.</p>
               <p>Did you see the prisoner do any thing more? - Nothing, only pull part of the bar down, and drink part of the liquor. He was in several parts of the house; he went all over the house. The mob were pulling the tiles off and throwing them down. I did not see the prisoner at the time they were throwing them down. I saw him at different times.</p>
               <p>What situation was the house in before they came? - Quite in repair.</p>
               <p>How was it when they went away? - The front of it was quite pulled down. It was lath and plaister.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>You are a publican? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who is your distiller? - Mr. Child.</p>
               <p>Did not he come that evening to assist you? - Not that I saw. I heard afterwards he was there.</p>
               <p>Did you know the prisoner before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What is his character? - A very honest man; I never heard any thing against him before this.</p>
               <p>Where was you? - In the street, facing the door; there was a great mob up in the house.</p>
               <p>Was you in the street when you saw him in the bar? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you see the prisoner in the bar? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You did not see him in any other part of the house? - Yes. I saw him in the one pair of stairs, the two pair of stairs, and at the top of the house.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How near to him was you when you saw him pull down your bar? - Only across the street; the bar is opposite the door.</p>
               <p>Did you say any thing to him? - Not a word.</p>
               <p>As you knew the man why did not you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178006280050"></xptr> speak to him? - There was such a mob I was afraid of having my brains knocked out.</p>

               <p>Did you observe him in any other part of the house? - No.</p>

               <p>You have no doubt but that is the man you saw in the house? - No, none at all; he was only making use of his hands, pulling down part of the bar.</p>
               <p>Jury. What part of the house was you in when you saw the prisoner pulling down part of the bar, or was you outside of the house? - I was on the otherside in the street; part of the bar is opposite the door.</p>
               <p>Could you see it distinctly? - Yes; the door was open and the window broke, so that the front of the house was all open.</p>

               <p>Was you on the 7th of June in Golden-lane? - I was in the house of Mr. Murphy when the mob came in.</p>
               <p>Give an account of the manner in which the mob came in, and what they proceeded to do, and what you observed done by Chambers? - Chambers was not there, I think, till a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes after the mob came in. I had a pint of beer in my hand when the mob came in and enquire d for Mr. Murphy's books; when they had examined the books, I believe they went up stairs and examined them, they went away, and soon after returned again.</p>
               <p>When did you first see Chambers? - About half after six, that was after the mob returned the second time.</p>
               <p>In what part of the house did you see Chambers, and what did he do? - The first time I observed him, I saw him pulling down a part of the bar opposite the door; I saw him pulling down part of the window frames belonging to the tap room.</p>
               <p>Did you observe him go into any other part of the house? - No.</p>
               <p>Was Chamber's person known to you before? - Yes; we worked for one master four or five months together.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was Chambers inside or outside of the house when he pulled down the window frame? - Inside; he came from pulling the bar down to break the window frame.</p>

I first applied, I should have told you, to one or two of the mob; and begged they would let me have my things out of the house. They said yes. I gave them seven or eight shillings out of my pocket. I went to Mr. Dickenson's and desired to have some of his men to help to get these things out; three or four of them came; there were two half-hogsheads of liquor upon the scaffold above the bar; the pipes came through and down to the bar; Mr. Dickenson's men came, and they were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178006280051"></xptr> throwed off the scaffold, and Mr. Dickenson's men carried them away.</p>

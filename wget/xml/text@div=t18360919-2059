                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker, and live in Brewer-street, St. Pancras. I produce a table which was pawned for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. by the prisoner, on the 24th of August—he said he had bought it at a sale for 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I did not exactly examine the table, but told my assistant to examine it—I think he asked 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on it—I advanced him, 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., it was much damaged—the leg was broken when he first brought it, and it was</p>

               <p>damaged here—he pawned it in the regular way—he did not say he should call again of it—I knew to live in the neighbourhood, and have done business with his friends also.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What state was he in? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I considered he had drank—we I advanced the money, he said. "Will you take some wine?"—I said, I had rather not; he said, "I insist on your taking some wine:" and I left the shop with an idea he would also leave it—when I returned, I found him there with a bottle of wine, the cork drawn, the glasses there, and he was helping a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>-man to a glass—I pointed out the impropriety or spending his money in so foolish a manner—I refused to take the wine—a lady who was there said, "Pray, do take the wine, to get rid of him"and I took some—not quite a glass—I did it in order to get rid of him—the lady took a glass, and the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>-man also—he bore an honest character when I knew him—I belive he was a grocer—this was about three or four o'clock in the afternoon—my shop is about two miles from Lower Grosvenor-street—I believe he brought the table in a <hi rend="italic">cab.</hi>

                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker and live in Upper George-street, Bryanston-square. I have a rosewood stand—the prisoner came to my shop about three o'clock in the afternoon of the 24th of August, in a very great passion, and said he had been to a gentleman in Portman-square, and the gentleman wanted to got it out of him without paying for it—he said he did not want to carry it to Vauxhall, and I might lend him what I liked on it, as it would be better than taking it home, and the interest would only be 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—I lent him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he pawned it in the name of Bennett—he was quite sober.</p>

Q.</hi> Are you quite sure of the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I did express a doubt about him at one time, I dressed differently at the, police-office—when he pawned the table he was like a working man, with an apron round him—my house is about half a mile form Lower Gros<lb></lb>venor-street.</p>

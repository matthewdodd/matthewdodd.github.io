Mr. Pearson swore, That as he was going from St. John's street to Islington, between 10 and 11 a clock at night, where he lived, the two Prisoners met him on the highway <note>[Text unreadable in original.]</note> ber last, and presented Pistols  gag'd him, and then stript him naked, taking away his Hat, value 12 s. a Wastecoat 8 s. a pair of Breeches 10 s. his Shoes, Shirt, Crevat, besides 4 s. 2 d. in money. On the next morning Mr. Elliot going up Holbourn, near Rose-Alley he met Elliot with his Shoes on his Feet, whereupon he seiz'd him, and afterwards took Leonard and the woman, viz. Bullen, at the Sign of the Leper in Picadilly. The Evidence against the Woman was, That she sold the Coat to a Broker, which she owned. An Inkhorn was found in Elliot's Pocket, which was Mr. Pearsons. And Pearsons Hat was found upon Leonard, and the Hathand was taken out of his Pocket, which Pearson swore was his; and likewise was positive that they were the men that robbed him. Leonard denied the Fact, and that he accidentally went to drink with the woman when the Constable came to apprehend him. Elliot alledg'd that it was very strange, that Pearson should know their Faces in the dark, and that he was never guilty of any such matter, and called one Mr. Keat to prove that he was in his Quarters the same night, but he could not. Others gave a fair Character of his former Behaviour; and as to the Pistols Elliot said he had them to clean, but could prove nothing. So Pearson's Evidence, together with other strenuous Circumstances, gave the Gentlemen of the Jury such satisfaction, that they found the men both <rs id="t16941010-8-verdict37" type="verdictDescription">

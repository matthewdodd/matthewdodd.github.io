             worked for me many years, I have often seen the prisoner in my yard along with him, perhaps two or three times a week. I having lost many things, had a suspicion of Triplet. I missed one barrel of pitch in particular, in September or October last, and some bolts of reeds, from out of my yard. I went over to the prisoner's house on the other side of the water, and there I found my barrel of pitch concealed, and some bolts of reeds. I took up Triplet on the 15th of November last, being the day after I found them; Aaron said the pitch was brought there by Triplet between twelve and one at night, and if it was mine I was welcome to have it; he produced a receipt, and said he paid for it, and said he himself wrote the body of it, and Triplet put his name to it, (producing one) this is it.</p>
               <p>It is read, to this purport.</p>
               <p>Received, September 17, 1760, of

               <p>Alloway. Triplet told me he paid but 10 s. 6 d. for the whole.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the neat weight of the pitch on the receipt?</p>
               <p>Alloway. It is 259 pounds; it cost me half a guinea a hundred-weight; 259 pounds was worth to me at that time 35 s. Triplet was tried and cast at the sessions in Surry for stealing it.</p>
               <p>Q. How came Triplet to be ordered to be whipp'd, when the copy of the record mentions his being guilty of the indictment. The judgment of the court shews it to be but a petty larceny, that is, under a shilling value.</p>
               <p>Hall. That I cannot account for, this is a true copy, there is not any value mentioned, only the word guilty.</p>

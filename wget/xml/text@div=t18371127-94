                  </hi>. I am a coal porter. On the 12th of November, I was going along Chiswell-street, at a quarter to ten o'clock at night—the two prisoner's followed me, seized me by the body, and held my arms down—Williams went behind me, and closed her arms round me to con<lb></lb>fine my arms to my body, and Jones seized me by the arms and pushed me into a court—I have not a doubt of the prisoners being the persons—Jones came before me and seized me by the hands, and Williams put her hand into my pocket and took out a half-sovereign, four half-crowns, a shilling, and a sixpence—it was in my right-hand trowsers pocket—she handed it over to Jones, who ran down the court with it, and dropped a half-crown which I immediately put my foot on—I called the policeman and seized Williams—I picked up the half-crown and gave it to the con<lb></lb>stable, after marking it.</p>

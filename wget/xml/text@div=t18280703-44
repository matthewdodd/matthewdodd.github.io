On the 30th of June, about seven o'clock in the evening, I was standing at the back door of my garden, and saw four children coming towards me, two in a little child's cart, and two drawing it - the deceased was in the cart; when they came up to me the other one got out of the cart, and the three then drew the cart on - they passed me, and in less than a minute I heard a cart coming towards me; I called to the children to draw close to my pailing, but in their fright they ran back screaming, and in half a minute I heard the child's cart crush, and the <rs id="t18280703-44-viclabel231" type="occupation">child</rs>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you observe that the prisoner's seat at that moment gave way, and threw him back? A. I could not see - it might have happened; whether he saw the child's cart I cannot say.</p>

            . I live in this lane. I saw the cart going along, with the prisoner in it, before the accident; he was driving faster than he ought - he was about one hundred and fifty yards from Mr. Evans' garden; I saw him fall back off the seat of his cart - I ran, and thought he would be thrown out of his cart; but before I could get up, he was out of my sight - the lane is nine feet ten inches wide where the accident happened.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When he fell, did he appear to lose the command of his horse? A. I cannot say, for I lost sight of him; I saw him hit his horse just before.</p>

            . I am a professor of languages at Harrow-school. I was walking out on the evening in question, and saw a cart passing very rapidly, and immediately afterwards, I saw the deceased child brought up in Buckingham's arms; it was done instantaneously - I did not hear anybody in the cart call out, and cannot recognize the prisoner as the driver; nor did I see the seat to ascertain whether it was broken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You did not see his cart come against the child's cart? A. No; it is low, and might easily escape the observation of the driver.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is the lane narrow at this spot? A. The street is narrow all the way through; I think there is scarcely room for two carriages to pass.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. As such, a person would be anxious to get out of the street as soon as he could? A. It was nearly at the end of the street.</p>

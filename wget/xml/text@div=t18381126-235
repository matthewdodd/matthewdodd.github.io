                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Samuel Carpenter, a boot and shoemaker, in London-street, Greenwich. I was in the parlour on the 26th of October—I turned and saw Brown in the shop—I asked him what he wanted—he said he had done mischief, he had strewed some papers on the floor—he asked if I wanted any pattens or clogs—I said, no—as soon as he had left, I missed a pair of shoes—I went to the end of the street, and brought him back—I asked him if he knew any thing of the shoes—he said no, but that he saw a lad leave the shop with a bag on his back—I asked if he should know the lad—he said, yes—I took him to several places about the town, but could not find the lad—I let him go, but still followed him, and saw him go to the other prisoner—they went across the Creek bridge—each of them was carrying a bag—they saw me, and dropped their bags—I caught Brown and took him to Dept<lb></lb>ford—Burt's bag contained three pairs of shoes, one of which belonged to me—Burt was taken afterwards.</p>

                  </hi>. I am master of Whitechapel workhouse. The prisoner was gate-keeper—he was appointed by the guardians of the Union—he had a lodge to live in—he was boarded, and had a salary—it was part of his duty to receive the bread which came for the use of the in-door and out-door poor—he was to weigh it, and receive it on account of the guardians—the contractor sends two tickets with the supply of bread—one of them the carman takes back, and the other I file—the prisoner's duty was to receive both the tickets, and if on weighing the bread he found a deficiency he indorsed it on the tickets, and gave one to me, and sent the other back to the contractor—I produce the tickets which I received of the prisoner on the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th of December, and they have no indorsement of any deficiency on either of them—the next delivery of</p>

               <p>bread was on Monday, the 7th of December—he did not on that day ac<lb></lb>count to me for any bread received to make up any deficiency.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Was it customary for me to indorse the short weight on the tickets? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was your duty, you have done it on tickets before—I kept the tickets till the Saturday, and they were then posted in my book, and the tickets destroyed, except those of the last two weeks—you had 1 1/2lb. weight of bread a day, but that had nothing to do with the tickets or the indorsement—that would be charged in the provision-book—it was allowed for your own consumption, not for you to dispose of.</p>

                  </hi>. I superintend my cousin's business, who contracts to supply the workhouse with bread—he supplies 41bs., 21bs., and 1 1/2lbs. loaves—we send the bread in daily, and if there is short weight, it is entered on one of the tickets, which is returned to us—I have the tickets which were returned on the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th of December, they are all indorsed as deficient, and the whole deficiency is 491bs.—I received this note on the Saturday—<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>—"Deficiency 491bs., and the two last weeks 5lbs., making 541bs. Please to send the amount of short bread in 41bs. loaves. <hi rend="smallCaps">WILLIAM COLLARD</hi>."—I rather disputed about the 5lbs., but I admitted the 491bs., and on Monday, the 7th of December, I sent twelve 4lbs. loaves for it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am carman to Mr. Kingsford. It was my duty to take the bread to the workhouse in a van—it was there weighed by the prisoner—I remember his indorsing the tickets, on the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th of December, and on the 7th I took twelve 41b. loaves to make up the deficiency—I took them to the workhouse, and delivered them to the pri<lb></lb>soner—I told him they were to make up the weight of the week before, and he took them into his lodge—the remainder of the bread was put away in the usual manner—that for the house as sent into the kitchen, and that for the out-door poor to the committee-room—I had seen the bread weighed the week before, and was satisfied there was a deficiency of 491bs.</p>

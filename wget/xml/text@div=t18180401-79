I rent a house there. and live in it by myself. On the 30th of March, at six o'clock in the evening, I fastened all my doors and windows, and went out-my property was all safe then, it was dark, between seven and eight o'clock. I returned at ten o'clock, and found my house broken open - A pane of glass had been taken out of the window, by which means they unfastened the sash - They got up by a ladder. As soon as I got into my room I fell over a stick. I turned my head to the window and found my house was broken open. I then ran up stairs with the candle, and found my sheets and blankets taken off the bed, my great-coat gone, and my pocketbook taken from off the tester of the bed. I lost the articles stated in the indictment, which were worth 37l, together. There was one 10l. two 5l. and fifteen 1l. notes in my pocket-book, which I had concealed at the top of my bed at six o'clock that night, for security. I saw all the property safe that night at six o'clock-but I saw none of it after. I suspected the prisoner, as he had been in the habit of calling on me. I got the headborough and constable and we all went in search of him-there were four of us; we were looking for him all night - We knew he lived at Wilsden. We went to Sandford and there separated. I and the constable went to Isleworth-the other two brought the prisoner and his wife to me; he said he had taken a house at Hanwell Common, and had the key in his pocket. When he saw me he denied having any house there at all. We took the key from him and went to look for an uninhabited house - We found a small house, and the key fitted the door - We took him with us. As soon as we got in we found my pillow-case, two blankets, a cap, and a pillow there. The people said he had taken the house on the Friday before. The constable found one of my braces in his hat. I never found any more of the property.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BALL. I live at Ickenham. Weeden came to me, and said his house had been broken open - We went in search of the prisoner. The prosecutor and constable went one way, and the other two went another way. I went to the house that the key fitted, with the prisoner. We tried the key to one house, which it would not open. As soon as we entered the house that the key fitted we found the property. As we were taking him to prison he said he had pledged the coat. He was apprehended the morning after the robbery, about ten o'clock.</p>

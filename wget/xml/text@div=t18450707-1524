                  </hi>. I keep the Black Dog in Crown-street, Finsbury. The prisoner had been in my service about three months, and lived in my house—on Saturday night, the 5th of July, I gauged my spirit casks, and took notice of my cheroots in the bar—on Sunday after<lb></lb>noon, the 6th, I missed a quantity of the cheroots, in consequence of which I gauged my spirit casks, and observed the decrease of the spirit! wai greater than the money I had taken would allow for—I observed that more particularly in the rum, but there was a decrease in brandy as well—we had been drawing from each—on the Monday morning, the 7th, I spoke to the police—the prisoner had permission to go out for a holiday, and she left my house about half-past nine o'clock, but a short time before she left she brought a box into the parlour, gave it into my hands, and asked me if I had a key that would fit it—she stated that her mistress gave it her, she had had it papered, and the man had sent back a rusty key—she had not been able to turn the lock, and wished to take a few things away with her, as she was going out—I told her I had not a key, and she had better leave it till she came home in the evening, and then take it to the man—she said she would take it with her, as one going out would do—I followed her out—the officer took her, and brought her back with the box—she was searched in my presence—I saw her shuffling about, and something fell from her, which proved to be cigars and tobacco—a bottle of brandy was found in her pocket—the box was opened, and in it was a quart bottle of rum, a bottle of ginger beer, a silk handkerchief, and a pen<lb></lb>knife belonging to myself—this is the handkerchief and knife—she said I had got all my property back—she begged for mercy, and said she had not taken any money from me.</p>

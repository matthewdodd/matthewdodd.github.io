I am a carpenter, of 36, Richard Street, St George's—last Saturday night, at 6.30, I was in Lower Chapman Street—the prisoner came up to me and got hold of this arm, another man got hold of my other arm, and a third put his hand under my coat, into my pocket, and took my puree, containing three half-sovereigns, a three-penny piece, and three or four sixpences—the prisoner held me till the other two turned the corner of Richard Street, and then he let me go, and, being an old man, I could not run after him—I am positive it was the prisoner; I got a good sight of his</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 5, Tambor Lane Place, Whitechapel—last Saturday I saw the prisoner first at 12.30 in the day, and was in his com<lb></lb>pany up to 6.55—we went into a public house, in Duke Street, North Street, Whitechapel, at 6.15, and remained there I dare say ten minutes—from there we went to the Golden Lion, Raven Street, Whitechapel, where we stopped two hours, and I dare say I might have left the prisoner about 9.15.</p>

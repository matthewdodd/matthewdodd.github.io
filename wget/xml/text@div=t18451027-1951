               <p>eight o'clock, and saw the prisoner there, intoxicated—his wife was with him—I met him at the door of the beer-shop—as he went along, he put his hand to his pocket, and said, "I will cut his b——throat"—his wife endeavoured to keep him away, but he got from her—the beer-shop is between Barrett's wharf and the prisoner's—I afterwards saw the pri<lb></lb>soner being led away by two men.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wharfinger, and live on Uxbridge Moor—I have been there better than two years—the prisoner lives near me, and is a wharfinger. On the 6th of Sept. he was on the bridge adjoining the wharf—he said, <hi rend="italic">"Nobby</hi> Barrett, I will do for you some of these days"—he used a good deal of low language—I had had no quarrel with him, nor from that time till the 7th of Oct., on which evening I was on my premises, which is a wharf and yard, and from seven to eight o'clock I heard the words, <hi rend="italic">"Nobby</hi> Barrett, I have got a knife and carpet"—he then said, "You rob me daily and hourly"—I went up to where he was—it was the prisoner—he had just got hold of my fence—I went up to ask him what the meaning was—he said, "You b----r, I will cut your b——throat"—I immediately received a severe blow on my face and nose—it appeared to be a cut—I bled wonderfully from my nose and mouth all the way down—I fell down from the blow—I cannot say what he struck me with, but he had something in his hand—I called for the police—nobody came—I went to Mr. Muggeridge, who dressed my wound.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What countryman are you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> An Uxbridge man—they call me <hi rend="italic">Nobby</hi> a great deal—I never had any transaction with a carpet, which they laugh at me about—I never heard that they said I had put a carpet round my neck and pretended to hang myself—they have said such a thing—I know nothing about the prisoner being drunk, but he held my fence—I do not know whether he was drunk or sober—I did not say that he was drunk or sober—there is an elder tree by the fence where he held—the top is not broken off and jagged—there is no broken branch that I know of—I never took notice—I stood about a foot from the tree—I did not try to take hold of his collar, nor he of mine, before I received the blow—I know West, Holt, Shirley, and Butler—I did not see them—Mrs. Slade was in my yard, and picked me up—there is no branch of the elder tree which comes about the height of my nose—there is no branch that touched my head of nose—it was a clean cut I am sure—I felt</p>

               <p>it was cut—I lost a great deal of blood—my little boy is not here—I would not let him come—I did not hear my wife say, "Why, he must have cut you, he must have had a knife," nor my boy say, "No, mother, he had nothing in his hand"—I do not know what was said—I went after the police—I was sober—I did not take my child before the Magistrate—he is ten years old—I do not recollect being asked about the boy before the Magistrate.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> The prisoner was obliged to hold the paling to keep himself up? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> With one hand—the pales are about five feet high—I have looked at the elder-tree, but can find no jagged broken branch.</p>

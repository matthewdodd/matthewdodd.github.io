                  </hi>. I am a chemist—Mrs. Brown brought me this frock and mantle—I examined it and discovered stains—on the jacket there was a white crystalline deposit down the front—I tasted it with my tongue, and found it extremely acid—it was not alum—in my</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186612170051"></xptr>
               <p>opinion it was oxalix acid—I looked at it from a powerful magnifying glass, and from the appearance of the crystal I said it was oxalic acid, but it might have been salt of sorrel—both of those are poisons, and the crystals very nearly resemble each other—oxalic acid is used for cleaning coppers, and salt of sorrel for removing stains and iron-mould from linen—the stains on the frock were consistent with one or other of these poisons—it would produce a burning sensation in the mouth and a strong acid taste—I should say about a drachm, that is sixty grains, would be sufficient to cause the death of a child six years old—the effect of an overdose would be vomiting—I looked at the child's throat, and found it unusually red, and the lips were very dry and parched—she said it had burnt her, but she did not feel it much then—alum would not produce such an appear<lb></lb>ance as I saw—alum is used for gargles—it would crystallise, but the crystals would be very much larger than those I saw—these were very fine needle-like crystals—crystallised alum would not be at all acid in its taste—it is a natural salt, there is no acid in it—the appearances I saw were quite consistent with the administration either of oxalic acid or salt of sorrel, and likely to be caused by it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you apply any test? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, the ground of my opinion was the examination of the stains and crystals through the magnifying glass, and also the taste—there are a great many acids, some varying very little from others in description—they have all their own peculiar character—there are many fluid acids, but oxalic acid has a very peculiar and marked crystal, which I detected through my glass—there is another acid a good deal like it, which is gallic acid, but that is so intensely styptic that it would not have produced the effect—I am not prepared to say there is no other acid that would—the crystals of alum are very large and awkward lumps—the stains on the dress were on the front part—they were not crystals—they were red stains.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Can you explain why there should be crystals on the upper part of the dress, and stains on the lower? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I can only explain it in this way, that it was the bottom of the vessel that contained the acid, and that the crystalline deposit fell on the jacket, and the fluid on the skirt—the whole of the crystal might not have been dissolved in the fluid—there may have been a deposit in the bottle, and that deposit might have been in the glass—I would not say it might not be caused by some other acid, because almost every day there are fresh acids discovered; there may be many which I do not know—I am a chemist and druggist, not an analytical chemist.</p>

Q.</hi> Do you know that alum water and peppermint mixed make a gargle? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I do not—alum water is used for gargle—when I produced the stain on the frock the acid did not crystallise—it is not usual for it to do so—it depends on the strength of the solution—in an ordinary solution of oxalic acid you would not expect any crystals—a given quantity of water takes up a given quantity of acid—there are other acids that would produce the same appearance; sulphuric acid, nitric acid, and muriatic acid—they are liquids—oxalic acid is a very deadly poison if taken in large quantities, a wineglass would be fatal—it is used for the purpose of cleaning coppers—whether the solution would be fatal would depend on the strength of it—I have known death ensue from oxalio acid after vomiting—many take it and their lives are sacrificed without vomiting at all.</p>

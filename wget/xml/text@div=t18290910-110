            . I am a labourer, and live at Langley,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182909100051"></xptr>in Kent; the deceased, Thomas Brandrith, lodged with me at the time of his death, and occasionally for years before - he came last the latter end of August, 1828; he had been in the army. He had been with me three weeks; on the 13th of September, 1828, he came home to his lodging, at ten o'clock that night, fell forward out of his chair, and almost immediately expired: I knew the prisoner; he is a pensioner, and lived about forty roods off; he had been in the army, and was acquainted with the deceased - I went to his house, and told him what had happened; he and his wife came back with me to my house, stopped there all night, and left about six o'clock; after they were gone I found two keys belonging to the deceased, and took them to the prisoner's house - the deceased had a portmanteau at his house; I gave him the keys - he asked me to go up stairs, and see the portmanteau unlocked; I went up with him; he unlocked it, and opened it in my presence with one of the keys I took; it was searched in my presence, and two papers found in it, which appeared about the size of a letter; Suffolk did not appear to take any notice of them - he did look at them, and said they were Brandrith's soldiering papers; I did not see any other papers in the portmanteau; (looking at a will produced by 
               <persName id="t18290910-110-person1068">J. </persName>
            Beams) I saw no paper of this sort found in the portmanteau - I saw it emptied; there was some wearing-apparel and things, and two sovereigns.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Suffolk was an acquaintance of Brandrith's? A. Yes; he was with him almost every day, and only came to my house to sleep - he came down from year to year to visit him; I have seen him there for years; and I believe he slept with me, because Suffolk had no place for him to sleep; the prisoner asked me to go up to see the portmanteau opened; he looked at the papers carelessly, and said they were soldiering papers.</p>
               <p>Q. Looking at this paper folded up as it is, can you undertake to swear it was not among them? A. I cannot; the things were turned out of the box, and put in again - some were not taken out; I believe they were all turned over, and all moved; but some might not be taken out - it was a leather portmanteau, lined with paper, I think; I think the lid was lined.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any search made in the lining of the lid? A. I cannot say that I saw any part of the lid open - Suffolk took the two sovereigns; I do not know that he paid for the funeral; all the time I knew Suffolk and Brandrith they seemed very friendly, and always walked about the common together - I was with them but very little; Brandrith never told me what he or his family were; I never heard him say what he meant to do with his property after his death - I knew a man named Whyman in the neighbourhood; I fancy he has been a schoolmaster; I do not know that he used to do writing for the neighbours - he lived at Sutton Valence, and has gone away; I do not know that search has been made for him - people have been enquiring after him: I never heard of his being found.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. What sort of a lining had the portmanteau; do I understand that it was lined with paper? A. The sides and the bottom; I think the inside of the lid was lined with cloth, or something - I went up at the prisoner's desire to search it.</p>

            , ESQ. I live at Langley, and know the prisoner; he came to me early on the Sunday morning as the deceased died on the Saturday night, and asked if it was necessary to have a Coroner; I told him he must have one, on hearing the particulars of the man's death - I asked if he knew any thing of the deceased; he said he did, that he was an old comrade of his; I asked whether he had any property - he said, "Yes, considerable." I asked what he meant by that - whether it was any thing he derived an income from, or if it was property; he said he had property in the Bank of England -I then asked if he knew whether he had left any will; he said No - I asked if he had any near relations that he knew of; he said he had a sister, and he believed she lived in the City of Chester - that he knew her maiden name, but did not know her name now; I told him she ought to be informed of his death, as the property was hers - he said of course the property was hers; he then said, the weather was hot, and the man must be buried, there was not time to give her the information, for he would not keep, and as there was sufficient property to bury him; he would bury him, and when they came, if they liked to pay him the expenses of burying him, he would give them up the property, which I understood was the money and different things which were found - this was about half-past eight o'clock in the morning; we always breakfast at eight, and were at breakfast when he came - he said he would write to the sister, and went away; I saw him again on the 1st of June this year; I had met him once before that in the road, near Christmas, and asked if he had ever had any answer from Brandrith's sister; he said No, the letter had been returned to him from the returned letter office, as they could not find her - I asked if he ought not to take other means to endeavour to find her out; he said he would write again - this was, I think, two or three days before Christmas; I recollect nothing more passing then. On the 1st of June Mr. Matheson came to me with a letter of introduction from Manchester; I went with him to Masely's house - he wished for information about the death, and to see Masely and the witnesses attesting the will, of which he shewed me a copy; while we were at Masely's, Suffolk came up to the door - I said to Mr. Matheson, "There is the man himself;" Matheson at first said he would not take any notice of him - he afterwards said to me, "I think I may as well at once;" he then called to him and asked whether he had not taken some money under a will of Brandrith - he said he had, that Brandrith had made a will, by which he had made him whole and sole executor, and left him all his property; that he had administered to that will, and had taken more than 300l. from the Bank of England - I then said to him, "How do you account for this? you told me Brandrith had made no will, and now you say he has made a will, leaving you executor and all his property?" he was very much confused, and hesitated for some time - at last he said, "I know I did, I did not then know that there was a will;" we asked him how long it was after Brandrith's death that he found the will - he said it was about a month; I said to him, "It is very extraordinary the will should bear date on the 28th of August, and he die on the 13th of September, and you living in so small a cottage, he should not tell you any thing about it, and that you should not know any thing about<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182909100052"></xptr>it;" we then asked him who made the will; he said he did not know that he was bound to tell - Mr. Matheson said he did not know that he was bound to tell, but he would most likely be made to tell in some other place, if he would not tell him; we pressed him very much to tell who made the will, and he said to Mr. Matheson, "I should like to know who you are;" he said, "I am an attorney at Manchester; I am sent here by the deceased's sister: and unless you like to give up the money I shall take proceedings against you, and very briskly" - he said he did not wish to hurry him, he might take his time about it and should confer with Messrs. Hoare and Beal, whom he should appoint his agents; Matheson asked him several times after, I should think a dozen times, to tell who made the will, and then we left him and went away - we asked if he could bring any respectable person forward who was present and saw the will made or any thing of that sort, but he would not give any answer - I do not think any inquiry was made of him respecting the witnesses; Saturday following (the 6th) I went to his house and told him I had received a letter from Mr. Matheson, wishing me to ask him two questions and he must do as he pleased about answering them; I would read the questions as they were written in the letter - one question was, at what precise time he wrote to the sister of the late Mr. Brandrith, and how and when he learned that the letter had been returned; he said he wrote on the Sunday, the day after the poor man died; that he got Rouse to write, and did not write himself; that he did not know the date of the return of the letter, but it was some considerable time (he told us in the conversation, on the 1st of June, with Mr. Matheson that when he found the will it was between the lid of the trunk and the lining, and about a month after the deceased's death - I asked him whether it was probable a man, who had made an instrument like a will, which was only to come in use after his death, would hide it where it most probably never would be found; he made no reply) - the second question I was to ask him was, "How long after Mr. Brandrith's decease it was when he found the will, as he stated, under the lid of the trunk?" he said he thought it was more than a month; he then asked me some questions about the matter- I told him I had no doubt Mr. Matheson would proceed against him, and that he knew best about the will, if it was a genuine will; he had better produce the witnesses or those who saw it made, that he might avoid getting into trouble, as I did not know in what way Mr. Matheson would proceed, but I thought most probably by a warrant - I told him if Mr. Matheson proceeded by an action against him it would put him to a considerable expense, even if the will was correct; he said a law suit would ruin him, he had better give up the money - he asked me for Mr. Matheson's address, which I gave him; I asked if he could told me the name of the sister, as I had forgotten it, though Mr. Matheson had told me- he immediately said her name was Makin, but I am not quite certain whether Mr. Matheson did not tell him her name on the 1st of June.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. When you and Mr. Matheson first saw him you did not tell him, in the first instance, who Mr. Matheson was? A. No; I have not stated the conversation quite exact in point of time - he was asked who made the will full a dozen times; he was asked two or three times before Mr. Matheson told him who he was, and several times after - he asked who Mr. Matheson was before he was told he would be made to tell who made the will.</p>
               <p>Q. It was on some interference of Mr. Matheson that he asked who he was? A. Yes; he asked the prisoner two or three times who made the will, and then the prisoners said, "I should like to know who you are?" but he was also asked after that who made the will.</p>
               <p>Q. Finding he was an attorney who came to claim the property, he declined answering him some question? A. Yes; it was after Matheson told him who he was that he said he should proceed pretty briskly - he answered both the questions I put to him from Matheson's letter; I know Whyman by sight; he can write, but not very well - I believe he has been in several different businesses; he has been rather unfortunate; the only thing I know of his having written is a notice, but not in very good writing - I believe he has left the neighbourhood entirely.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Repeat the answer Mr. Matheson gave when asked who he was? A."I am an attorney of Manchester, and am sent here by the sisters of the deceased to inquire about the will;" Suffolk said "I only knew he had one sister" - whether either of their names were mentioned, I do not know.</p>

            . I am an auctioneer, and live at Sutton Valence. I was employed to bury the deceased; the prisoner gave me the directions for the funeral, he said if I would do it he would see that I should be paid - he knew Mr. Brandrith had died worth property, and he would see the expenses paid - he said he supposed there would be a will found, by which he expected the property would come to him, but if it was otherwise, the deceased had a sister living near Chester, and he wished me to write her (looking at a letter produced by the prisoner's counsel) this is the letter I wrote by his desire; it is written as from myself, and was returned to me from the post-office - (read.)</p>

            . The prisoner's letters are al<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182909100053"></xptr>ways left at my house - I broke this open myself - Langley is the adjoining parish to Sutton Valence; I was in the habit of seeing him frequently, almost daily - he came to me four or five days after the letter was sent, to know if I had received an answer; and so he did day by day - the letter was returned about a month after it was sent - I told him it was returned, and gave it him; a very few days after the letter was returned, he said if his sister was living, and there was no will, the property would belong to her - but he said he thought he knew the place where the deceased's trunks were in London, and he should go to London and see if it could be found there; he said he knew one place where there was a trunk, but he thought there were two or three different places where he had trunks.</p>

               <p>Q. At the time he talked of going to London to search the trunk there, did he say any thing about the trunk at his own house? A. He said he had searched the trunk at his own house, but could find nothing there in the shape of a will; he said he should go to London to search the trunks, to see if he could find a letter to tell where the sister lived, if she was living; I cannot fix a date to this conversation; it was not many days after the return of the letter - he told me afterwards that he had been to London; I saw him on his return - I should think he had been absent a fortnight - he told me he could find no will; he paid me for the funeral after he returned from London; and when he paid me, I told him I was surprised how he could obtain the money without a will, as he told me he had got 380l. from the Bank; he had been to London twice; after he had been the first time I gave him a paper which I wrote; it was merely an account of what I had heard Mr. Brandrith say respecting him, both in his presence and out of it - I gave it him at his own request; and after he received that paper he went to London a second time; some time after that he paid me for the funeral - I do not think that was for nearly three months after the decease; he paid me about 14l., including money I had lent him - in answer to my question, how he got the money without a will, he said there was no will, but the paper I gave him was as good as a will; he said he had been at a great expence and trouble in getting the money - I think he stated he had received the 380l. from the Bank, both at this conversation and before- I saw him afterwards; he said it was very strange the sister had not written nor come up, as she must have heard of her brother's death; but he understood they were not very good friends - he came to me about the beginning of last June, and told me there had been a solicitor down respecting Mr. Brandrith's will; I said, "I thought you always told me there was no will" - he said there was a will - that Whyman had made a will - he asked me where Whyman was; I told him I had put him in possession, under a distress for rent, at Tunely - he was occasionally employed by me; he said he should go down and see him; (it is about twelve miles off) he came back next day, and told me he had been down and seen Whyman; I know Whyman's hand-writing; I have often seen him write (looking at the will) - I believe this to be Whyman's hand-writing; it is not the hand he usually writes; but it is his hand-writing, I am sure.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Do I understand that you knew the deceased and the prisoner both? A. I knew them both very well; he was on particularly intimate terms with the prisoner, and came down every year to pass some time at his cottage; they lived and boarded together on the most intimate terms - they frequently came to my house, which is a public-house, and it was always a matter of indifference who paid; I am a publican as well as an auctioneer - they frequently talked of the services they had been in together abroad; and I heard they were in the same corps.</p>
               <p>Q. You communicated something he had said both in Suffolk's presence and out of it; was it not that he should leave Suffolk all he had in the world? A. No; Brandrith, when he was down the year before, told me he should stop about a fortnight longer in the country; he lodged at my house - he came home that night, and said he should go home next day - I said, "Why you said you were not going home?" he said, "Yes; but I cannot bear to stay here to see that poor Jem in such misery for the money he has lost by Boddin - I have told him not to grieve; I will take care of him as long as I am alive, and if I die I will take care of him; I am going home now to arrange my affairs" - this was in 1827 - he did not say when he should return to Sutton Valence; I saw him when he returned the following year - he lodged at my house then, and repeated the same sort of conversation respecting his intention towards Suffolk; I have heard him say the same sort of things several times, and one night in particular - when he gave Suffolk's wife his watch, he said, "Sally, when you hear I am dead, come and take my watch, it was given me by Lord Barrington; I should like to wear it all my life, and after I am dead it is your's;" he said Suffolk and him, between them. had money enough to bring them to their graves' end comfortably - he could not bear to see Mrs. Suffolk dragging about the leasing-field, when there was no occasion for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not say Mrs. Suffolk would have his watch, and the rest of his property would go to Suffolk? A. I do not think he ever said the whole of his property - he always said he should take care of Suffolk, he should secure Suffolk; I do not think he ever said he would leave him the whole of his property - he said Jem would have his property, or he should take care of him; I know it was his intention that Suffolk should have his property - he told me and my wife so when he has been talking to us; he has said he should give Suffolk property, but I do not think he ever said the whole of his property - I will not say, I have not stated that he said all his property should go to him, nor will I say Brandrith did not say so; I think it was before the prisoner's first journey that he told me he was going to London to look for letters to find the sister's direction - and on his return, I think he told me he had not got access to the trunks at all; I do not speak from dates, I only recollect this as a general conversation - I merely conjecture that it might be three months after the decease that he paid me.</p>
               <p>Q. He told you Whyman had made a will - did he not, in the same conversation, say Whyman said he had made the will? A. Yes; he said Whyman told him he had made a will; but I said, "If there are any secrets in it don't tell me;" he said, "There are no secrets on my part;"<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182909100054"></xptr>I told him it had been said about the place that I had made the will - that I was out of it, and wished to keep out of it; I wanted to hear nothing about it; he said Whyman told him he had made the will for Brandrith, but I do not recollect any day being mentioned when it was made.</p>
               <p>Q. Then Suffolk mentioned it as a matter Whyman had told him, not as knowing it himself? A. No; it was what Whyman had told him; I know Whyman very well - I believe he was always about that part of the country, not exactly at Sutton, but in the neighbourhood; he formerly kept a school; I do not know what has become of him now, I do not think he can be found - I have looked after him; I saw him on Sunday, the 15th of June, for the last time; I think Suffolk was in custody then, but am not sure; I told the constable if they wanted Whyman I knew where to find him; they said they did not want him; on the very day Suffolk was sent from Maidstone to London I met Mr. Makin, and said if he wanted Whyman I could find him; he said he did not want him that he knew of, there was nothing against him; the constable, I know, told me there was nothing against him.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Was the 15th of June the last time you saw Whyman? A. It was; I gave the prisoner a paper to the purport of the conversation I have stated relative to the disposal of the property; I was paid nothing for my trouble in drawing this paper - I received 3l. from him besides the funeral bill; I had been laying out of my money a long time; I charged him the same as was paid - I had not lent him the 3l. - it was for laying out of money, and I had lent him money; he made me a present of the 3l. as a compliment for that; it was a long time after I gave him the paper.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You charged for the funeral exactly what the undertaker charged? A. I did; if it had been any body else I should have had a profit, but as I knew him I expected he would give me something without it; the 3l. had nothing to do with the paper.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You stated, that in June he inquired where Whyman was, and you told him at Tunely? A. Yes; and he went there - I saw Whyman after that; I went to see him, most likely on the 7th day, as the goods would be condemned that day; I saw him in possession of the goods I had left him with - I have known the prisoner five years, he bore the character of an honest respectable man.</p>

            . I am an officer of the Marshalsea. I have known the prisoner since November last, when I saw him at the Horse Shoe and Magpie, in Fetter-lane - the landlord informed me, in his presence, that the prisoner had applied to him to recommend him to somebody to advise him how to act respecting a debt from a man named Brandrith, who had died in his house - he stated that the person had died in his house and left no will; that he owed him 79l., I think - I told him he had better apply to an attorney; he told me there was property in a box at the Grosvenor Arms, Chelsea, but he did not know what it was; in a short time Mr. Beetham, an attorney, who was in the habit of calling at the house, came in - I introduced him to him, and said he was as fit a person as I knew to attend to his business; he stated to Beetham, that Brandrith had died in his house in his debt, that he had left no will that he could find, and there was a trunk containing some property, of which he had the key, at the

            , Pimlico; Beetham said it was necessary a proctor should be engaged, and he went to Mr. Clarkson, at Doctors' Commons - either I or Beetham recommended him to apply to the landlord of the Grosvenor Arms to let him see the contents of the box to ascertain whether there was a will; he said if he obtained the amount of his debt he would pay both me and Beetham liberally - I believe that is all that passed then; I saw him next day - he told me the landlord of the public-house would not allow him to open the box; I had gone the day before with Beetham to the proctor, the prisoner was not there - I saw him several times every day for a fortnight nearly at the same public-house; the next circumstance I recollect, was going with Beetham and the prisoner down to Pimlico to examined the box, which was on the 8th of December, about a fortnight after I first saw him; Beetham applied to the landlord to let him see the box, and Beetham produced a will in the prisoner's presence - this is the will he produced (looking at it) - the landlord then delivered up the box to be examined; there were clothes, books, and some Bank Stock warrants found, but no will there; there was a quantity of letters and papers, but none of any importance - an inventory was taken of the different articles; I got a tape tied over the box, sealed it, and left it in possession of the landlord, taking away the inventory; a very short time afterwards I saw the prisoner, when he and his brother made an application to Beetham to give up the will; I heard the application made - he refused to give it up till his bill was paid; Beetham afterwards instructed me to go with him and the prisoner and his brother to fetch the trunk from Pimlico; we all three went with a man to carry it - the landlord delivered it to me and the prisoner.</p>

Yes, he presumed it would be found in that box; he spoke as if he expected there was a will in existence, though it had not been found - no secret was made about it; it was known to us and to twenty other people - a man named Whyman was there on some occasions; the first time I saw him was after the will was produced; I saw him the day before or the day after the will was produced to the landlord - I did not go with Whyman to Doctors' Commons; I only went the first time with Beetham - I made an affidavit before the Lord Mayor; I saw Whyman once, twice, or three times.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not stated by Whyman that the will had been made by him, and found by him? A. Not in my presence - I heard nothing about the will, only that it was produced; it was stated either by the prisoner or his brother that it was found in the ticken of a portmanteau or a trunk - I did not know at any time that the will had been written by Whyman; he was called the schoolmaster.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. You say you saw the prisoner nearly every day, do you know whether he went out of town during that time? A. I think he went out of town twice during the time - he went out of town and was absent at least a fortnight; I think there had been a Iapse of a fortnight from his first application to Clarkson and his demanding the box, and during that time I did not see him; I did not see the will before it was produced to the land<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182909100055"></xptr>lord - I think the prisoner had been in town about two days before it was produced to the landlord.</p>

               <p>JURY. Q. Can you tell whether the prisoner or his brother told the landlord where the will was found? A. It is impossible for me to say who said it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the expression that the will was found, or that he had found it? A. It was said in general conversation that it was found in the ticken of a trunk or portmanteau.</p>

            . I am an attorney. I was passing the Horse Shoe and Magpie, Fetter-lane, the latter end of last year; I think it was the beginning of November, and was introduced to the prisoner by Lee; they were standing in the street as I passed up - Lee said, "Mr. Beetham, these gentlemen want you to do some business for them;" I think there were two others; I am sure there was one -I was addressed by, I presume, the prisoner's brother; the prisoner was present; I believe he is rather deaf - the brother said a man named Brandrith had died in their village, and he believed he had made a will, but that will they had not in their possession; they suspected it might be in possession of a person at a public-house at the west end of the town, somewhere by Chelsea, where the deceased had a box; they said they had applied to search this box, but the landlord had refused them; they had previously said the deceased was indebted to the prisoner 60l., I think - he shewed me a letter which had been written to the deceased's sister, and returned "Not found;" I advised him to obtain letters of administration, as a creditor; that was agreed to - I immediately went down to my proctor, a Mr. Clarkson, and gave him instructions; I did not see the parties again for some time; they returned into the country, I believe; however, in about three weeks, (I think) the prisoner, with his brother and a third person, who I understood to be Whyman, came to my house, which was then in Grenville-street, Brunswick-square; they then produced to me a document, purporting to be a will; I think this (looking at the instrument) to be the same.</p>

            . I am a proctor of Doctor's Commons. I have seen the prisoner; he produced this will to me (looking at it); he was sworn on the 12th of January; I had seen him about a month before on the subject of the will - Beetham came in the first instance, and instructed me to enter a caveat - I afterwards understood Beetham had the will, and refused to give it up for about a month; the will was produced to me by the prisoner; I am not aware whether I or my clerk was present when he was sworn - the jurat is in my hand-writing; it was written on the 12th of January; the signature to it is Dr. Coote's - my office is in Doctors' Commons; probate was granted on it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Do you recollect distinctly from whom you received the will, whether from the brother or Whyman? A. I believe the brother was present; but whether I received it from the prisoner or his brother I cannot tell; I believe the prisoner was present; I should say so from the jurat - the will was not in my hands till the jurat was written; Beetham was not present when I received it - I believe the brother and Whyman were there.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you a clear memory, or are you sure the prisoner was present when you received it? A. I should have some difficulty in swearing that positively; I am sure I wrote the jurat, but who swore to it I do not know; I am not certain whether I went to Dr. Cootes, or my clerk- who took the oath I do not know; I do not recollect that I got him sworn.</p>

He had been to my office before with a person, and stated the business in my absence; I cannot swear the prisoner is the person who appeared before Dr. Coote, and swore this; the impression on my mind is that the prisoner is the person; I should say so from the name in the jurat - I believe he was there when it was brought, if his name is

               <p>COURT. Q. The question is not whether he was the man before Dr. Coote, as you do not know whether you were present yourself; it is when that will was put into your hands (you say three people brought it to you;) was the prisoner present or not at the time the will was produced to you? A. I never had any previous acquaintance with him, when he came to prove the will; I feel great difficulty in swearing positively to his person - I feel a difficulty in swearing whether he was one of the persons present at my office on that particular business.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you believe him to be the man? A. I have no recollection of him; I have not sufficient recollection to enable me to form a belief; I believe I saw somebody on the subject of the will, about the middle of December - I have no doubt of it; the prisoner might have been one of the persons I saw then - I believe he might have been; I believe he was among them.</p>

               <p>JURY. Q. Where did you acquire the information relative to the amount of the personal property? A. From one of the party in attendance; I do not recollect whether the prisoner was present at the time the information was given.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is the signature to the jurat yours? A. Yes - It is not usual to state in the attestation of a will, who the actuary is; the memorandum is in my hand-writing - the signature at the bottom is a private mark of the registry.</p>

            . I am clerk to a stock-broker. I know the prisoner - he applied to me in December, and said he had got some stock to sell out under a will of a person named Brandrith; I sold the stock for him, and paid him the produce of it; I did other business for him before that - I first bought in some Long Annuties, in January.</p>
               <p>Q. Well, but that was after December? A. Yes; he applied to me in December, but I sold the property on the 10th of February; it was 266l. 12s. 5d. New 4 per Cents., 115l. 16s. 9d. 3 1/2 per Cents.; the produce of the two sums was 367l. odd - I have seen him on different occasions at the Bank, no where else; he showed me a will - Michael Whyman was with him at the time; I believe the will produced to be the one he presented to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you make any mark on it, so as to know it again? A. No - he showed it to me about the middle of January; I told him he must take it to a proctor.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it about the 15th of 16th of January? A. I dare say it might; I will not swear it was not later, nor do I swear this is the paper; I think it was about the middle of the month - the probate lay in the will-office three weeks before it was acted upon; I know that because I took it away from the will office myself - the document shown to me was paper, not parchment.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. When are the 4 per cent. dividends due? A. On the 5th of January; I saw the prisoner about the stock the latter end of January; I went to the office myself to take the probate there - the prisoner gave it me to carry there.</p>
               <p>Q. You have stated this will was shown to you - under what circumstances was it produced? A. Suffolk, the prisoner, told me he had left the will with an attorney named Beetham; this was some time in December - I had told him nothing could be done without the will, and upon that it was produced to me at the Bank; I told him he must take it to a proctor; I made no mark on it, but the will produced appears to be the same - I read it over, and recollect the names of the witnesses; I believe it is the paper he produced to me.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You made no mark on it? A. No Whyman and another man, who I believe is the prisoner's brother, were with him - which of them produced it to me I cannot say; they were all present.</p>


               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. The prisoner gave you the direction about the stock, and you paid him the money? A. Yes; I am sure the prisoner gave me the direction about the stock.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. When did the prisoner first make application to you? A. In December; he asked for Mr. Brazier at first, and on inquiry I found Brazier was dead; there were two persons with him; the prisoner was the one who asked for Brazier - I told him he was dead; the prisoner then asked me if I would do some business for him, and said it was to sell some stock under a will - I found some difficulty in transferring the stock, as the names were differently spelt; I saw the prisoner several times before I could make the transfer; he was waiting in expectation of it every day - he mentioned in December about the will being at Beetham's; he said it was lodged there, and he found some difficulty in getting it away - I told him I must have it, or nothing could be done, and it was brought to me in January, by the prisoner; the other two were with him then - I cannot tell which of them produced it; this was at the Bank; I told him that very day that he must go to a proctor - I got the probate three or four days after<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182909100057"></xptr>that; the prisoner brought it to me - his brother was with him then, but not Whyman; I lodged it in the will office, and after that the transfers were made.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street. I took the prisoner into custody on Sunday, the 21st of June, at Battle-bridge, at his brother's house; every thing seemed to be packed up for the purpose of going away - I found this book and paper in the pocket of a coat in a trunk; the prisoner claimed it as his, and told me to be particularly careful of it, and not part with it; I found a card and paper in his hat, which he claimed - (read).</p>
               <p>I, J.Rouse, of Sutton Valenoe, in the County of Kent, innkeeper, do certify, that Mr. Suffolk and the late Mr. Brandrith was frequently in the habit of using my house, and I have often heard Mr. Brandrith tell Mrs. Suffolk, that if she should survive him, it was his wish that she should have his watch, and that his property of every nature and kind, he wished that Mr. Suffolk should have at his decese, and Mr. Brandrith have told me repeatedly that Mr. Suffolk, at his death, would have something wery hansom.</p>

               <p>MRS. MAKIN re-examined. I live at Penlington, two miles beyond Manchester; my sister lives at Salford, near Manchester - Chester is about forty miles from Manchester; I was born at Chester, and lived there till I was about sixteen years old - my sister was born there, and left when about fourteen.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written.) My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, - I was acquainted with Mr. Brandrith many years, having served together in the army; we were on the most friendly terms - he repeatedly told me and other persons that he intended to leave me all his property; when his death took place, knowing he had property, and not knowing whether he had made a will, I immediately wrote to his sister, hoping she might be able to give me some clue where the will might be found - I accidentally mentioned the circumstance to Whyman, among others, and he informed me he had made a will for him shortly before he died; Whyman afterwards produced the will to me, and I had every reason to believe it was the one Brandrith had made, and being ignorant of business, I left it to my brother and Whyman, to do what was necessary.</p>
               <p>JURY to COLLISON. Q. Did you ever lend that copy to any body else? A. I never lent it before or since.</p>

            . I was quarter-master in the prisoner's regiment; I came here by request of the officers of the Grenadier Guards, which the prisoner was discharged from in 1814 - I think he was in the regiment about twenty years; he was at Walcheren and fell ill with the fever - Brandrith was in the same regiment and discharged, being old; while I knew the prisoner in the Guards he bore an unblemished character, and was respected as much as any non-commissioned officer - I knew him as an honest man, and he was considered a very excellent soldier.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was he in the habit of reading and writing in the Guards? A. Yes; he could write and read himself - he had returns to make.</p>

               <p>The case was stated by Mr. Alley.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM TUFFIN. Q. You are an apprentice to Mr. Self, the plaintiff - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these two letters - did you receive them from the postman - A. Yes, on the 28th of November.</p>
               <p>Q. The post-mark is the 28th of November, four o'clock; they are both marked the same way - at the time you took them were they both sealed - A. No; the one with parchment in it was sealed, the other was unsealed; I did not take them in my own hand, my mistress took them in; I saw it; I was in the shop at the same time; my master took one out of her hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her read it - A. I did not; she went into the parlour.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. They were both put in the same post office.</p>
               <p>MR. SELF. I am a sign-painter, No. 60, Sun-street, Bishopsgate-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect on the 28th of November last receiving these two letters in question from the postman - A. My spouse received them of the postman, and while she was paying the postman the four-pence I took one out of her hand, which was sealed and had an inclosure in it. She took the other into the parlour with her; she is near sighted, she could not read the whole, she could make out a few words; I opened one, and when I saw this inclosed I immediately went in; there was no writing on it, but only the inclosed; it contained a little slip of paper, I believe the words Michaelmas term upon it, with the Exchequer process; I read part, I did not read the whole; I went into the parlour and took the other letter out of her hand, and read it.</p>
               <p>Q. That letter produced to you to day is the same letter - A. The very same.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that process and see whether that is the same - A. It is the same inclosure as when I received it.</p>
               <p>Q. Now is this the other letter - A. It is the other letter.</p>
               <p>[The Court was of opinion there was no occasion for reading the letter containing the libel, the whole of it being very vulgar and indecent, and written by some bad man, the jury should have an opportunity of looking at it themselves.]</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. This little slip of paper contains on it, Exchequer, Michaelmas term - you have seen the letter, and you have seen the writing on it, are you able to say from what you have seen of the defendant's hand writing, that that is his hand writing - A. I believed it directly I perused it - I mean the libel, and the superscription on the other.</p>
               <p>COURT. You believe both to be the hand writing of the defendant - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley to jury. Gentlemen, if you put the quarters of the sheet of paper together - the two letters together - you find they form one whole half sheet one<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180904120078"></xptr>has been torn from the other - A. JURY. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. to plaintiff. Do you remember the day he was taken in custody - A. It was on Saturday.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after that was it you received this - A. I cannot say whether it was the Saturday following, or that Saturday week that he was taken in custody.</p>
               <p>COURT. Where was he taken in custody - A. In London, and as he was coming into this court to plead or to find bail, he said I was a false swearing villain I wanted to seek for his life, but he would do for me some way or other, if he got clear of this; they were the very words.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. I suppose there were some officer in the coach - A. There were two.</p>
               <p>Q. You have a large family of children, I understood by my learned friend - A. I have none, but my apprentice and servant.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 27th of December had you any conversation with the defendant on this subject - A. I had; I saw Mr. Sherman at Sadler's repository, Goswell-street; I remonstrated with him on his conduct to Mr. Self; I asked him how he could send such an infamous writing to Mr. Self; he said he knew nothing about it. I told him that he had been discovered, for the Exchequer process had been served upon him; he then said that it was through Mr. Self, the defendant, that it was served upon him, that Self was a perjured scoundrel, he would swear any thing; this was previous to the indictment being prefered.</p>

               <p>Mr. Alley. Look at that writing, who wrote that - A. I do not know, it is not like his general hand writing.</p>

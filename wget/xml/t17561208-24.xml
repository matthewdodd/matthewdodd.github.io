            . On the 8th of last month about two o'clock, the other evidence pointed out to me the prisoner at the bar, and said he had pick'd a gentleman's pocket of a handkerchief. I took hold of him, and took the handkerchief and four others out of his pocket. Then I told him we should take care of him, and deprive him of his market on the morrow. He said he bought the handkerchiefs of an old cloaths man in the street;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175612080017"></xptr> but could not tell what street, nor the man's name, nor where he lived.</p>

               <p>I bought these handkerchiefs in Holbourn. When I came into Cheapside I took one out to wipe my face and put it into my pocket. Then they came and stop'd me. Why did they not stop the gentleman as we I as me?</p>
               <p>Smith. If I had went to a prize the gentleman of it, the prisoner would have got away.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Hoop and Horseshoe, on Tower-hill. On 9th July the prisoner came there—my daughter was there serving—the prisoner asked for a small glass of brandy—my daughter served it—he gave her a half crown—she took it, and put' it in the detector—I ran to the bar, and put it in the detector myself—I found it was bad—the prisoner ran out—I pursued him—he saw me pursuing him, and stopped—I took him, and gave him into custody—he had been in my house before with another man—I cannot say which of them offered a half crown then; I think it was the other man—I found it was bad, and said so—the prisoner said he had got it for work done, and he would pay for what they had had to drink—I gave them the half crown back, and told them not to try the game on again—the last half crown I took to the station—I marked it, and gave it to the inspector—I asked the prisoner where he lived—he said he did not like to disgrace his friends—he did not give his name in my presence; he refused to do so.</p>

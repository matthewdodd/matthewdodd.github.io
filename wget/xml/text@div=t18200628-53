            . I was introduced to the prisoners on the 25th of April; I was employed by the Solicitors of the Bank, and was introduced to the prisoners at the Sun, public-house, at the corner of Brownlow-street, Drury-lane. I saw Marsden there - a person was there whom I knew; he spoke to Marsden after I had been there about ten minutes - that person and Marsden both went out into the passage; I was afterwards called into the passage and saw them there. The person asked me in the hearing of Marsden to lend him 6 s., I did so, he gave it to Marsden, and Marsden gave him a piece of paper folded up, which he gave to me; I put it in my fob, and said to Marsden that I should like to have one myself. I said nothing else, but went out of the passage into the taproom, and was called into the passage about five minutes after by Marsden - I gave Marsden 6 s., and he gave me a 1 l. forged note. I put it into my fob with the other, and then said I should like to have something in a larger way; he said I could have them at any time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you express what you meant by something in a larger way - A. I said I should like to have a 5 l. note, he said I should have one next day, at three o'clock. I asked what price it would be? he said 24 s. I then went away, took the two notes to the Crown tavern, Clerkenwell, and gave them to Foy, the officer.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see Marsden again - A. On the 27th, at four o'clock in the afternoon, in the taproom of the Sun, public-house, Drury-lane - he said he expected to have seen me in the morning; that he had got a five for me, but he had put it away as I did not come, and asked if I would have it now? I said No, I had not the money to pay for it. He asked me how many ones I would have, and if I would have three? I said I had not money enough, but I would have two. He said,</p>
               <p>"Stay till it is dark and you shall have them?" I staid there till nine o'clock; he went out, and soon afterwards returned - he called me out, we went down Charles-street and Drury-lane, into a back room of the Coach and Horses, public-house - nobody but ourselves were in the room. He asked me if I was ready? I said Yes, and gave him three half-crowns and a crown piece; he gave me two 1 l. notes, desired me to look at them, and asked if they were not fine ones? I said nothing, but doubled them up and put them into my fob.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to give him 12 s. 6 d. - A. He had not a 6 d. to give me change, and returned me a half-crown. I went to the bar, got change, and returned him 2 s. I took the notes to the Crown, marked them, and gave them to Foy - (looks at two) - these are them. On Saturday the 29th, I saw him again in the tap-room at the Sun, at seven o'clock in the evening; he had sent a person for me. On my going there, he said he had got a five for me, and said he had sent a person for me. He asked if I would have it; I said, Yes - what price is it: he said 26 s. I told him, he said before I should have them for 24 s.; he said he would see if he could get one at that price, and, if not, how many one's would I have, as I might have as many as I pleased. I said I would have three or four, but I I would rather have a five. He went out, returned in about twenty minutes, and said he had sent a person for a five, and it would not be long before it was there. He said he had sent to Skinner-street, Snowhill, for it. In about ten minutes the prisoner, Smith, came in, he whispered to Marsden, then Marsden turned to me, and said the only five they had was gone, and asked me how many one's I would have; I at first said I would have three, but afterwards said I would take four. Marsden turned to Smith, and whispered to him - Smith then went out; while he was gone a person, who was sitting in our company, asked Marsden what the old man's (Smith's) name was? Marsden said he was called

            , and that he was nearly seventy years of age. Marsden then said to me,</p>

               <p>"You would hardly suppose that he has been transported for fourteen years, and I myself have been cast for death twice, and once transported?" I said,</p>
               <p>"The Devil you have!" He said he had, but he had only served sixteen months of his time at the Bay, but the old man had served his time duly and truly. Smith came back, and whispered to Marsden; Marsden went out, and beckoned me out, took me down the cellar stairs of the public-house; when we got to the bottom, he said,</p>
               <p>"Here is a place where we shall not be seen." There was light there. He undid a small roll of paper, and gave me four 1 l. Bank notes, one at a time - they were all the roll contained. I had only ordered four. He told me to look at them - I did so, folded them up, and put them into my fob. I paid him 24 s. for them. We returned to the taproom, had something to drink, and came away. I went to the Crown tavern, marked each note on the face, and delivered them to Foy, in the presence of Mr. Christmas, a Bank inspector - (looks at them) - these are them, they have</p>
               <p>"J. Marsden, 29 - 4 - 20, F. F." on them. I saw Marsden again on the 3d of May, at two o'clock, at the Blue Lion, public-house, Gray's Inn-lane - we met there by his appointment.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182006280023"></xptr>Q. Why was the house of meeting changed - A. He said he would rather deal with me by myself somewhere else. I had met him always before at the Sun, in company with another person. On my going there, he said the old man would be there shortly, and we were to wait till he came. Smith came in in about three-quarters of an hour, and whispered to Marsden; Marsden said, he (meaning Smith), has got but two, will you have them? I agreed to take them. He desired me to go down the ground, and he would follow - there is a pleasure ground there. He followed me, and gave me two 1 l. notes, and I gave him 12 s. for them. We returned to the taproom, Smith was sitting there, he said to Marsden,</p>
               <p>"Has he got them?" Marsden said Yes. He then said,</p>
               <p>"Has he paid for them?" He said,</p>
               <p>"Yes, it is all right." Marsden asked me to come the next day at twelve o'clock and I should have half a score. I agreed to go; I took the notes to the Crown tavern, marked them on the face, and delivered them to Foy - (looks at two) - these are them. I marked them</p>
               <p>"J. Marsden, 3 - 5 - 20. F. F." I went there again on the 4th of May and waited there. Marsden came about half past twelve o'clock; said we must wait till the old man came, and he would bring them; we waited there till near three o'clock; he did not come, and Marsden appointed to meet me at one o'clock next day. I accordingly went there to the same house, and waited for him in the street; he came in about ten minutes; we went into the house and waited there about half an hour for the old man; I said I could wait no longer; we agreed to meet again at two o'clock; I went away, and saw Foy and Christmas, who were waiting for me; I went again at two o'clock; Marsden was not there; I waited in the street till he came; we then walked up and down the street waiting for the old man, and in about a quarter of an hour Smith came; he joined us in Guildford-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you command a view of him before he approached you? - A. Yes; before he came up, he took his hat off and waved it as a signal that he was coming; he might be a dozen yards from us then. We all three went into the taproom of the Blue Lion - none but ourselves were in the room. Marsden asked Smith if he had got the things; Smith said Yes, and pulled out a parcel and offered it to me - it was not open - I told Marsden to take it while I got the money out of my pocket; I asked how many notes there were; Smith said ten - he handed them to Marsden, who undid the roll a little; I said I could only take eight; Marsden undid the roll again a little, and Smith took two of the notes out; then Marsden gave me the parcel, containing eight; I gave him a 1 l. Bank note and 28 s. in silver, and asked if I could rely on it that there were eight; he said Yes, I might rely there were - Smith also said there were eight. Marsden gave Smith the money, and Smith asked if it was all good; I said Yes, and Marsden said, he would be bound it was all good; Marsden asked if I was going into the country; I said I was, I had previously told him so; he said, you cannot justly say when you shall want any more then? I said I could not tell; he said when you do want any more, write to me at the Sun, the day before you want them, and I will meet you. Smith was present all this time; he must have heard it, we were all in company. After a short time, we went to the door, shook hands, and separated. I went to the Crown, marked each note on the face, and gave them to Foy, in the presence of Christmas - (looks at them) - these are them; they are marked</p>
               <p>"J. Marsden, 5th of May - 20 - F. F." I saw Marsden again by appointment on the 10th of May (I had sent him a letter), at the Blue Lion at twelve o'clock; he had nothing then; he said he would meet me again at three o'clock; I told him I wanted some notes - nothing passed at three - we met again at six, and I gave him a 1 l. Bank note and 10 s. to bring me five ones the next day; we were to meet at the Union, public house, Spafields, and did so; this was on the 11th, at twelve o'clock; he met me at the Union door, and asked me to go down the road with him, which leads by Bagnigge Wells; I went with him into a field past Bagnigge Wells; he said Smith was there, and would not come up, and I had better go down to him. When we got into the field, Smith was there waiting for us - I asked him if he had got them - he pulled out a brown paper parcel, tied round with a bit of thread, gave it to Marsden, and he gave it to me. I asked Marsden how many there were, Smith replied fifteen; I asked what sort they were, if there was a 5 l. note; Smith said they were all ones; I broke the string they were tied with; they said I had no occasion to count them, they were all right; I said I could only take ten; I took ten away, and returned the five to Marsden - he returned them to Smith.</p>
               <p>Q. You had paid him 1 l. 10 s. the night before? - A. Yes, and I gave Marsden 1 l. 10 s. more then, which was 3 l.; he asked when I should want any more? I said I could not say for a day or two; he said when you want more write as before, and you shall have them; I asked them to drink, but they refused and we parted. I took them to the Crown, marked them, and gave them to Foy, in the presence of Christmas. - (looks at 10) - these are them.</p>
               <p>Q. During these transactions had you been furnished with money by Christmas, and did you communicate from time to time the whole transaction - A. I did the whole of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner MARSDEN. Q. Who introduced you to me - A. A man named Bumpus.</p>

            . I am an officer of Marlborough-street office. On the 25th of April I received two notes from Freeman, at the Crown, Clerkenwell-green. On the 27th of April he gave me two, and on the 29th of April four. He gave me them all at the Crown. I had frequently communicated with him relative to this subject, and it was arranged that he should bring me the notes he might purchase of the prisoner. On Wednesday, the 3d of May, I saw Christmas give him some money, I do not know how much, it was to pay the prisoners for forged notes; and on Thursday I and Christmas went in a coach opposite the Blue Lion, Gray's Inn-lane. We got there about two o'clock, or rather earlier; I saw Freeman shortly after, he went into the Blue Lion. I saw Marsden coming towards there from Guildford-street way; it is at the corner of the passage leading to Bagnigge-wells. Marsden appeared to see Freeman going in, for he ran after him and got in nearly at the same time. We remained in the coach, and in about a quarter of an hour Freeman and Marsden came out together; they spoke together and separated. We<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182006280024"></xptr>then drove to the Crown. Freeman came up almost immediately, and returned Christmas the money he had given him. Freeman went to meet Marsden again about four o'clock. I saw Christmas return him the money. Wales was directed to go before us into the Blue Lion, and watch what passed between Freeman, or any one else who might be there. Freeman followed Wales in - I and Christmas followed them in a coach. We went nearly opposite the Blue Lion - got there about a quarter or half an hour after four o'clock; Freeman staid at the door, watching. He was shortly afterwards joined by Marsden, and both went into the house together. We waited till after five o'clock, and as neither of them came out, we returned to the Crown; and about half-past six o'clock Wales and Freeman came there - Freeman delivered me two notes. On Friday, the 5th of May, I saw Christmas give him some money for the same purpose. Wales and Jefferies were directed to go to the Blue Lion, to observe what passed. Christmas and I went in a coach, saw Freeman standing at the door, and very soon after I saw Marsden on the opposite side of the way - he beckoned to Freeman, who went over to him. They spoke together and then crossed over into the house, remained there about half an hour, then came out and separated - that was at twelve o'clock. We went again a little before two o'clock; on getting to the house, Freeman was standing at the door, and was soon after joined by Marsden. They walked up and down the street together, and went frequently opposite to the end of Guildford-street. Marsden appeared to be looking for some one in Guildford-street; after doing this three or four times, I saw him cross quickly over into Guildford-street; Freeman followed him, and in an instant they came in sight again, accompanied by Smith; they walked together, Freeman being before the prisoners, and went into the Blue Lion. After remaining there nearly half an hour, all three came out, had a short conversation in the street, shook hands with Freeman, and separated. The prisoners went away together, and Freeman went towards Battle-bridge. We returned to the Crown, Freeman came to us shortly after and delivered me eight notes, which I marked. On Thursday, the 11th of May, I saw Christmas give Freeman some money for the same purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of information you received from Freeman, were Wales and Jefferies directed to the Union public-house, Spafields? - A. They were, I and Christmas also went there about half-past eleven in a coach. When we got there, I saw Freeman standing at the door, and saw Marsden come up to him, they walked down the road together out of our sight. We went to the Crown about twelve o'clock, and at half-past twelve Freeman came, and delivered me ten notes. On the 25th of May, I I apprehended Smith in Wellington-street, Strand; which leads to Waterloo bridge; Plank was with me, I saw him in the street, and took him; I asked him if he had any thing about him, he said No; I said I should secure him, and proceeded to do so, he struggled a little; I found 4 s. 6 d. in his breeches pockets, and in his breast coat pocket, a brown paper parcel; I asked what it contained, he said he did not know. I asked him where he got it from, he hesitated a little, and said he had picked it up just before as he came over the bridge, in the road; the parcel was perfectly clean and dry, it was a rainy day, and the streets were very dirty; on opening it, it contained 50 1 l. notes in three distinct parcels, two of 20, and one of 10; we tied them with packthread, and marked them before I parted with them. - (The witness examined, and identified the several notes as he mentioned them.</p>
               <p>MARSDEN. Q. Did you at any time see Freeman give me any money, or receive any from me? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>SMITH. Q. The road I found them on was gravelled. A. It is rather a dry road, but the gravel was wet, there was no appearance of its having been on the ground.</p>

            . I am an inspector of Bank-notes, Freeman was employed under my direction, I supplied him with money from time to time, he reported his proceedings to me, and the appointments he made, I was in company with Foy, when he at different times brought forged Bank-notes to the Crown. On the 3d of May, I was with Foy in a hackney coach, near the Blue Lion, and saw Freeman there; he was afterwards joined by Marsden, it was about two o'clock. At five we were there again, and saw the two prisoners and Freeman, they went into the Blue Lion, we came away, and went to the Crown. On the 4th of May, we went to the same place, and saw Marsden and Freeman in the street, they went into the Blue Lion. Next day at twelve o'clock, we went there, and saw Marsden meet Freeman in the street; I think they did not go into the house that time, but I am not certain; we left in about half an hour, and went again at two, and saw Freeman waiting in the road. Marsden came up to him, they walked backward and forward sometime, then crossed together, went into Guildford-street, and returned back with Smith, Freeman was before them; they walked towards the Blue Lion, all three stopped at the door about three minutes, and talked together, then all went into the house, and were there sometime; they came out together, and shook hands at the door - the prisoners went up Gray's Inn-lane and Freeman towards Battle-bridge. I saw Marsden on the 11th at the door of the Union, in Spafields, Freeman was waiting there for him; they went away together towards Bagnigge Wells.</p>

            . I am an officer of Marlborough-street. On the 3d of May I went in disguise to the Blue Lion about four o'clock in the afternoon. I sat in a box in the taproom nearly opposite to where Marsden and Freeman sat - I think I got in before them, but it was nearly about the same time - they sat in a box together, and another person with them, for upwards of three-quarters of an hour. They had some ale together, and were in conversation. Marsden went out, and returned almost immediately with Smith, and both sat down with Freeman four or five minutes, then Freeman and Marsden went out of the taproom, leaving Smith behind. They all three appeared in conversation. Freeman and Marsden presently returned to the same box, remained there ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, and then went away. On the 4th of May Mr. Christmas gave Freeman some half-crowns and shillings. I went again to the Blue Lion with Jefferies about twelve o'clock - we were disguised. Marsden and Freeman came in, and remained till about three - they both went out and in during the time I believe. On the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182006280025"></xptr>5th of May I went there again into the parlour, which looks directly into the street. In a short time I observed Marsden and Freeman in conversation on the other side of the street, near Guildford-street, for near ten minutes. They parted soon after - one went one way, and the other another - this was soon after twelve o'clock. The same day, at two o'clock, I and Jefferies went there again, and while waiting in the front parlour I observed the two prisoners and Freeman together under the parlour window, just by where we were sitting - they parted, and went away. On the 25th of May, about four o'clock in the afternoon, Plank, Jefferies, and I went to the Sun, in Drury-lane, and found Marsden there, standing between the fireplace and the tap-room, and apprehended him. I found nothing material on him, he only had 1 s.</p>

            . I am an officer of Marlborough-street. On the 4th of May I went with Wales to the Blue Lion, and saw Marsden and Freeman together in the taproom - they continued together from about half-past twelve o'clock till near three, and had some ale, bread and cheese and raddishes together. I was on one side by the window, and Wales on the opposite side. I saw Freeman go away, leaving Marsden there. On the 5th I went to the same house again with Wales about twelve o'clock, and soon after saw Marsden beckon to Freeman, who was outside, they joined company together. We went away, came again at two o'clock, and saw Marsden and Freeman outside the house, Smith joined them soon after. I believe, they went into the taproom, but cannot say, as I was in the parlour - they appeared to be acquainted - they came out in about a quarter of an hour and parted. On the 11th of May, about twelve o'clock, Wales and I went to the Union, in Spafields, and saw Freeman there - Marsden joined him about a quarter past twelve - they went down the road together towards Bagnigge Wells. On the 25th I apprehended Marsden at the Sun with Plank and Wales.</p>

            . I am clerk to the Magistrates at Marlborough-street. The prisoners were examined there - I took down what they said, it was quite voluntary; it was read over to them, and they signed it - these are the papers they signed; they have Mr. Farrant's signature to them - (read.) -</p>
               <p>"The prisoner, Marsden, says, I am entirely innocent, have no acquaintance with Smith, and was never in company with him and Freeman in my life. I never was in the Blue Lion or the fields by Bagnigge Wells, in company with him. I have been seven or eight times in company with Freeman, but not with Smith. I never had any money transactions with Freeman, or received or paid him any money.</p>
               <p>"The prisoner, Smith, said,</p>
               <p>"I never saw Freeman till I saw him at this office. I never was in company with him and the prisoner, Marsden, together in my life. I have no acquaintance with Marsden - I never paid or received any money from Freeman, and never received any note from Marsden."</p>
               <p>THOMAS GLOVER. I am an inspector of Bank notes, and have been so upwards of twenty-six years - (looks at the notes uttered on the 5th of May) - they are forged in every respect. One is signed T. Elgar, but is not his writing. The whole of the notes produced are forged in every respect, and are not the hand-writing of the persons they purport to be - they appear to be signed by the same hand but the names are different. The fifty found on Smith are also forged.</p>
               <p>Prisoner MARSDEN. Q. Are the fifty signed by the same persons as signed the others - A. No; but all those produced by Freeman are off one plate.</p>

            . I am a signing-clerk at the Bank, there is no other of my name. The signature to the note is not my writing. Another has my name, but it is not my writing.</p>
               <p>(The note was here put in and read.)</p>
               <p>MARSDEN'S Defence. I believe, in the first place, Freeman says he was only in my company ten minutes, and after that he asked me to give him a bad note, to which I agreed. Now, is it consistent with reason that I should sell him a bad note after ten minutes acquaintance? Admitting that I was a dealer, is it consistent that I should risk my life for that. I do not know who his friend is - it is easy to bring his friend forward. I deny ever having had any connexion with him. I believe he says I sold him notes three times at the Sun, and once that I took him into the cellar. Now, as he acknowledges being employed by the Bank, is it not reasonable to suppose he would have marked money in his possession? He had an opportunity to have me taken, and by finding the marked money on me it would have convicted me. He had every opportunity to have me taken, but there is no person to prove he was seen to give me a note or receive any from me. He says I sold him notes at the Sun, and afterwards he said it was at the Coach and Horses, in Charles-street. He afterwards said he met me at the Blue Lion, and if so he could have had me taken. If I had sold him notes at that house it is evident the officers would have taken me with the marked money, which would have convicted me at once, but we never had any dealings. But those that adopted the plan had more judgment in them than I should have had to escape. He says he objected to take the notes from Smith in the field, and would have them of me - now, if so, would not any one suppose it was to get the person into trouble who sold them?</p>
               <p>SMITH's Defence. I know nothing about it.</p>

He was in that which had the six men in it; I saw Murphy strike him once or twice with a cutlace, I cannot justly say whereabouts he struck him, there were so many of them about him; it was much about his head and shoulders: I saw also James Dogan upon the timbers with a stick in his hand, he struck the deceased once, twice, or three times, and afterwards flourished his stick over his head; he had the stick in his left-hand, he is very remarkable, his right hand is lame; the deceased lay on his face ging for mercy; I heard him say, for God's sake do not take away my life, do not kill me, gentlemen;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176807060043"></xptr> one of them that is not taken, said, d - n your life, we will have all your lives before we have done with you.</p>
               <p>Q. How many might there be on the timbers?</p>
               <p>Beckett. I suppose there might be sixteen or twenty, there were no sailors there but the deceased.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any of the other prisoners there at that time?</p>
               <p>Beckett. I saw Carne on the side of the dock in the mob on shore, he got a blow on the right-side his temple with a stone; there were many stones throwed, I do not know who throwed them; I saw

               <p>Beckett. I do not know that any of them had, I am sure none of them had been on shore before the coal-heavers had called to them to come on shore; there had been no conversation between the sailors and coal-heavers as I knew of before; this was the first I ever heard or knew of; when they came on shore, I am sure none of the sailors made any attempt upon the coal heavers; they were talking about five minutes, then I saw the sailors run away, and in about six or eight minutes the deceased got upon a rast of timber; I saw Murphy upon the rast, he cut the deceased.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was the raft from the causeway?</p>
               <p>Beckett. It was about ten yards from it; the timbers were masts, one end lay upon the shore, and the other lower in the water; it was about an hour's stood.</p>

The 24th there came a gang on board, whether it was a false gang or not we did not know, and therefore we would not deliver the ship up to them to work; they went on shore again, there were twelve or thirteen; some of us went on shore between three and four o'clock in two boats, to know why they left off work; we wanted them to go on board their ships where they were at work; they called us to come on shore from our vessel, which lay 2 or 300 yards from shore; Beattie, the deceased, was with us in the boat I was in, he belonged to the Freelove; our ships lay in one tier close together; when we came to the shore I got up stairs, and shook hands with many of them; one of them came and ran a stick at my gullet, I had given no provocation for it; three or four words passed, and I went down again directly, we had no arms with us; in about ten minutes after that we were all attacked and knocked down by the coal-heavers; a great many of them had sticks and cutlaces, there were none on shore but myself as I know of; the rest were in the boats, one end of the boats was on shore; they came and got hold of them, and drawed them farther on shore; I was taken up for dead, being wounded on my head, and all over my body; they hoved us out of the boat into the water; I got into a sculler, and got off into a lighter, there<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176807060044"></xptr> I lay for some time before any body came to assist me; I could not observe what was done to the deceased.</p>

               <p>Q. Which did he strike him with?</p>
               <p>E. Moncoe. I do not know with which it was, there were a great many people throwing stones, there might be 20 or 30 of them throwing stones and brickbats; I saw Hammond among the crowd, flourishing a stick, saying, he would have the first sailor's head that came on shore; there were a great many of them upon the rast with the deceased, I cannot say I saw Hammond upon the rast; I saw Murphy several times on shore, I have seen him several times and in different dresses, I knew him before, though he changed his clothes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Grindal. I am a surgeon, I attend the London-hospital. On the 24th of May in the afternoon, between six and seven, to the best of my remembrance, the young gentleman that attends to take in accidents, sent me word a very dreadful one was just come in; I went to the hospital, and found John Beattie there, he was very sensible; he had received a blow, which he said was by a broomstick that broke his nose; he said there were several of these men set upon him; he said one knocked him down with a broomstick, another cut him cross the head (the wound began at the temple, and went quite to the back part of the head through the skull) done with a cutlace; it had broke a piece of bone in about the bigness of a shilling, which I took out, it went through the scull into the brain; he said he thought they left him for dead, but seeing him struggling another came up, and gave him a cut cross the shoulder ( which went into the joint of his shoulder;) he languished ten or twelve days in a deplorable situation, and then died.</p>
               <p>Q. To what do you impute his death?</p>
               <p>Grindal. I impute it to that wound on his head, they were either of them enough to have killed him.</p>

             there, I saw him go into the water, and take hold of the sailors boat, with a stick in his hand, as the boat was going off; he was among the coal-heavers, I cannot say I saw him strike any body; he hauled the boat back again, the people were so thick upon the shore that I could not see through them; I saw some blows pass from the coal-heavers when Davis took hold of the boat, they struck the people as they lay in the boat; there were two men lay down for dead in the bottom of the boat.</p>

            , a ship-chandler, on Wapping-wall; I saw it from the beginning to the end, I was on a barge near Shadwell-dock, I observed some sailors in some boats coming to land; the sailors began to call to the coal-heavers to shake hands in a friendly manner, till about ten or a dozen might be on shore; this might be about three o'clock: as soon as they had got on shore the coal-heavers marched down the stairs, some with sticks, and some with cutlaces, and fell upon them in a most desperate manner; they struck the sailors as fast as they could; it is impossible for me to tell how many sailors came down, there were as many as could fill the stairs, and more behind; then some of the sailors got into the boats again, and pushed off into the water; they were all got in, except one young man; when he was got in the boat they throwed a stone, and knocked him down; he was in a boat by himself, I mean the deceased, I believe it was him, he could not get the boat off I imagine; he then went into the water, and got out upon some timber; then one man threw a stone, and knocked him down upon the timber, that stone came from the crowd; he got up again, and made a slip; then one of the fellows came up to him with a drawn cutlace, and took him a knock upon the head, I saw it bleed, that fetched him down; I was then within ten yards of him, it may be less, he cut him several times; he struck him with the cutlace, and sometimes with the stick, and several others came and struck him while he was down at the same time.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know which of them made that answer?</p>

On the 24th of May Murphy went with me from King James's-stairs, about eight that morning; we worked on board the ship called Molly, a collier, we did fourteen chaldron of coals on board her, we came on shore together, I do not know whether he came on shore in the same boat as I did; I believe, when we came on shore, it was about ten o'clock; there was a rumour spread that the sailors were coming on shore at Shadwell-dock; Murphy to be sure was along with me, there were numbers of coal heavers; I was expecting to go to work again, I followed the mob of coal-heavers to the stairs, for I was not in safety to go home; I saw a red flag hoisted on board one of the ships, Murphy and I waited till about twelve; I saw nothing of him after twelve o'clock, I had been hard at work on board about one o'clock, and the affair was about ten or eleven o'clock.</p>

            . I have known Murphy about 2 or 3 months; the day the fray happened, which was Whitsun Tuesday, I saw him a little before it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176807060048"></xptr> began, I believe about a quarter of an hour before, crossing Shadwell-dock-stairs, going downwards between three and five o'clock, where he went I cannot say; I never saw him afterwards that day, he had a stick in his hand, no hanger as I could perceive; I know it was not Murphy, nor never a one here that killed Beattie with the hanger: the man that killed him was in a white fustian frock, an old hat with a bit out of the edge of it, he had the hanger in his left-hand and a stick in his right; whether his breeches were cloth or leather I don't know, they seemed to be white.</p>
               <p>Q. What colour were his stockings?</p>
               <p>Magoury. I did not observe his stockings.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was you to the deceased?</p>
               <p>Magoury. I believe I was about thirty yards distance.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was this after you had seen Murphy?</p>
               <p>Magoury. It was not half an hour I am sure; there was nobody on the raft but the deceased and that man that cut him, he made several blows at him with the hanger and stick.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the deceased standing or down?</p>
               <p>Magoury. He was down before the blow hit him; he crawled to shore and came to me, and leaned on my shoulder, and asked my help: I helped him a little way and then left him with some women; the man that cut him went thro' the yard and out upon the raft; I can't say I ever took notice of the man that cut him before.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Magoury. I am a lumper, and go to sea sometimes; after this I saw the man that cut him going along, I said that is the man that cut the man upon the raft; the other said, it is a shame for him to kill him, I could kill a thousand of him; this was one Smith Owen that said so.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was this after the man was cut?</p>
               <p>Magoury. This was not an hour after.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body with you when the deceased came and leaned on your shoulder?</p>
               <p>Magoury. No, nor nobody near me.</p>

             M'Daniel. I was standing at the landing place at the back of the Noah's Ark; I had seen the people going down upon the causeway, Murphy had a stick in his hand, and I saw him after the fray; he then had nothing else but a stick; I saw him on the causeway at the time of the fray, it was a black stick.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>M'Daniel. This was the 24th of May between three and four in the afternoon; the sailors and coal-heavers were engaged in a battle, I saw them during the whole time.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the battle?</p>
               <p>M'Daniel. It was about low water mark; there was a man wounded at the time of the fray; first the sailors got the better of the coal-heavers; before they got into the water, the coal-heavers got more force, then they got the better of them; three of the sailors jumped overboard, two were taken up with a boat, one jumped over on the other side and got upon the timbers, and two men followed him; one of them cut him with a cutlace in one hand, and a black stick in the other.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the time the sailors got the better?</p>
               <p>M'Daniel. That was when the coal-heavers were in the water; at last they knocked them backwards and forwards; then three jumped overboard, and there were two in a boat wounded.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the man wounded upon the raft?</p>
               <p>M'Daniel. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of him afterwards?</p>
               <p>M'Daniel. He was carried up afterwards by some people.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not walk at all?</p>
               <p>M'Daniel. He crawled in a manner, then he was assisted by other people.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he standing or lying when the man struck him?</p>
               <p>M'Daniel. He was standing upon his legs; the man had a cutlace in his hand, but he knocked him down with a stick; he cut him when he was down with the cutlace, he struck him again with the stick.</p>
               <p>Q. How many men were upon the raft?</p>
               <p>M'Daniel. There were two men, but the other was not close to him; there were three upon the raft in all when the man was wounded; I did not see the others do any thing; the man that out him on the raft was the beginning of the fray, he was dressed in a whitish coat and a flapped hat; he came down the stairs swaggering with the sword and stick in a terrible manner; he made them sheer off; they hawled this man in the water by his coat; one man got in up to his neck and catched hold of the boat, and I don't know who had the first blow; I am sure and certain I saw Murphy on the causeway at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>M'Daniel. I am a publican; I was coming from Wapping Old-stairs at the time to my house; I live on Cock-hill, at the sign of the Pewter Dish.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does your landlord live?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176807060049"></xptr>M'Daniel. He lives in College-yard, his name is Stimson.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the arms the sailors had?</p>
               <p>M'Daniel. The first man had a cutlace, the rest had broomsticks; they reasoned the affair before they began; the man leaned his elbow over the bow of the boat, they asked what was the matter; the coal-heavers said they did not want to hurt never a person; then the fellow came down with a cutlace in one hand and stick in the other; I guess the sailors were in dread of him, and shoved the boat off; then another ran and hauled the boat in.</p>

Castillo brought two sailors in at the Noah's Ark, and treated them with a pot of beer; I saw him go down to the bottom of the stairs and come up to me again; I said, how bad they behave to one another, then he went and took me into the Noah's Ark again; we were there at the time of the fray, and after that I went home. Hammond lodges at my house, he came to my house when the fray was over, and said there had been a fray; said he, I don't care, I happened not to be among them; I was at the Hoop and Bunch of Grapes in the Highway, he is a very honest man.</p>

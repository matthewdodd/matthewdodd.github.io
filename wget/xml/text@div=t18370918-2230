                  </hi>. I am apprentice to John Moore, a butcher, in Nelson-street, Greenwich. On the evening of the 19th of August I was standing outside the shop, and saw the prisoner waiting as I thought to buy some meat—I asked her what she would buy—she asked me the price of a piece of veal—I did not know the price—she put it inside—our young man was weighing some veal—she went in, took a piece of beef, put it under her shawl, and came out—I took hold of her arm, and said, You have a piece of beef"—she then threw it on the step of the next door, and said she had no beef, and had not seen it—I gave her into a witness' charge, and went down the step and picked up the beef.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the prosecutor's employ.

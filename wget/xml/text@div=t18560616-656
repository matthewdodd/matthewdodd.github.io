               <p>Greenwich. I keep a marine store shop also—I know both the prisoners, they have both been at my shop—I gave up to the police all the chandelier (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), one whole and one in pieces, also a number of gas fittings—I bought all these things from the prisoner Lewry at different times—he was about a dozen times bringing all the things, between 5th April and 21st May, that was the day on which he was taken into custody—I gave informa<lb></lb>tion to the police Lane was present three or four of the times on which these things were brought—he was present when this chandelier was brought, that was on 17th May—some of the things in the handkerchief (the gas fittings) were brought at the same time—Lewry was more par<lb></lb>ticular in weighing the things than Lane, whom I took to be his master—he was more particular in my favour—Lewry had the money for the chandelier—there was a quantity of brass forming a brass chandelier, in pieces, which I have sold—Lane was not there, I think, when any of that was brought to me—he was present when I paid the money—I was never at home when the prisoners came to my house, and they always used to wait for me till I came home; and when I came home I used to hear that they had been waiting for me some time—the things were brought to me in exactly the same state as they now are—this chandelier is of brass—I gave sixpence a pound for them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of the last witness. I saw the prisoners when they came to our house—they always came together—the money was always paid to Lewry—Lane brought the chandelier, he carried it himself; he set it inside the kitchen—Lewry was always with him—I was not pre<lb></lb>sent when it was weighed—the lad was so very particular in the weighing—the other one took the money—the other one brought something at the same time—I cannot say what it was, but he held it down—the chandelier was open when it was brought, as it is now, but the other things were in a basket.</p>

On Saturday night, the 6th of July, the prisoner came to my house, about nine o'clock—he opened the door and came in, and sat down in a chair—I said I was going out—I asked him to go away several times, and he refused—I told him a young man I live with, named George Bowley, was coming—I went out to seek for Bowley, and left the prisoner there—I left a basket and two handkerchiefs in the house belonging to George Bowley when I came back I missed the basket and handkerchiefs—the prisoner was then gone—I was not out of the house a quarter of an hour.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Jones, and live in Trafalgar-row, Greenwich. On the 3rd of December I hung up some clothes to dry in my garden—I missed a shirt between eight and nine o'clock in the even<lb></lb>ing, which I had seen safe between five and six—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I have the fellow to it, made of the same cloth—it is my own work—I know nothing of the prisoners—I observed some foot-marks in my garden, apparently of only one person.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On file 3rd of December, about seven o'clock in the evening, I was on duty in Church-street, Wool<lb></lb>wich, about three miles or three miles and a half from the prosecutrix's, and saw the two prisoners together—one asked me where William-street was—I asked who they wanted there—they said, the night station-house—I said, if they would follow me I would direct them—in the mean time I observed James Wilson had a bundle under his arm—I asked what he had in it—he said a shirt—I asked whose it was—he said his own—I looked at it, and observed it was quite wet, and partly covered with frost—I asked who washed it—he said he washed it himself, at Barnet, the day before, and not having sufficient time, he was obliged to put it into his handkerchief and bring it wet—I took them to the station—Dillon said there that he would swear it was Wilson's shirt, for he saw him buy it at Liverpool the day before they left.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">John Wilson's, alias Dillon's Defence</hi>. I did not know it was stolen; I had parted from the other prisoner some time, and got a ride to Wool<lb></lb>wich; I was not taken that night; they let me go, and I went and got a lodging; I went next day to see how the young man got on, and was taken in the court-house.</p>

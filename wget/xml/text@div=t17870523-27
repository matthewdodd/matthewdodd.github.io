               <p>I was an officer on board the Calais packet, belonging to the Excise; on the 4th of May, between the hours of twelve and one in the morning; about ten minutes after twelve we were alarmed, by a boat coming along-side, which I supposed to be an excise-boat, as we are frequently visited in the night; I was coming upon deck, and was met by a tall man with a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178705230044"></xptr>pistol in his hand; I took one of the cabin chairs up to keep the man from me, while I alarmed my brother officers; I cried out, oh Lord, oh Lord! turn out; while my partner was waking, and turning out, one of them jumped up to the cabin where he was, and stopped him; that was Smithiers that they prevented from jumping out; the tall man that I met first, d - d me, and demanded my money, which I gave him, sixpence in silver, and two-pence farthing, I think there was, in copper, but twopence I am sure of; then he gave me a blow with the but end of a pistol, to make me hold my noise; I was begging for my life; and he bid me go into my bed again; I turned in, and one of them went to Smithiers, and demanded his money; he told them he had none; one of them made reply, cut his head off, a b - r; he made reply, because I have no money, my friends? and another that was in the gang, I believe, prevented him from doing mischief; then they asked us what packages they were that were in the cabin? we said it was impossible for us to tell, as we were only officers on board; but we believed they were perfumery and smelling waters; we could not tell.</p>
               <p>Who was the man that prevented the mischief? - I really believe the evidence was one, and that Romain was the other; they took away three of the packages, and came down and asked me for a candle; my friends, says I, we have no candle; we have nothing more here than what you see; the middle man, which I believe was Cunningham, took the King's book, in which the account of the cargo is entered, and crammed it into the fire to make a light, and it gave a great blaze; then they went up with their packages; they came down a second time, and asked me what was contained in the cag; they asked us round; I said, I believed it to be indigo, but could not tell; they replied, they thought that would do, and went away.</p>
               <p>From the observation you made of these men, can you speak with certainty to any of them? - I am positive sure that Cunningham was one of them that assisted in robbing the ship, by burning the book.</p>
               <p>What do you say as to the other men? - I cannot positively say; but I believe, from the stature of Mr. Romain, that he was the man that prevented them from doing the mischief, or else there would have been murder done.</p>
               <p>What do you say to Hammond? - I cannot say any thing to him; I do not remember Hammond; a tall man came up to me, but I do not believe he is the man; I do not think he is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. This was between twelve and one in the morning? - About ten minutes after twelve, on the 4th of May.</p>
               <p>What hats had these persons? - They had round hats on.</p>
               <p>Their faces were muffled? - The blaze of the book gave such a light to Cunningham's face, and his squinting; I am positive sure of him; I could see all the forehead, and the eyes.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that you saw his forehead, when he had a round hat on? - All the eye brows.</p>
               <p>Court. Did not you say that Cunningham squinted? - Yes, that made me take particular notice of him.</p>
               <p>Did you say any thing on the last trial about the man's squinting? - I was not asked any questions about Cunningham; I answered every question that was put to me; I understood I was asked as to the tall man.</p>
               <p>Did you, the last time you was here, say any thing about this man's squinting? - No, I cannot recollect I did; I did not say any thing about him, one way or the other.</p>
               <p>Was not you as much bound to disclose the whole then as now? - Yes, but the Judge ordered me down, and I asked Smithiers immediately, am not I to speak about Cunningham? and one of the officers of the Court pushed me back, and said no, you are done with.</p>
               <p>You mentioned nothing of the squinting at the last trial? - If you look at the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178705230045"></xptr>affidavit at the Justices, I swore to it there; I spoke the truth, as far as every question was put to me.</p>
               <p>Do you know what you shall get if this man is convicted? - No, God forbid any thing; I am not of that; I would not desire it; I have children of my own.</p>

               <p>I was on board the Calais packet, as an officer, and on the 4th of May she was entered by people who threatened all our lives; three of them came down into the cabin; one of them robbed me of eighteen and two-pence.</p>
               <p>Can you say, from the observation you could make, whether the prisoners, or any of them, are the men that robbed the ship? - I can form some idea of the persons of the men; part of their faces were not to be discovered, only by their eye-brows, and their statute; we had very little light; I believe two of them to be the men that were in the ship, Romain and Cunningham.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You mean to say you was robbed by some men about the same size? - I saw but four of them in the cabin, and I believe them two to be two of the four that were in the cabin; one of the men was taller, but I do not see him here.</p>

            , took a boat from the Tower, and rowed down the river; I was in the boat with them; we came down to Lady Parson's stairs, and boarded the Calais Packet; she was a sloop; we went down into the cabin, with our handkerchiefs half over our faces, with a pistol and cutlass, meaning to rob the people on board in the cabin of their money; the mate and the officers said they would give all that they had; we took from one of the men in the cabin one shilling and some halfpence; I cannot say which it was that took it; they rummaged all about the officers, to see if they had any watches, but there were no watches, and we took three cases; one case was covered with a mat, and we took two trunks, and put them into the boat; then we went down again to ask the mate for a hammer, or something to break open the cases and two trunks; he got out of his cabin, and gave us a hammer; then we went into the cabin again, and asked the officers what was in this cask that stood by the fire-side, and they said they believed it was indigo; we said then that would do for us, and we put it into the boat, and rowed over to New-stairs, Rotherhithe; alongside of the craft we took away three cases and two trunks, and we began to open the three cases, and they contained doctor's drugs; we opened the trunks, and there were two shirts and a great coat, and two or three pair of silk stockings, and some other articles of wearing-apparel with the shirts; then we began to open the cask, and it contained indigo.</p>
               <p>Is indigo and Prussian blue the same thing? - Yes; we began to tie it up in our handkerchiefs, and the wearing apparel we put into the boat; then we left the three cases in the craft, and the two trunks we chucked over-board, and rowed over to Lady Parson's Stairs, and then walked up the back lane; we had the clothes and the Prussian blue with us; we knocked at the door of one Moses a Jew, the other prisoner, about three in the morning; he came down and let us in; we told him we had some clothes, and this indigo, and we sold the property for four guineas, and shared the money equally alike; every one of us went home to our apartments; we four were all that were concerned.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Mr. Dolfin, you stand there with a great deal of ease; how long is it since the ship was robbed of the dollars? - About three years.</p>
               <p>How long have you done business in that way before? - Not many years.</p>
               <p>You appeared then in the same easy manner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>As an accomplice brought from gaol<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178705230046"></xptr>to this place, to give an account of your behaviour? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I am sorry you did not benefit by the warning of the Court; you received warning from the Court? - Yes, I believe I did.</p>
               <p>Then for these three years you have persevered in your old courses? - No, I have not; I have been on board a man of war since.</p>
               <p>However, you have resumed it; you begin now to be a little ashamed? - No, Sir, I am not.</p>
               <p>What office was you examined at? - At Mr. Smith's, in East Smithfield.</p>
               <p>I am very sorry to see you a witness here again.</p>
               <p>Court to Dawson. Were any of these goods ever found at Moses's? - I received a private information that they were at Mr. Moses's that morning; in consequence of that I went up to Mr. Moses's; but when I came there, I could find nothing; Mr. Moses was at home, he opened the door to me, and told me I was welcome to search all over his house, which I did, as far as I thought was necessary; but when I did not find the property in the place where I had information it was, I did not think it necessary to search any farther; nothing more was done in respect to Moses till the Sunday following, when Dolfin was apprehended; the persons of the other three were described to me, and we apprehended them; I am not quite certain with respect to Hammond, whether he was apprehended the day prior or subsequent to Dolfin's, being examined; in consequence of the information we received from Dolfin, we went again to Moses's house, but Moses had been down at the office, and there was word taken for his appearance at any other time, should he be wanted; Moses said as he said before, I was welcome to look any where, and I searched the house, and could find nothing; he was afterwards taken in custody, and admitted to bail.</p>
               <p>Prisoners. We leave it our counsel.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Meriton. What was the value of this blue? - It is twelve shillings a pound.</p>
               <p>What quantity might there be in this keg? - I really cannot tell; there might be sixty or seventy pounds.</p>

                  </hi> I am a gardener, at 15, Thurlow-square, Brompton. On the 4th Nov. last I was at the Admiral Keppel public-house in the Fulham-road—the prisoner and deceased were there—the deceased was quarrelling with every one, and was very much in liquor—he was wrangling and quarrelling with Spicer—he called him a cur, and said he was no man—he then quarrelled with the witness Cook, and wanted to fight him—Cook said he would do no such thing—Birch got up and swore he should fight either up or down, and struck him, knocked him down, and dropped down on him—Cook had a file on the table, and said, "If you offer to hit me I will strike you with this file," upon that Birch fixed him in the throat, and held him down till he was black in the face; at the same time taking the file out of Cook's hand he stabbed at him with it two or three times, and struck him in the eye with the handle of it—I got up and snatched it out of Birch's hand—he still hold Cook by the throat—Spicer got up, took up the tongs, and struck him with them on the lions, and right up the back—it was a very heavy blow, with the top part of the tongs—I said to him, "For God's sake, do not strike the man like that"—he repeated the blow; Birch at the same time rose his head and received the blow on his head—he went out of the room bleeding—I saw him about ten days after—he appeared better then.</p>

                  </hi> I live at 3, James's-street, Marlboro'-road, Chelsen, and am a locksmith. On 4th Nov. I went to the Admiral Keppel public-house—I saw Spicer, Birch, and Fuller there—Birch was drunk—I do not recollect what words passed between him and Spicer, but Birch got hold of and shook him—he was wrangling with every one in the room, and several gentlemen left—he was calling me all manner of ill names, and swore he would fight me, seized me by the collar, pulled me from my seat, and struck me two or three times—I begged him to be quiet, and he sat down on the opposite side of the fire-place—he then jumped up again, and swore I should fight either up or down—I said, "George, if you touch me again, I will strike you with this file," which I had in my hand—(he was called George)—he then seized me by the throat, caught the file out of my hand, and <hi rend="italic">jobbed</hi> me with it two or three times with great violence—he turned the handle of it, and the handle struck me in the eye—Fuller wrenched the file out of his hand—I did not</p>

On the evening in question I went to the Admiral Keppel public-house, and saw Birch standing in front of the bar, bleeding profusely from a wound in the head—while I was speaking to him, the prisoner came out of the parlour, and I said to Birch, in his presence, "George, you have done it"—he said, "That b----y rogue, Spicer, he has done it for me now"—Spicer said, "It serves you right, you wanted to choke the man"—I asked Birch if he would give the prisoners in charge—he said he wanted no law, he would take the law into his own hands the first opportunity he had.</p>

                  </hi> I am house-surgeon at St. George's Hospital—the deceased was brought there on 4th Nov.—I found a lacerated wound on the upper part of the left side of the head, about an inch and a half long—there was considerable bleeding from it—I dressed it, and wanted him to remain in the hospital, but he would not—I told him of the danger—I saw him twice during that week, and then did not see him again until the 24th, when he was labouring under an affection of the brain, difficulty of speaking, and paralysis of the right side and arm—I then prevailed on him to remain—he became much worse—an operation was performed on 2nd Dec., and he died on 7th—an examination of his head was afterwards made in my presence—the cause of death was abscess on the brain following inflammation—I consider that abscess to be the result of a blow—there was a wound ex<lb></lb>ternally—I consider his death to have been caused by that blow.</p>

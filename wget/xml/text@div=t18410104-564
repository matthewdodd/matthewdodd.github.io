               <p>"Cheltenham, 30th August, 1840.—Tavistock Hotel.—Dear Kennedy,—I am very sorry to hear of your misfortune with respect to your face, that is a very bad job, as well as the goods. You see I owe 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. here, for I calculated on having 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Now here is Sunday, and I have not got a shilling in my pocket. Simpson is down here, and he will not go away till the end of next week, and I cannot get a thing till he is gone; and am afraid to do so till he is gone. You mention in your letter that you had not disposed of the two lengths of silk, but you were going to do so with a Jew. Now, if you would send me down a sovereign out of that by Tuesday morning, I should be much obliged to you, for I really want it. I calculated myself what I should be able to get on them, at least 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; but still, of course, if you lost some, it made a difference—I shall not be able to send you any thing till Friday or Saturday, because he will not be off till then, and then I will send you as much as I can. Hoping to hear from you on Tuesday morning, I remain, yours truly, H. Wingfield.—With respect to coming here, and</p>

               <p>going to large towns, I think it would run away with more money than we could muster." [Addressed as before.]</p>
               <p>"Cheltenham, August 31, 1840.—Dear Kennedy,—Simpson left as yesterday morning. I have got as much as I could, for I want 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. very bad now. I have sent you thirty-one yards in one piece, and twenty-one in the other, which we sell at 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; they are excellent. Try and get as much as you possibly can, and send me down an order for the whole amount, and on Friday morning I will send you lengths and silk shawl for yourself. Trusting you will get as much as you can for me, and waiting an answer, I am, H. Wingfield. Be very careful of the paper they are packed in, as some person's name is on it."</p>

I think the first day on which I sent any goods to Cheltenham was about the 15th or 16th of August—my shopmen all went down together—goods would be three days getting to Cheltenham—these lengths of silk are called satinet—they left London about the 14th or 15th—the selling price is 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard—I am quite positive it was on the 18th that Wingfield went—the letter dated the 14th must be wrong dated—I had taken the house at Cheltenham about a week before I opened it—I have no particular reason for fixing on the 18th as the day on which Wingfield went—I do not think it was a week sooner—I cannot show that it was not—I opened the house on the 24th, and sent Wingfield down about five or six days before—my private mark is on the silk, in pencil—I know the shawls by the par<lb></lb>ticular make—there is no mark on them—Miss Thompson made them for me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live in Somerset-street, Aldgate. On Monday morning I went to a house in Whitechapel to sleep; it was not my own house—it was too late to go home, it was 1 o'clock—two young <hi rend="italic">chaps</hi>, William Waite and Patrick Reagan, were with me—I went up stairs, opened the bedroom door, and went to the window—I did not know that the prisoner was there, I had no candle; there was light from the window, it was a moonlight night—when I went to the window I was stabbed by the prisoner in the left breast—I could see him by the light of the window, just as he stabbed me—he is a tailor by trade—I had had a quarrel with him about twelve months ago—I had had no quarrel with him since then, except on this Sunday evening; we went to a public house, and met him there—he was going to speak to me, and I offered him the beer, and told him to drink, and then to speak—my wound bled all the way to the hospital—it was done wit! a pair of scissors; I did not know that until they were found in the bed—I did not see what I was struck with—Reagan helped me to the hospital—my wound was dressed there—immediately after the prisoner stabbed me, I heard his say that he would stick the first that came in his way—I could not rightly tell whether he was drunk or sober, I think he was sober—I had met him tat evening at a public house in Petticoat-lane; Waite, Reagan, and I were there drinking together; it was there I offered him the beer—we went from that house to the Grapes, at the corner of Catherine-wheel Alley—my partner called for some beer there—I gave the beer to another man, and Maden came up as he was going to drink it, and said he had paid for it—I denied that he had paid for it, and with that there was some words, and he and a young man that was with me struck one another—they were separated—I then went towards my lodging, and found it was too late, and Waite asked me to go home and sleep with him—I did not know where the prisoner went to.</p>

               <p>they slept in the same room as the prisoner, but I could not tell that; I never slept there before—there were two beds in the room—I could not tell that the prisoner was in one of them when I went in—I could not tell that he got out of bed to strike me—we went in very quietly—we commenced drinking about 11 o'clock on the Sunday night; I was not in any public house before 11 o'clock, it was about 10 o'clock when I left my house to come out; I had no drink before I left home—I was in two public houses; we had a pot of beer at each, between three or four of us—we were in another public house, at the corner of Whitechapel—we went home very quietly—they did not tell me that Madden lived there—I knew it was the house where he worked; I did not know that he was in that room—I had no conversation with the others before we went up—I had no light—I opened the door—I had been there before, at 4 o'clock one Sunday, and then I knew it was a bedroom—I was never there but once before—I did not know it was Madden's bedroom, I had never seen him there before—I knew the way up the stairs, the others were coming up after me—I had given Madden some beer that night, and we had been good friends.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. I saw the prosecutor at the London Hospital on the night in question—he had a wound under the left nipple, about one-eighth of an inch deep, and an inch long; it was not dangerous in itself—he had bled on the way to the hospital, but not very much—it had been inflicted by a blunt instrument, it was an incised wound—it had gone through the waistcoat and shirt; the clothes had deadened the blow, otherwise it would have been much more serious—these scissors (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) might have caused it—there is only one point to them; they must have been partially open at the time the thrust was made.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live in Wygrave-street I was in company with O'Connell on this Sunday night; he could not get in at his own house, and I asked him to come with me to my lodging; he knew that the prisoner lodged there—we were at a public house that night, Reagan was with us; we all went there together, it was getting on for 12 o'clock—the prisoner was there—we stopped there till the row commenced, and they were all turned out—I do not know how the row commenced, I was not listening to it, I was at the other end of the bar; I was in a peaceable part of the room—this was at the last public house—I saw the scuffle between Reagan and the prisoner—they were turned out—I stopped inside after they were gone—O'Connell then went with me to my lodging, we went into the bedroom, I threw myself on the bed, and O'Connell went over to the window—the pri<lb></lb>soner went over to him; I saw him take up his hand, and when he had done it he went back again—O'Connell told me he was stuck, and asked me to go to the doctor's with him—the prisoner did not ask who it was, not till after it was done, and then I told him it was Reagan that was stuck—he said nothing to that, except that he would have revenge out of more of them—I do not think he knew who he struck—he said there were six or seven beating him at the public house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live at No. 3, White Rose-court. I was with O'Connell on this Sunday night from 11 to 12 o'clock—the pri<lb></lb>soner went with us into the public house—we had some drink there—we were all sober; we had some words, there were no blows—the prisoner swore he would be satisfied to be hung in the morning for me and O'Connell, he would have our lives—we then parted, and he went home—I lodge in the same room with him—we went with O'Connell to his lodging; he could not get in, and I brought him home to sleep with me—he went up stairs first—I was afraid to go up, I stood outside the street door—I did not go into the bedroom at all until after the prisoner was taken—while I was standing at the door, I heard O'Connell call out that he was stabbed, and he said, "Open the door, I want to go to the hospital"—he came out, and I put my cap to the wound to stop the bleeding—after the prisoner was taken, I went into the room and found these scissors in the bed, just underneath where be had been lying; there was blood upon them—I gave them to the policeman—I had seen the prisoner trying to hide them before be got up and dressed—Waite saw me take them from the bed—the prisoner was then down stairs with the police<lb></lb>man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Robert Watt; he lives at Clare<lb></lb>mont-cottages, Hollo way. On the evening of the 11th of May, about a quarter, to eight o'clock, I got into an omnibus in Exmouth-street, to go to Holloway—I went to the farther end from the door—a lady sat next me, and my little girl sat next me on the other side—a young man sat next to the lady, on the cross seat, but I did not notice him—I had this blue satin bag hanging on my arm—a lady who sat opposite me got out, and the young man who sat on the cross seat at the end followed her out—the lady next to me then asked if 1 had lost anything out of my bag—I looked, and found my bag still on my arm, but it was cut, and my purse gone from it—I had seen it in the course of the afternoon, about three o'clock—I had not looked at my purse afterwards—I am certain my bag was not cut when I got into the om<lb></lb>nibus, or the things must have dropped out—my purse had 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in it, in half-crowns, shillings, and two fourpenny-pieces—this now produced is my purse and money.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Charles-place, Hackney-road. I am the con<lb></lb>doctor to the omnibus—I set down a lady in High-street, Islington—as she was getting out, I saw the prisoner getting out rather faster than passengers usually do, and as soon as he was out Mrs. Watt called out, "Some one has cut my bag"—the prisoner was then walking fast—I called after him, and he ran—I ran after him, and he was caught I think in Noel-street, by two gentlemen just as I was going to catch hold of him—he asked what I wanted—he had got his hand behind him under his coat—I took hold of his arm, and he dropped this purse—I picked it up, and gave him to the policeman—I found 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the purse in half-crowns, shillings, and two fourpenny pieces.</p>

               <p>Was there any person with you at the time you was robbed? - I was by myself on foot; there was another person in company with the prisoner; I should know that person if I was to see him; I understand he answers to the name of Richardson.</p>
               <p>Have you recovered any of the things again? - No, none of them.</p>
               <p>Have you ever seen them at any time since? - No, never; I heard that my watch had been sold to a Jew with a watch of Captain Young's who has been robbed.</p>
               <p>When did you see the prisoner after the robbery? - I believe that day week at Sir John Fielding's.</p>

               <p>Can you positively take upon you to say that the prisoner is the identical person that robbed you? - The prisoner is the person that put both his hands in my breeches-pocket, while the other held me; I observed them look at me before I came up to them, which drew my attention to them; they came up to me, and the other struck me up against the bank, and said, D - n your eyes, your life or your money.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner say any thing to you at the time they robbed you? - I don't recollect that he said any thing; after they had taken my money, they stooped for my buckles; I said, Gentlemen, don't use me ill, my buckles are of no value: Richardson said, B - st your eyes, if you say a word I'll blow your brains out; after they had taken my buckles, the person who is not taken, took me by the shoulder, and Richardson struck me on the side of the face with a stick, and said, D - n your eyes, you shall not look this way, look towards London: there was a post-cha ise coming, I heard it near at hand; they left me directly, I turned again, and went to my friend at the sign of the Crown, and told him I had been robbed; I had not left the house above five minutes: the prisoner took the buckles out of my shoes, and some keys out of my pocket, which they put in again. Here is a person in court they offered my watch to that evening.</p>

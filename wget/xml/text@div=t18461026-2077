                  </hi>. I am the wife of Giuseppe Guanziroli—the prisoner was in my service. On the 7th of Oct. T missed two sovereigns out of my purse in my parlour cupboard—the last time I had opened my purse was at eleven o'clock the night before—I had the key of the cupboard in my posses<lb></lb>sion till about eleven o'clock the next day—this must have occurred between eleven and one o'clock—the prisoner was the only person who had access to my parlour—I left her there for about twenty minutes—I am sure the other servant was down stairs—she had not been up stairs during the whole of the day—in consequence of suspicion, I went into the prisoner's bed-room on Thursday, the 8th of Oct.—I searched in every part—I afterwards examined her bed, and found her pocket under the pillow, and in it were two sovereigns, wrapped up—that was exactly the money I had lost—I called the prisoner down into the counting-house, and spoke to her about it—she said she knew nothing about it—I told her I had found two sovereigns in her pocket—the said it was her own, and she did not take it—I bad talked to her about money the same morning, and she said she had not a sovereign in her posses<lb></lb>sion, and had not had 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to pay the postage of a letter since she bad been a my service—my husband is at Scarborough.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the prosecutor's service—the prisoner talked with me about her money—the first conversation was in her bed-room—she said if she had 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. she would have her bonnet cleaned—I said if she asked her mistress she would let her have one—she said she did not like that, having been so short a time—on the night before she was accused she said she would buy herself a decent winter bonnet, and get her cloak out of pawn—I said a month's wages would not do that—next morning she came down and said mistress had locked the bed-room door, and she could not get in—I said, "What of that?"—she said, <hi rend="italic">"</hi> I had a sovereign or two in my pocket, and I am frightened that my mistress has found it"—she said, "If anything is saw about money, you stick up for me"—I said, "What do you mean?"—she said, "Say that I told you I had some money, and did not like to change."</p>

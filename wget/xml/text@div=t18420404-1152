                  </hi>. I live in George-yard. About a quarter to ten o'clock, on the 11th of March, I went with a cart to fetch some coals for my shop—when I got as far as Skinner-street, Bishopsgate-street, I went to speak to a person on business, leaving a hamper of coals in the cart—on my return I found the tailboard of the cart down, and the hamper and coals gone—I called a policeman—we walked up Skinner-street, and saw coals along the ground—we traced the coals to the far<lb></lb>ther end of Skinner-street—we went into a house there, went down stain, and taw a woman and two men—the policeman spoke to her about it—she said something—we then traced the coals up the stairs—the police<lb></lb>man knocked at the door of the back-room, first-floor—after doing so I heard the window of the room open, something thrown out, and the window shutdown again—I think the prisoner opened the door, but I cannot say—a young woman was in the room—I did not look out of the window—I found part of the coals in the room—they resembled those I lost from the cart—the hamper was found down stairs in the yard behind the house, with a lot of coals in it—the person who threw any thing out of the window would throw it into the yard where the hamper was found—I compared the two coals together, and they resembled each other—I should think a woman could not carry the hamper—the prisoner did not say any thing about the coals—the hamper was brought up into the room—it was mine.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a physician, and live at Harberry-terrace, Ken<lb></lb>sington. On 8th May, about 11 o'clock at night, I attended Mr. Horrocks, at Notting-dale—I found him bleeding profusely from the nose, with a con<lb></lb>tused and lacerated wound in the centre of the forehead.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had that wound anything to do with the bleeding of the nose? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I suppose concussion was the cause of the bleeding—no part of the nose was struck, but the concussion might have caused the bleeding; there might have been some previous defect, I did not trace any<lb></lb>thing of the sort—he had been bleeding profusely from the nose from the time of receiving the blow—a druggist had been attending him for some hours before I was called in; I stopped the bleeding by plugging the nose; I stopped it almost immediately, after carrying him to bed—I remained with</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185406120040"></xptr>
               <p>him an hour and a half, and then left—I was called to him next morning, about half past 2 o'clock; he was then bleeding again profusely from the nose; I think that was in consequence of neglect—there are some persons who have the disease of bleeding, which is brought on with the slightest touch, and they continue to bleed for a very long time; it is a disease common in some families—a very slight shake will produce bleeding in such persons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SHARPE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In what state did you find the deceased the second time you saw him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Almost insensible; so much so, that he did not know me; that was from loss of blood—his nose had bled profusely, and was bleeding then—I had given directions that a proper nurse should sit up with him, his wife being eighty-four years of age; and that cold evaporating lotions should be applied to the forehead, and other remedies used; instead of which no nurse was employed, the candle was put out, and his wife went to bed with him—he was seventy-four years of age—on the Wednesday I pronounced him out of danger, I had succeeded in stopping the bleeding, and I thought there was no danger from any other cause—a man of that age does not very readily recover from such a loss of blood, but he had suffi<lb></lb>ciently recovered to justify me in pronouncing him out of danger—the bone of the forehead was not fractured; it was not at all a serious wound—I was sent for again on Wednesday night, about 10 or 11 o'clock, and then found him in an apoplectic fit—he had quite lost all consciousness and all motion—he died next morning at 7 o'clock.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Could you, with any reasonable certainty, judge what the cause of that apoplectic fit was? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I could not with certainty trace it to any cause; there might be many causes; there was no apparent cause—I opened the head, but found no particular appearances—the functions of the brain may be entirely suspended by causes which do not injure the texture of the brain—there was no appearance on the brain directly connected with the outward wound on the head—I found a very slight softening of the brain opposite the wound, but of a very equivocal nature—there was no effusion of blood on the brain; it was a serous apoplexy, not a sanguineous one—I think it very doubtful whether a blow on the forehead from a stone caused all that I saw.</p>

            . I live in Honey-lane-market, and have my beer from Beeton. This pot was placed inside the door opposite to me - I saw the prisoner pass by alone; he passed the door three or four yards, then turned round, stooped inside the door, picked up the pot, came out, and walked off with it; I followed him through the market into Cheapside - he turned to the left; I kept within a few yards of him, followed him along Cornhill, and down Finch-lane, where I saw a street-keeper, whom I told; he went after him, took him in Threadneedle-street, and took the pot from him - I never lost sight of him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not see any more pots on the pavement while you were following me? A. No.</p>

            . I am a street-keeper of Cornhill. Thresher pointed the prisoner out to me in Finch-lane; I followed, and overtook him at the corner of Broad-street, and took the pot from him - it has Beeton's name; he said he had picked it up, and was going to take it to him, that he could not read, and expected to meet a friend who could tell him who it belonged to.</p>

I was going to meet a friend to give me a letter to the hospital - I saw the pot on the pavement, not inside the door; not being able to read, I carried it open in my hand to ask my friend who it belonged to, meaning to return it, and expecting some reward for telling him there was more pots laying about, as there were three more just by.</p>

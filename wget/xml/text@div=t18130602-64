            , and where - A. On the 27th of April she was brought to Pancras parochial infirmary; she was brought in a senseless state. She had fits at the time until the 2nd when she died. On the day following I examined the body and the brain. There were no external marks of violence whatever on the body, except a small wound on the arm and a black eye.</p>
               <p>Q. The blow on the arm could not be the cause of her death - A. By no means. On the brain was an extensive inflammation, the blood vessels being considerably extended, besides which there was an organic disease, a kind of cheesey substance on the brain. The deceased had been subject to fits for four years past. She was a patient at the hospital for four months, in the house. I understood from herself that she had been subject to fits for four<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181306020040"></xptr>years; I cannot take upon me to say what was the cause of this inflamation.</p>
               <p>Q. Did there appear any external marks upon the deceased that could accellerate that disease - A. I think not; it could accellerate it in some measure.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing you discovered in the body after it was opened that could lead you to discover what was the cause of her death - A. I suppose the organic disease would ultimately kill her.</p>
               <p>Q. That disease could have nothing to do with the blows that she had received - A. No, it could not.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it possible for you to say whether any of the blows that was the cause of her death - A.No, the greater probability was that she met with her death through that disease.</p>

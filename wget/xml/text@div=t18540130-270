                  </hi>. I am a haberdasher, at Birmingham. On the evening of 3rd Jan., I was walking in Holborn, towards Oxford-street; I felt a jerk at my pocket, I turned round and saw the prisoner with my handkerchief in his hand—directly he saw me he dropped the handkerchief, and I took it—I do not know whether it was out of his hand or not, but he let go of it—he then appeared staggering like a drunken man—I followed him—he did not say anything for some time; he then turned and asked what I wanted with him; I said for taking my handkerchief—he denied it at first—he then said he did it for want, and begged my pardon—he said he did it to get a breakfast, and that he was a tailor, which I might see by his finger—he then said he did it for the sake of his mother—I said I would not forgive him—he was then very abusive, and he said would I go back with him to his father in Holborn, who was a respectable tailor; I went back with him, and some persons came round—a policeman came up and took him; had he not come up, most likely the prisoner would have got away.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>, 217). The prisoner was given in my charge by the prosecutor on Holborn-hill; he charged him with picking his pocket—the prisoner was not in liquor—I believe him to have been quite sober; he tried to reel and appear as a drunken man, but he was not so in my estimation; he talked at intervals like a man quite sober.</p>

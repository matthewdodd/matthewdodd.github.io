             sworn.(Produces a counterpane, a sheet, and a night gown).</p>
               <p>About a quarter after nine o'clock, on the 11th of February, Mr. Hill, the pawnbroker, sent for me; when I came into the shop I saw the prosecutor and the prisoner at the bar; there was nothing but the counterpane upon the counter; I asked the prisoner where the rest of the things were; the prisoner said, if I would go with her she would show me where the articles were; I went to her lodgings, and behind the door, upon an old hamper, the sheet was hung to dry, which she gave me, and a night gown.</p>
               <p>Q. Before she made this discovery, had you made any kind of promise? - A. No; as I was taking her to the watch-house, I asked her what became of the washing-tubs; she told me, she had sold them to Mr. Prior, a broker; I went to Prior's, with the prisoner, and found one of them; he had sold the other; Mr. Prior acknowledged he had bought them of her; I took her to the watch-house, and locked her up.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Hearne. These are my husband's property.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of them? - A. I said, at the Justice's, half-a-guinea altogether.</p>

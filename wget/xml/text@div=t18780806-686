                  </hi>. I live at 1., Marlow Cottages, Twickenham—on Sunday, 14th July about 3.30 in the afternoon, I was bathing with two other boys, from Mr. Hall’s field, in the River Crane, which is a narrow stream running into the Thames; we were undressed and out of the water, when I saw the prisoner come along Mr. Menn’s filed on the other side of the river with a gun—he said we had no business there we said had leave—he said we had not—he said we had better be quick and dress our<lb></lb>selves—we said we were dressing as quick as we could, and were going—I was just going to get my clothes as he fired—I was naked—he said he would pull the trigger if we did not go—I saw him point the gun at me—I was then about 40 or 50 yards from him—I am and hid behind an iron thing—I was shot in them neck and shoulder and the front part of my left thigh—the other boys pulled the shots out—I then dressed myself and went home—I was examined by a doctor next morning—the prisoner was given in custody that might.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I was not aware than the prisoner was conting to warm us off—I was about 8 or 9 yards from him at first, and I ran away and was 40 or 50 yards from him when he fired, trying to hide behind an iron trough</p>

               <p>that the horses drink out of—most of the shots were in front—I was running sideways and looking back—the shots went into my flesh under the skin; I could see them—I pulled some out with my finger-nail—I bled a little—I used no bad language to the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Twickenham—I was bathing with Brench<lb></lb>ley, and the prisoner and his wife came along and asked what business we had there—Brenchley said we had leave from Mr. Hall—the prisoner swore at us and called us b—liars—Brenchley said he was a liar—he said "If you are not off I will pull the trigger"—I and Brenchley ran away, the other boy was in the other field—the prisoner held the gun up to his shoulder—we were between 40 and 50 yards from him—Brenchley ran to get behind an iron tank, and I ran to get behind the hedge—I heard the discharge—Brenchley came up to us and said he was shot—he showed us some wounds; he was bleeding a little—I helped to take the shots out and we threw them away; they were No. 5 shot, I think, used for sparrows, like those produced.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. As soon as the shots were extracted Brenchley put on his clothes and went home—he was not put to bed—he seemed worse next day.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman T</hi> 435.) I took the prisoner into custody at his house on the Sunday night—I told him the charge—he said he could not have hurt the boy, as he had no shot in the gun—Brenchley, who was with me, said "I had six shot wounds on me"—the prisoner said "A good job if you had twenty"—in going to the station he said "I fired at a black<lb></lb>bird; I did not see the boys"—I found this gun, powder, flask, and shot<lb></lb>flask at the prisoner's house, and five shot in a bag in a drawer, marked No. 5—there was powder in the flask, but no shot in the shot-bag—he said he had been using the gun during the afternoon scaring birds.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon at Twickenham—I examined Brenchley on Monday morning, 15th July—he had six small round super<lb></lb>ficial wounds, and was suffering from a nervous shock, being frightened—the shots had just penetrated the cuticle.</p>

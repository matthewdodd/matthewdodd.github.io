               <p>He used me extremely ill, by reason I was not agreeable to his proposals; he took a large stocking-needle and ran it into the calf of my leg; I cried out, and told him he had run something into my leg; I pulled down my stocking, and pulled the stocking-needle out of my leg; the blood spun out and frightened him; he said he would run and fetch a surgeon to see what was the matter with my leg. I have lived twelve years in gentlemen's families; I never lived in a loose way in my life.</p>

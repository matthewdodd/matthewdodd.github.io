               <p>Q. Did you receive the directions from your master. - A. I did, I weighed out a parcel of Piedmont silk, ten pounds; I am quite certain as to the weight, I put some silk at the bottom of the bag, as I usually do; I called he prisoner to take the bag to the markers, which he did, he took it from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the parcel of silk brought back by Mr. Deboos. - A. I did, in the space of twenty minutes; I weighed it and there was a pound deficient, of Piedmont silk.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was present when you weighed it. - A. Mr. Deboos's brother.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Arabin.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is it since you have been so accurate, and so very attentive to your business. - A. I have always been attentive since I have been in my master's employ, that is my business.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you always so attentive. - A. I generally am.</p>
               <p>Q. Then sometimes you are not. - A. I am always as particular as I can be, I was told to be more particular with that parcel than any other.</p>
               <p>Q. You have made a mistake before, did it not occur to you that the men accused you of making a mistake. - A. I have made a mistake at times.</p>
               <p>Q. And when the men said they were wrongfully accused you found that you was wrong, you found that you was mistaken; was not there a case of three pound of silk that you miscalculated. - A. There was once, that was three or four months ago.</p>
               <p>Mr. Curwood. Supposing you had made such a mistake before, was the silk found in the men's lodgings. - A. No; I am certain I was accurate with this.</p>

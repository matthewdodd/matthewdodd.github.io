I am a jobmaster, of 36, South Street, Walworth—on 3rd May White came to my place about 9.30 A.m.—he said he wanted to hire a horse and cart for a few hours—I agreed to let them for the day for 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which he paid me—he took them away—it was a black mare, a green cart, and a silver-plated set of harness—the address he gave was 9, Liverpool Street, Walworth—the horse and cart did not come back, in consequence of which I sent my man to that address—he did not get the horse and cart—I gave information to the police the next morning—on the following Monday I saw my horse and cart in the green yard at Dartford—White and Bennett were then in custody—I charged them with stealing it—they said they were drunk when they disposed of it, they had changed it away for another one—White said "I had the horse and cart of you"—I do not think he was drunk.</p>

I am a hawker, of East Lane, Dartford—on Saturday, 4th May, I was driving through Dartford about 10 A.m.—I saw the prisoners standing at the door of a public-house—they called me—I pulled up—Bennett asked whether there was a fair or market on—I said "No, there is only a fish market on"—he said "Because I have a horse and cart to sell"—I said "Where is it?"—he said "The horse is in the yard and the cart in the stable," and I might buy it—I went and looked at it—I said "How much for the horse, cart, and harness?"—he said "I have been asking 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I will take 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it now; I would as lief change it as sell it—I said "How much shall I give you to change my horse and cart?"—he said "6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said "I will give you 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—at last I gave him 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I got a young gentleman in the public-house to write out a receipt like this one, and he guided my hand to make an X—both prisoners were present—I asked</p>

               <p>Bennett how long he had had the horse and cart—he said "A good while"—there was no name on the cart—I showed it to my brother and in consequence of what he said I told the police, afterwards I went after the men—I caught them about a mile and a half on the London Road—Bennett said "You have had the best deal"—I said "Have I?"—he said I will give you half-a-crown to <hi rend="italic">chop</hi> again"—I said "I know a gentleman who will buy it if you will come back again"—t'other one says "Let's go back"—we got a little way along and he would hare a pot of ale—they came back to the public-house at Dart<lb></lb>ford, where I told them to wait while I fetched the man—I fetched a policeman, who took Bennett into custody, and I brought back the other man.</p>

I am superintendent of the Dartford Constabulary—the last witness made a communication to me on the 4th May and I sent him for the two men—an hour afterwards they were brought to the station by a constable and the last witness—the horse and cart were also brought—I said "How do you account for these, are these your own property?"—Bennett said they were, and produced a receipt with "W. Bennett, New Gross Gate" on it—I asked if that was his name—he said it was, that he was a dealer—I said "There is something wrong about this transaction"—Bennett said they were his own—he afterwards said he had bought them the day before at Deptford, and he appealed to White as to how long he had known him—White said he had only seen him two or three times, but ultimately said he had known him 12 months—both had been drinking, but knew the questions put to them—I found on Bennett 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., some keys, and a chisel; on White a latch or skeleton key, a hammer, knife, rule, and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he first gave an address James Street, Poplar, and ultimately in Wandsworth, which I believe is correct—I made inquiries and afterwards told them they would be charged with stealing the horse and cart—Bennett said it was done in a drunken spree—White made no reply.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a timber dealer, and live at Little King's-hill, Great Missenden, Buckinghamshire. On 13th April I was in London with my horse and cart, and delivered to my servant, Joseph Cordery, some chaff, corn, half a bushel of mixture, consisting of whole beans, oats, and bran, an empty sack and an open sack, to take with the cart and horse to Uxbridge, and remain there till I came—the corn was in one sack, and the mixture in another, and the chaff, about two bushels, in another sack.</p>

                  </hi>. On 13th April I received this mixture and chaff from my master—about a quarter to 9 o'clock at night, I stopped at the Green Man, at Ealing, baited the horse, and laid down on the sacks under the manger in the stable—I got up about a quarter before three, and gave the horse some more corn—I then went out of the stable to the horse, and in a quarter of an hour my master came and told me there was no corn there—I went into the stable where I had put it, and it was not there—the horse could not have eaten it—the prisoners were then there, and were just starting with their carts; they were close against our horse, and I made inquiry about our corn, and Clark said they knew nothing about it—I had not left the stable</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185205100012"></xptr>
               <p>between a quarter to nine and three—there was another man asleep there, and when I went back he was still asleep; I woke him up, and he said he knew nothing about it—I found the empty sack and the cut open sack which we make a cloth of, in the hay bag of Goodyer's-cart, just behind the horse—Clark drove that cart—when I found that, Clark said, "I know where your corn is," and said it was in the stable; and when I went it was not there—the prisoners drove away their two carts, and there was another man driving another—I afterwards got a policeman, and went with him after the prisoners; we searched the first cart we came to, and there was nothing there—we then went to the next cart, which Clark was driving, and there found the two bushels of chaff, and the half bushel of mixture, and the sacks—the sacks are my master's, and the mixture and chaff were similar to what I bad had—Goodyer at that time was on the top of the load which Clark was driving, and he had hired another man to drive the other cart—when we first tried to search the cart, Goodyer would not let the constable get up, and asked what be wanted there.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long have you been in Tillbury's employ? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He only hired me for this journey—I got to the Green Man about 9 o'clock—there were plenty of carts there, and drivers with them—they all had food for their horses in the same way as I had—some food is made of mixed beans, and some of whole beans; the food is always carried in sacks—there were other horses in the stable—any one could get from the road to the stable who had horses there—after I was asleep in the stable the prisoners came with their horses, and that woke me up—I had not been very long asleep then; it was just daybreak when I awoke at a quarter to three, getting rather lighter—I did not notice whether it was moonlight—Goodyer was present when Clark said he had not seen any sacks, or any corn—they were then just going to leave for London—there are one or two men there who assist in taking the horses out of the carts; they never helped me to carry the sacks of food to the stable—Goodyer's cart was loaded with straw—they had gone about a quarter of a mile when we overtook them—they were not going very fast, they were going up a hill, and loaded—Clark was walking at the side of the horse, and Goodyer was on the top—it was about a quarter to four then, there was not room in their hay bag for these sacks of food—the policeman was getting up the cart, and Goodyer asked what business he had there—he said there was some corn lost, and it was his duty to get on the cart and look for it; the sacks were found there, and he took Clark and locked him up—he let Goodyer go, and he was taken next night when he came down again—I have never been in trouble but once—that was for getting drunk—I was fined; I could not pay, and was sent to prison.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Crouch End, Hornsey, and used to keep a public-house there—on 19th June last, by virtue of this agreement (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>), I let a house called "Alexandra House, Crouch End," to Barnes—he said that he desired to open it as a grocer's and provision dealer's—after he had possession I saw the words "Grocer and Provision Dealer "painted over the front of the shop—I went for my rent after the Michaelmas quarter—I found the windows all smeared over with whitening, so that you could not see through—there was a small portion of bacon and some lard in the shop, but no groceries to be seen—I did not see anything sold—he never paid me a farthing for the rent—there were some canisters in the shop, which belonged to me; the prisoner Barnes had the use of them by the agreement.</p>

It had been a provision merchant's shop before, but it had been closed since the October previous—it was first opened the Christmas twelvemonth before, by a person of the name of Clisby. I could not say whether "Provision Dealer and General Merchant" was over the door when Clisby had it—I won't say that it was not—I know Mr. Masters, and knew that he was a wholesale provision merchant in Chiswell Street—I don't know that Clisby dealt with him—I never saw Wright, that I know of, until I saw him at Highgate Police Court—I don't know a Mr. Nicholls—I know a Mr. Noble, of Hornsey—I really don't know</p>

I am house-agent for Mr. William Elder, of Hornsey, and live at 2, New Road, Hornsey—in March last year Barnes came to me, and said he was to take the house No. 11, New Road, and I agreed to let it him—I think there was a letter passed between us—I had subsequently to put in a distress for rent—this is the distress warrant.

He did not pay the distress out—he subsequently left—we allowed him to take his furniture on condition that he gave up possession—I know Alex<lb></lb>andra House well; it is a shop, and the upper part is a dwelling—I never saw the shop opened.</p>

I am a provision merchant, carrying on business at 26, Chiswell Street—I have known Wright a number of years—on 24th September he came to my warehouse with Barnes—he said "I have brought a friend of mine with me, he wants some very good goods, he has a dairy at Alexandra House, Crouch End, and he is going to open a provision ware-house; he wants something very choice, I thought I might recommend him to you"—I said "Good morning" to Mr. Barnes, and he selected his goods—he was very particular about the quality, because he had such fine families to serve—he selected a quantity of goods—I said "I thought it would be too much"—he said "Well, I will leave it to you," and I said "I think you had better have a less quantity"—he selected goods to the amount of 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. but I shortened them, and eventually the amount was 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he then asked me my terms—I said "Cash for the first trans<lb></lb>action, if it was for the Prince of Wales"—I said "You will see better what you require, and we can come to terms afterwards"—he put his hand in his waistcoat pocket and pulled out a few coins which looked like sovereigns, and said "I have not got enough money to pay you now, send them up and I will send you the money back"—I have never received any money for the goods—they were sent by my own cart to the address given by Barnes, "Alexandra House, Park Road, Crouch End"—I was induced to part with the goods having known Wright so long—I considered it was a respectable transaction, although I did not feel pleased with the money not coming, yet I said "Well, I dare say it will be all right."</p>

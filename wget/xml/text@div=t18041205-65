               <p>Q. Was her husband with her? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My husband was taken bad through a hurt he had two years ago; I pledged these things out of my room, and meant to return them; my husband brought the tickets to the Justices, and I gave them up; he went on the Saturday to pay five shillings for the rent, and said if they would give the tickets up, he would get the things out.</p>

               <p>Q.(To Mr. Wallis.) Had you any conversation with the prisoner's husband? - A. No, I never saw the man but once in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any person, pretending to be her husband, take the lodging of you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he, as her husband, pay you five shillings at any time? - A. The Saturday after she was taken up, he came and paid for the room; I asked what was to be done about my things; he said, he had taken them out so often, he would take them out no more.</p>

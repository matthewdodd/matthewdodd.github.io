On the 21st of July, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I was going along the Strand, and was accosted by a well-dressed woman, who stated that she was very thirsty, and requested I would give her a pint of porter; I agreed to give her half-a-pint, and to take half-a-pint myself; she introduced me into a public-house, which I understood to be the <placeName id="t18270913-17-crimeloc113">York Arms</placeName>

I sat down in the tap-room, to drink my half-pint of beer - she had her ginger-beer in the same room (the house I understand to be in <placeName id="t18270913-17-crimeloc114">Shire-lane, close to the Strand</placeName>

I was immediately afterwards followed into the house by Jones, Palmer, and several other women - they sat down in another box by themselves, several of them; I drank my beer, and Jones, with a woman who is not in custody, got up, and crossed the room to me- I suppose I had been about ten minutes in the house - they crossed the room, and seized me by the throat, as I at oh the bench; the other woman assisted in holding me, while I was robbed by Jones - Palmer was one of them; there were five or six of them; Jones and the other held me by the throat, the others by the arms and legs: Jones held my throat with her right hand, and thrust her left-hand into my waistcoat pocket - I extricated my left hand from one of the women, and for hold of the bottom of my pocket, to secure my property. Jones drew her hand out, and got eight sovefeign out of sixteen; eight still remained in my pocket, they trust me down on the settle, knocked my hat off, and ran away, leaving me there. I proceeded towards the door, to secure them, and was met by Riley - I stated to him that I had been robbed; he demanded the money for half-a-pint of beer, and the ginger-beer before I should go out - I told him I had been robbed, and to let me go and get an officer, and he should have his demand; he said, "D - n all about robbery - give me the money for the beer" - and after detaining me for a minute or a minute and a half, he let me go into the street, without paying him; I returned into the house, having no hat on - he met me in the tap-room, brought my hat to me, and again let me go without paying. I proceeded to find an officer - that is all I know of this transaction.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Riley at the time these women were on you? A. I asked him where he was - he said he had been out to get change - I did not see him at the time; he was not in the way; he at first said he had been out to get change for his master, and then said it was for a person in the neighbourhood. He was certainly not in the room at the time of the robbery. I asked the landlord where he was at the time - he said he was asleep, and had left a child to mind the bar. There was nobody in the tap-room except those who attacked me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What are you? A. A carman and green-grocer. I keep a horse and cart. I had just received the money at Hopkinson's, the banker, in Regent-street. A gentleman in Regent's-park had paid me a cheque on them. I had never seen the welldressed woman before - I met her about the end of Shire-lane; I was never up the lane before - it comes into the Strand, on the other side of Temple-bar. I did not know it was a bad house, or a bad lane; I only went there to get the beer. She appeared a decent woman - I did not give it a thought whether she was an immodest woman. I believe there were five or six women in the room altogether - I will swear there was not a dozen; I could not halloo out, because I was nearly choked. Riley, the waiter, brought me the beer. I had never seen Jones before - I did not notice her being pregnant - I was as sober as I am now. I was too much confused to notice who was in the bar. When I ran out Riley would not let me out of the room - I did not go to the bar. I had never seen any of the women before, to my knowledge. The prisoners had three examinations. I told the same story to the Magistrate; Mr. Halls said I had contradicted myself, but on referring to his writing he found he had made a mistake - that was not about this robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not, at one examination, say Jones robbed you while another held your throat? A. I say so now, but she held my throat with one hand, while she robbed me with the other. Directly I got outside the house I looked about, and returned to the house for my hat: the party were all gone out - I had seen them go out, and the moment I was let out I followed. I do not know whether there is a watch-house near. I have been in the Strand a thousand times, but know no watch-house there. I have noticed the patrols about the Strand, but till this happened I did not know they were officers. The lane I was robbed in is west of Temple-bar - I have not been there since, except with the officer, to take Riley. They call it Little Shire-lane. He conducted me to the house the robbery took place in.</p>
               <p>Prisoner PALMER. Q. Can you swear to my being<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182709130026"></xptr>one of them? A. Yes; I never doubted about you or Jones - it was about some others who were taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you identify me till the officer said half a sovereign was found in my mouth? A. I was put into a room where the prisoners wait to be examined: there was above forty persons in the room. The officer desired me to go and see if I could identify any of them - I turned round, and said they were two of them. They had not told me half a sovereign had been found on her.</p>



               <p>COURT. Q. After this transaction, you speak of something else happening - had you, after the first occasion, seen Palmer till she was in custody? A. No.</p>

            . I am a constable of Bow-street. On Saturday, the 21st of July, about eight o'clock in the evening, I had information of this robbery; I took Palmer about half-past eight, or near nine o'clock - I took Jones about eleven, at the King's Head public-house, Strand, and told her about the robbery at Temple-bar; she said, thank God she was not there, she had been out charing all day, that they had agreed to give her 3s. for her day's work, but she pleased them so well, they gave her 4s. - and as we went to the watch-house, she admitted that it was all false what she had said, and that she was there, and had done the robbery by way of a lark - I had not used any threat or promise to her - I took Riley on Monday morning, the 23d, at the York Arms public-house, Little Shire-lane - there is a court out of Picket-street, into the lane; it is on the west side of Temple-bar - Great Shire-lane is on this side the Bar; the York Arms is in the County - I had not seen the prosecutor till the Monday morning, when he came to the office, and went with me to the York Arms; he could not point out the house for some time; he did not know exactly where it was situated - I found half a sovereign tied in a handkerchief, which Palmer had round her neck.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is Little Shire-lane in a straight line with Great Shire-lane? A. No, it turns to the left - I go up a court in the Strand directly into it; one side of Great Shire-lane is in Middlesex; the prosecutor had given information to two officers in the Strand at the time.</p>
               <p>RILEY's Defence. When this man came in, an old gentleman was there, drinking half a pint of a beer - he called for three bottles of ginger beer, and a glass of porter - I went to the old gentleman, and said, "I wonder what you was going to do with the ginger beer;" the old gentlemen said, he had got three girls who had gone backward; when he had drank the beer I asked him for the money; the old gentleman said I need not be afraid; one of the young women came, and asked me to get change for a sovereign - I went out for it, and as I came back the old gentleman said, "That man has been robbed, you had better go after him, and give him his hat" - I went and met him, gave him his hat, and asked him for 101/2d.; he said "Show me the house, and I will give you any thing" - I showed him the house; he would not give me the money, and I would not let him go out again; he must have been intoxicated, or he would have known the house.</p>
               <p>Palmer put in a written defence, declaring her innocence, and that she had not been in the house at all that day.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Emanuel-buildings, and am a reader at the Synagogue in Prescott-street—on the evening in question I left the Synagogue at a quarter to 6 o'clock—I locked the door and kept the key—the parchment scrolls were then safe—they were in a case to keep them clean—this blue silk (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) I can speak positively to—the pointer (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was on the premises also—I went to the building next morning at a quarter-past 6, unlocked the door, and when I got in I found the back window open, just enough for a man to get in or out—I saw the doors were open where these rolls stood, and they were all gone—I then gave information to the police—I had not known the prisoner before at all.</p>

I am a general dealer of 31, Cable-street, White<lb></lb>chapel—on Thursday morning, the 3d March, the prisoner came to my shop, and brought the piece of silk and pointer produced—the pointer was unscrewed—he asked me if I wanted to buy them, and I asked him to show me what there was—the silk was torn as it is now—I bought the things for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I afterwards received information about the Synagogue—I then went and looked after the prisoner—I went to a coffee-shop in a street out of Cable-street, and saw him there—I called to him, and told him I would give him a job—he asked me what it was—I told him to take some sailor's clothes—he was taken to the station-house.</p>

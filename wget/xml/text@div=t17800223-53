             sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 25th of January I lost a handkerchief and 3 s. 6 d. in monies out of a drawer in the room where I sleep.</p>
               <p>At what time? - Between eleven and twelve at night. I was called down by my landlady, when I went up again they were gone. I took my cloak out of the drawer just before I went down; and then I saw the handkerchief and money. I left no one but the prisoner in the room.</p>
               <p>What is the prisoner? - A <rs id="t17800223-53-deflabel294" type="occupation">hair-dresser</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17800223-53-defend633 t17800223-53-deflabel294"></join>, at Acton, I believe; he was an acquaintance of mine a great while ago, when I was a servant.</p>
               <p>How long did you stay down stairs? - About a quarter of an hour; when I came up he was gone.</p>
               <p>Is your room up one pair of stairs or two? - Two pair of stairs forward.</p>
               <p>What room was you in below stairs? - In the fore room of the next house; when I returned I went to the closet to see if he was there, I thought he might be there out of fun. When I found he was not there, I immediately looked in the drawer and missed the handkerchief and money.</p>
               <p>How came you to go and look immediately in the drawer? - Because he had served me so before, this is not the first time of his serving me so.</p>
               <p>Were these other things in the same drawer? - Some caps; there was nothing but what was trifling. I went after him, and found him at a night house in Covent Garden, and the property was found upon him, in his great coat pocket.</p>
               <p>Are you sure it was your own handkerchief? - Yes; there was

             upon the corner of it at full length, in Indian characters; it was my cousin's, who is gone to sea. I did not want to hurt the prisoner, he was willing to give it me back again, and make it up.</p>
               <p>Did he acknowledge the handkerchief was your's? - Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>The money was like other money, you could not swear to that? - I could not say any thing to the money.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Bridgeman was an acquaintance of yours? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He frequently used to spend his time at your house? - Not frequently.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178002230079"></xptr>What are you? - A servant, out of place.</p>
               <p>You lodge in Drury-lane, when you are out of place, always? - Yes.</p>
               <p>In Shorts-Gardens? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long have you lived there? - Between five and six months.</p>
               <p>Where did he pick you up? - In James-street.</p>
               <p>Did not you meet him in the night house? - I met him at the night-house door.</p>
               <p>He went home with you at that time of the night? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You left him in the room though you knew he had robbed you before? - I locked the street door when I went out.</p>
               <p>You expected to have him there all night? - He might have stayed all night if he would.</p>
               <p>Did not you tell this gentleman you was going to meet some of your friends, the constables of St. Giles's? - No.</p>
               <p>When you came back from the next door he was gone, and you found him at the night-house, where you had met with him before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And though you charged him with the robbery, he would not give up this handkerchief, he would keep it for your sake? - He would not give it up.</p>
               <p>It was past eleven o'clock when you met with him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When he came up stairs you desired him, I suppose, to pull his hat and great coat off, and sit down, did not you, and bid him go to bed, when you went out? - I said there was a bed, he might go to bed if he would.</p>
               <p>Did not he tell you he went away to the night house, because you mentioned going to the constables of St. Giles's to drink with them? - He said he thought I was gone for some constables.</p>
               <p>He thought you was gone to get the constables to press him, do not you do such things? - No.</p>
               <p>You never heard of any such thing in your way? - I do not.</p>
               <p>You know there is money to be got that way? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>You get your money then in the fair trade? How did he get out if you locked the door after you? - He said somebody let him out; I did not leave any body in the house but him, that I know of.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know whether there was any one else in the house at that time? - I do not know whether there was or not.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the prisoner. When you came to this house, and said he had a handkerchief, and he said he had not, I believe you pointed to the great coat, and bid the constable look there? - No, I did not.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a constable; on the 25th of January while I was at the watch-house a watchman told me there was a man in the night-house in James-Street, who had robbed a woman of a handkerchief. I went to the night-house; I saw the prisoner there; I brought him to the watch-house; I desired him to turn his pockets inside out, to see if a handkerchief was concealed in his pockets; he pulled out two handkerchiefs which were in his under coat pocket, and said he had no other. I observed a bulk in the right-hand side of his great coat pocket, I insisted on searching it, and he then pulled out this handkerchief (producing it) which answered to the descrlption the prosecutrix had given of it; he said he did not know how that handkerchief came into his pocket.</p>

               <p>Did he seem surprised when he found that handkerchief? - I think he was surprised; the handkerchief is very remarkable, for there is the name Stubbs stamped on the handkerchief; he said he did not know there were pockets in the great coat, that he had borrowed it of a gentleman that night.</p>
               <p>Did the young woman claim the handkerchief when she saw it? - Yes, immediately; he still persisted in being innocent of taking it, or knowing that it was in his pocket; she also accused him of taking 3 s. 6 d. in monies. I desired him to turn the money out of his pocket, which he readily did, there was about 9 s. 2 d. he accounted for that by saying he had changed half a guinea to pay for some purl that he and his serjeant had drank together, and that was the remainder of the change.</p>
               <p>Who first told you the man was at the night-house and had stolen the handkerchief?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178002230080"></xptr>- One Gibson, a watchman, in James-Street; the girl had given him the information.</p>
               <p>Did you see the girl before you went into the night-house? - I saw the girl in the passage of the night-house; she said there was a man who had robbed her of a handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Did she give you any directions where to search for this handkerchief? - Not the least in the world upon my oath.</p>
               <p>Had you any intimation from any one where to search for this handkerchief? - not the least in the world.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>How long have you known the prosecutrix? - About nine or ten months.</p>
               <p>What business does she follow? - I looked upon her to be a girl of the town.</p>
               <p>She is a notorious street-walker? - Most certainly she is.</p>
               <p>You have known her follow the business ten months? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You know she has lived in Short's Gardens these ten months? - I hardly knew where she lived; they said she lived in St. Giles's.</p>
               <p>When you came to the night-house she was waiting at the door for you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What time was this? - About one o'clock.</p>
               <p>Who first gave you an intimation where the handkerchief was? - Nobody, I first observed the bulk; she said perhaps he had thrown the handkerchief away; he seemed quite surprised when he found the handkerchief; he seemed to have a deal of innocency about him, for that reason I locked up the girl.</p>
               <p>Did he know before you came to the night-house that any body was coming for him? - I believe not by his behaviour.</p>
               <p>Was he ever out of your sight before he got to the watch-house? - No, never, I told him at the watch-house it might become a serious matter, and if he had played any trick with the girl's handkerchief, he had better give it her again; as we went to the watch-house I held him by the left arm.</p>
               <p>Might not he have put his right hand into his pocket and thrown the handkerchief away as he went to the watch-house? - He might; he had all the appearance of innocence as much as I ever saw in a man in my life, except the handkerchief being found upon him.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>The constable asked me what handkerchiefs I had about me? I told him two and no more. I pulled one out of one pocket, and the other out of the other, and then sat down again; He said had I no other pockets? I said I had no waistcoat pockets, and I never put a handkerchief in my breeches pocket. She said you have forgot to search your great coat pockets, I said I did not know that I had any great coat pockets; that I had borrowed the coat of a gentleman. I felt in the pocket and found this handkerchief there; I said it was not mine, I did not know whose it was.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>- READ sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a watchmaker in Little Britain; I have known the prisoner from a child, I know him to be as honest a man as ever lived. As soon as I heard he was in trouble, I bailed him; I would have trusted him with any sum of money; he is a hair-dresser, he waits upon gentlemen at Ealing, Acton. and round about the country; I believe he is as honest as any man I ever knew.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Muir—I cannot tell whether he is living or dead—I have never heard of him since the day when he went out in liquor, which is nine years ago on the 6th of August—I have inquired about him—I applied to the parish, and to many places—he had no relations in England—he was a Scotchman—I do not know where he went to—I have never heard of him or from him—I had my shawl about two years before I lost it—I bought it, and paid for it—I got the money by hard labour at the wash-tub and mangling—I take in washing and mangling—the prisoner used to work for me—I discharged her five or six weeks before the time she was taken—I had the duplicate of my shawl on the mantel-piece—I had not pawned the shawl myself—an acquaintance of my daughter pawned it for me and my daughter together—the prisoner did not steal the shawl, but the du<lb></lb>plicate of it—she bad the shawl on her back in the yard at Worship-street.</p>

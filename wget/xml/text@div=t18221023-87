            . On the 26th of September, at eight o'clock in the morning, I went to the Coopers' Arms, public-house, and waited there till twenty minutes past four in the afternoon. Several soldiers and women were there. A soldier made a dispute about a pot of beer, and while they were talking about it, somebody knocked me down; the prisoner was in the room. I was insensible; I do not know that she did any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. She did not attack you - A. Not that I know of. I never told the Magistrate that she attacked me; my deposition was read over to me before I signed it. I lost my property out of my waistcoat pocket. I was taken to the Castle, public-house, and found the prisoner there; they said she was the person who robbed me. I saw nothing fall out of her bosom; I saw the pencil case, but did not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182210230061"></xptr>see it fall, and never told the Magistrate I saw it fall from her bosom. I lost 1 l. 15 s. 6 d. from my waistcoat pocket.</p>

            . I am a private in the Cold-stream Regiment. On Thursday evening, the 26th of September, I was coming along Broadway, Westminster, and saw a piece of work; the prosecutor was using the prisoner very ill. I said,</p>
               <p>"Don't beat the woman - if you have lost any thing, take her to Queen-square." He said she had robbed him. I took her from him. He took hold of her gown, and out fell the pencil case, and other things. I picked them up - he claimed them, and said she had robbed him of them. I assisted in taking her to Queen-square.</p>

            . On the 26th of September, I was coming through Great Chapel-street, and saw the prisoner in custody of some soldiers; the prosecutor was very much intoxicated, and charged her with robbing him. The soldier gave me two pencil cases, which he said he took from her bosom.</p>

            . I was at the public-house, the prosecutor was tossing with the soldiers for beer; he lost, and was not willing to pay - words occurred between them, and they got fighting and went out. I afterwards saw him beating the prisoner in a most cruel manner.</p>

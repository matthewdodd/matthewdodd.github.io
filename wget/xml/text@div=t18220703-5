            . On the morning of the 25th of March, I was at my door, which is a quarter of a mile from Lay's, and saw the prisoner and Walton, who had something under his left arm in a white bag; Taylor ran and hid himself; I said,</p>

            . On the 25th of March, I was at the Horse and Groom, public-house, Kingston. The prisoner and one Sturkey were there - one asked the other if he had seen Dummy, which meant Walton; one of them said No, and shortly after Walton came in; they enquired for the ragman, meaning Shaw, and between twelve and one o'clock the ragman came; Walton and Taylor went out together, and came back together in a quarter of an hour, with a bag containing copper, and sold it to the ragman for 4 s. 6 d.; he weighed it, and took bag and all - they said they had liked to have lost it, for there were some boys birds nesting in the ditch; the prisoner had a knife, which was notched - he said it was the first time he had ever been in such a thing, and would never do it again. He was talking to Walton and Sturkey.</p>

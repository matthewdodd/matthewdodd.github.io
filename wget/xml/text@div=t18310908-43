            . I keep the Eel Pie public-house, Surreycanal. I employed Messrs. Mayhew and Johnson as my solicitors; I know the prisoner very well - he called on me for 7l. to pay into Court, on the 20th of January, 1830- I gave him 4l. first, and then I wanted change for a 50l. note; I gave the prisoner 3l. afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q.Have you known him some time? A. Yes - I was a client of the prisoner's before 1829, and owed him 20l. for business on his own account - I took no receipt of him for this 4l.; I had paid him money two or three times - I have a memorandum of this, which I got from my wife; I did not employ the prisoner in this business of the 7l. - Mr. Mayhew did; the prisoner introduced me to the prosecutors, and they were my attornies in this business; I cannot tell whether the prisoner is an attorney at all.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You were indebted to the prisoner 20l.? A. Yes - the prisoner did not apply to me generally for money, but for money for Messrs. Mayhew and Johnson, to be paid into Court - I am still in the prisoner's debt more than 7l.</p>

            . I am cashier in the prosecutor's office, and have been so for seventeen years. It is the prisoner's duty always to account to me for money he received - he never accounted to me for 23l. 6s. received in the matter of Taylor. I never received from him a cheque of 26l. received from Mr. Dance, nor the 7l. from Mr. Topp - he never accounted to me for these monies; it was certainly his duty to have accounted to me for them all.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080036"></xptr>Cross-examined. Q. How long had the prisoner been engaged there? A. I think from February 1829; he had a salary of 150l. a year, with an allowance of 10l. for errors, by which losses might accrue to himself; that is the usual course in the common law department - I do not know of the prisoner having agreed with the prosecutors to allow him a third of any business he brought to the office; but it was the custom if a clerk introduced any business, to allow him a gratuity, which was generally at the rate of about a third; the prisoner introduced several clients - I know of no engagement but the regular rule of the office - the prisoner left about March, 1830; his salary was paid up to the 27th of February, 1830, and after that his attendance at the office was very irregular - there was no ascertained sum of money due to him, (at the time he left,) for business he had introduced; I believe something was said about some money - I cannot tell whether there was eleven months of the 10l. a year due to him; I have heard of a notice to produce a bond, executed by Mr. Cuer and the prisoner; but I have not brought it - I saw the bond this morning in Mr. Johnson's hand; I know Mr. Cuer - the prisoner left his disbursement-book behind him, when he went away; I have heard that he went into the service of Mr. Martin, in Red Lion-square - I understood he was taken in his office; I had seen him three or four times after he left the prosecutors -Mr. Cuer came to the office several times; Mr. Mayhew might have been there sometimes - but I do not recollect it; I remember going into the prisoner's accounts with Mr. Cuer after the prisoner had left.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS to MR. MAYHEW. Q. Is this receipt the prisoner's writing? A. I believe it is - I spoke to him about this money of Topp's, and he admitted having received it; I said Mr. Topp had been and said he had paid him 7l., which was to be paid into Court off the 9l. 7s.; I had spoken to him about Mr. Topp's money before, and he said he had not got it; that caused me to write to Mr. Topp.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When was it you spoke to the prisoner? A. I had spoken to him repeatedly after the 10th of January, 1829, and then after Mr. Topp had been - I said he had been, and said he had paid the prisoner, and he said he had - I kept speaking to him about Mr. Dance's money up to the very hour he left; and he always declared he had not paid it - the 26l. was on account of Tebby's insolvency; I directed the prisoner to apply for it, on my account, as I had accounted to my client at Coventry for it, as received by me - I never allowed the prisoner to retain 26l. from the 10th of July to the middle of March; I called on Mr. Cuer to make good the prisoner's deficiencies - I suppose it was eight or nine months after that before I took steps to prosecute him, as I discovered he had kept counsel fees and other things; I then said "Let me see every thing you have done, and we will see what can be done;" he discovered every thing except the 26l. and the 23l. 6s. - I discovered that his security was not available to make good his deficiencies after seven or eight months.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you find out that before you preferred the indictment against the prisoner? A. No, I think afterwards - I cannot tell whether I had any bills of exchange from Mr. Cuer, but I believe there were; I took an assignment of Mr. Cuer's equity of redemption, and I released him from any demand we might have upon him under that bond, but I afterwards refused to give up the bond - I have it still, in case there should be any further demand; I make no doubt but the 7l. was included in the account with Mr. Cuer, and the 23l. 6s. and the 26l. - I did not take the prisoner before a Magistrate; I did not tell a person who applied to know the charge, that if the law would not tell him I would not; I said the indictment would tell the charge before the Grand Jury, because they were sitting at the time: I recollect a friend of the prisoner's applying to me on the subject of this charge, and I recollect saying that the premiums which had been assigned to me had been put up for sale, and they would not pay the money they were mortgaged for; that was after I had preferred the indictment - I had no conversation with any one before; I discovered the embezzlement of the 23l. 6s. when my client came to me, which was, I think, six or seven months after the prisoner left me - I did not then know where the prisoner lived; I thought he was in no service; I went to Mr. Martin's, in Fitzroy-street, and there I found the prisoner - I never went to Mr. Martin's, in Red Lion-square; I asked Mr. Lock where the prisoner was, and he said he was in Mr. Martin's employ - I thought he had gone there, as he was in the habit of doing, to make up some work; I had not then discovered the whole of these deficiences, only monies that I said I would forgive if he made discoveries; I cannot think Mr. Martin would allow him to stay there after what I told him.</p>
               <p>The bond was here put in and read, and the agreement for the 10l.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. I went to the prisoner's house; I asked if she had got a bed out of pawn that morning - she said Yes; I asked her how she came to do it when she knew it did not belong to her; she said she was not aware of the consequences - I found this sheet and calico on the drawers, and on the table I found a bag; the bed was in the yard, tied up in a bit of carpet.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. STURGEON. Q. Did she in any way attempt to conceal them? A. No, she said she found the duplicates.</p>
               <p>MRS. RATHBONE. This is my bag - here is my marriage certificate in it, and thirteen duplicates.</p>

            . I am a shopman to Mr. Reynold's, a pawnbroker, in High-street, Shadwell. The prisoner came to his shop on the 9th of June; she produced a duplicate of a bed, and said she wished to take it out - I got a man to take it home for her; Mrs. Rathbone, who had pawned it, came afterwards to stop it, and I produced the man who took it to the prisoner's.</p>
               <p>MRS. RATHBONE. These were all pawned in my name before I was married, and the marriage certificate has the same on it; I had only lived next door to her for three weeks - I suppose I dropped the bag in the street the night before these were taken out; here is only one duplicate of my ring, which is in my present name.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman, No.</hi> 515.) On Wednesday night, the 30th of August, about nine o'clock, I was on London-bridge, about the centre of the bridge, and saw a butcher's horse and cart coming from the Surrey end of the bridge—the prisoner was driving, and there were two other persons in the cart—I should say the horse was galloping at the rate of twenty miles an hour—the prisoner had the reins in his hand, and the whip also—when he got opposite to where I was I saw him raise his hand and cut the horse with the whip hard—when the cart had passed me twenty-five or thirty yards it came in collision with a light chaise-cart, which was coming in an opposite direction with two persons in it—the deceased, Mr. Constan<lb></lb>tine Briggs, was one of them—he was driving—I cannot say at what rate his cart was going—it appeared to me to be going gently—immediately the col<lb></lb>lision took place I ran to the spot, and on coming up saw three men lying in the road apparently insensible—I picked one of them up, and assisted him out of the road—he was one who was riding in the cart with the prisoner—all the parties were thrown out of both carts—at the moment the collision took place the carts were both out of their proper places—the prisoner's cat was on the off side when it ought to have been on the near, and so was the other cart—the near wheels of the carts came in collision with each other—after assisting the man on the pavement, I returned and took the address on the cart which the prisoner was driving, which was "Jesse Garland, Leaden-hall-market"—the prisoner was in a butcher's dress—I asked him if he was the owner of the cart—he hesitated an instant, and then said "No"—I asked if he had got charge of the cart, and was driving it at the time—he said "Yes"—I saw Mr. Briggs standing with his back against the parapet of the bridge—I asked him if he wished to be taken to an hospital—he said no, he wished to be taken home, where he could have advice—he did not appear much hurt at the time—Mr. Solloway came up, who said he knew Mr. Briggs and would assist him home, and I left him in his charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Garnham, the prisoner's master, who is a carcase butcher in Leadenhall-market. On Wednesday, the 30th of Aug., I went with the prisoner to Norwood—I went to see how the horse went, to try him—I understand horses a little—that was the reason I went with the prisoner—the horse had been brought from the country by George De Coe—we had not had it half an hour before we started—we toek seventy stone of meat down to Norwood—I thought the horse would have run away as we went—there was a difficulty in keeping him in—the prisoner drove him—he did all he could to restrain the horse—he made several efforts to run away on the road to Nor<lb></lb>wood—after we had delivered the meat we set out to return, about ten minutes or a quarter after eight—John Martin was in the cart with us then—the horse attempted to run away several times on our road home—the prisoner tried to pull him up—I believe he did every thing he could to restrain him, but the horse broke out, galloping several times—I do not know Newington—it was going at a violent pace a quarter of an hour or so before the accident—it was pulled up, and started two or three times—up to the time of the accident the prisoner used every effort to restrain the horse—in my judgment it was ungo<lb></lb>vernable in his hands—he was not able to restrain it up to the time of the accident—he had not power enough—the last time the horse started was some<lb></lb>where by the Elephant and Castle—I was thrown out by the collision, and stunned—we were all three perfectly sober—I have known the prisoner three-quarters of a year—he was always a steady, sober, trustworthy person.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher, and live in Leadenhall-market—the prisoner was in my service at the time in question—the horse was a new one for trial on that day—I had directed the prisoner to take the horse—I did not know Baker was gone with him till afterwards—the prisoner has been about two years in my service, and is a steady, sober, well conducted man—I trusted him to drive my horse and cart for a year and a half—when I found what had happened I returned the horse to the persons I had him of.</p>

               <p>Court. What did Mrs. Shepherd say when you took the horse there? - She said it was her's, and she would swear to it at first, but afterwards she did not chuse to have any trouble about it; the horse Chandler saw at the office was the same I shewed to Mrs. Shepherd, and took from the prisoner.</p>

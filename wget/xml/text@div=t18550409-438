                  </hi>. On Sunday morning, 25th Feb., I was returning from work, in company with John Tramplett, and going up Maze-lane, I saw an apron string, lying on the snow—I pulled it up, thinking it was a bundle of rags, and found it to be a child—it was quite dead—I gave notice to a policeman.</p>

From information I received, I went to the place, and there found the child, it was a boy—I took it to the Rail<lb></lb>way Hotel, and sent for a surgeon—on 28th Feb., I took the prisoner into custody; I told her she was charged with causing the death of her child by placing it in a heap of snow, in a lane, in the parish of Isleworth—she said nothing for a time—her sisters, who were there at the time, said she was a wicked and cruel girl—she said, "A good job"—she afterwards said that the child died in her arms, and what could she do with it—I then told her that she must accompany me to Brentford—I got a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and as we were on our road to the Waterloo Station, she said, "I <hi rend="italic">done</hi> it; I am very sorry for it; what do you think I shall get done to, shall I be transported?"—I said, "I really cannot tell"—she said she was very sorry she had done it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. On Sunday morning, 25th Feb., I was sent for to the Railway Inn, to see a child that had been taken from the snow—I examined it externally; there were some reddish marks or patches on the face, but nothing, viewed externally, to account for its death—next day I made a further examination; I observed some similar spots on the extremities—the cause of death was congestion of the lungs—I could not say from what cause that arose, cold or various things might cause it.</p>

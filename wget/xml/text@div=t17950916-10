               <p>Q. What time of day did you see them there? - It was from twelve to two; I see them there and left them in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear they were Mr. Mason's? - Yes, his name is in them.</p>
               <p>Q. Any number in them? - None at all, I am sure they are these me I missed, because I took them in myself of the man. I went from there to Mr Sander's, the constable, to ask his advice, what I was to do in the business; and Mr. Supple gave a very good description of the man he bought them of, and therefore Mr. Sanders said he thought he knew the man, provided he came down in the evening.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see this man take the shoes? - I did not, the man came to me and said he had lost two pair of shoes, and I went up to the shop, and the man described the man he bought them of so plain that I was afraid that it was Collings, who then lodged at my house; I see the prosecutor about an hour afterwards, he did not want to prosecute if Collings would pay the three shillings, which the shoes were sold to Mr. Supple for, and the prisoner then might go about his business, he urged very much to have it settled, and I had five shillings from the prisoner, and I put three shillings own; Mr. Banby or the other man took up a shilling or two, and then there was a demur about a shilling, which was to pay the parish constable; the four shillings was returned to me, and the prisoner has had it back-again, I have given him a little back at different times, more than that since he has been in prison.</p>
               <p>Q. What was done with the shilling about the constable? - The constable returned it, for Mr. Banby and the others whispered together; then they insisted on going before the justice, the shilling was given back to me; I had all the five shillings; he has expressed his regret that he did not take the three shillings, and have it settled, and seemed to pity the prisoner very much, that he had sent him to prison.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the prisoner in any line of business? - No, he was not then, he has lodged with me six weeks; when I knew him first he kept a good house; a gentleman said he would get him a place in the Custom House, and he went out every morning seeking after it, for the last three weeks, at least he left my house is such.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he before? - A gentleman's coachman.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I left a gentleman's service as coachman, the 3d of July last; knowing Mr. Sanders for some years, and he knowing me, I went to lodge at his house; I was promited by a gentleman a place in the Custom-House. But as to these shoes, I was walking along the street one morning, and these shoes lay in the street, I picked them up, and thought they would sit me, and I enquired of some children who were at the door near where I picked up the shoes, whether they knew the shoes? they said they knew nothing about them, and I took them to this man's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were these shoes the last time you see them here? - The last time they were in my parlour window.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I have not let my friends know any thing at all about it; Mr. Sanders has known me several years.</p>
               <p>Sanders. I never heard him charged with any thing before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The reason I left my place was, the coachman and cook had married away formerly, and had gone into business; after our cook happened to go away, and she made application to come back again into the family, and my master took her, and her husband having lived there before, she made interest with my master to take the husband also, and so I was agreeable to go; my master with give me an excellent character, it is Major

                  </hi>. I am a partner in the firm of White and Co., of Cheapside, warehousemen—there are three partners—on 30th April, I believe, 1849, the prisoner came to our premises, and selected some goods—he had previously opened an account with us, and given us references to houses in Manchester and Bradford, on the strength of which we bad agreed to trust him to the extent of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and had entrusted him with some portion—on 30th April he selected to the amount of 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or thereabouts—we should not have allowed that amount of goods to leave our premises on the Manchester recommend<lb></lb>ation, but he made this statement, which I wrote down immediately he left the counting-house, that he belonged to the firm of Kealy and Co., of Galway; that there were three brothers in the firm; that they began business five years previously with 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that at that time they had a stock of</p>

               <p>2,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., all paid for, within 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—upon that, I allowed the goods to be removed—they were 400 yards of silk, some yards of long cloth, and some yards of woollen cloth—I made an arrangement with him that he was not to have the usual term of credit (four months) because it was a larger parcel than usual for that term of credit—he was to pay it by instalments, and before the term of credit expired—he agreed to pay by instalments—in Nov., we received a communication from Manchester—we had then received 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from him on account of that parcel—we had received money for the parcel which was purchased on the reference previously—I next saw him on the day before he was given in custody, about a fortnight ago, at Messrs. Spence, Baggallay, and Co.'s, silk warehousemen—he came again on 10th May this year—he was talking to my father, and when I went up, my father was saying to him, "How can you expect us to assist you, when you behaved to us in the way you have, in getting you a situation"—I said, "When you were here last, you made a statement that you began business with your two brothers with 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-piece," and I was about to recapitulate the whole statement, but he stopped me, and said, "I know I did"—I asked him if it was true—he said, "No, it is false; but it is no use kicking up a row about it"—I ordered him out—I afterwards saw him at Spence and Baggallay's, and gave him in custody—I can tell the amounts we actually received, by referring to this statement, which I have copied from our books—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>) there are four payments of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each on account of the goods purchased on 30th April, and one pay<lb></lb>ment of 39<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on account of the first purchase from the Watling-street warehouse, which is a branch of our establishment—it appears from this account that there was 63<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-worth more obtained from Watling-street on 3rd and 4th May, which have not been paid for at all, leaving a balance of 182<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. against him.</p>

Gibbs did not return this case, but said we might go before the Grand Jury—when the prisoner came on 3rd May, he sent back 32<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-worth which did not nit him, of the goods he had on the references, but not before he got the others away—all he obtained on the references has been balanced up—I was annoyed at the prisoner's conduct this May—I did not say 1 would ruin him in the London market—I said I should certainly stop his credit if I could, if I found he was trying to get it; we lost our money, and I should prevent other people losing theirs—I do not know that he offered to return the goods, if he did, It would be only a figure of speech with him—I swear he did not make me such an offer when I first pressed him for payment in May 1849.</p>

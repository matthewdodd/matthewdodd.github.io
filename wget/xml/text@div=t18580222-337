                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's wife, and live at No. 4, Fort Build<lb></lb>ings, Shoreditch; I am a costermonger. On 12th Feb., I was sitting in Mrs. Collins's kitchen, No. 4, Fort Buildings; only my two children were with me—about half past 7 o'clock my husband came in, and asked me to go out and have half a pint of beer; I said, "No"—he asked me twice, and I refused; the third time, he struck me, and I felt it go through me—I fell down, and do not know what happened to me—I do not know whether it was with any thing in his hands; it went through my clothes, and into my belly—I lost my senses, and a surgeon attended me—I had been away from my husband for five weeks; he very often threatened me with my life, but it was nothing but talk—he never spoke about a knife—I think he had had a drop to drink on this occasion.</p>

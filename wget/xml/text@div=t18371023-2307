I keep the Halifax Head, Princes-street, Whitechapel On Sunday morning, the 10th of October, between ten and eleven o'clock the prisoner came for half a pint of beer and offered me a shilling—I gave him change—after he was gone I perceived it was bad—I cut it—I kept it by itself till I gave it to the policeman—on the 14th he came again for half a pint of beer, and offered a shilling—Thomas Stickley took the shilling—I got it from him—I was at the bar, and saw it was the same that he got from the prisoner—I cut it with a pair of scissors into two bits, and threw It down—the prisoner ran out after I cut it—he said he got it from the next public-house—he then said he received it at Smith's, at a beer shop, and then that he took it at Stratford—he took the two pieces of shilling in his hand and ran off—I pursued and took him with them in his hand—I gave him to the officer—I marked the shilling at my own house—the inspector saw it and told me to mark it again, and I did—there are two marks on it now</p>

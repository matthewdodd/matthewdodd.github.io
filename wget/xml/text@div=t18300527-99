            . The prisoner was in my employ on the 10th of April; I had a hat with red leather, and the others had red silk in them - I saw that hat at twelve o'clock at night, when the shop was closed, at No. 85, <placeName id="t18300527-99-crimeloc536">Strand</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. This is your own hand-writing? A. Yes; what was set down on the slate was rubbed out when I entered it in the book - the prisoner was sometimes there to read it to me; I do sometimes leave it for two or three nights - I cannot say whether it was left as much as a week; I might have been out of town, and then it must have been left - no one but the prisoner had access to that slate; it hung behind my desk- I had a porter, an errand-boy, and a work-girl there - the prisoner was not always present when I entered my accounts; I cannot recollect whether I took it down that Monday night or not; I might leave it till Tuesday - here are two hats marked C. sold on the Tuesday; the one to Mr. Wilde was not sold that day - it was paid for.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Should you know the hat again that was lined with red leather? A. Yes; I have seen it in the possession of Mr. Sharp - it was a guinea hat; I missed it about eleven or twelve o'clock on Monday, when I wanted to show it to a gentleman; I am sure I saw it on the Saturday night, and I had no account from the prisoner of the sale of it - he had no authority to sell my hats without accounting to me for the proceeds.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you inquire of the prisoner for it? A. No, I thought very likely it was in another place, and I might find it - the only hat I received a guinea for on the Tuesday, was one which had been previously supplied to Mr. Wilde.</p>

            . I am a groom. I went to Mr. Perring's shop for a hat; it was brought down to the stable to me - I said I did not like it, and the prisoner said, "If you will bring it back to the shop I will give you another;" and on Easter Sunday, the 11th of April, the errand-boy brought me another - on the Monday I saw the prisoner, and he said, "How do you like your hat?" I said, "Very well, I will keep this;" I had paid the prisoner on the 20th of March for the first one, and it was exchanged on the 11th of April.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Who did you buy it of? A. Of the prisoner; he said, "Will you have it on Mr. Perring's account or mine?" I said, "I don't mind - I will pay for it."</p>

               <p>MR. PERRING. This is the hat which I looked for on the Monday; I had seen it on the Saturday - the prisoner had no interest in it; I have received no account of the payment for it; here is one hat sold by the prisoner on the 20th of March, for a guinea; one hat for 1l., one silk hat 12s., and another hat 21s. - I do not know who that was to, but it is marked W. P., another quality; the other one sold at 21s. was to Mr. Sheldon.</p>

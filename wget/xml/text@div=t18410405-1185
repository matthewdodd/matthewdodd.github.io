                  </hi>. I am a seaman, and live in Old Gravel-lane. I was with a woman in Bluegate-fields on the evening of the 7th of April—I cannot tell who it was—I went to the house of the prisoner Hillman—I paid the young woman 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—She left me—Hillman came up after the girl left me, and told me I must go out of the house—I told her I had paid for the room, and I should not leave it—She took hold of me by my waistcoat, tore two buttons out, and said I should leave the house directly—I had a watch and key in my pocket—the prisoner Smith then came in—she told me I could stop there all night along with her if I chose—I told her I had but little money left—I gave her half-a-crown, and she agreed to let me stop there till morning—Smith said to me, "You had better give your watch in charge to the landlady till the morning"—I said I could take care of it myself—she said, "No, you had better give it to the landlady"—she called Hillman up again—She had left the</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I apprehended the pri<lb></lb>soners on the 7th of April, about twelve o'clock, in bed at a brothel—they were in different rooms—Hillman said the prosecutor had given her the watch to take care of till the morning, that Smith came into her room in the morning, and took it out of a box which it was in in her room, went out, and pledged it—I asked if she went with her—she said, "No," she did not—at the station I put the same question to her, and Smith said, "My God, you know you did go with me."</p>

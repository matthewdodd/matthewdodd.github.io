On the 13th of January, about half-past one o'clock - I saw a boy, whom I believe to be the prisoner, going out of the shop; I had seen these stuffs on the counter shortly before; I looked at the counter, and missed them. I went out, and saw the prisoner with them - he dropped them, and I followed him. They are worth 4 l. - they cost as much as that, or more. He had got out of my sight before he was stopped, but from his size and appearance I believe him to be the same - he was brought back in two or three minutes.</p>

            . I live at No. 82. New Bond-street. I was going along the Strand, towards Charing-cross, and saw the prisoner running from this shop, with these goods under his arm - he was called after, and dropped them; he ran into a house, and was brought out from there. I have not the least doubt he is the person who dropped the goods - he did not say anything.</p>

            . I am street-keeper of St. Clement's. I brought the prisoner out of the house, but I had not seen him before he got in there - he was charged with stealing these goods, which were claimed by Mr. Mathews. He said he was in distress - he appeared so to be. I searched him, and he had not a halfpenny about him.</p>

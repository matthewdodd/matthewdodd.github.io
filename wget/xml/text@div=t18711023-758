                  </hi>. I am a French and Italian agent; at the time of this case I carried on business at 21 A, Jewin Street, but now I am at 130, Lon<lb></lb>don Wall—I have known the prisoner since he was a boy—I took him into my employment somewhere about the end of June, as general assistant—on 23rd September, I entrusted him with 81., to take to the Central Bank of London, 52, Cornhill—it was about 11.50, on Saturday afternoon—I told him to be as quick as he could, and he said he would be back in twenty minutes—he never returned at all—I waited at my office till 7.30, and as I was going home, up Alders gate Street, I met him, half tipsy—I said "Where have you been?"—he said "I met my brother Dick, who, you know I have not spoken to for twelve months, and we made it up to-day; he took me into Cheapside, and bought me some new clothes"—I said "I am glad you have made it up with your brother; but did you pay my money into the bank?"—he said "Yes; do you think I am a thief I"—I bade him good-night, and said "Will you be there on Monday morning?"—he said he should be there at 8 o'clock—I said "No, don't come at 8, come at 9 o'clock"—I was there at 9 o'clock—he did not come, and I did not see him till the Saturday night following—on Saturday, when I was coming from the Post Office, I met him with a man named Milne, arm-in-arm—immedi<lb></lb>ately he saw me he ran up Little Britain, and Mr. Milne gave me this letter, which is in Robinson's writing—(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Mr. Simpson. Dear Sir,—I am sorry to have to ask you to come and see me; I can't really face you any more. If Mr. Milne will tell you where I am, I implore you to come alone. I have not been able to show my face anywhere, fearing arrest; I therefore throw myself entirely on your mercy, should you still wish to carry out your determination, as the imprisonment will be preferable to the torture I am undergoing; but I think your heart is not so hard as that, although mine has been the reverse; but it was the drink that caused it, being the ruin of a good many. However, it will be a lesson to me. I remain, in waiting, yours obediently, T. Robinson."—I then said "Where is he"—Mr. Milne said "Will you give him into custody 1"—I said "No; I have no power to give him into custody; I have no warrant"—I went on with Milne, and saw the prisoner in a court, with his back towards me—I said "What have you got to say for yourself?"—he said "Nothing; I can't speak"—I afterwards gave him into custody.</p>

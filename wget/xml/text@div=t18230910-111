I had a flat of butter in my care. I had just taken it from the waggon. I saw the prisoner there from three o'clock in the morning till four or five, looking at the butter, and other goods standing there. There were nearly a hundred flats of butter there. I believe he was a hackney coachman, and belonged to the first coach on the stand. Between four and five o'clock, a waggon came up and left eight flats of butter, which were put on the pavement. I saw the prisoner, while I was looking at the bill, take up one flat; and I said,</p>
               <p>"Don't meddle with that, for I shall not know where to find it." He made no answer. I went in doors to sign my name to the bill, and ten minutes after, one flat was gone. I followed and saw him in about ten minutes, and charged him with stealing it. He said,</p>
               <p>"Steal a flat of butter! I know nothing of any butter." He did not appear to be wrong in his mind at that time. He was feeding the first horses in the rank.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employment of the Citizen Steam Boat Company, as assistant money-taker at the Old Shades Pier—I was there on Tuesday, 22d August—it was my duty to keep the gangway clear—about 1 o'clock on that day, the prisoner came there with a basket of walnuts—I did not know him before he—put his basket down underneath the window where the people pay—it was a basket with a pile of walnuts on the top of it—I asked him to move the basket, and he would not, and told me to mind my own business—I said if he did not move it I should have to move it myself, because it caused an obstruction—he did not move it, and I put my foot against the bottom of it, and pushed it on one side, and some of the nuts fell off—the prisoner directly flew at me and said, "Pay me for my nuts"—I said I had nothing to do with them, and told him to take them away, and not cause an obstruction—he then struck me in the mouth, caught me by the collar, threw me, and fell on me—I fell on the ground on my left side—we had a little bit of a struggle, and I got away from him and got up—he then attacked me again a second time, and threw me again, and when I was on the ground, he laid hold of me by the collar and knocked my head on the ground five times, I think—he dashed my head on the flag-stones—I got up, and went to try and find a policeman, but could not find one, and living close by in Miles-lane, I ran home—my mouth was bleeding from the effects of the blow—I went to bed, and the next morning Mr. Humphreys, the doctor, saw me—I have been confined to the house a very long time—two or three days afterwards, the Lord Mayor came and took my deposition—on the Thursday the prisoner came to see me—I was then very ill—a constable was sent for, and he was given into custody—he said he was very sorry about it, and he was going to give his name and address.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon at 9, Trinity-square, Tower-hill—on Wednesday, 23rd August, I went to see Pearce—I found him in bed—he was seriously ill with apoplexy, almost insensible, in fact it was with great difficulty I could make him comprehend anything at all—it was very difficult to rouse him—the left arm and side of the face and the left foot and leg were quite paralysed—this state of things went on for several days—there was no external injury of any importance on his mouth—the paralysis that I saw could have been produced by violence or struggling—the injury was to the brain—I thought he was in great danger at the time—I had no idea of his recovery—it was two or three weeks before he could go out—he is paralysed, and permanently, I am afraid—I don't sup<lb></lb>pose he will ever use that arm or leg again—he was so ill that I got the Lord Mayor to come down and take his deposition—that was some three or four days after this—I knew Pearce before—he has had epileptic fits for many years past—I have been in the habit of seeing him—he used to come up to my surgery frequently—this was not the result of any epileptic fit—he had not had one for eight months.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Would the epilepsy predispose him to anything of this sort? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It marks a weak brain, of course—I think it would have more effect than on a perfectly sound constitution—it is a matter of conjec<lb></lb>ture—this was not from any injury to the spine—that would not affect the muscles of the face, and they were paralysed as well as the extremities—the brain is the part injured; the injury originated in the brain—if a man's spine is crushed it would not paralyse his face—I think it was from the knock on the head and not from the doubling of the spine.</p>

                  </hi>. I superintend the business of Mr. John Samuel Crispin. He is a shoemaker, and lives at St. Pancras—the prisoner had been servant there four or five months—he was going out of the shop on Sunday morning, the 7th of August, and I observed his pocket projecting—I passed into the passage after him, and requested him to sweep the door-way—after he had done that I requested him to come in, and said I thought he had something in his pockets which he ought not to have—he drew out this pair of boots—they are my master's.</p>

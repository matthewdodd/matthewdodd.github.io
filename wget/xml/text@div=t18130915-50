            . I am a baker by trade. I have known the prisoner about five or six months; when I first knew him he lodged in Carnaby-market; he afterwards lodged at Somers-town, about two or three months after I removed his goods from Somers-town up to St. John's-lane, Paddington. Mr. Fidlers man assisted me; his name is Taylor.</p>
               <p>Q. After that, did the prisoner apply to you to remove any thing else - A. Yes, about a month after that, it was on a Sunday, I do not know the day of the month; it is now about two or three months ago that I moved the press for him, on a Sunday morning, about a month after I moved the other goods; I removed the press from Baldwyn's-place, Baldwyn's-gardens, to Gwyn's stable, by the assistance of

               <p>Q. Where was Gwyn's stable - A. In Grafton-mews. He said there was something to pay, if I would move it and find a place to put it in for a little time, he would satisfy me for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose house was it removed from - A. I did not know the name then; I paid three shillings; they said that was owing for rent of the room; the prisoner told me there was some rent owing; they said that was the rent. I removed it into Gwyn's stable, and asked the favour for me to put it there a few days according to the prisoner's order; after that the prisoner came to me at the Three Compasses, in Holborn; he asked me if had ever seen any bad bank notes, and if I should like to pass any; (I lodged at the Compasses public-house then,) I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181309150032"></xptr>said I should not like to pass them, I thought it was a dangerous case to pass them; we parted then. He called again upon me, after that he asked me to take some; I drank with him; he then said that he had worked at the Bank; he said if I would pass some I should soon make my fortune; I consented. I saw Gwyn after that; he said a young man had called upon him, and asked if that press was for sale; I said I did not know. I would enquire. I saw Foss after that; told him there was a person that wished to buy the press if it was for sale; he said he should not sell it; put it out of sight and let no one see it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards do any thing with the press - A. Yes; Gwyn and me removed it over to the coach-house, opposite his stable.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards see the prisoner there - A. Yes; he called upon me afterwards, he asked me to walk up to his house; I went to him one evening, and Gwyn with me; he was not at home then; his wife said he was down at the shop in Crawford-street; we saw him at a public-house in Crawford-street. He asked me then to get him a stone as soft as I possibly could; I said I did not know that I could get a stone; I though Gwyn might, as he was so much among the stone-masons. Gwyn got the stone, and we walked up with it to Foss's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the stone given to - A. After that we gave the stone to Foss in the public-house, Crawford-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards do any thing with the press - A. Yes; he came down to us; we walked down to the stable together; he desired us to move the press from the coach-house into the stall in the stable; he said that would do for the purpose that he should want it for. We moved it there by his order.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you do any thing with it - A. Not that time; soon afterwards the press was put up in the stall.</p>
               <p>COURT. When - A. When we removed the press over, then it was put up; after that he came with some paper, and wished us to go the Grafton Arms. Grafton-mews, and in the parlour he produced some paper of two sorts; he asked which would be the best to make Bank notes; I told him I did not know; I thought he was the best judge; he said that was what they called Bank post paper; he thought that would be the best to make Bank notes of. After that we met at the Goat and Compasses Fitzroy-square; he desired Gwyn and me to get some old coal or charcoal, and a saucepan to make a fire; we got charcoal on the Friday evening. He met us again between eight and nine o'clock at the Goat and Compases; Gwyn and we went down to the stable to get a light; Foss got whiting and some oil himself; Gwyn got a light; we all went up stairs together in the room over the coach-house; Gwyn and I lit the fire; Foss made a rim round the stone to pour the pewter in the stone, and I and Gwyn melted the pewter; when the pewter was melted and poured on the stone Foss said he thought it would not do; he touched the stone up again with a knife, and made a rim round the stone; we melted the pewter; he poured the pewter on the stone again.</p>
               <p>Q. What then - A. After that he turned it out again; he said he thought the pewter would do very well; then he mixed some oil and some black on the back part of the stone; we all three went down stairs together; he tried the pewter plate on some of the blank paper; he said it would do; after that he rubbed the blacking on the copper plate, rubbed it off with a rag, and rubbed the copper plate with his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Who produced the copper plate - A. Mr. Foss produced it; he wiped his hand over with whiting and laid the plate on the plank, after he rubbed it over he put a slip of paper over the line of London and the date of the year; he told me it was London and the date of the year.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot read yourself - A. No, I am no scholar myself. He applied another piece of paper for the purpose of making a Bank note, and run it through the press; after that he applied another plate with the line of London, and the date of the year; he told me so; after that we run it through the press again; I turned the press, and Gwyn held the light; we made five or six that evening.</p>
               <p>Q. You said something about the water mark - A. We run it through the press for the water mark. This is the pewter plate; the paper was put on this, and run through the press afterwards. This is the stone; here is where he mixed the blacking on it; after this was done we went up stairs all three of us together; he wrote on one corner of all the notes, six of them; he gave me two, Gwyn two, and kept the rest himself. We parted that evening; he appointed to meet us on the Saturday again.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the plates and materials in the mean time - A. We left them on the table up stairs. Gwyn had the key of the room.</p>
               <p>Q. After that did he say any thing to you about these notes that had been made - A. He appointed to meet us again, told us not to part with these notes, they would not do, he would make some better. He met us on the Saturday evening to tell us not to part with the Bank notes; then he appointed to meet us on the Sunday morning if I could get any burnt oil in Long Acre. I got it early on Monday morning, I took it to Gwyn, and we met on the Monday night at the Goat and Compasses, and the same thing was done again in the same manner as before; about forty only were made.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing written upon them - A. Yes, Mr. Foss wrote upon them at the corner; Mr. Foss took some away with him. I did not take any that evening. The room was locked up as before, and the notes were left on the table.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give any direction what was to be done with the materials - A. He told me to remove the press, and take it away as soon as I could, and the plates likewise, except one plate he wished to be left. There were three plates. I took them to

               <p>Q. Did any body write upon these notes before you went - A. I saw Gwyn write upon some of them; then we went with them to Billericay fair. I passed one at a butcher's shop, another at a public-house, and the remainder I bid fifteen pound for a horse; I gave nine of them for a horse, and the other six pound in good money.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner, Foss - A. Yes. The first time I ever saw him was about six weeks before I was taken in custody. It is now about thirteen weeks since I first saw him. I first knew him by going with Norman to his house in St. John's-lane. The first transaction was, he asked me to get him a stone.</p>
               <p>Q. Before that, some things had been removed to a place of yours - A. Not to my knowledge that it was his then. A press had been removed; that was first placed in my stable.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that a stable to which persons had occasionally to resort - A. Yes; I kept a horse and cart first. The first press stood public just as you opened the door.</p>
               <p>Q. After that, you say the prisoner asked you to procure him a stone - A. Yes, a soft stone as I could possibly get, about ten inches by six. I procured him the stone, and delivered it him. I afterwards saw the stone in his possession, about a week after I had given it him.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the appearance of the stone after it had been in his possession about a week - A. There was the word one, and flourishes round it.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that stone, and say whether that is it - A. I have every reason to believe that is the stone. When he first shewed me that stone he had hid it in a field. He gave me the stone to take care of until I should see him again. The next time we met at the Goat and Compasses.

             was with me and Foss at the Goat and Compasses; he asked to go down to my stable. We went there to look at the press. The press was removed; it had been removed by me and Norman to the opposite side of the mews, to a coach-house. He asked us to move it into the stable, at one particular place in the stable; he said that would answer the purpose that he wanted at present. It was removed accordingly. He said he would meet us again in a few days at the Goat and Compasses. We met there. He asked us to go to a public-house where we were not so well known. We went from the Goat and Compasses to another public-house. We went into the front parlour to ourselves entirely; there was no one it: we had a pot of porter; he pulled out a sample of paper, which he shewed to Norman; he called it bank post paper, and asked Norman which he thought was best to make bank notes. Norman told him he did not exactly know, the prisoner must be the best judge. The prisoner fixed upon one; he said he thought that would do. He said that was what they called bank post paper. He said he would call again in a few days and leave the plates. He came again on the following Monday or Tuesday, and brought the plates to me. He brought three copper-plates. I had not seen any before he left them in my possession. I looked at them. He told me he would meet me and Norman in a few days.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they plates of this description - A. Yes, sir; this is one of them, and that is another.</p>
               <p>Q. You can read - A. Yes. I can swear to these two; that is one of three that he left me. He mentioned the night that he would meet us again, which was the Thursday evening, at the same public-house, the Goat and Compasses, and told us to get some charcoal or old coal to make a fire to melt some pewter down. We got some charcoal. We went to the stable where the press was; Norman, me, and Foss went to the stable. On Friday the prisoner met me and Norman at the Goat and Compasses; he ordered me to light a fire with the charcoal. He made a rim round this stone with some whiting and water while we melted the pewter. He poured the pewter into the mould, and after it was hard he turned it over and looked at it.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the marks resemble the marks on the pewter plate - A. It did. He said that would not do, there was a deficiency in it. The marks then were not so strong as they are now. He ordered us to melt the pewter over again, and while we were melting the pewter he touched the stone with a knife that he took out of his pocket to make the impression deeper, and then the mould was run over again, and when it was hard he turned it over again and thought it would do. I believe that to be the pewter plate in the amended form. After that he turned the stone on the other side, and mixed some blacking and oil, which I delivered to him. Norman, me, and the prisoner went to the stable where the press was fixed by the prisoner's order; the first thing he tried was the pewter plate upon a piece of blank paper, to see whether it would do or not. He put the pewter upon the plank of the press, with the blank paper on it, and run it through the press. After it came off he said he thought it would do, it had the appearance of water marks. The next thing he rubbed some of the blacking that he had been mixing up on this copper plate, and after that he rubbed the blacking off.</p>
               <p>Mr. Attorney General. Mr. Harper, attend to this part of the witness's evidence; perhaps you may be asked some questions upon it by-and-by.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181309150034"></xptr>Gwyn. He rubbed some blacking over the copperplate marked No. 1, and then he wiped it off with a rag. After he had prepared the plate he put it on the plank of the press; he put a slip of paper over the date line; he put a piece of paper over it, and run it through the press; then he took the plate, No. 2, rubbed the ink in the date line only, and rubbed it off as before. He put the same paper over it, in order that the paper should take the number from No. 2. The next thing we went up stairs; he wrote the signature to each of them.</p>
               <p>Q. How many did he make - A. To the best of my knowledge, six or seven. He went up stairs, carrying those which had been printed into the room above; he there sat down and wrote the signature to each of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect what the signature was - A. The signature of White. He then gave me two and Norman two, and the rest he kept himself. He said he would meet us on the next evening at the Goat and Compasses, between eight and nine o'clock. He met us accordingly at the same house; he said it was too late to get some burnt oil; he asked Norman to get him some on the following morning; if he could get it to bring it to him: he could go to work without us. Foss came on the Sunday morning to me; we had not got the oil, being Sunday. At that meeting on the Sunday morning he told us if we had not passed the notes not to pass them; they were bad, and would not do. I had not passed them, nor Norman. We both destroyed them together. We met again on the Monday evening at the Goat and Compasses between eight and nine o'clock. We then went to the stable as before, and made about forty.</p>
               <p>Q. When you say we, you mean you three - A. Yes. They were made the same way as the others. After the impressions had been taken from the plate we went up stairs. The prisoner then put the signature as before, the same name.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, look at this, and tell me whether you believe this to be one made of that batch on the Monday - A. I have reason to believe this to be one of them by the signature, and by the general face of it; 1813 in the date line, and then in the Bank of England line there the year is 1812.</p>
               <p>Mr. Attorney General. The top of the note is 1812, the other is 1813. What name is written on the back of that note - A. Thorowgood. I wrote that upon the back of it by the prisoner's order, for it to appear as though it had passed to other people before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you follow that direction of his by writing a name to every one of the notes for the purpose of circulating them - A. Yes, upon all, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Then seeing the name of Thorowgood written by yourself, have you any doubt that is one of the notes you took of him for the purpose of circulation - A. I am certain of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Norman cannot write - A. No, to the best of my knowledge he cannot. I wrote the name upon them; any name that first came into my head; no name in particular.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these notes, and see if there is any thing written by you upon each of them - A. Yes, there is. I find some name written by me upon every one of them. I am certain they are every one the notes of his making.</p>
               <p>Q. After these forty were made what was done next - A. He went up stairs and wrote the signature upon each of them, and then ordered me and Norman to move the press as soon as we possibly could. We were to move the press, and all the plates but this No. 1, that was to be left behind. He intended to take the date line out, and the number line out, and put a fresh one in.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any distribution of notes made - A. No. He ordered us to take a house in the country, that he might; have an house to go to work. He said by that means we should soon make our fortunes. He was to work two or three days in a week. He wrote upon the back of the notes, them he took away with him, and left the rest for me and Norman to circulate as soon as we could. I passed two to a woman of the name of Jones; these were two that the prisoner made in my presence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards go with Norman to Billericay - A. Yes; that is my native place.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pass any - A. No. Norman bought a horse; he paid nine of these notes that were made by the prisoner, upon which I wrote some names on the Sunday morning before we started.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain that the nine that he paid in part of fifteen pound for the mare were part of those that you saw him make - A. I am certain of it.</p>
               <p>Q. After Norman had made his payment he was suspected and apprehended, and you were apprehended too - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. After you were taken did you state this circumstance - A. Not while I was in the country.</p>
               <p>Q. I say, when you were in custody - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that you stated this circumstance to Mr. Kay did you know that Norman had made any confession - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. How many notes did you utter - A. Five.</p>
               <p>Q. That is five capital offences. Are you out of employment - A. No, I am in the yeast line.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know, I dare say, there was any harm in it - Witness paused.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you give me an answer. Why are you so dumb all at once; you have been so glib in telling your story - A. I have been telling the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not believe all that men swear - A. I do believe there is harm in it now.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you make the discovery - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it at the time that you were in the hands of the officer that you made the discovery. You must have known at the time that these things were made in a coach-house that there was harm in it at that time - A. I could not think it was any good.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you know it was a very wicked crime - A. I did not then.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been in this great town - A. Some years. I do not know exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. Norman was caught at Billericay - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Each of you thought it better to save your<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181309150035"></xptr>own necks - A. We thought it better to tell the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. You would rather any man to be hanged than yourself - A. I suppose that is every man's feeling.</p>
               <p>Mr. Attorney General. You have given a true account of the circumstance - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you did not know that Norman had given any account - A. I did not, sir.</p>

Mr. Foss came to me in the beginning of February to come and look at two presses that he wanted to sell then; while he was there he looked at a press. He afterwards came back and asked the price of the press that was at our shop. I have seen the press since. That is the press that he had of us. This is the plank to the press, and these are the blocks that belong to it. Mr. Hanson agreed with him for the press; he offered eight guineas and the two presses. I was not there when it was finished.</p>

               <p>MR. HARPER. I am an engraver and printer, employed by the Bank of England. Early in April, 1806, I became acquainted with the prisoner; he was my assistant in that employ from April, 1806, to November, 1810; he was only a <rs id="t18130915-50-deflabel301" type="occupation">printer</rs>

               <p>Q. Look at these plates, you have examined them before - A. I have looked at the notes, and the body of the notes is taken from No. 1, excluding the date line; the date line, excluding every thing else, is taken from No. 2; so there is the circumstance of 12 and 13 occurring in two parts of the note. The witness gave a very correct description of it, putting a piece of paper over it; I have no doubt it is so manufactured.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the signature, T. White do you believe that to be the prisoner's hand writing - A. Yes, I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the back of that bank note I now hand to you; do you find the name of Johnson upon the back of it - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you find the word cash upon the back of it - A. I do; I think that is the prisoner's hand writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at the face of that, and see whether it appears to be made in the same manner as note A. appears to be - A. Yes; I am sure it is composed of part of these two plates. The name of the signing clerk is much the characters of the prisoner's.</p>
               <p>Q. As to all that is printed, you have no doubt it is printed from these two plates - A. I am sure of it, by stopping out each with a piece of paper.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, I hand you a bundle of notes, which I call C. these eight notes upon the outside is marked C. - A. These all appear to be manufactured in the same way. I believe the signatures to be the hand writing of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good as to look at that plank, apply one of these plates to it, does it appear to you that plates of that size have been used to that plank - A. It exactly covers the marks. One of these plates called A, is on it now; these plates are capable of making that impression on it. I have no doubt it has been so used. I have examined the pewter plate; there is every thing necessary for making bad bank notes This pewter plate has been cast from this stone; it would give the water mark by bruising the surface of the paper.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My lord, and gentleman of the Jury, I stand before you with all the fortitude a man in my situation can be supposed to possess; not from the effect of hardihood or want of knowing that a just application and impartiality in which every men's case is treated by the jury, assisted by the learned charge, which is delivered by the learned judge, to each man accused; I must take the chance<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181309150037"></xptr>as well as other men, and trust my case with the Court and Jury. If this had been an action for forty I night have had the assistance of counsel to have pleaded in my behalf. Not so now; I am compelled to explain the circumstances which may have run in my favour, although I am obliged to go by the established practice of our criminal code. With deference I submit how improbable it is that I, who have been four years and a half in the Bank of England, should send out notes with 1812 at the top, and 1813 at the bottom, which at first inspection would appear to be bad notes; but how much unlike myself, who had been in the habit of printing bank notes. A man not invested with education would not have acted so as to be accessary to such base conduct. Surely it cannot but be supposed that I should have acted otherwise, instead of bringing forth such things as were sure of detection. With respect to the evidence of Mrs. Elms, can it be supposed that she would destroy the plate of a stranger. No, gentlemen, it was her brother's property; her brother prompted her to do it, them knowing the circumstance of Norman and Gwyn. They disowned each other, and persisted in it, until they were informed the other party had impeached; then the plan of my destruction was fabricated, and these men, to save themselves, would sacrifice not only me, but the whole court. Gentlemen, you see the danger of relying on circumstantial evidence. The present aweful sessions exhibits a melancholy instance of the danger of circumstantial evidence. Some time ago the late Haggerty and Holloway forfeited their lives upon evidence founded solely upon an accomplice, and now at this sessions another person has been indicted for the same offence.</p>

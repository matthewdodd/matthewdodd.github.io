                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's wife and live in Great Camden Street, St. Pancras—on Wednesday night, 13th March, about 8 o'clock, I and my husband went out—we returned about 11 o'clock; we went upstairs and sat down by the side of the fire, the children were lying on a couch in the room; we have two rooms, one leading into the other—my husband passed into the back room for a minute, he then returned, looked round, and took hold of the back of the chair I was sitting on and tilted me into the fire, but instead of falling into the fire I fell on the back of the fender—I said "Oh, William, don't do that"—he said "Now you b—b—, there is no witness here now, you b—, I will do for you;" no sooner the words he turned round and instantly took up the tongs, with which he began hammering into my head and all over my body; I was bruised from head to foot, my eyes were blacked and my nose cut—after receiving about four or five blows I fell and do not remember anything afterwards; when I came to myself I was sitting in a chair with the doctors and police round me—all the six children were in the room, but only one was awake—my husband and I had not had any words that evening, we were quite comfortable, for a wonder.</p>

                  </hi>. I am 14 years old, and am the daughter of the last witness—on this night I was lying on the couch with the dear little baby when my father and mother came home—they sat down very quietly, father went into the back room, came out and said "Now you b—b—I will do for you, there is no b—b—witness now, mind"—no quicker than the words were said he took hold of the back of the chair and tilted her on to the fender, and broke it, instead of her going on to the bars—she got up and said "Oh, pray, William, don't do that, for what will become of my poor dear children?"—no quicker than the words were said he took up the tongs and gave her four or five blows over the head with them, and she fell on the floor senseless—when I saw her fall down I threw up the window and cried out "Murder"—he then said to me</p>

               <p>"Harriet, I shan't be a minute, I am going to fetch a doctor," and he went downstairs—a policeman coming by stopped him and brought him back—mother was then lying senseless on the floor bleeding—my father said to the policeman "My wife has attempted to murder me with a knife"—she had not attempted to do anything to him—mother came in as happy as anything, and said "William, would you like a bit of bread and cheese for your supper," and she said to me "You are a good girl to keep up a little bit of cindery fire for us"—I had jumped out of bed and poked it as they came upstairs.</p>

I am surgeon to the police—I was sent for to the prosecutrix—my assistant saw her first—I found a severe lacerated wound of the scalp over the left parietal bone, about an inch and a quarter in length, and several contusions round the spot—she com<lb></lb>plained of pains about the shoulders, eyes, and nose, but there was no<lb></lb>thing particularly visible there, except over the nose, where my assistant had placed a small piece of plaster—she was low and exhausted from the shock and loss of blood—she did not appear to be under the influence of drink—the wound itself was not dangerous, it was a nasty ugly wound, very severe, and in a dangerous place if erysipelas had set in.</p>

Hill says he got it from you"—he said, "I don't know anything about it; I have not given him any money order"—they were afterwards confronted—I repeated the statement, and also showed him two other money-order, and said that Hill said that they were given to him by Bush—Bush said, "He did not get them from me."</p>

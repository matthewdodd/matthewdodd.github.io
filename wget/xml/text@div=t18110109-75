               <p>Q. Had you any pigs in your field on the 8th of December - A. Yes, in the Spa-field, facing the chapel; there were three of them; one of them came home rather sooner than the others did. I missed two of the sows. On that evening we made every enquiry we could, and heard nothing of them. On Monday an officer of Worship-street called at our house and gave some information; my man went to the Basing House. One was a fine sow-pig, ten weeks in the pig, the other was a young one; I saw the carcases in Worship-street, I am very certain they were my pigs. One was a black and white sow, and after they had been scalded the black marks still remained.</p>
               <p>- ADAMS. I am a servant to Mr. Ashton.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know these pigs were your master's - A. I had every reason to believe they were them. I knew them by the head, and by the feet; the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181101090055"></xptr>fore-feet were not scalded, they were white feet, and a black mark down the back, it was just the same after they were scalded. I knew the breeding and the rearing of them. I missed them on the 8th of December. I had seen them on that day, between ten and eleven o'clock. These were three pigs in the field, one of them came home about twelve o'clock and seemed terrified.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to the Basing-house to Mr. Kelly's. - A. Yes, and there I saw the pigs that my master had lost. I have no doubt at all about it.</p>

               <p>Q. What sort of pigs were they. - A.

I saw Dexton and Mr. Kelly killing the black sow with the white mark. Kelly knocked it down. On Sunday afternoon Mr. Armstrong sent for me to come to his house. On Monday Mr. Bishop and I went to Mr. Ashton's house, to enquire if he had lost any pigs. He described what pigs he had lost, and the description answered to what I saw. The Butcher

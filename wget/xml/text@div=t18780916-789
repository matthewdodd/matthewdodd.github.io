                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the cartage office, Brick Lane station, Great Eastern Railway Company—on 13th August I was on duty there till about 9.30, waiting for Kimber to come back with the goods; he did not return, and we closed the office.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 8, Rockmede Street, Hackney Road, and am a carman and contractor—I saw Kimber between 7 and 8 p.m. on 13th August driving a van and pair of horses towards Stratford Church—the tarpaulin over the goods was one of the Great Eastern Railway Company's.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I saw him going towards Marsh Gate Lane, Stratford, near Bow Bridge, about a mile this side of Stratford—I did not see where he went to or where he turned off; it was nowhere near Brick Lane or Hambro' Wharf.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective</hi>), On account of information I received, on 30th August, I was in the Commercial Road, and saw Kimber at the corner of Morgan Street—as soon as he saw me he ran through a number of streets—I ran after him and took him—he made a statement to me—in consequence of information I received I went with a search warrant to Emery's place of business on the 2nd instant, with a constable named Saunders; he was not at home—I left Saunders there and went away, and returned—I then took Emery into the back yard and pointed out a bottle<lb></lb>basket and a dozen and a half hamper—I said "How do you account for these hampers being in your possession, Emery?"—he said "Oh, I have had them for months; I bought them at the top of the street, and gave a man a shilling for them and a lot of straw"—this tally was tucked under like that—I said "How can you account for that being written on, '12.8.78'?"—I was not aware at that time that the Civil Service Supply Association used this mark—the other label was dated "13.8.78"—he said "I know nothing about it"—I then showed him the bit of tea-chest which I found in the cupboard amongst other things, with "Studd" upon it, and said "How do you account for this?"—he said "I don't know"—I Said "That is one of the packages that was stolen on the 13th, with a number of others"—he said "I know nothing about it"—I found about 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. b. of tea in the bedroom in a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. b. paper packet—I also found this canvas bag; there is nothing on it by which to identify it—I also found a small quantity of soap marked "Hearn," and some packets of black-lead pencils, note-paper, and envelopes—Emery's is a private house with double doors; it is 79, Stanley Road, Stratford, just opposite the sewer bridge; it is the London side of Stratford, 400 or 500 yards from Marsh Gate Lane.</p>

I went with Hutt on the 2nd inst. with a warrant to search Emery's premises—it is a private house, with doors leading into a yard—Hutt knocked, and a woman answered the door—at about three o'clock Emery came home—I told him I was a police-officer, and held a warrant to search his premises for goods stolen by Richard Kimber on 13th ult.—he replied, "What goods?"—I said, "Tea and various other goods"—he said "I never had them here"—I took him to the back-yard, and showed him the two hampers produced marked A and B, and asked him if he could account for the possession of them—he replied, I have had them here for months"—I then showed him the tally on the hamper marked A, and the date, 12.8.78.—he said, "I bought them of a man at the top of the street with a lot of straw, and gave him sixpence for them"—at the station he said, "I understand the charge, but I never had the things."</p>

I am a carman, of 117, Leverton Street—a month or six weeks ago Emery came to me and asked if I could let him have a horse and van the next morning to move some goods, as his horse was not well—I told him I could, and he told me to bring a sheet in case it might rain.—six empty hampers and three sewn-up canvas bags were put in the van, and he gave me two empty boxes—the bags were full, but I could not see what was in them—I afterwards handed the boxes to the police—Emery told me to take the other things in the van and stop against the new wing of the London Hospital, Mile End Road, and he would come up by train and be there as soon as I was—I waited there from half an hour to three<lb></lb>quarters—I went into a public-house, and left the ran outside—he then came with another man I know and said, "I, thought you would have drove further up; stop a minute or two," and he went away again—he then came back and said, "Come on and pull up here"—I followed him up with the van to a little cottage—he said, "Come and have a drop of ale before we in load"—I had a drop of ale and he went out again—I then <hi rend="italic">see</hi> him unloading the van, and he took the things into the cottage—he gava me 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>, for the job.</p>

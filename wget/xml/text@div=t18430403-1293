                  </hi>. I am a livery-stable keeper, in Red Lion-street, White-chapel. The prisoner was in my employ for five or six weeks before the 14th of March—I sent him to the roof of the stable to clear the snow off—he did not say anything when he came down, but when the snow was gone the wet came in, which it had not before—I then sent him up a second time, and said he must have removed something—I afterwards went up myself, and found the lead was off from under the sky-lights—I came down and told him it was not surprising that the wet came in, when some one had been stripping the lead from the sky-lights—it appeared to be gone from ten or eleven sky-lights—the policeman afterwards stopped the prisoner with some lead—I have not examined it—I am a tenant at will of those premises under Mrs. Margaret Craven and others.</p>

I stopped the prisoner with this lead on the 14th of March—I asked where he brought it from—he said, from his work, in Red Lion-street—I took him to the station, and he there said he had found it, and Mr. Webb was his master—I went there, and saw Mr. Webb—I examined the premises, and fitted this lead, which corresponded exactly to the places where the lead was taken from.</p>

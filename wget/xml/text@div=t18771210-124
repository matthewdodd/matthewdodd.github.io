                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the office of my late father Mr. John Gough, of Kirby Street, Hatton Garden—the business is carried on by his executors—Mr. Joseph Nevett is one—on 30th June an account was outstanding to Messrs. Bainbridge and Co.—I handed to the prisoner this cheque to pay it. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated 30th June</hi>, 1877, <hi rend="italic">drawn by A. Gough, R. Bishop, and J. Nevett, on the London Joint Stock Bank, in favour of Messrs. J. Bainbridge and Co., for </hi>29<hi rend="italic">l. </hi>14<hi rend="italic">s. </hi>4<hi rend="italic">d., and was endorsed "J.

I also handed him a cheque—for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and another for 32<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., tell<lb></lb>ing him to hand me the proceeds of the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque—the other cheque was to pay the wages—the prisoner had Messrs. Bain bridge's account—he went out saying he was going to the bank—he returned in about 40 minutes or an hour with the change for the 32<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheques—the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he handed to me, and paid the men with the 32<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he brought me this account receipted on 2nd July for 29<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the receipt is '2777. Received by cheque for Gray Bainbridge and Co., J. F. Y." It is like the prisoner's writing—the endorsement on the cheque for 29<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is also like his writing—it is "J. Gray Bainbridge and Co."—he had asked for an open cheque, as he said Bainbridge's had no bank<lb></lb>ing account—we had also customers named Plambeck and Co.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> We had a foreman named Richmond in December, 1876—the prisoner was never manager, Richmond was—I believe I said at the police-court the prisoner was managing clerk—he had no works of his own to my knowledge—I do not recollect his showing me an order he had received for a steam winch—he said he had entered into a contract with Gordon—he did not tell me it was a steam winch—we undertook to make a steam winch for Mr. Gordon—the prisoner said the order came to Gough and Co.—the work was introduced by the prisoner—Bainbridge's account was for goods supplied to Gough and Co., including the Gordon steam winch which the prisoner introduced—he was to introduce the customers, and we were to manufacture—A. Gough and Co. are general engineers—a patent press is one of our specialties—Richmond went into business and took our shop foreman and some of our men—we have two rooms, one as an office and one as a store—we should all be in the same room—the prisoner asked me for the cheque—I only know of his paying money out of his own pocket for the firm once—Mr. Nevett, the acting</p>

               <p>executed, is a bookbinder, and employs a largo number of hands—he comes <hi rend="italic">every</hi> morning and stays an hour or so—I will swear that—as a rule he stays longer than five or ten minutes—the time varies—he was not there when I gave the cheque to the prisoner—I went to his place to fetch it—I believe he was there when the prisoner asked for it—the prisoner did not say "I have an account to arrange with Mr. Yarrow and shall try for an allowance"—I have known the prisoner about two years—he has introduced other articles to manufacture besides the steam winch, viz., Cole's patent sash, of which he is the proprietor—I do not recollect anything-else—I said at the police-court he had introduced other articles—I know Holder Bros.—the prisoner went there—they do not make the steam winch—I do nut know of an account paid by the prisoner to Mr. Rowe—I never heard the name—a Mr. Pearson has worked for us—I have seen a Mr. Greenfield at our place, but not to speak to him—I do not know that the prisoner did business with him or paid him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the prisoner would pay for railway carriage, &amp;c., out of petty cash, and not out of his own pocket—a cheque to the prisoner would be made payable to bearer—he has never to my knowledge endorsed cheques in the names of the Great Northern Railway Company nor the Grand Junction Canal Company, nor the London and North Western Railway Company—I believe these cheques were made payable to bearer—I do not know that the prisoner has put his name on cheques payable to Mr. Bedford for work done for us and recouped himself—I cannot swear he has not—I do not believe he endorsed a cheque for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 20th August payable to Messrs. Plambeck and Darking, and paid an account of ours to Mr. West—I do not know of an account with Mr. West—the prisoner com<lb></lb>plained of our foreman insulting him—he stayed away a week—I do not believe it was for that—he wrote several letters and telegrams saying he was going to return, but he did not—he was taken into custody on the Sunday—I opened his desk—I left the papers as they were—the foreman was with me—my initials are "W. J."—in July and August I believe I and our foreman prepared an account of all the wrought and unwrought work belonging to the steam winch upon the premises in order that the prisoner might value them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> We are described on our bill-heads as "Printers', stationers', bookbinders', press, machine, and steam engine makers"—Mr. Nevett has an office a few doors off—about the 27th August the prisoner claimed 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which he said he had paid to Messrs. Plambeck and Darking—we gave him a cheque for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the Saturday, and on the Monday he handed me a receipt for 42<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we had not discovered this forgery when the prisoner went away, and not till four days afterwards when Gray and Co. applied for the account—the prisoner did not come back as he said in his letters, and I gave him into custody at Gravesend.</p>

I looked through a hole, and saw the prisoner on the roof, cutting the lead off the gutter with a knife and hammer. I got on the roof, and saw him drop a piece of lead from his hand - he seemed very much agitated at seeing me - I went past him. He came up to me in the yard, and said,</p>
               <p>"What have you got to say against me?" I said I had nothing to say against him. He then said,</p>

               <p>"You had better stop, and speak to Mr. Walker." I saw Mr. Walker coming into the yard, told him that was the man, and gave the prisoner to him. He went to shew Corporal Jones where he got the lead; he took up a tile, and gave him some lead from under it - he was working near the place.</p>

               <p>"You have been cutting lead off the roof." He said he had cut a little off to repair the plumbing work - I took him back, and when he came to the sky-light where he ought to have been at work, he took up a tile, gave me a small quantity of lead, and begged that I would not hurt him, or report him to his master - I gave him in charge. He cried very much.</p>

Yes, I found two ducks gone, they were the only two that we had left; I saw them again the 8th of February at Mr. Wilson's at Darts in Hertfordshire, they were dead; I am sure they were the two that were stolen from our poultry house, one had a white ring round the neck, and the other a little spot of white under the throat; I had been particular in saving them, I meaned to keep them to breed.</p>

Yes; when I come to Whetstone it was four o'clock; on my coming on I saw the prisoner walking along the path; we walked a good way, he said good morning to me, he said he would thank me to put his parcel on my cart; he had two bags on his shoulder, one hanging behind, and one before; he said they were not five pound weight; when the horses stopped at the bottom of the hill, I objected to it, I would not let him; I went to the Dirt House on the side of Finchley Common to have some bread and cheese, I never saw him at all there; going up Highgate he came to me again, and asked me if I had a parcel of his in my cart; I told him no. I asked him what it was; he said it was a parcel of clothes he was going to carry to his daughter, he said thanky, and I never saw him any more; when I came to market and got to the Bear yard, Smithfield, when I took my bottle hay off, I found the two bags laying on the hay in Smithfield.</p>

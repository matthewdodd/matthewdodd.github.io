            . The prisoner came into our house after his uncle; he was crying: he began abusing my husband, and said he would lay him on his own fire and burn him, and he hit his head against the wall. There was liquor left to pay: he would not pay it, and went away. He went out, I desired my husband to shut the windows: then the prisoner came back, and said he would push my husband's head in the dunghill: he hit him, and when he pushed him down the second time, his leg caught in the drain, and broke; which was the cause of his death. He ran at him, as if he was going to hit him again, and threatened that he would hit him; but did not: he died of a mortification in his leg.</p>
               <p>On her cross examination she said that the prisoner said, when he came into the house, that a man had attempted to steal his uncle's ducks; that they knocked him down; that the deceased said to him, You a good man, and cry for being knock'd down, and said that when he was of the age of the prisoner, he did not fear any man: that then they talk'd about wrestling, but that her husband said that he would not wrestle or fight again at any time, unless he was drunk. She said her husband did not call the prisoner back when he was gone away, but only called after him, and told him, that both he and his uncle were shuffling fellows; that the prisoner stript, and came back again, and then the accident happen'd. She said that Parsons and James were not by at the same time, but at a distance by Dewell's cloaths; that her husband took hold of the prisoner by the collar, and tore his shirt, but that he only took hold of the prisoner's collar in order to support himself.</p>

He says the prisoner pushed the prosecutor in the stomach, but not violently; that then he struck him on the temples, which knocked him down; that when he got up, the deceased laid hold of the prisoner; then the prisoner twisted him round, and his leg hitched in the drain, and broke.

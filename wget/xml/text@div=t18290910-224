            . I am a butcher, and live at No. 6, Tower-street, Newport-market; I know the prisoner Newitt. On Monday morning, the 3rd of August, about five minutes before six o'clock, he came and knocked at my door; I was not up - my wife let him in; he asked me if I could work - I told him my feet were very bad, I did not know that I could; but he wished me to go very much, and said he would satisfy me for my trouble if I would go - he told me he had sent some things to Mr. Johnson, No. 92, Edgware-road.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he explain what he meant by things? A. Whether he said sheep I do not know, I imagine he must; I was to go and dress them - he gave me some gamble-hooks, tied in a blue apron; they are to stick in the legs of the sheep to hang them up; I went from there to a gin-shop with him, and he gave me a drop of gin; and from there I went to No. 92, Edgware-road - he did not go with me, I understood him that he was going to Smithfield - he told me to go on to Mr. Johnson's, and there was somebody there to help me kill these things; I parted from him when he told me he was going to Smithfield, and got to Johnson's about half-past seven o'clock - I was very lame, and not able to walk fast; when I got near Johnson's I saw the door was open, and some sheep in the road at a distance - I suppose about thirty, but did not count them; I saw two men at a distance with the sheep; I went into Johnson's shop - there was no person in the shop then; I called Johnson - the sheep were driven into the shop; I assisted to drive them in - the other two men, Mr. Johnson, and other people who were passing, also assisted; they might be ten minutes or a quarter of an hour bringing the sheep in; I could not swear to the two other men who were with the sheep - I never saw them before to my knowledge - I never saw the other prisoners to my knowledge till they were at Hatton-garden - I cannot swear at all to them; I never saw them before - if they are the men, they were dressed different at the office, and I considered that one was taller and the other shorter than the prisoners - to the best of my knowledge they were; I then went to get somebody to help me kill these sheep; I returned about half-past ten or a quarter to eleven o'clock;

             and a man called Poultice, were the men who returned with me to assist in killing them - when I returned with them I saw Newitt forty or fifty yards on this side Johnson's house; I told him there was nobody there to help me, and I had been to fetch these two men; he asked if we would have some gin, to the best of my knowledge; he said he had heard in Holborn that there was nobody to help - he told us to go and get to work, to get some sheep dead; the men who was with me went and stuck the sheep, and I was stripping ready to dress them - I went in with them; Newitt came in a little time, and brought some ale into the yard in a pot while we were engaged with the sheep - I did not count them and cannot say how many were killed - we killed the whole in the yard, which was about thirty; I did not take notice what breed they were: there was no black one; there was a kind of brown one.</p>
               <p>Q. Come, Sir, was there a black sheep? A. There was a kind of blackish cast sheep; I cannot say it was a black one - I believe Newitt stuck one or two of them himself; but I was engaged in dressing them and took no notice particularly. Newitt said he wished to get them dead soon that they might get stiff, as he wanted to send them to market; we got done between five and six o'clock I think, but cannot exactly say the time: Newitt did not stay till we had done; he left in the morning: I did not see him again till about six, when I saw him at the public-house next door to Johnson's - Wincott and Poultice were there, and Newitt, I believe, paid them for their work; he paid them 3s. or 3s. 6d., I believe, but I cannot exactly say, as I did not count the money. I saw Newitt again that evening, in a cart near the Hop-pole public-house, Edgware-road; it might be between six and seven - a person named Clark was in the cart with him and a little girl; I got into the cart: there was a sack in it containing some substance, but I did not look inside it - I believe it was fat, but cannot say; I believe there were some skins in the cart; they were sheep or lamb skins - we went down to Clare-market in the cart, to Mr. Sadler's; the sack was taken out and delivered into Sadler's - I cannot exactly say whether Clark or Newitt took it out - next day, Tuesday, about six or seven o'clock in the evening, I was at the Green Man public-house, Coal-yard, Drury-lane, and saw Newitt there; other people were in the house - I cannot exactly say who; Newitt then paid me for my trouble.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. About six in the morning you saw somebody drive the sheep into this place? A. Yes, it was broad day-light. I said at the office that my belief was that neither Williams nor Dennington were the men; I believe neither of them are the men I saw.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you known Newitt long? A. Some years; there was no concealment in the transaction; it all took place in open daylight - I cannot tell how far Newitt's house is from Islington, but I suppose about three miles and a half; I have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182909100103"></xptr>always understood that he was labouring under dropsy, and he has been rather lumpy, like other butchers; he cannot walk very fast - I did not notice the sheep skins so as to know them again, and cannot speak to them; my business was to dress the sheep.</p>

            . I live in Little Grove-street, Lisson-grove; and am a porter, and keep a horse and cart - I have known Newitt many years. On Sunday evening, the 2nd of August, I saw him at my house - two of the Johnsons' were at my house at the time - Newitt said to Johnson, that as he was out of business, he must do something for a livelihood, and he would buy a few sheep, if he could have a place to carcase them: Johnson told him if he did buy any, to send them to his house and he would kill them for him - he said nothing about killing them at my place, I believe: I might say I had no place that would do - I went to Johnson's next evening with my yokes and pails to fetch some offal for my pigs; I had my pails full of offal and was coming away, when I saw Newitt - he said he wished me to go home with the offal, and then to bring my horse and cart to take away the fat and skins; I took my horse and cart there: my little boy was in it - the fat and skins were put in by some of the men who had been employed; I did not count the skins - they threw them in any how; Newitt was there: they said there was a certain number - I cannot say whether Newitt was there then.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did they mention any number, and if so was it in Newitt's presence? A. I do not think he was there - I saw the skins put in, but did not count them; I never had such things in my cart before, and do not know how many there were - there were above twenty, I am confident; I think there were about twenty, or above - there were above twenty; Newitt told me I was to go first to Clare-market with the fat, and the skins were to go to the foot of Blackfriars-bridge; Newitt and my boy went in the cart with me - we took Holloway up at the Hop-pole, in Edgware-road, and got to Sadler's fat house in Clare-market, about seven o'clock; we had all the fat taken out - I went up into the loft to see it weighed - it weighed 30st. 1 lb., I think; while I was there I saw three sovereigns given, I think by young Mr. Sadler, to Newitt in part payment - I had left the skins in the cart at the door; while I was in the house my little boy, who was standing at the door, sang out, "Father, father, somebody has taken our Peggy away;" that is the name of our horse - Newitt was at that time down below, just where the boy was; I went down, and the horse and cart were gone - I found Newitt there, and asked why he took the horse and cart away without my consent or knowledge; he said why did I bring my little boy with me for, I would not do to go with the cart - I abused him very much for taking the cart away; he said, "Never mind, it will be all right bye and bye when the cart will meet us in Holborn" - I went to a public-house in the market with him and Sadler's man; I and my boy then walked with Newitt to the White Horse, Holborn - he said the horse and cart would meet us at that public-house; it came after we got there - I suppose that was about an hour and a half after it had been taken from Clare-market; I cannot positively say who the person was who got out of the cart when it returned, whether it was one or two, but I saw a party go across the road - there were no skins in the cart then; I parted with Newitt directly I got my cart, and went away - Newitt told me to be sure to be in time at Johnson's next morning for the sheep, to take them to Newgate-market; I went there next morning, about half-past five o'clock - I was to have been there at five; twenty sheep were put into my cart there to go to Newgate-market; fourteen were taken to Mr. Pocklinton's, and six to Chandler's, both in Newgate-market - they were left there in Newitt's name.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you make any particular observation of the skins? A. No, not to know them again.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When you came down stairs, after weighing the fat, was the cart gone out of sight? A. Yes; I cannot say who went in it.</p>

             re-examined. Q. When you came to Clare-market, and the fat was taken out, what became of you? A.

               <p>JURY. Q. Is it not usual to be paid at so much a head for dressing sheep? A. Yes; my work was 1 1/4d. a head, but I had to go backward and forward for a man to assist and he gave me 5s. for my trouble, without mentioning the number of sheep, and I did not count them.</p>

            . I am in the employ of my brother, who is a butcher in Edgware-road. On Sunday evening, I was at Clark's house; Newitt was there - I got up next morning about a quarter to eight o'clock, and found some sheep at the house - my brother called me; there were thirty sheep, but I never counted them - one of the drovers, I think, told me there were thirty; I saw the prisoner Dennington as one of the drovers of the sheep that morning - there were three men with the sheep when I got up; Holloway was one - I cannot speak to the person of the third; there was one which we term a black sheep - it had a black face, and was black in the neck - I considered them Leicestershire sheep; one of the men said, "Poke that black b-r in, and that will frighten all the rest." Dennington was there then, but whether it was him used that expression, I cannot say; the sheep were got in - I was not there while they were being killed - I met Newitt by St. Giles's pound about ten o'clock, in a cart, as I was going to Smithfield with my brother; he was going in a direction to my brother's house - he got out, and I said to him, "You have been as good as your word, you have sent thirty sheep home;" he said, Yes -I asked him who he traded with; he told me he bought them of Ebb - I know a person of that name who deals in sheep; I said, "How did you come on?" meaning, how did he buy them - he said he thought he had bought them rather too dear, but he did not know how they would turn out; we had something to drink together at the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182909100104"></xptr>pound, and parted - I went on to market, and he to my brother's; I saw him again about seven o'clock in the evening at my brother's - the sheep had been killed then, and all hung out of doors in public view; he did not say what he meant to do with them - he asked if I would buy any; I agreed that I should have a couple at whatever he might sell the others at market - he had told Clark to come for the offal; I was to buy two sheep for whatever the others fetched at market - it was not said in my presence what was to be done with the rest; I know Mr. Nicholl, and saw him at my brother's next morning -Newitt was there, and sold him two sheep; I remember some of the sheep were double-lined, as we term them - it is customary for butchers in general to put a mark of their own on them; I do not consider that these had any butcher's mark.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you take any particular notice of the skins? A. No, I should not like to swear to them. I have known Newitt seventeen or eighteen years; I am certain he was not the third person who drove the sheep in.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. At what time did you first see the sheep? A. About a quarter to eight; my brother's name is William - he had been up before me, and came up to call me; his daughter was up before him, and she called him - they had a better opportunity of seeing the sheep and the men than I did; I had not been acquainted with Dennington - I have seen him at work at Smithfield before among a variety of drovers, but never spoke to him; I conceived it to be a fair and open transaction - there was no concealment about it; I was not desired to say nothing about it - the sheep were exposed as publicly as possible when dressed.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. How far are Thompson's layers from Johnson's? A. Nearly three miles, I should think; I have no doubt of Dennington being one of the men.</p>

            . I am sometimes called Poultice - I am a butcher and porter, and live in Newgate-market. I know Holloway, and remember going with him to Johnson's, in Edgeware-road, on a Monday in August to kill some sheep - thirty were killed; I assisted - I cannot say what breed they were; Wincott was there - he skinned them; I legged them all but two; I have since been shewn twenty-seven skins by Limbrick - I examined them, but cannot say whether they are the skins of the sheep which were killed that morning, but they were in the same way as I generally leg sheep; there was one black sheep, and there was the skin of a black sheep among those shewn to me, and only one.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, I ask what your belief is as to to their being the skins of the sheep you killed? A. I do not know them any more than by legging them, and there was a black sheep among them, but I do not know by the legging whether they are the skins or not - I cannot say whether they are or are not the same: I believe they are the skins, but the only reason I have is that they are legged as I leg them, and there was a black one.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What do you mean by legging? A. Skinning the fore and hind quarters; other persons may leg them in the same way.</p>

            . I am a butcher, and live in the Edgware-road. I remember thirty sheep being brought to my house on the 3rd of August, between seven and eight o'clock in the morning; they were Leicestershire sheep: one was a black one: two men accompanied them- Williams was one of them; Newitt came to my house that day - I advised him to kill only ten, and send the others out to field; he said he thought he should kill about fifteen, but when I came home they were all killed; it being hot whether I thought it not right to kill them all- when they came Williams said he had brought some sheep for Mr. Newitt.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How often were you examined at the office? A. Twice, or, I believe, three times; I said at the two first examinations, that I could not swear to Williams, but said at the third examination I could.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You were up before your brother that morning? A. Yes; my little girl called me - I did not take particular notice of the sheep - it did not strike me that there was any thing wrong.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Explain how it is you can swear to Williams? A.

            . I am Johnson's daughter. I remember thirty sheep coming to my father's house, about seven o'clock in the morning; I opened the door - Dennington was there (pointing to him) - the sheep were not there then; Dennington said was that Mr. Johnson's - I said Yes; he said the sheep were a little higher up, and he would go and fetch them - I saw them brought in; there was a black one among them: I went and told my father.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Have you no doubt about Dennington? A. No; I did not know him before - he was not pointed out to me at the office; I pointed him out - the Magistrate told me his name; my uncle pointed over to Dennington just now, while I was looking about; I have always told the same story about this - I have said it was on a Friday that the sheep came, and I say so now; I have no more doubt of that than I have of Dennington's person.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Whether it was Friday or not, was it the same day as the sheep were killed? A. Yes; I saw Mr. Newitt there.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. How soon afterwards did you see the man? A.

               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Was when you were before the Magistrate the first time you saw Dennington after that? A. Yes - the Magistrate pointed him out then; I had pointed him out myself before the Magistrate told me his name - the Magistrate then said his name was Dennington - there were four people at the office when I pointed him out; there were no more prisoners there - he stood at the end of the bar; there were other people standing at the end of the bar; I was not told the people who had been at our house were standing there - only one person besides him stood at the end of the bar; nobody had told me he was the man.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. You opened the door to Dennington - did you continue in the shop, or go up stairs? A. I stood on the stairs, about an hour, while they were driving them in; the door opens into the shop - I could see the shop from the stairs; my uncle and father came into the shop; I called them while he was gone for the sheep - when they were driven in Dennington came into the shop, so did my uncle and father; I saw no other man came in, nor did I see any body outside; I stood on the stairs till they were driven in- I never saw thirty sheep come into my father's at any other time.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. When he gave you the 5l. note, where was he? A. In front of the bar; Williams and Dennington were in the tap-room. and could not hear or see any thing of it; when I brought the four sovereigns he was in the tap-room, sitting with them, and I gave them to him there- he asked me after I changed the 5l. note if I would take care of a good deal of money for him - I spoke to my wife, and she would have nothing to do with it; he had a good deal of money, and put it into his fob - he had between 100l. and 200l. about him, for he asked me if I would take care of between 100l. and 200l. for him.</p>

            . I am a painter, and live at Mr. Bonington's Coal-yard, Drury-lane. Newitt lodged in the second floor back room, and I live in the first floor back room. On Monday, the 3rd of August, at three o'clock in the morning, there was a knocking at the door; I looked out of window and saw two persons - they were Williams and Dennington; they asked me if Mr. Newitt was at home - I think it was Williams spoke; I said I believed he was - I went up and called him; he came down, and went out about five minutes after I called him, but I cannot say whether they all went together - I went to hed again - I saw Newitt again, at home, about twelve o'clock that day; I saw him next day at the Green Man, Coal-yard, with Williams, Dennington, and Holloway - they were all drinking together that afternoon; I had seen Dennington and Williams before that morning, and had spoken to them five or six times before.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Newitt lived at the house? A. Yes; he is married. I saw Williams and Dennington go away when I gave them the answer at the window; I did not see Newitt go out - I saw him at his bed-room door when I called him; he appeared as if he had just got of bed - I did not stay at the window above a minute; I only gave the answer to each person - I cannot say whether Dennington and Williams came back and talked with Newitt at the street-door; I have heard Newitt complain of dropsy before this happened - he was very much swollen; I have not observed it affect him so as to prevent him making any great exertion - I heard him go up again, and dress himself afterwards, and go down again in five minutes; he was up stairs long enough to dress, and he went out - I did not see him go out, but I heard the street-door shut directly after he went down; I heard him go down when I called him, heard him go up again, and then down, and never heard him go up again.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. There can be no mistake about time? A. No - I heard the clock strike during the time I was out of bed; I do not suppose I was out of bed three minutes altogether - I do not burn a light; it was not very dark - the moon was -</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear it was a moonlight morning? A. It was moonlight and daylight together, so that I could distinguish - I will not swear it was moonlight; I cannot say there was a moon - it was not clear daylight at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you say there was a moon? A. Because I could not recollect whether it was daylight or not; I did not see the moon, and will not swear there was one - it was so far daylight that I can swear to the prisoner's if you put them among 20,000 men; it was both daylight and moonlight together - it was not raining then; I did not look to see if the ground was et - one man stood answering me, and the other a little distance off; I only looked at the mens' faces, their appearance and dress - I took particular notice of them; I do not know whether there was a moon or not - I did not see it; it was between daylight and moonlight, because I know it was about the time the moon was up - my recollection is furnished by a knowledge of the state of the moon and the night; it was the third quarter - I am sure of that; I do not know when the moon was new - I calculate from the last time of the new moon, that it was the third quarter; I do not know when it was new, only from seeing it full on Sunday or Saturday night last - I will not swear it was the third quarter; I swear I have not sworn it was.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Had you any expectation of being<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182909100106"></xptr>examined on the state of the weather? A. No - there was light enough for me to distinguish their persons, and I am certain of them; I told them Newitt would be down directly, and then they went away from the door - they came to the door; I did not hear the street-door open the first time Newitt went down - he came up in about two minutes, or two minutes and a half, and I heard him go down again in about two minutes and a half; I then heard the door shut, and did not hear him return up.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The moment they came to the door they asked if Newitt was at home? A. Yes - I said I believed he was; they asked me to call him - I went up and told him two men at the door wanted to speak to him; he came, opened his door, and told me to tell them he would be down directly - I told them so, and did not see any more of them; I heard him come down stairs directly -I did not hear him open the door or speak to them; I heard him come up again - I heard him moving about in his room over head, and go down in about two minutes and a half, and heard the front door shut; I had not heard it opened - I think it was possible for him to dress and come down in the two minutes and a half he was up stairs.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you know the two prisoners before? A. Yes - I had seen them four or five different times, and have spoken to them in the street.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. When had you last a job of painting? A. The last job I did was for Mr. Leggatt, the witness, at a house in West-street, Walworth - he paid me for the job; I began it on the 5th of August - it took six days; I came here to day with Leggatt - we did not go before the Magistrate together; I was summoned there - I had told Bonington, the landlord, and Leggatt, what I knew; Mrs. Bonington told Limbrick I was the person who answered them from the window.</p>

            . I am keeper of the watch-house in Albany-street, Regent's-park. On the 3rd of August, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, a man, who is not here, brought in a sheep skin, and about five next morning, a watchman, who is not here, brought in another - I kept them both, and went on the Tuesday morning, between seven and eight o'clock, to take a walk by the Regent's-canal, and found a parcel of sheep skins in a heap: I was with my horsepatrol, and in the evening be fetched them to the watch-house - there were twenty-five; there was one black skin among them - I gave the twenty-seven skins to William Gordon; Clare-market is about two miles from that spot - none of the skins were entirely in the water, but on the bank; one of them hung on the butment of the bridge - they appeared to have been thrown over carelessly.</p>

               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were you ever at Marlborough-street Office? A. Yes, once - I was not charged with doing any thing - there was no accusation made against me of stealing a watch; I had a ticket of a watch in my possession which had been stolen, not knowing it to be<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182909100107"></xptr>stolen - I gave it up to the officer, and got nothing for it; I was discharged directly.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do you mean to mix the gaslight with the day and moonlight? A. No; it did assist me to see the prisoners - I did not mention it, because I was not asked - I have not said there was "daylight" enough; the daylight assisted the gaslight - I lived in Smart's-buildings when I had the duplicate - I have lived three years in that house.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Why did you leave there? A. Because the woman who lived there went into the almshouse - a Mr. Cave took it, and ordered all the lodgers out; I went from there to where I now live; it was twelve months ago last February, and have lived there ever since.</p>

            . I am landlady of the house Newitt and Surby lived in in August last. On Monday, the 3rd of August, I saw Newitt at three o'clock in the morning, and I saw him again about six - I then met him in the passage of the house going into the yard, where there is a privy - he appeared as if he had just got up in a hurry, with his stockings down, and the knees of his breeches not tied; he appeared to be going to the water-closet; he had been infirm and dropsical for some time before.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. How long had he lived at your house? A. About ten days before, but I had known him about twelve months - he had kept a butcher's shop; I was not particularly intimate with him; I used not to walk out with him - I cannot swear I never went out with him, as he came to my house on a Saturday, and I went out with him on Sunday; at least I and my husband met him, and he said he was going to Lisson-grove, we went with him; I have not been out with him since, to my knowledge - I do not know the Castle in Holborn; I have not been to a public-house in Holborn with him since the robbery, to my knowledge; I am not bound to swear what I am not convinced of; I have not been out with him since the robbery to my knowledge; I do not know the other two prisoners - I cannot swear to them; I cannot swear I never saw them at my house - to the best of my knowledge I have not; I do not undertake to swear any thing of the kind - the officer came to my house a great many times; Newitt was not in my house when Limbrick came - I never saw any officer but him there; I was at home three or four times when he came - Hall came with Limbrick afterwards; Newitt was not in the house at any time when the officer came, that I will swear.</p>
               <p>Q. The first time you saw Newitt was about three o'clock? A. Yes; I was up then, for my husband, when he gets liquor (which is not very often) is like a madman, and I am afraid to go to bed with him, and sit up - he was at home and in bed at this time; I was up and dressed, and about three o'clock Newitt came down stairs; I heard Surby call him - my door was shut, it is close to the street door; my room is on the ground floor - my door continued shut all the time; I saw Newitt going up stairs; I did not consider that he had shut the street door after he had answered somebody, and I opened my door; I went out to see if it was shut and fastened, and it was fastened - I turned towards the staircase and saw Newitt going up stairs; he had nothing on but a pair of dark or black trousers; I had not heard him speak to any body at the door - I did not go to bed at all; I did not hear him come down again, to the best of my knowledge; I do not think he ever went out of the house; I have had some conversation with Surby - I told him I considered he was telling very great falsehoods in saying the man went out, for I did not go to bed, and was certain he did not go out.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, did you not say to Surby that you recollected seeing Newitt come in the morning, at a quarter to eight o'clock, with his shoes all over dust? A. I take my oath I never did, nor any thing of the sort; I saw Newitt again about six o'clock - our men knock at the door about six, some of them came rather before six - it was not about five or ten minutes after that I saw him; it was shortly after six, for our men are very punctual - I was giving the key of the street door when I met Newitt, just as if he had come from his bed; it was not above five or ten minutes after six - he was partly undressed; my house is five or ten minutes walk from Newport-market.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he could not be out and dressed, calling on a man in Newport-market, before six o'clock? A. I cannot say; that is the time I saw him.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What is your husband? A. A coach-smith; Newitt's wife lived with him at our house - he never took any liberties with me; I was awake from three to six o'clock: I do not consider that I closed my eyes a moment - I sat not exceeding two yards from the street door; and from three to six o'clock heard nobody leave the house, nor any one come down stairs.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Did you not, on the 3rd of August, the day of the robbery, go with Newitt to the Castle in Holborn? A. I could not attempt to swear such a thing; I have drank with him on several occasions, when he lived in Rose-street and Turnstile - I have not told Mr. Oldershaw that I went on the 3rd of August with Newitt to the Castle; he asked me that question this morning: I told him I was not bound to answer such questions - I did not say I was there.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182909100108"></xptr>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did Mr. Oldershaw ask you questions? A. Yes, two or three; I told him I was a witness for the prisoner; he and another gentleman questioned me outside.</p>
               <p>JESSY SURBY re-examined. I have had some conversation with Mrs. Bouington about the robbery; she told me she heard Newitt go out of the door about five minutes past three o'clock on the Monday morning, and come in about a quarter to eight that morning with his shoes all over dust - I cannot say what day she stated this.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was any body present? A. Her sister; she told me that I was correct in my statement about his going out soon after three o'clock, and that he came in again about a quarter to eight with his shoes all over dust; she did not say I was a liar for stating what I had, nor any thing to that effect - I had been to Hatton-garden at the time of this conversation; I did not state this to any body - I did not mean to do it, till I heard she was going to appear against me, to try and transport me; I then thought I would peach her, and repeat every thing I knew - I have no spite towards her, nor ill feeling; I have a good will towards her, for I know she cannot transport me - she told me she heard Newitt speak to Dennington and Williams; I told Mr. Oldershaw, the attorney, so last Thursday - I do not know that peaching is a cant word; I know nothing about cant words - I have heard it several times; I heard it both before and after I got the watch ticket.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was it from a back room you answered the men? A. I sleep in the one pair back room - the knocking was at the front door; I went to the staircase window to answer them - there was a single knock first, and then a double one came, like a postman.</p>

I cannot state, probably within thirty of the number of persons, but I could tell within one whose names I have sold to on one particular day in August - I cannot tell within fifty of the persons I sold sheep to in August, not as to the number, but I can tell their names within one; I have no foreman, or any body who sells sheep for me - persons do sell for me when I am absent, but I was not absent in August during the hours for the sale of sheep; I will swear nobody sold sheep for me - I swear I was never absent for an hour during the hours of sale; my knowledge of persons to whom I sell is chiefly derived from my transactions with them- I could not identify every person I sold to; I cannot swear nobody bought sheep of me on Newitt's behalf, but I swear they did not buy in his name - if a man buys of me I give an account of them in the name of the buyer, and, in some instances, in the name who he should use; it is common for persons to buy for others - the name they buy for are entered, and if that name is not given to me I enter them in the name of the purchaser; I have sworn there is no other William Ebb in London, a salesman - I cannot say there is no other William Ebb; I do not know such a salesman, and will swear there is not one- no person can be a public salesman without my knowing it; there are a great many other public markets for the sale of sheep, but only one for the sale of live sheep in London - I know nothing about dead sheep; I do not mean to say live sheep may not be sold without my knowledge, but there is no other market for live animals - sheep may be sold in a lane; there is not a sheep salesman named

            ; there is no other market where salesmen attend for the sale of live sheep.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How many market days are there in a week? A. Two, Monday and Friday; I recollect very well that I was in Smithfield on Monday, the 3rd of August; I did not sell thirty sheep to Newitt that day, nor any - I did not speak to him that day, to my knowledge; I have known him for five or six years - he has dealt with me; he formerly was a butcher; I do not know how long he has ceased to keep a shop, but I have not sold him any sheep this year; I did not sell thirty sheep to him, nor to any body in his name, on the 3d of August - it is both a ready money and credit market; the market hours are from four o'clock in the morning till three in the afternoon, or twenty minutes after; I attend generally within twenty minutes under or over five - no sales of sheep take place before I get there; I have been at Smithfield-market every Monday, for the last twenty years, and every lot of sheep, amounting to twenty-five, I have sold myself on all those Mondays - no agent or person has been deputed to act for me on a Monday; each buyer who pays for sheep, goes and enters his name in the money taker's office - so many sheep, such a price; I sell sheep on commission for any body who sends them - I never sold sheep for Newitt, except half a dozen once because he was absent; he is a salesman himself.</p>

I knew William Smith - he was seventeen years old - he used to stop with his mother, in the daytime, in Blue Anchor-yard - I do not know where he slept - on a Tuesday in June, I was looking out of my window, nearly opposite his mother's, and saw the prisoner, George Soden, in the room with Smith - he was beating the boy Smith right and left - I did not see Smith strike the prisoner at all - they were on the opposite side of the street, in the house - I could see through their window - a man named Taylor was in the room, holding a candle to light him - I saw the prisoner, Elizabeth Hawker - she hallooed up stairs, "Go it, George, go it; you cannot give him too much" - she is the landlady of the house - I continued looking at them for half an hour - this went on for full half an hour - I cannot tell what the cause of it was - I heard the boy say, "George, do not do it any more" - Hawker called a man down, and told him to go and fetch a policeman - the person came back with one; and she ordered the policeman to go up stairs and fetch the woman down who belonged to the prisoner - that was his mother - I cannot say whether she was in the room, but I saw a woman there - Hawker was not in the room - the policeman said it was more than his place was worth, and he went away - he said if he took any body, it ought to be the man who was drunk in front of the door; that was the prisoner Soden - he was down there when the policeman came - he did not take him, but went away - he was quiet then - the next thing I saw was Hawker fastening the door - I went to bed directly afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any body coming out of Gardener's-lane into Blue Anchor-yard? A. Not afterwards - but when they were coming home, before this happened, I saw them come out of Gardener's-lane; the mother, the son, and the prisoners, all four together - it was about eight o'clock in the evening, (before this happened) - Soden was drunk then- I did not notice that Hawker was - Mrs. Smith was in liquor - Smith himself did not appear in liquor - I did not see Taylor till he was holding the candle in the room - next morning (Tuesday) I went with Smith, the deceased, by his mother's desire, to a new lodging, and I carried him to a public-house, just below the hospital in King's Head-court - he was very bad indeed - he could not stand on hand or foot, and could not walk without assistance - when I saw Soden strike right and left, it was done with his fist; there were no sticks used that I saw.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. The deceased, the prisoner, and the deceased's mother, all lived together, did not they? A. They did in the daytime; but I cannot say about the night - I was in my room opposite their window - my window is a middling way from the ground - I could see out into the prisoners' window - I had seen them quarrelling before that - when they came out of Gardener's-lane they went up into the room - that might be a quarter or half an hour before - I did not see them at the Feathers - I did not see the first beginning of it - the female prisoner sent for the policeman, and he said he should take charge of the man who was drunk in the street - Soden was very drunk indeed; Hawker was not drunk; Smith was not drunk, that I could see; I was about ten yards from him - he was at the old lodging next morning, and I carried him to the new lodging - I saw him on the bare floor next morning, there being no bed - I did not see the prisoner next morning.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The deceased called out, "Father, come up-stairs?" A. Yes; and I interfered, fearing there<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183407030066"></xptr>would be another row - when I saw this, I was standing on the iron plate over the water-cock, and could see the prisoner and the deceased - I saw them at the window.</p>
               <p>Q. The whole time that you were looking in at the window, you are quite sure you stood on the water-cock? A. I did; what I saw of the striking I saw there - while I saw him hit I was standing there - I saw Soden's face scratched - I did not see him go to the pump and wash his face - I never had any quarrel with the prisoner, quite the reverse - I never said I would try to get him in trouble to any body - I am certain I did not say so to James Taylor, nor any thing to that effect.</p>

            . I am the deceased's mother - his name was William - I was on the landing-place of the lodging, and when I got into the room, there was the prisoner Soden, the deceased, and the man with a candle in the room - I had not come home with them - I had not been in their company - I had been moving my things all day, with my son and another man from two o'clock - I had come in out of Gardeners-lane - the boy and I went and stood in Gardeners-lane, and Soden went with his sister-in-law - we came in from Gardeners-lane together - my son went up stairs first - I had the key and unlocked the door - Soden was gone then to the Broadway - this was in the daytime.</p>
               <p>Q. Well, at night, Soden and your son, and a man with a candle in his hand, were in the room? A. Yes; I saw them fighting one another - the boy fighting the man as well as the man fighting the boy - I prevented it as far as my strength would allow - this did not last five minutes after I got in - I could not get into the room at first, as the landlady detained me on the stairs, calling me names not fit to mention, and she kept calling out, "Give it him, George. You cannot give it him too much" - there never was a better man in England than the prisoner is - he never would have done it, if it had not been for her.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they quarrel about? A. The lad had been six weeks on his hands, and he called him lazy for not looking about for work, as he supported him - this lasted about five minutes after I got in - they had been fighting a long time before - I heard them, but could not get to them - I was knocked down in the passage myself, and beaten, and got a bite on my flesh - Soden hit me, which he never did in his life before - he was very drunk indeed - I saw Taylor - he did nothing that I saw, but he would not offer to part them - he held the candle - I had been to the Feathers that afternoon - Soden and my son were both there - they began quarrelling there, and began to fight - I think, to tell the truth, my son began it - the prisoner never hurt him in his life, and would not have done it if it had not been for the landlady - they fought there, and that was where Soden got his face scratched and his shirt torn - the boy had been saucy to Hawker in Gardeners-lane, between one and two o'clock, and she beat him herself then - I told her that she ought to send for a policeman and give him in charge, and not beat him in that dreadful manner. After all this was over, we three remained in the room, because I could not find the key to go to the new lodging - Soden, myself, and my son, all slept there that night - we had nothing to sleep on but the boards - I had removed the bed and every thing but a chair - I could not get the key of the lodging, because the deceased had it in his pocket, and I did not know it - he was taken to the new lodging next morning, and I went to Mr. Davis to see him - he lived eighteen days after this - I always kept asking him if he complained of any particular part - he said, "No, mother" - only his limbs were useless, like a baby.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The deceased had insulted Hawker in the first instance? A. Yes; he used ill-language to her, and she beat him - I did not see Soden interfere to separate them at the Feathers - the deceased and Soden rushed out together, and I could not see who struck - I went with the deceased to the Feathers, and the prisoner was there.</p>
               <p>Q. When the prisoner came out of the Feathers, did not the deceased use some expressions to him? A. I could not tell, there was such a mob of people - they were quarrelling, but I could not understand the words - I did not see the prisoner thrown down on the curb - I saw him washing his face from the blood caused by the scratches - that was after he had been fighting with my boy.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was not your son taken to the hospital? A. Yes, two days before he died.</p>

            . I am an assistant-surgeon at the Western Hospital, in the medical department. I went to the lodgings in King's-head-buildings by desire of the house-surgeon - I found the boy in a state of general paralysis - I think this was on Wednesday, the 24th of June - he was perfectly sensible - I examined him, and found a tenderness and good deal of pain in the region of the back of the neck - I made inquiry, suspecting he had received some injury - he complained of pain at the back of the neck - I did not observe any external bruise - he said he was unable to move either of his limbs; and he had no sensation, or very trifling - his symptoms agreed with paralysis - he did not complain of any injury - I saw no more of him till he came into the hospital on the following Tuesday, the 10th of June - I attended him there on Tuesday morning, at half-past eleven o'clock - I opened the body after death - there was one bruise on his right buttock - it was merely a bruise of the integument, a superficial bruise - there was a fracture of the fifth joint of the neck, that would affect the spinal marrow - the concussion caused by the blow would produce an injury to the spinal marrow, by causing an extravasation of blood on the spinal marrow, which I observed, and very great congestion - the blood-vessels were ruptured, and the blood was in the spinal canal - the spinal marrow itself was healthy - the vessels of the brain were very much gorged with blood; but the brain itself was healthy - I opened the chest - both the lungs were gorged with blood, and continued distended - there were some old adhensions of the right lung to the sides of the chest - I have no doubt that was the result of a former inflammation, of perhaps two years' standing - the recent injury of the spinal marrow caused the congestion of the blood on the lungs: that congestion might certainly have arisen from natural causes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it likely to have occurred to a person having the appearances you have described; I mean the adhesion from the former disease? A. No; because there was no disease in the structure of the lungs - I believe the immediate cause of his death was suffocation from the conges<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183407030067"></xptr>tion of the lungs, produced by the extravasation of blood on the spinal marrow, which was caused by a blow, I have no doubt.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You state a blow on the back of the neck might have produced the injury to the vessels close to the spinal marrow, and that produce paralysis - how long, in your opinion, would it take to produce death? A. If the injury had been higher up, death would have taken place immediately; but I think, where it was, life might be continued about ten days - it is possible the injury might have been inflicted a fortnight before he died - a fall a fortnight before might have produced concussion.</p>
               <p>MARGARET SMITH re-examined. My son was in very good health before this - he never complained - he slept during the night after this happened; but kept me turning him from one side to the other all night.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. You say, when you saw your son and the prisoner scuffling, you were detained on the landing-place? A. Yes, by the woman - she did not hold me; but I could not get past her - she stopped the way - she prevented me, by abusing me and calling me names - she did not stand in my way, and say I should not go in - Soden and myself lived together as man and wife.</p>
               <p>Soden's Defence. There was a chest of drawers in the room on the night the deceased came in - it was about four feet high - some time after that, when the mother thought the boy in danger, she observed to me, "I had sooner you had taken a stick and beaten him; for his death might be caused through throwing him against those drawers" - after the mother's leaving him in the hospital, she returned to the room, which I pay the rent of, and said in a flurry, "I have put my son in the name of Smith - I have done wrong; for it is well known that his name is Longford" - I attended the inquest by order of the beadle - I cannot think of any thing being in the room but the empty drawers - I was taken up in the room, and laid down in a state of intoxication, having my shirt torn, and very bloody from the injuries I had received at the Feathers - I was supporting the boy with what I could get- he has lifted a poker two or three times to me, and called me all the bad names he could think of.</p>
               <p>Hawker's Defence. I came home about half-past two o'clock, and while we were drinking some beer, Mrs. Smith came in and called me most abusive names, and the boy likewise - I gave him a slap in the face - after I struck him, I came to the door and said, "Mrs. Smith, I insist on your going away;" and she went out in the road - when I came home, about seven o'clock at night, part of the things were removed by her son and her; and they were quarrelling then certainly; but I do not believe any blows were struck in the room - I did not go up stairs; but I said, "Mrs. Smith, do not make such a noise" - she flung a piece of chest of drawers at me - I went into my own room.</p>
               <p>MARGARET SMITH re-examined. I am the mother of the deceased. He always went by the name of William Smith.</p>

On the day in question, I was at the premises where the deceased was - about nine o'clock in the evening, I went in - I heard a noise in the room - I called for a light, my son brought me a light - my son lodged in the house - when the light came I saw the deceased standing across Soden, who was down on his back - he struck Soden once in my presence in the face, while Soden was down - I went to put my arms round the deceased, and pulled him away - Soden attempted to get up twice, but was so tipsy he could not - the boy then took off his jacket, and rolled some other articles in it, to make a pillow of it - he put it under Soden's head, and we left them all in the room together, he being so drunk - I left them and went up to my son - this was between nine and half-past nine o'clock - nothing more occurred to me that night - I know the premises well - there is a water-cock on the opposite side - the cock is in a diagonal direction, and the window of the room is at least nine feet higher than the cock - I have not measured it - I have known the prisoner about eight months - I never saw him out of temper, but when he was in liquor - he was merry, but not quarrelsome.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long were you in the room? A. Perhaps a quarter of an hour - but I was in the house about an hour and a half during the quarrel - when the light was brought into the room, I saw the boy across Soden - that was the first thing I saw in the room - I had heard a noise which induced me to go down - I was in the room above - it was a noise as if somebody was attempting to make a louder noise than they did - my son brought me a light - I went to the room, and stayed there a quarter of an hour - I saw Smith standing over Soden, but not the whole time - I dragged him away, and held him on one side a few minutes, while Soden attempted to get up, and Soden fell down again - I said, "Now you see the state your father-in-law is in" - I then let go of him - I saw nothing the matter with Smith at the time, for he went down stairs - he stayed two or three minutes - he came up then, and took his jacket off to put under Soden's head - when he had done so I left them - that was after he had wrapped something up in his jacket - the pillow was not put under his own head - there was nothing apparently the matter with Smith at that time - I never saw Smith struck at all - my son had the candle - he was outside the room with the candle - it was not in the room at all - I did not see it till my son went up stairs - he was called down directly by Mrs. Hawker, to fetch a policeman - when he went for the policeman, he put the candle on the floor - I did not take it up - I never took it in my hand at all - Soden was not able to strike Smith - Smith ran down stairs very lively.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any body say, "Give it him. Taylor?" A. I never heard the words made use of - I never spoke to Woodley - I never saw him till Saturday, I believe, and I did not speak to him then.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Woodley charge you with holding the candle for Soden to beat the boy? A. I believe it was my son was accused of that- I never heard the words, "It is a d---d lie" - I am sure I did not use these words - I never spoke to Smith in my life - I have seen him backwards and forwards since he lived in the house.</p>

            . I lived in the house at the time this happened - I came downstairs with a light to the first floor - I took it to the threshold of the door, and either my father or somebody took it from me - I was rather con<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183407030068"></xptr>fused with the noise, and do not know who took it - somebody took it - I held it till I was sent for a policeman - I do not know who I gave it to, or whether I put it down - while I was there nobody else had the candle.</p>
               <p>From the position in which you stood, could you see into the room? A. I could not see all round the room - I saw Soden lying on the ground, and the deceased standing over him - Soden was doing nothing but lying down - the boy was doing nothing when I went into the room, but he had been beating Soden - I did not see him beat, but I heard Soden cry out, "I am robbed, they are robbing me" - I am quite sure I did not go into the room with the candle, till after the policeman came.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Then you saw no fighting at all? A. No: a man who lives in the room opposite accused me of holding the candle for Soden to beat him, and I called the boy down - I did not say it was a d---d lie - I said "I will prove it is false; and I will call  the boy down" - I called him down, and asked him; and he said, what they said was false, for I was doing no such thing; and I was a very civil young fellow, and tried to part them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear anybody say, "Go it - give it him, Taylor?" A. No: nobody said it that I heard - Smith seemed quite well - he did not seem as if anything was the matter - he ran down stairs when I called him, and said he was quite well - I have never seen him since.</p>

            . I am a confectioner, and live in Tothill-street. I have been to the premises where this happened - I saw a water-cock opposite the house - I was present when the distance was measured between that and the window - the water-cock is two feet, or two feet two inches from the ground, and slants down - it is impossible any body could stand on it - there is nothing but the brick wall to lay hold of - the window is ten feet three inches from the ground.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Could not a man reach up on the window-sill? A. The house is on the other side of the way - the water-cock stands between two windows - there is nothing within reach that a man could lay hold by - I saw it measured yesterday afternoon.</p>

            . I am a high constable. I measured the place - the water-cock stands opposite the window - it is twenty-two inches high from the ground, and covered with an iron sheeting - I could not stand on it, and it is impossible for any person, if the prisoner and the others were on the floor in the opposite room, if a man was twelve feet high, to see them, for the window-sill is ten feet two inches from the ground - if the party were standing up they could see their bodies, but if on the ground, it would be utterly impossible.</p>

            . I am a marble mason, and live in Blue Anchor-yard. I saw the transaction from the beginning to the end - I saw young Taylor walking round the room, with the candle in his hand, while the prisoner struck the deceased - I do not recollect the day - it was on a Monday, the day before he left the lodgings - I saw the prisoner strike him several times with his right hand and left - both - and Taylor followed him with the light - I saw him strike him several times, and the boy fell - I saw no more of him, till after that Soden came down stairs - Elizabeth Hawker stood on the stairs crying out, "Go it, George! - Give it him! Give it him! You cannot give it him too much!" - I was at my own window, almost opposite theirs - it is not directly opposite - I could not see into the room - when he had got his satisfaction he came down stairs, she called him into her room, and said, "Come in, George, I have a drop of gin for you" - I saw no more of it afterwards - I had seen no quarrel between the female prisoner and the deceased - nor the scuffle at the Feathers - I saw the whole transaction in the room - I was standing at my window when I saw Hawker take Soden by the arm - he was in the hall, coming out of the door, and she dragged him in - I could see him very well - my window was open - young Taylor was holding the candle with his left hand while Soden struck the boy - Soden was standing up - I did not see the other Taylor there - he was not there - I saw the deceased holding his father-in-law's shoulder while he was being struck by him (the prisoner.)</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Smith held his father-in-law's shoulder? A. Yes, while his father was striking him - I saw the policeman after it was over - I did not see him go into the room. I am quite sure the other Taylor was not there.</p>
               <p>COURT to ALFRED HALL. Q. You describe the injury to be at the back of the neck, you are of opinion that death was caused by that injury? Yes: it consisted of extravasion of blood in the spinal process of the vertebrae of the neck - a blow from a fist I think would not do it  - a fall against a door or drawers might occasion it.</p>

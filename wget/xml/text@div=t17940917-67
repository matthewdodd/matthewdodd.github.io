               <p>Prisoner. I was in the room this morning, and this woman came down, and she said that she had been wrangling with her husband, and that he said he would go to Ireland, and she said here is all the money I have got, and he should not take it to his wife there; because he is a married man; with that I left them; with that there is a witness that I have got here, she went with her to Covent-Garden and went to the coal-shed, and before ever she cried out about her money, it was twelve o'clock, and then she accused her husband, and she asked her man whether he took the money out of her pocket? Says the husband, I never took the money out of your pocket; then, says she, it is one of the lodgers.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. That girl's sister, she owned to Mr. Macarthy that she had my property.</p>
               <p>Q. To Macarthy. Had you any hint given you that you was to keep this man for them? - I had not; they are neighbours, they all lodge in this house; the prisoner's sister told me she believed the money was lost.</p>

               <p>Q. Who said they had been robbed? - The woman that lost the money, Ca<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170154"></xptr>tharine Bryant, she is here, and her husband, no one else. She first charged the prisoner at the bar at that time; and secondly, she suspected some of her lodgers of taking the money, one James Mandy, it was between nine and ten, as near as I can recollect; she suspected the lodgers to have found it afterwards in her own room.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not she go to Covent-Garden, and give you some money to get some coals? - She asked me where the coal-shed was before ever I heard of the money being lost, and I went with Mrs. Norton to shew her the coal-shed between seven and eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that before she lost the money? - I cannot say, because I don't know of her losing it.</p>

               <p>Q. Where was Catharine Norton at the time she made the complaint? - In her's and the prisoner's room; the prisoner, and mother and sister, had a lodging at her house.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the prisoner at the time that you heard this outcry of the robbery? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after the cry of robbery did you see the prisoner? - Not till twelve o'clock, to my knowledge, and I had seen her a little before the cry of the robbery was; I see her at twelve o'clock, between twelve and one, between Mrs. Joyce's room and her own room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Norton and his wife there at that time? - I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When I heard that she had lost her money I came home, and Mrs. Norton and her husband were in the house, and they never said any thing to me.</p>
               <p>Court to Norton. Was you at home at twelve o'clock that day? - No; I was not; I was looking after his girl, and my wife was with me.</p>
               <p>Q. To Mrs. Joyce. Was the prisoner Catharine Neale at home about twelve o'clock? - Yes; till twelve and one o'clock, better than half an hour.</p>

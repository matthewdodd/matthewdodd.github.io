            . On the 28th of June, about half past six o'clock, I was with Woodward at the King's Head public-house, Crouch-End. My master had information that Mr. Rugg had been robbed, and said that the three lads were gone up Mount Pleasant; we went after them, and overtook the prisoners on Stroud Green, about a mile and a half from Mr. Rugg's. Woodward got up to them first; when I came up, Norton ran away and I after him; I saw a man and called Stop thief! he detained him till I came up; I took him to the other two. They were very loth to go back; we took them to Mr. Rugg's, who said he knew they were the persons who had been into his house, and if they would deliver up his things they might go about their business; they declared that they had got nothing; he said he knew they had, and the sooner they gave it up, the sooner they would go; King and Norton delivered up a good many things; Rawley said he had nothing; Mr. Rugg said they were to go about their business; I said they should not, and while I was speaking Francis came and took them. Mr. Rugg would not give up the property.</p>
               <p>MR. RUGG. I have all the property here, and can swear to it. Rawley said he was perfectly unacquainted with the others, that they merely overtook him.</p>

I had a pocket-book, containing a 10 l. note, and two sovereigns, locked up in my box in the pantry; I kept the key in a small drawer. On the evening of the 1st of October, I and the other servants were in the kitchen - the prisoner began to lay the things ready for supper, he said he was very thirsty, and should like some beer: I said the keys were in the dresser drawer, he could draw some, and draw the beer for supper at the same time: he went and was a long time gone; I went to see what he was after, and saw him in the pantry, making his escape from the side of the pantry, where my box was: I found him behind the door, and asked if he had drawn the beer; he said he could not find the key; I said it must be somewhere, perhaps it was in the cellar; I went to the cellar and found the key in the barrel; I returned to the pantry, found my box unlocked, the lid was down and the key in it; I had locked it that morning and put the key in the drawer; I said "Bless me, how came my box open?" he made no answer; I locked it without looking at the contents, and put the key into my pocket, and told him to come to supper; he said he would; he was walking about and I asked if he was not going to have any supper; he said he did not feel inclined; I said he could sit down - he did so for about five minutes, then lighted a candle, went out of the kitchen, and we thought that he was gone up to his room; I went and missed my pocket-book; I went up to his room with the watchman and Elizabeth Skinner; we found his room door shut - I knocked, and he asked who was there - I said it was me; he jumped out of bed and opened the door; I said I had lost my pocket-book with 12 l. in it, and did he know any thing of it; he said he did not: I said if he would deliver it up I would forgive him, and say nothing about it: he put his hand behind the drawers and brought the pocket-book out, and said he took it for nonsense, intending to return it in the morning. I found the money and note still in it.</p>

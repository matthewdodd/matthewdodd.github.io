            . I am a farmer. I keep pigs in Bedford-street, Liquorpond-street, The prisoner brought me this pig for sale, on the 28th of February, about a quarter past six o'clock; he asked me four pound ten shillings for the pig I told him if he would call at eleven o'clock, I would pay him. I took it in my yard at that price, and before ten o'clock, the woman came, and owned the pig. I shewed her the pig after she had described it; she said it was her hog. She stopped with me until the prisoner came; I then sent for an officer, and the prisoner was taken to the office. I delivered the pig to the prosecutrix. As soon as I let the pig out, she ran after the prosecutrix.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was sent for to take charge of the prisoner at Mr. Caton's. Mrs. Condin said it was her pig; the pig turned out to be an acquaintance. As soon as it was let out of the sty, it ran after her. The prisoner told me he bought it on this side of Mile End turnpike, of a man of the name of Lloyd, that sold cats meat and dogs meat. I took him before the magistrate; he was committed for re-examination. He never brought any one forward. The magistrate gave him an opportunity of finding this Lloyd.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I gave four pounds for the pig to a man in the street; he said, he worked at Blackwall. I sold it to Mr. Caton for four pounds ten shillings. I never was in confinement before.</p>

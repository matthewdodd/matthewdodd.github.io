On the 24th of August the prisoner came to our place and wished a pair of horses to be put into a carriage called a "Brougham," which was standing in the yard—he had a cash-box with him—he directed to be driven to the post-office at Kennington—I drove him there—he got out, took the cash-box with him, and went into the post-office—when he came out he brought the cash-box—he told me to drive to Clapham-road, to a post-office there—he got out there with the cash<lb></lb>box, and came back to me again—from there I drove him to the post-office, Camberwell-green—he took the cash-box out again, brought it back into the carriage again, and ordered me to drive to Islington, but before I got there I was to stop at the Post-office in St. Martin's-le-grand, which I did—when I was coming from there he asked me if I knew what time the Bank closed—I said I did not, but I drove him to the Bank—he got out there and came back with the cash-box—he came out of there a few minutes after five, and I drove him to Sadler's Wells,—he opened the cash-box in the portico, and gave me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. out of it—there were a great many sovereigns in it—he went into the Myddleton's Head, called me into the place again, and rode a little way into St. John-street with a young lad who he brought out of Sadler's Wells—I drove them a short dis<lb></lb>tance to St. John's-street—they got out there, and he left the cash-box in the carriage—I asked him if there was any property in it, if so, I should take it to my master's premises—he said there was none—I found there was none—it was fetched away a few days after.</p>

I was thirty years physician to St. Luke's hospital, and am now consulting physician—I have had my share of practice in cases of insanity—I was first called to see the prisoner on Friday the 16th of September, in prison—I had a consultation with Dr. Philip and Mr. M'Murdo, and they were present at the examination—I was introduced to him by Mr. M'Murdo as a person wishing to submit a few questions to him—I asked him about his health, which he said was very good—I re<lb></lb>gretted the position he was in—he said he had been guilty of no crime, that he had acted for the good of the state, that he only required to see Lord Lowther, that everything would be made satisfactory, and that he ex<lb></lb>pected promotion in consequence of this act—I asked him at to his edu<lb></lb>cation, and whether he had been trained to the military profession—he said he had, and he held a commission in the army, that he was a colonel in the 16th Lancers—I asked him if he had ever worn the uniform of a Colo<lb></lb>nel—he said he had frequently—I produced a dress which I had taken with me, and which he recognized as having frequently worn—he told me it had been given to him by Colonel Belie, that the epaulets had been bought in Paris, that he had a right to wear them, for he was a colonel in the 16th Lancers—I took the dress with me to ascertain whether be recog<lb></lb>nized it—I had got his hand-writing from the family and submitted it to him, asking if it was his hand-writing—he said it was—I said, "Surely, you cannot mean what you have written here, you have written Colonel James Brown"—he said, it was his, and he had a right to the signature, he was Colonel James Brown—I asked if he objected to give me his designa<lb></lb>tion in writing, and he wrote in a good, bold, firm hand, "Colonel James Brown, 16th Lancers, 16th September"—and under the letter "S" he wrote "24" in small figures—I asked what that meant, he very adroitly replied, "Oh, I mean to dine out that day, I am engaged to dine with Mrs. Ducrow"—I asked him if he knew the little boy, young Ducrow—he said he did, that he was very fond of him, and had given him 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to buy a pony—I asked if he recollected being angry with the little boy for not answering a question, and whether in consequence he did not threaten to throw a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note behind the fire—he said he re<lb></lb>collected the circumstance, but he did not throw the 5<hi rend="italic">l,</hi> note behind the fire, but he lit his cigar with it—I asked him if any other person had done that in his presence whether he would not conceive it was an act of mad<lb></lb>ness?—he said, "No, I should not, there is nothing in that"—I said, "It is stated that you thrust your hand into boiling lead, is it so? what made you do it?"—he said, "I only did it to try if it would hurt"—he afterwards said it was so like quicksilver that he was tempted to try the experiment—he admitted that he was hurt by it, and was attended by Dr. Brady—I wished to know whether he had any intention of altering his situation in life, I heard he was going to be mar<lb></lb>ried,</p>

                  </hi>. I am surgeon of the gaol of Newgate, and have been so thirteen years—I have had opportunities of examining and conversing with the prisoner, to test his state of mind, and I have heard the evidence given by the members of his family to-day—I was not aware</p>

               <p>of those circumstances previously—from the opportunities I have had of seeing him, and from the evidence to-day, I believe him to be of unsound mind.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> State the reasons of that opinion? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I addressed him, understanding there was some doubt about his state of mind, previous to my hearing of the facts given in evidence, and asked how he could commit the act he was accused of—he said, "I did it, but I did it in order to get promotion—I have endeavoured in vain, and my friends have endeavoured in vain, to get me another place in the Post<lb></lb>office; and I wished to convince Lord Lowther how frequently frauds might be committed; and I did this to prove my assertion; and I have no doubt I shall now be promoted"—I have been obliged to examine a great many who have asimilated madness, medically, to trace it—I think or experience enables me to discover the difference between an asimilated state<lb></lb>ment and a correct statement—I notice the conduct of the prisoner at other times—I have examined him three or four times.</p>

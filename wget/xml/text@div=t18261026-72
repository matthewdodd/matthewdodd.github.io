I sounded the half-crown, said it was bad, and put it on the counter, and on turning round it was gone; I asked him where it was - he gave it me back; I weighed it, and returned it to him; he said he took it of his master, and could get it changed; he went away. On the 20th, at a quarter past eight o'clock, he came for a quarter of an ounce of tobacco, which came to 1d. - he gave me a shilling, and I gave him a six pence and 5d. - he went away; I afterwards showed it to my son, and it turned out to be bad - I kept it separate from all others till I gave it to the constable; he came again in about two hours, for a quarter of an ounce of tobacco - he put down a shilling, but seeing me looking at him, he took the shilling up, gave me a penny, and went away. On the 22d he came again, and bought of my husband a quarter of an ounce of returns, which came to 1d., and gave him a shilling - my husband said it was bad, and secured him - 5d. was found upon him.</p>

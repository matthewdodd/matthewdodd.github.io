               <p>Do you know on Saturday night the 9th of July, how the house was left? - Every thing was left safe, all the watches were in the shop, we supped in the shop, and when we went to bed, about five minutes before twelve, every thing was safe; we were not alarmed in the night; my master called me about four, he got up about three, the shop was broke open, and all the watches gone; the lead-light was taken out of the back window, and taken into the garden; there was no casement; I am sure the light was there when I went to bed safe, at dusk they got over two or three people's gardens out of Christopher's-alley; there are two walls that the person got over, they are as high as that wainscotting.</p>
               <p>Had anybody called on your master the night before? - Yes, about nine in the evening, my master was not at home, a man came and asked if my master was at home, I said no; I never saw the prisoner since; he was meanly dressed; he said his business was not material, he would call again another time.</p>
               <p>Did you observe the colour of his coat? - No, I did not particularly notice that; There were above fifty watches gone.</p>

               <p>Court. Any person from without who wanted them, would not lean over the shop board to get at them? - No, Sir, from within-side the watches were all taken away, that watch in the black tortoiseshell cover that I took to Mr.

               <p>Did you hear the prisoner acknowledge the button to be his? - No, I heard him say he had been at a fight, and lost a button.</p>

               <p>After the robbery at Mr. Moore's did he give you any information of any particular circumstance? - He sent for me on Sunday morning about half past six, and shewed me a metal button shanked, that he said he found in the shop.</p>
               <p>Look at that button? - I am sure this is the button; he gave the button into my hand, says he, there is a number of people that comes to your house, take it and enquire for any person that wears such a button; accordingly I took it, and kept it three quarters of an hour, and delivered it to him again, then he told me what had happened, and desired if anybody should happen to come to our house with such a button and coloured coat, to take notice of them; he said, he found it under the vice board in the shop; I told him I did not see anybody that answered the description then, but on the next day about eleven in the forenoon, I was at the door serving two people with some liquor, I saw the prisoner come by with the same coloured coat, and the button was off; his coat was buttoned and his hands in his pockets; he turned his head towards the window, he made no stop, but I thought he walked rather slow, that was before he came to me, then I took particular notice that he wanted a button, and I went and told Mr. Moore that I thought the man was gone by that committed the robbery; Mr. Moore, me, and another, pursued him down Crown-alley, there we lost sight of him; we saw him again, and he was stopped, he made no resistance whatever.</p>
               <p>When you stopped him did you observe whether his coat had lost a button? - At the Justice's I did, it was from his breast, it appeared to be torn out, it being set on with cloth of the same colour; he did not deny that the button matched with his own, but said that he was in an affray on Wednesday in Kingsland road, and might lose his button there, and another person might pick it up and drop it at Mr. Moore's, enquiring for a watch, might throw it over the sash; but the sash did not run.</p>
               <p>Court. Then he did not say positively whether it was his button or not? - No, he seemed to signify that it matched with it.</p>
               <p>Was he then told where the button was found? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What is the reason you was not at Mr. Wilmot's to give your evidence? - I was there, but nobody was called in but Mr. Moore, and the man that took you.</p>
               <p>Did I refuse going with you? - No, you went along easily, you said you would go anywhere with me.</p>
               <p>Was not I searched at Mr. Wilmot's? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You remember there was no sum of money found about me? - I did not see him searched.</p>

               <p>I was present when the prisoner was apprehended; being very well acquainted with Mr. Moore, I was with him on the Monday morning after the robbery, considering of an advertisement, when about eleven Mr. Upham, who is a near neighbour, came and knocked at Mr. Moore's door, and said the man was gone by which had the button on, he went down Crown-Alley, I followed him, I saw no such man, he then went up a little alley that leads into Sun-street, I followed and saw a man going on, then I observed the colour of the coat and button, which appeared to be like that, and there was a button wanting on his coat, he said he lost a button fighting in Kingsland-road.</p>
               <p>Did you make any remark on the rest of his dress? - He had an apron on, and when the apron was pulled up his breeches were ragged, that was all the observation I made, I cannot say whether they were ragged or torn by accident.</p>

               <p>Did it appear to be fair worn, or torn by accident.</p>
               <p>I should think it must be torn by accident, they were torn in strips, he did not take off any other of his clothes.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he say that was his button, or the button of his coat? - He said he did not know but it might be his button, but if it was his button it was lost at the sight.</p>

               <p>On the Saturday which is reported to the night the robbery was done, Mr. Astill<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140165"></xptr> was along with me, that was the 9th of August.</p>
               <p>What last month? - No, the month before.</p>
               <p>Then you do not mean the 9th of August? - Yes, I do, it was last month, now I am sensible it was last month.</p>
               <p>Recollect yourself, this is September, you say it was the 9th of August? - I am sure it was, I am positive that night he was with me, on the 9th of August, about six weeks ago, i was not farther back, it was not June or July.</p>
               <p>Where was he, Sir, with you on the 9th of August? - I must tell my story as near as I can, and I will do it with as much justice as I can; he called upon me on Saturday evening, he sent for me out of the playhouse, we drank a pint of porter together, and he and I went home together, and my wife was gone to a sister of hers who was in labour in Ratcliff-highway, I live in St. Martin's-lane, we waited at our house till four o'clock.</p>
               <p>You remember the time particular by the labour? - I will tell you presently; he told me he was taken up for a robbery in Moorfields; says I, you could not, you was with me that night, my wife's sister was in labour; I said the 9th of August but I was mistaken, I will swear it was on the Saturday night the 14th.</p>
               <p>Will you swear that it was the 10th of August? - I will swear it was the Saturday the robbery was committed.</p>
               <p>What are you? - I am a carpenter, I live in St. Martin's-lane.</p>

               <p>Can you tell us any thing by your books? - I have not my book, it is six or seven weeks ago; I do not come here with a studied story.</p>
               <p>Will you undertake to say that it was not in September? - Yes, it is longer ago.</p>
               <p>What makes you think it was not July? - I have sworn before he was with me on the Saturday night, on the Monday I saw him in Clerkenwell.</p>
               <p>On Saturday the 9th of August? - I will swear it was the 9th of August.</p>
               <p>Court. Whereabouts in St. Martin's-lane do you live? - Next door but one to May's-buildings; I have lodged at the butcher's shop about twelve months.</p>
               <p>Who do you lodge with? - The landlady who keeps the house, she keeps a publichouse in Red Lyon Square, her name is Treble, one Mr. Buir keeps the butcher's shop next door to Mr. Treslove, there is a baker on the other side whom I do not know.</p>
               <p>Who do you work with? - At Covent Garden theatre.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. This is an aukward circumstance, such a one as will make any jury pause much upon it, at the same time it is but a circumstance, and I must say that I do not think it by any means a conclusive one; you, however, are the proper judges; it is not for me to impress upon you what I think upon it, but I confess, as the man's life is to depend on a single circumstance, I could with that circumstance had been more conclusive; but if it is so convincing in your minds that you cannot get over it, you will discharge your consciences; if there is a probability that it was not his button, if there is a possibility that it was not his button, perhaps you may think it too much to take away his life upon a single circumstance.</p>
               <p>(The Jury desired to withdraw.)</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, before you withdraw, my brother Gould wishes me to mention to you what is extremely proper, that though many people have been convicted upon circumstances only, yet one cannot recollect a case in which a man has been convicted on one single circumstance, several circumstances combining together have great weight with a Jury: but where there are no circumstances to corroborate each other, but a case depends on one single circumstance; there to be sure the weight of it is very much abated.</p>
               <p>The Jury retired for some time, and returned with a verdict</p>

The prisoner was employed as a plasterer's labourer for my master, Mr. John Jay—he had no right to have any nails in his business—I cannot swear to these nails, but I had just such—I could not miss any, I had such a number in my care—he had no right to take any away.</p>

I stopped the prisoner in the Uxbridge-road, on the 26th of August, with a basket on his shoulder—I asked what he had got—he said, "Chips, and a bottle"—I searched, and found these nails—I asked how he came by them—he said he brought them from where he had been at work, at Mr. Jay's, the builder, and was going to nail a box up—I searched him at the station, and found on him as many more nails as I could hold in my hands—I said next morning that he was very foolish in taking them—he said he picked them up in one room and another.</p>

Where did you get them? says I. - Your Husband leads a loose Life, and I am afraid they are stolen. I am afraid so too, says she, and I believe he'll never leave off till he brings me and himself too to the Gallows. But I'll go and fetch him and his Companion, and let them answer for themselves. She went away, and quickly return'd, with her Husband and Harvey. They asked Half a Crown a Pair for the Stockings. I examin'd how they came by 'em; and Harvey said they were his, and he bought them to go to Sea; but wanting a little ready Money, he was willing to dispose of them again. But afterwards he confess'd that he wrenched aside the Shutters of Walker's Shop, and pull'd them out with a Hook. They were carry'd before the Justice: Their Confession was drawn up, and Sperry was going to sign it; but Harvey pull'd him away, with a G - D - ye for a Fool! Are you going to sign your own Dead-Warrant? They were committed to New-Prison; but the Keeper there was for having them sent to Newgate; for he thought they did not belong to his Posterity.

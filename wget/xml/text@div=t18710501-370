                  </hi>. I am a butcher, of 133, Cromer Street—on 6th March I saw the prisoner in my shop—my boy served him with a half-pound of beef sausages, which came to 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he paid with a half-crown—the boy called out "Change, take 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—my wife took the half-crown, and said "I don't think it is a good one "—I tried it with my teeth, and found it was bad—I had never lost sight of it—as I had thrown two half-crowns into the fire previously, I said to the prisoner, "I have had enough of these," and gave him in charge with the half-crown.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside with my husband at Addlestone, Surrey—on the evening of 22nd September, about 10 minutes to 9 o'clock, I left my house to go to the Holly Tree public-house, which is a few yards from my house—as I approached the front entrance of the Holly Tree I observed a man came from the front door of the Holly Tree and go round to the tap-room door at the side of the house, which leads out into the road, the same as the front door—I recognise the prisoner as the man—I did not know his name, only as "The bargeman," which my husband called him; I had seen him several times pass my house of a morning—when he was at the tap-room door he stooped down and put a light to something, what it was I could not say; he put it inside the door—I was in the street, four or five yards away from him; he was not inside the door, he was outside the door—he put the something inside; he opened the door and put the light in, down below; he stooped down to put it in; he then closed the door and walked away towards the front railing—then something went up and the room was full of smoke; it went "puff, and a few sparks and smoke; I did not observe any noise—Mrs. Aplin</p>

               <p>was with me—we turned our backs to go round to the tap-room door again, and the prisoner went into the bar through the front door—he came through the bar into the tap-room just as Mr. Rankin came in, when the place was full of smoke—when I first saw the prisoner I made a communication to Mrs. Aplin; we went round from the front to the tap-room to see what it was, and found the room full of smoke—the prisoner and Rankin and several others came in—I did not observe any smell—I did not observe the prisoner speaking, or any one else; I was outside the door—I saw him again, two or three hours afterwards, when the policeman brought him to us.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was not going to the public-house, I was going to see if my husband was there; he was not there—he is a carpenter—I do not know a man named Bolton a carpenter. (<hi rend="italic">Bolton was here called in.</hi>) I know that man; he lodges next door to me, at Mrs. Aplin's—I saw him in the bar that night—we did not go in the bar, we only stood against the door—I saw him from the front door; we stood at the front of the house—I did not go into the house at all on this night—some people came into the tap-room after the smoke was there; I did not notice who came in first—I did not hear any noise—I was four or five yards away from the tap-room door; I was walking towards the tap-room door—I did not stop at all, not till we saw the prisoner coming; we stopped when we saw him coming—we were standing out in the road so that anybody could see us—I did not see anybody else in the road at the time we stopped; I did not look round—the person that we saw could have seen us, there was nothing to prevent it—the person who stooped down walked away a few yards to the fence, and stood there a minute or two—I did not observe him run; he did not run—I did not speak to the landlord that night; I did not know the landlord then—Mr. Lemon, the butcher, came and talked to us, that same night, a few minutes afterwards—I talked the matter over with Mrs. Aplin; I spoke to her about it—I have stated that I recognised this man by his peculiar cough—I recognised him by his manner and his walk—I said at Chertsey that I knew he was the man by the cough he had; it is true that I recognised him by his cough—I said at Chertsey that I did not hear him cough that night—all I said was, "He has a peculiar cough, a bark, but I did not hear it that night"—I said he had a peculiar cough, like a dog; I had heard him several times as he passed my house—I did not say anything more about his cough—I heard him cough after the policeman brought him to me, going down the road; that was the cough I recognised him by—I did not hear him cough when he stooped down—there was a light in the tap-room—I saw Mr. Lemon about 10 minutes afterwards, when he came across.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I recognised the prisoner when he came out of the public-house, by his dress and his manner and his features—it was moonlight; I saw him distinctly, quite plainly—I am quite sure he is the man I saw coming out of the tap-room door; I have no doubt about it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry Aplin, a coachman—on the night of 22nd September I went to the Holly Tree with the last witness—we did not go in, we went towards it; it was about 10 minutes to 9 o'clock when we started from our house—I believe it was a fine night; it did not rain, I know—we were coming down to see for her husband—while we were there we saw a man come out of the front room door; he came round by the tap-room door, and I saw him push the door a little and stoop down and light something, and something went off like gun<lb></lb>powder; I don't know that it was gunpowder; he then came away from the door, and went and stood against the rails by the front door, not close by the front door; he stood there a little while, and then we saw him walk into the front door again—I did not see his features, I noticed his clothes—the man the policeman afterwards brought was dressed the same as the man I saw at the tap-room door—the prisoner is not dressed exactly the same now as he was when I saw him—he is about the height of the man I saw with the policeman—I can't swear to the prisoner.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I am not certain that the prisoner is the man that was brought by the policeman; I don't know his features; I had never seen the man before—I said before the Magistrate "I did not see his features, I did not take particular notice;" his dress was all I knew him by—I am quite sure that the man I saw walked towards the railings; I saw him come out of the house, and walk partly round—I know Mrs. Wood-yard's husband quite well, he lives next door to us—when I saw the man coming out I said to Mrs. Woodyard "That is your husband," and she said "It is the bargeman," and I asked her who the bargeman was—I only saw the man coming along; I saw him plainer afterwards—I know Mr. Lemon by sight; he came and talked to us afterwards—after it was done we went round by the tap-room door, and he came and spoke to us; that was about 10 minutes afterwards—I had seen him three or four minutes before, going across after his supper beer; that was while we stood there, after this had occurred—I did not notice how many men there were in the bar that night or in the tap-room.</p>

I am the landlord of the Holly Tree—on the evening of 22nd September, about 9 o'clock, I was in the bar parlour—I heard some one exclaim that there was a smell of smoke in the house; I after<lb></lb>wards heard the word "meter" used, and on hearing that I ran from the bar parlour, through the bar into the tap-room, where I saw the room full of smoke—I went forward to the door which leads into the street and I found the door of the box in which the meter was contained forced open; it was in the corner of the room, about a foot from the ground, and the meter was fitted inside—I found a piece of smoking paper inside the box—I put my hand inside the box and felt all round the meter to see if I could find any more paper burning, and I found some consumed fragments of paper—I afterwards saw a black mark on the floor leading from the tap-room door to the place where the meter was—the witness Lemon wetted his finger and put it down and pronounced it to be gunpowder—it looked like the sort of mark that gunpowder would make—I have known the prisoner for some time; he was once a lodger in my house; about the end of July or the beginning of August there was a small balance outstanding for board and lodging—he had been in and out of the house on this day since 2 o'clock in the afternoon at various times—I did not see him shortly before this happened, I was not in the bar—I did not see him in the tap-room that afternoon; he followed me into the taproom after I had examined the meter; he had been in the bar in the afternoon—when I went into the tap-room he followed me; I found him at my back as I was rising up from examining the meter to see if there was any more lighted paper, and he had a lighted paper in his hand and said "I will see if there is any," and stooped down—I pushed him back and said "No, no, there has been plenty of light here already"—afterwards, from some communication made to me, I gave him into custody.</p>

My reason for refusing to serve the prisoner was because he annoyed me so in my business, talking and jeering, and passing all sorts of remarks—it was not at all connected with the trouble I had had with the young man—he was not tipsy—it was not about the disputed account; I can't say exactly what it was; it was in many little ways—he had been a lodger in our house, and he annoyed us in that way, and for that reason we refused to let him remain there—he made a great noise after we had gone to bed, throwing things about, and this evening he was jeering at me, and annoyed me when I was serving the customers, passing all sorts of disagreeable remarks, chaff, and</p>

               <p>foolishness, and I said to my husband that I would not serve as long as he was there, and my husband told him he had better leave, as he was annoying me so—he came in again after that and went into the bagatelle<lb></lb>room—the latest time before 9 o'clock that I remember seeing him was only two or three minutes, perhaps five minutes—he had been in the bar then—I could not say to five minutes, he was in and out so much.</p>
               <p>----<hi rend="smallCaps">TYRRELL</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman</hi>). From information I received on the night of 22nd September I took the prisoner into custody at 11 o'clock—when I went to the house he was in bed—I called him up, and told him I wanted to see him—the two witnesses were outside, and I took him to them and asked if that was the man they saw—they said "Yes," and I told him I should take him in custody for trying to set fire to the Holly Tree public-house—he said "I know nothing about it"—he was the worse for drink—I was talking to him for about half an hour before I apprehended him, outside the public-house—he was standing in company with two more men about 10.30, and he asked me for a light—I told him he did not want any light, he had better go home, as he had had quite enough, and he went away home—the charge was read over to him at the station—he said nothing about it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When I first spoke to him he said he knew nothing about it—it was about 10.30 when he was on his way home—he lodged about 200 yards from the public-house—he asked me for a light for his pipe—I don't know at what time he left the public-house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, and live at 20, Gerard Street, Lewisham—on the night of this occurrence I was in the bar of the Holly Tree between 10 minutes and a quarter to nine o'clock—I remember some one coming to the tap-room door and complaining of the smoke—I don't know who it was; there were several there—I saw Lemon in the bar; I saw lots there—I don't know whether Lemon was the man that came; he might be—at that time the prisoner was in the bar with me, drinking with me—I spoke to him about his work, that was all—we had been speaking together I should think about a quarter of an hour—he never left me at all during that time.</p>

We were talking about the work; I don't know that there was anything particular said—he is a carpenter; I don't know the man—he was on the same job that I was—my job was fencing—I was at work about five minutes from the public-house—I only went there on Monday and came away on Wednesday—I only saw him to pass the time of day—I don't know what he is; I am a carpenter; he was labour<lb></lb>ing</p>

               <p>on the job, I suppose—I don't know what part of the work he was doing—I don't know whether all the workmen from the job went to this public-house—I have generally gone in there and had my pint; it was the nearest—I was working for Mr. Cole at park-paling fence—I don't know what work the prisoner was doing: I saw him with a shovel in his hand—we were talking together this evening for about 10 minutes—I really can't tell what I said to him or he to me; it was something about the work—I don't know that there were any other men there who were on the same job; I did not go before the Magistrate, I was away—I heard of the prisoner being taken—I had a bed at Mrs. Aplin's; I heard them talking about this affair; I told Mrs. Aplin that I was with the prisoner at the time, and told her to be very careful what she said, as she might be putting away the young man—I said I thought he could not be the man, because I had been with him so long; I said that the same night—I understood that she thought he was the man—I did not go before the Magistrate as a witness because I went away from there on the Monday, and went to work at Bromley for Mr. Cole; I did not think there was anything very important about it—I did not know what he was charged with—I don't suppose I had half a dozen words with Mrs. Aplin all the time I was stopping there—I did not know the case was so serious as it has turned out to be; if I had been sent for I should have gone, but I had a letter from my employer to go to Bromley to work—I had reason to think the woman might be doing him an injustice by fixing him with a serious charge, but my business called me away—I could only give evidence that the man was with me at the bar at the time; of course, that made me doubt if the woman's evidence was correct—for two or three days after this fire I was employed at Chertsey, about five minutes' walk from the Holly Tree; I don't know how far it was from where the Magistrate was sitting.</p>

I remember Bolton telling me that I must be very careful, for that he was with the prisoner at the bar—Bolton lodged at my house; he came home at 10 o'clock that night, I can't remember whether that was before or after the policeman came—when he came home he began talking to us about it, and I told him this was the man, and he said the prisoner had been drinking with him—he did not say how long; he said I must take care what I said, or I should get the man into it, or get him away for a long time.</p>

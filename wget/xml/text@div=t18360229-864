                  </hi>. I am uncle of one of the prisoners. He works on the river, and has charge of a barge belonging to Mr. Fuller, of Limehouse—in February last that barge wanted repairing, and it was to go to Lime-house-reach, to Mr. Tulley's yard, to be repaired—it was to pass the Gra<lb></lb>vel Engine to get there—I had seen a stove on board that barge for three weeks before the barge went to be repaired—it was not concealed at all—the Gravel Engine is a place where people constantly deposit things—it was not necessary to deposit the stove on board the barge, while it is repaired—it was taken out and left on board the engine, but I do not know who by.</p>

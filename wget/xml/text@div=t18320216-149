I was sent for to Edward-street, Hoxton, to look at these books - the prisoner called on me to go, and I went and saw her son, but not her; she called on me about the middle of January, and asked me 40s. for the books - I ultimately agreed to buy them for 32s. -I sent my boy home immediately after her, and he brought them to me, but he is not here - the prisoner said they were the refuse of a set of books, which she had to dispose of, but she was not present when I saw them.</p>

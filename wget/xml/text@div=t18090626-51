               <p>Q. How long had she left your service - A. About a fortnight or three weeks. She had lived with me about eight or ten months; she had got into another service, she lived at the White Horse, Fetter-lane. I took with me Bray, Tipper, and Sherrin, I went to search a house, No. 13, Bowling-alley, next door to the other house, we found none of my property there.</p>
               <p>Q. What occasion have you to charge her with stealing the things mentioned in the indictment - A. We found them in the house of Mrs. Holland.</p>
               <p>Q. Then your search at this No. 13 produced no property - A. No, none at all. I afterwards found these articles at Mrs. Holland's, except the napkin.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Did not the poor woman tell you that Mrs. Parker had given her that napkin instead of a towel, which is now at your house, and which was her property - A. She might have said so at the Mansion house, but I did not hear it. She conducted herself extremely well at my house.</p>

             - A. Yes, she had a furnished room some where in Cloth-fair; she came in the evening late; she said her husband was gone, she could not afford to pay six-shillings a week for an apartment; if I could make it convenient for her to stay with me till she could get a situation; I gave her leave. She brought her box and clothes; some time after I saw a set of fire irons, wrapped up in an old cloth; she told me that she bought her own crockery ware, and her own linen.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know her husband - A. I saw him once. She lived with me a few weeks, then she went to the Bath-hotel; she lived four weeks there, she returned home to me; she left what she had with me; one box the constable searched, that box she told me she had purchased the articles that were in it.</p>

            . I took the prisoner at the White-horse, Fetter-lane. I found a napkin in her box. I brought it to the Mansion-house; it has A. H. upon it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. This is but half a napkin - A. Yes, it is not a whole one, certainly.</p>

               <p>- SHERRIN. I am a constable. In consequence of a search warrant, I went to Mrs. Holland's house, in Camden-court, Grub-street; I searched the prisoner's box, there I found a set of fire irons; a plate marked Hale, and co.; and seven cups and saucers.</p>
               <p>MR. BLIZARD. I can speak to the plate, it has our name on it; and the napkin is marked in full length; it has been attempted to be taken out.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. These fire irons my husband bought me, and the day I left Mrs. Holland, I sold them to her for six shillings; and this napkin that Mr. Hale claimed,

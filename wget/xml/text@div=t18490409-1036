                  </hi>. I keep a tobacconist's shop in Bear-lane, Greenwich. On 13th March a young man in his shirt-sleeves called, and asked for an ounce of the best tobacco and a halfpenny pipe, and paid roe with a crown-piece—I gave him the change, and he went away—I put the crown into a bowl with some small silver, but there was no other crown—a policeman came in directly—I marked it, and gave it to him.</p>

On the evening of 13th March I was in Deptford Broadway, in plain clothes—I saw the two prisoners, and watched them for an hour—they went to the other side of Greenwich College, and at last they came to Mrs. Morris's—Knight went in there in his shirt-sleeves—Jones remained opposite the shop—he then went and placed himself by a post about thirty yards off, in sight of the shop—when Knight came out he went in the direction where Jones was—I went into the shop, and received from Mrs. Morris this crown—I then went in pursuit of the prisoners—I came up with them in three or four minutes—Knight then had a jacket on—I took the prisoners into custody—I saw Jones put his hand into his pocket and drop something like a piece of rag into an area—I said they were charged with passing a bad crown at Mrs. Morris's—they said they knew nothing about it—I searched Knight, and found on him some tobacco in a paper, a half-crown, and two shillings—I pointed out to Serjeant Carpenter the area where I had noticed Jones to drop something.</p>

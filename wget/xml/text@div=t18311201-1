On the 5th of October, about eight o'clock at night, the prisoner called on me - he appeared sober; he said he called, expecting a letter, or message; from his wife - I told him I had received no letter, nor message; his wife was at that time working at Mrs. Nightingale's, Fetter-lane- he asked if I would go and fetch her; I said I would not, but at last my niece went to see if she was there - she at last came to my room; that was between half-past eight and nine o'clock - the prisoner was still in the room; when she first came in he got up and caught hold of her by the hand, as if in friendship - he then pushed her into the corner, and asked her to live with him again; she replied, "Keep off, I cannot live with you any more; "I then got up, and said, "Parrott, leave her alone;" I took her into an adjoining room, and said, "Mrs. Parrott, you have weathered many storms with him, try him once more" - she said she could not, for she was in danger of her life; he was in my kitchen at the time, but could hear what passed, for he pushed into the room immediately, and I then took her into the bed-room - he followed us into that room, and asked her if she would return to him again; she told him No, she could not live with him any more - he said, "Won't you?" she said No, she could not; he pushed her into a corner, and then turned himself round quick - I turned round but for a moment; he did not speak, then he turned round, and I saw him put his hand into his pocket, pull out a piece of paper, and he directly seized her by the throat; she called out, "Oh, my throat! my throat!" I called to my husband, "Chell, for goodness sake come here, for he is choking her;" I did not suppose he was doing any thing more than throttling her - my husband came immediately; I then saw her throat was bleeding to an extreme - she said, "The instrument is in my throat;" he said, "No, it is not," and then he threw a razor away - it caught on my drawers, and broke the glass; I directly sent for an officer - I afterwards saw the officer take the razor up, and it was bloody; his wife bled so profusely, that my husband went without coat or hat on for Mr. Bradford, the surgeon - he arrived in about ten minutes; the bleeding had not stopped - my husband did all he could to stanch the blood.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner do? A. I was supporting his wife on a chair, and he came and said, "Good bye, perhaps we shall meet again in another world;" he was then secured - I kept his wife at my house all night, and sat up with her all night, fearing it would hurt her to remove her; she was taken to the hospital next morning, and was there three weeks - the wound was very large; it went upwards, which prevented its cutting the arteries.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Have you known them often quarrel, and be reconeiled again? A. I must leave that to the wife to say; she never left him before, to my knowledge, except to sleep at a friend's house for a night; I have known them quarrel - they never separated; I cannot say whether he had a strong affection for her - he expressed a strong affection that night, and entreated her to come back; he never would work for her, nor his family - he said, "My dear Harriet, for God's sake let us be reconciled;" I never saw any thing to lead me to conclude he was flighty in his mind - his wife has said his tricks were mad at times when he was tipsy, but he was quite sober then.</p>
               <p>Q.His wife said his tricks were mad at times? A. No, not on that night, nor any thing like it; she has repeatedly said that he had mad tricks, and was tipsy - she never told me he had met with an accident in the head; I know nothing of his having a blow from a cricket-ball- he has had five children by his wife; the eldest is twenty-two, and the youngest nine years old.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the prisoner call out, at the instant he cut her throat, "Oh, God! what have I done?" A. No, he did not; he did not support her in his arms - he did not touch her till my husband got her out of the bed-<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183112010004"></xptr>room into the kitchen; he then sat down opposite me, took up the beer, and drank the officer's good health - when the doctor came he knelt down on the hearth, and looked at the wound while the doctor was sewing her throat; we would not let him go out - it did not strike me that there was any thing extraordinary in his conduct.</p>

            . The prisoner is my husband - he had not lived with me from the Tuesday five weeks before this happened; I was at work at Mrs. Nightingale's, and slept over the water - I did not then know where he lived. I went to Mrs. Chell's on the 5th of October, as she sent over for me - I got there between eight and pine o'clock, and saw my husband there; when I opened the room door he came to me in a hurry - I told him to keep off; he came to me - I said, "Keep off! keep off! let me alone!" Mrs. Chell asked me to go into the next room, and I told him to keep away and let me alone; Mrs. Chell then asked me to try him again, and live with him - I said I could not, and then he came into the room; I do not think he could hear what was said - he asked me to live with him again; I said I could not - he asked me again, and said, "Won't you?" I said No; he said again, "Won't you?" I said No - he turned sideways to me, took something out of his pocket like a letter, and tore it, then turned round, and took me by one side of the neck and pressed it, but what with I could not fell; I said afterwards, "Oh! you have left the instrument in my throat;" he said, "No, I have not - there it is," and threw something across; I perceived blood coming from my throat - there was a looking-glass opposite, and I could see it streaming down; I just recollect Mrs. Chell coming to me, and remember getting across the room into the kitchen, and sitting down there, and that is all: I just recollect my husband saying, "We shall meet in another world;" I was insensible when the surgeon came - I came to myself afterwards; I passed the night at Chells, then went to the hospital, and was there three weeks and one day; I had been married to the prisoner twenty-three years - I have three children with me now; the youngest is between nine and ten years old - I do not know how my husband got his living after I left him; I am quite sure I said nothing to him, but refused to live with him again; I did not reproach him, or strike him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I believe you had some quarrels? A. Yes, and had been reconciled again; Mrs. Nightingale had talked to him the day after I left him, but not particularly to reconcile us - she had not endeavoured to persuade me to return to him; I have seen my husband in rather a flighty and deranged state of mind when he has had a little to drink.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not seen him at times a little flighty without drink? A. No, not particularly - drink would make him flighty latterly; his actions were like a mad man sometimes - he was struck by a cricket-ball on Kenningnton-common six or seven years ago, and received an injury on the temple; he did attempt to destroy himself the day after I left him, which was five weeks before - I do not know of his having attempted it before at any time.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you know whethere he has a mark on his neck of his having attempted to cut his throat? A. I have heard he attempted it; he was sober when I came to Chell's - it was all done in the space of five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not think he was in the state you had seen him before, crazy and heated? A. He did not appear so bad then - he was all of a work seemingly; I was not in the first room half a minute, and hardly know what condition he was in there - I was so flurried at seeing him, I hardly know; I think he said, "My dear Harriet, for God's sake let us make peace;" he appeared anxious to be reconciled - I do not know what happened to me after my throat was cut, and do not know what he said at the instant; I do not recollect his saying, "O, God! what have I done?"

            . I am a surgeon, and live in Fleet-street. I was sent for to Mrs. Chell's about nine o'clock in the evening; Mrs. Parrott was sitting in a chair- there was a puddle of blood, in the room, and a great deal over her clothes; Mr. Chell's hand was over her neck, and when it was with drawn the blood flowed freely - I said at first that she was dead, for she was cold and blanched, and her sight apparently gone, but Chell said she was not dead; it was a large wound, four or five inches long, of a semicircular shape - it had gone obliquely upwards; the large vessels were laid bare for an inch and a half - the jugular vein had a slight scratch; if the wound had not gone upwards it must have caused instant death; I secured the vessels, laid her down, and sewed the wound up- I went with her to the hospital: I thought the wound dangerous, and ordered her to lay on the floor all night, and not to be moved - I saw the prisoner in the room; my mind was engaged with the wound, but I heard him say, "I committed it;" when the wound was dressed he approached towards her, and used some expressions, but I thrust him back.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.You do not recollect the expression? A. I do not, but I was afraid he would disturb the wound again by the excitement; he was in one corner of the room when I entered, and Mr. Chell was holding the wound; I found the room door open - I should think the prisoner might easily have gone before I came.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY to MRS. PARROTT. Q.Before you went into the second room you yourself said you would not live with him? A. I said I could not live with him - I did not say to Mrs. Chell, "You see he is mad in a moment;" I said, "See how he turns in a moment."</p>

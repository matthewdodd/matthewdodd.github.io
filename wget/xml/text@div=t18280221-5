            . I am the wife of John Doggett - we live in Huntsworth-mews, Dorset-square; we have one room there over a stable, and pay 2s. 6d, a week for it- Mr. Peters is the landlord - his gig is kept there, but no horse: the stable and all belong to us - we keep the key of it, and go through it to get to our own room: Peters has a key of the stable also, and kept a cart there - my husband does not take care of them; Peters lives in Upper Park-place - we do not use the stable. On the 29th of January, at ten minutes to two o'clock, I left home, and left nobody there - I locked the room door and put the key into my pocket, then came down stairs into the stable, locked the stable door, and put that key into my pocket; there is a door at the foot of the stairs that has no lock: in about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, Richard Peters fetched me from Mrs. Simmond's - I went home, and found the stable door lock wrenched clean off, and hanging to the door; I found my room door broken open - I missed two silver watches, and a silver spoon out of a little mug on the mantelpiece; I had seen them safe when I went out - I have not found any of my things; the prisoner lodged with us when we lived at No. 1, in the mews; I had seen him on the Thursday before, going up the mews - I opened my window, and said, "Jonas, have you any work?" he said No; I said, I had a new clock, and asked him up to see it - he came up; the watches were on the mantel-piece then.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. The prisoner is a carpenter? A. Yes, I know nothing about his character, he behaved well while with us.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's brother. On the 29th of January, at six o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner going up Huntsworth-mews - he was about thirty yards from the stable door, and had passed the door; I overtook him, and said, "Jonas, have you any work?" he said, only a job or two on his own account; he asked if my brother's wife was at Peters, at work, (she often works there) - I said, I thought she was working at No. 7, Edward-street, which is just at the back of the stable; he asked again, if she was not at Peters' - I said, she was not; he said, I am pretty sure she is, for I think I saw her about dinner time - I said, she was at Edward-street when I went home to dinner - I wished him good night, and left him in Park-place, at the corner of Edward-street - I went home to No. 7, Edward-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is not his master's workshop in the mews? A. Yes, Mr. King is master of the shop where he had a little job; he said he had been working there six or eight weeks - I understand he was then doing a little job in King's shop; he had a basket which lapped over the handles, not a carpenter's basket exactly.</p>

            . I live at No. 6, Huntsworth-mews, Dorset-square - my husband is a coachman. On the 29th of January, about half-past six o'clock in the evening, I heard a noise as if somebody were trying my door to make me hear, as I have no knocker; my dog barked - I got up, looked out, and saw the prisoner coming from Doggett's stable; he looked up at my window, saw me, and immediately put his basket down, and stopped under my window as if for a necessary purpose; my room is over the stable - I shut my window and saw no more; there was a little boy passing on the opposite side of the way - the prisoner was between my door and Doggett's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know King's workshop in the mews? A. Yes; he was more than thirty yards from there: there are three or four stables and coach-houses between us and the workshop - when I saw him he was coming towards King's workshop.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is King's workshop on the other side of Doggett's? A. My house is between Doggett's and the workshop.</p>

            . I live at No. 24, Lisson-street, Mary-le-bone, and am a bricklayer. I have known the prisoner about two years - I saw him on the 29th of January, between nine and ten o'clock in the morning, at Mrs. Collins', the Portman Arms, Dorset-square - I was at breakfast there; he came in, and took up the paper - I sat opposite him: he called me over, and said, "Will you go with me to break open Doggett's house to-night?" I said No, I would not, and went and sat down in my place; he called me again, and asked if I should be there by six o'clock - I said perhaps I might, as I used the house; I said I was generally there: he pulled a screw-driver out of his side pocket, and said, "I have got the tools that will do it;" I took the screw-driver in my hand, and looked at it - I gave it him again, and he put it into his pocket - that is all that passed. I noticed the screw-driver - it was rusty nearly all the way up - I should know it again; he did not ask me to rob Mr. Morse - it was Doggett's name that he mentioned; Mrs. Doggett was once Mrs. Morse. I went there again about three o'clock in the afternoon, and about six, as I was having some beer with my brother Charles, he came in, and passed Pain at the bar; he came to the tap-room door, and beckoned me out - I shook my head, and would not go out; I remained there till about five minutes to eight o'clock - I did not expect to see him there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it not occur to you to give notice to Mr. Doggett, or to any Magistrate? A. I was in danger of my life, for he has a great character as a fighting-man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Give us a better description of the screw-driver? A. It was not very rusty - I noticed nothing more particular in it; I had it about two minutes in my hand: there was nobody else in the tap-room. I am generally at the Portman Arms when I am out of work; my brother lives near there, and gives me a little; the potboy was in and out of the room in the morning, when he asked me to go and break the house open. I was once taken up on suspicion of something; I was never in custody but once, except for making a noise in the streets; I was never charged with stealing a great coat: I was taken up about four sovereigns by a young man; I have heard my mother has paid him so much a week to make it up - she never told me so herself. I have been out of work about eighteen months - I have worked for Mr. Phillips, a builder in Regent's-park, about three weeks; that was just before the hard frost set in.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first think of telling this story? A. On the Saturday after the Tuesday it was committed - I told the Magistrate of it because I wished to tell the truth - I told Mrs. Doggett of it the morning after the prisoner was taken, on the Wednesday, about one o'clock; I did not hear of the robbery till about twelve - Gibbs was in the public-house, and asked if he did not see me in Tottenham-court-road last night, going to a dog fight - I said No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say a word about the prisoner before you were charged with it? A. No. Mrs. Doggett is sometimes called Morse, but I mentioned the name of Doggett to the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where did you see Gibbs? A. He came to the Portman Arms next morning; he did not take me into custody; he said, "I want you to come down to the office - your mother and Mrs. Doggett are there;" I went with him - I did not know the robbery was done till then; he said Mrs. Doggett suspected me; my brother William works at St. Katharine's Docks - I have not seen him for six weeks - my brother Charles also works there; I saw my brother William about a week before the robbery, but not since.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. How long has your brother William been working at the Docks? A. I do not know - Charles was paving some stables at the back of the mews at the time the robbery was committed.</p>

I have worked at St. Katharine's Docks about nine days: my brother William went to work there a week or ten days before me - we both work there now - we came home together last night - he lives in Sovereign-street, Edgware-road.</p>
               <p>Q. When were you, William, and Thomas together last? A. I do not know - it is a good while ago; we do not take heed of him. I have known the prisoner about two years and a half - on the evening after his first examination I went up to see if it was true that he was in custody, and as he was coming out to the van, I said, "Jonas, I am afraid you are betrayed" - he said, "Betrayed! what do you mean? I do not think I am, without your brother William has come against me;" I said, "Mrs. Morse has offered my brother Thomas a sum of money to speak the truth;" he then got into the van, and I saw him no more of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How much had Mrs. Morse offered? A. I do not know; I heard she had offered money - she told me so herself, in her own room; I do not know how much it was: I was at work just at the back of these<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182802210008"></xptr>stables; my brother Thomas used to come to me to relieve him - whenever I had a pint of beer he was welcome to part of it, let his character he what it would; I give him a drop of beer if he wants it, but I do not keep his company; it is not my place to expose him - he has certainly been bad, but he has suffered the law for it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were you at the Portman Arms on the 29th of January? A. I was there in the evening, and sat with my back to the door, and my brother sat facing the door: I did not see Jonas come in myself; my brother Thomas was at work in the Regent's-park last summer, for six or seven weeks - it was about the beginning of the summer; he was not at work in the winter.</p>

            . I am a constable. I heard of this robbery about half-past nine o'clock at night; I went next morning, before day-light, to the prisoner's house in Princes-street, Lisson-grove, with Doggett - when the shop was open I went up to the second floor room, and knocked at the door; he was in bed, and asked who was there - I said my name was Gibbs; he dressed, and let me in; I said he was suspected of robbing Mrs. Doggett last night; he said, "I am innocent, Mr. Gibbs - I will go with you any where - you are welcome to search the place;" I did so, but found nothing; I asked if he had any tools - he said, "I have a few down in the wash-house, where I keep my work bench;" he took me down, and in a small basket there was a large screw-driver - he said, "That is all the tools I have." I took him to the office, then examined the stable door, and found a very small space had been worked out with a similar tool to this, but I do not mean to say the mark tallied; the lock had been forced off, but was then mended; any screw-driver might have done it; the prisoner told me, going along, that he could account for where he had been that evening. I afterwards received private information that Thomas Peirce knew something of the robbery, and took him at the Portman Arms; he walked down with me, and his mother - he was not in custody; I took him into custody on the day of the second examination; he has been in custody ever since, to give evidence.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When you first went to him, did you charge him with the robbery? A. No; I said I wanted him to go down to his mother; I did not tell him he was suspected till Saturday. The lock of the room was inside - it could not be forced off; the bolt was wrenched back.</p>

            . I live in Upper Park-place, Dorset-square, and have a workshop in Huntsworth-mews. I have known the prisoner two years - he worked for me the summer before last, and this winter, for about ten weeks; he often worked at my shop; I owed him 10d.: on the 29th of January, he came to my house about ten minutes or a quarter past six o'clock, and stopped and talked at my door for a quarter of an hour.</p>

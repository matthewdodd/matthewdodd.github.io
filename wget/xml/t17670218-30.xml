               <p>Morris. She was a widow, they were married on the 26th of August last, and the marriage was entered according to act of a parliment, I put my name down as a witness.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did she live?</p>
               <p>Morris. She lived near the church, in Church-court, opposite the sign of the Crown. I think I have heard her say she lived there 12 years. After the wedding we went to Chelsea, and came back and dined at my house; then he, my wife and his wife, went to Sadler's-wells together.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I married my first wife in the neighbourhood of St. John's-street where Mr. Morris lives, and I have not lived with her 3 years; I was credibly informed she was dead, or I had never carried my wife into that neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>Q. to Morris. Did the prisoner live in St. John's-street as a housekeeper?</p>
               <p>Morris. No, he never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he pass for a married man or a batchelor?</p>
               <p>Morris. He past for a batchelor; I remember he did once tell me he had had a wife, but she was dead.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Morris has seen my first wife several times in that neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>Morris. If I have seen her, I did not know that she was his wife.</p>

               <p>I have no other wife living to my knowledge; I acknowledge to both the marriages; I never saw my first wife for between 2 and 3 years; there was a woman came and took me up with a constable, but who she I don't know. She may be raised from the dead for what I know. I was a little in liquor; I can prove I had letters when I was at Hull in Yorkshire that she was dead, and I came to London directly, but did not give myself a great deal of trouble about her; after that I heard she died in Ireland.</p>
               <p>For the prisoner</p>
               <p>John. I knew the prisoner in staff, and westminster I saw him at Oxford races.</p>
               <p>Q. How come you there?</p>
               <p>Casper. I deal in the country with goods; he was telling me his wife was dead; I never know he was married again till I came to London this last time, but I heard several people that travel with goods say he was married again.</p>

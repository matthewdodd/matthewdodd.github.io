            . I am waiter at the Cock and Lion public-house, Wigmore-street. I know the prisoner- I saw him at our house on the 25th of March, at half-past seven o'clock in the morning; he came in, and had a coat on his arm, and a hat doubled up in his grenadier's cap; he produced two bottles out of his pocket, one full of wine and the other half full; he sat down, and called for half a gill of vinegar, which he drank - he then got up, pulled his regimentals off, put on the coat, hat, and stock, and left his regimentals in my care, promising me that he would be back by ten o'clock for them; he went out at half-past eight, and did not come back - I found him next morning in custody; I took his regimentals to the watch-house, and gave them to the officer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was he drunk? A. Yes.</p>

            . I am an officer of High-street Police-office. I have a coat, waistcoat, stock, hat, a pair of gloves, and a handkerchief, which I took off the prisoner, on the Wednesday night, when I found him in the Birdcagewalk barracks; I went to apprehend him in consequence of Mr. Neale's death - he was confined in the guard-house- I called him by name, and began to pull these clothes off; he asked what I was going to do - I said to take him back to the barracks; he was a little in liquor, and resisted the clothes being taken off; one of the serjeants said he was in the civil power, and must submit: he then said,"Then I am a lost ruined young man;" I said, "Young<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182904090042"></xptr>man, do you recollect going home with a gentleman last night?" he hesitated, and said, "No. I went home with no gentleman;" he said he was with three girls in Oxford-street: when I got him to the office I said I took him for the murder of a Mr. Neale last night - he said, "Good God, I murdered no gentleman last night - I can prove where I was;" in the morning he asked me if the gentleman was dead - I said he was; he asked if the Inquest had sat - I said it had not, and told him he had better say nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. At what time did you take him? A. About nine o'clock in the morning - he was not sober.</p>

            . I am the cousin of Mr. Neale. I remember his coming home on the night in question, accompanied by the prisoner; I endeavoured to convey him to bed,but finding it impossible, arrangements were made for his lying down in the dining-room - he laid down in his clothes; Norris alarmed me in the morning - he was found dead, and his clothes gone; I know all these to have been his clothes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was he a married man? A. Yes- his widow is now living; he has two brothers and a child; I believe he made no will - I do not know whether any one has administered - Mrs. Neale was not at home at the time.</p>

The gentleman and I were left together about two o'clock; after resting some time he awoke from his sleep, and awoke me also, about four o'clock in the morning, I suppose; he got up, and asked if I had been absent from my barracks - I said Yes, for two days and two nights; he said, "Do you mean to go back?" I said I did not know; he said, "If you take my advice you will never go back again - you will get severely punished - I will give you these clothes; make the best of your way out of the country, and never come back again." I am as innocent of this charge as of the last.</p>

On Monday, the 6th of September, about seven o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner at Mr. Vincent's skittle-ground, the Star and Garter, at Hammersmith—he asked me to go with him as far as the Broad<lb></lb>way—we went to the Suspension-bridge public-house—he went to ask the girl there if she was going to the play, and then we went to the Swan—he said he wanted to go out backwards, and left me in the tap-room—he was gone five or six minutes—he owed me, and we went down to the Star and Gar<lb></lb>ter again—there I left him—he said he would go and get his watch out of pawn—I met him next morning, and we come to London together, and went to Bartholomew-fair—I saw him sell two coins at Mr. Whitford's at Smithfield-bars, for 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—we came home together—he gave it to officer after I was taken up.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a watch-maker, and live at Smithfiled-bars. I purchased these two pieces of coin, I think it was on Wednesday, the 8th of September, the last day of the fair, of the prisoner—Gyett was with him—I gave him 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for them—the prisoner was dressed differently—he had a hat on, and at Bow-street he had a cap on, which made a material differ<lb></lb>ence in his appearance, and I could not recognise him—I am now positive he is the person, by his countenance—I delivered the coins to the officer.</p>

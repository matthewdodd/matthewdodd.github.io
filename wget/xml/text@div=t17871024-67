               pleaded GUILTY
            </rs> by advice of his counsel, and called two witnesses, who gave him a very good character, and he having saved the life of one of the revenue officers against the outrages of his associates, the recorder passed sentence on him as follows:</p>
               <p>Prisoner at the bar. You have in this case, in the first instance, been guilty of a crime, which certainly would have brought you within the description of those laws, that punish resistance against the officers of the revenue with death: You have in the first instance, in strictness of law, most unquestionably forfeited your life; and it is highly necessary for the public, and for the preservation of the revenue, that those laws should be carried into pretty rigorous execution; but you have in a considerable degree, atoned for the crime in which you have engaged, by saving the life of a fellow-subject; which is a circumstance of merit, which ought always to be considered in the administration of justice; those who prosecute on behalf of the crown, have proceeded with great candour and lenity in this case; they have brought the offender before the Court, and have themselves stated to that Court, the circumstances which induced them to think you an object of lenity and favor: these circumstances therefore, the Court think it right to follow up the merciful intentions of the crown, and to pass such a sentence on you, as compared with the nature of your original offence, will certainly wear the appearance, rather of a reward than punishment; you have saved your life by the circumstance I have already mentioned; but for your own sake, as well as for the sake of the public, it is necessary, that this Court, in following up the merciful intentions of the crown, should at the same time teach and convince you, that you have grievously offended against the laws, and therefore the Court think it right to inflict some punishment upon you, though it should be of short duration; and as you have a good character, the Court would not wish, for your own sake, to mix you with the felons in Newgate; therefore, I shall shorten the term, that otherwise would have been thought necessary to have confined you; and instead of ordering you generally to be confined for six months; I shall order you to be <rs id="t17871024-67-punish350" type="punishmentDescription">

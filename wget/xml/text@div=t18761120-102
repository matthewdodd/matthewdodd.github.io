                  </hi>. I am an engine-driver—in November, 1875, I was living with my father at 5, Ashdown, Buckstead, Sussex—at that time I opened an account at the Savings' bank at Uckfield; and I received this deposit-book; this is my name at the beginning; it was issued to me by the Uckfield post-master—on 27th November I deposited 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. there; my father went with me——on 15th January I deposited 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and subsequently 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. through my sister at Rotherfield post-office—since I paid in those sums I have never drawn any out, or authorised any one to do so for me—about 6th June I went to work at Midhurst—I was then lodging at my Bister's house once a month—she is the prisoner's wife; they lived in Town Row, Rotherfield—on a Monday evening in June I remember looking for my deposit-book and it was there all right; I kept it in a little box in my clothes box in the bedroom where I slept—I went away on 31st July and returned to my sister's on 26th August, and next day, Sunday, I examined my box and found that the little box was gone containing my deposit-book—I spoke to my sister about it after breakfast; the prisoner was present, and he said he would see if they had lost anything—he and my sister went upstairs and they said they had lost a ring and a. pair of black cloth trousers—I went to the post-office at Rotherfield that morning, my sister went with me, and I gave information to the post-master of my loss—I caused a letter to be written to the authorities, the prisoner wrote it at his own house; this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I signed my name to it at the bottom. (<hi rend="italic">Bead:</hi>"August 27th, 1876. Dear sir,—I have had the misfortune to lose my bank-book from my box.

If no one has not taken the money out, I wish you would stop them, and let me know by return of post. I believe the number of my book is 1207. I had the book from Uckfield postoffice for 5, Ashdown. I live at Rotherfield now with my sister and brother. I have lost my letters that I had from you altogether with my book. Signed, John Reed, engine driver.")

                  </hi>. I am post-master of the post-office at Rotherfield—on 2nd August I recollect a person coming and asking for a withdrawal notice; I can't tell at what time he came; it was some time during the day——the prisoner is the man that came——I asked him if he had got a savings' bank book, and he produced a deposit book; I can't say that this is the exact book; he produced a book, and I got him to fill up the notice from the book—it is the same number on the book, it is No. 1207, Uckfield—I handed the prisoner a withdrawal form; this is it; I told him how to fill it up; he filled it np and signed it in my presence. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Uckfield, 1207, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., Rotherfield, John Reed, Rotherfield, labourer.") He signed that "John Reed," and put in the word "labourer "—I then gave him the withdrawal notice and he posted it to the chief office—on the morning of 4th August I saw him again; he came into my office and wanted to know if there was a letter for John Reed; I told him the mail bag was not in yet; he said he would call again presently—in the course of about a quarter or half an-hour the mail bag came in; the letters were sorted out, and there was no letter for John Reed——in about half or three quarters of an hour the prisoner came again and produced this warrant; he did not say how he had got it, he simply produced it——I saw that it corresponded with the advice I had received, and I paid him the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he signed the name "John Reed "on the warrant——that is a receipt—at the time I paid him the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I made this entry in the deposit book: "August 5th, 1876, K 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., G.E."—I did not know the prisoner before by name, only by sight—as far as I knew he was John Reed.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I saw him about after the 4th of August, and I saw him when the sergeant of police brought him to my office about three weeks after——the post-office is about a mile from where he resides—when the sergeant brought him it was about the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. being withdrawn—I did at first say I would not swear to his being the man; it was in the evening—I swore to him before the Magistrate on the 4th September; I think that was three or four days after the sergeant had brought him to me——I had seen the prisoner in the interim and I had seen Mogford, the letter carrier; he comes to my office every morning—I had also seen the sergeant——the prisoner wrote the first document in my presence; he wrote it as anyone would, freely enough.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you lose the halfpence on the 16th of December? - A. On the 15th I had suspicions of him, I sent for the constable on the 16th, his box was searched in my presence by the constable; the prisoner was standing by at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon opening of the box what did you find? - A. We found several papers of copper, some half-crown papers, some five shillings, and some two shillings; one half-crown paper I could swear to; the prisoner said at the time the paper might be mine, but I could not swear to the money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear to having wrapped up halfpence in this paper? - A. I have sworn to it; there were three or four half-crowns tied in such paper.</p>
               <p>Q. It is such paper as all cheesemonger's use? A. No, not all, it is part of an old book.</p>
               <p>Q. You buy all sorts of paper? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose other cheesemongers buy all sorts too? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. All you can say merely is, that you wrapped up some halfpence in some waste paper, and this paper is of the same description? - A. I know it is mine.</p>
               <p>Court. How do you know that paper is yours? A. Because the other papers were tied up at the same time, and they correspond one with another, I know by the appearance of the hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. This kind of paper was laying about your shop to be used? - A. It was behind the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. And therefore the prisoner being in your shop he might get it for any purpose that he wanted it for? - A. He might.</p>

             sworn. Examined by Mr. Gleed. I am a constable, I apprehended the prisoner, and searched his box; I produce the paper parcels of halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find that parcel of copper money? - A. At the bottom of the box, he unlocked the box himself. I told the prisoner I thought it was strange of him having this quantity of halfpence; he said that he carried on business for himself at Hounslow, and had taken them in payment; the master said then he could swear to the paper, that he had told the prisoner to tie up between two and three pounds worth, and one of these parcels was the parcel that was missing; the prisoner said he might swear to the paper, but he could not swear to the money.</p>

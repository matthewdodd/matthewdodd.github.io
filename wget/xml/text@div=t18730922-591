                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Packer, of Ampton Street, Gray's Inn Road—on 22nd August I was on Tower Hill, I felt my dress touched—I looked down and saw the prisoner's hand in my pocket, I grasped him by the collar with one hand, and with the other caught his hand in my pocket, with the purse in it; I pulled his hand out of my pocket, purse and all, and took the purse from his hand, it was open, there was then only 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in it, it had contained 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and two duplicates—I saw him pass his hand, and a young man with weak eyes ran away directly—some man said "There goes the man with the money"—I said "Never mind the man with the money, I have got the man who put his hand in my pocket"—I saw the money in the prisoner's hand—he got away from me, but he was stopped by a person named Robinson, and I gave him into custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was speaking to a person at a photograph shop, and the prisoner was looking at the pictures while he was picking my pocket—I daresay there were twenty or thirty persons about, it was about half-past 1 o'clock, just the dinner time—I caught hold of the prisoner's hand actually in my pocket, with the purse in it, and the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was between his fingers—I had come up from New Cross with 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and I changed one at the station.</p>

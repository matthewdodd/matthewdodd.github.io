               <p>HENRY NUNNEY. I live at the Green Man, public-house, Coal-yard, Drury-lane. On the 30th of April I was in <placeName id="t18250519-130-crimeloc771">Watling-street</placeName>

I was going along very quick, and perceived something touch my clothes; I felt in my pocket, and my handkerchief not being there, I looked into my hat, but could not find it - I walked on, and saw nothing till I saw an officer with the prisoner in custody; he produced a handkerchief, which I could not be certain of; it resembles mine. I live with my brother, a publican, and <rs id="t18250519-130-viclabel772" type="occupation">serve in his bar</rs>

            . I am a constable of the Thames Police. I saw the prosecutor in Watling-street, at twelve o'clock in the day - I saw the prisoner in company with two others, following him; I was on the opposite side of the way, and watched them; I saw them come near to Nunney, and saw the prisoner take a handkerchief from Nunney's right hand coat pocket - he tucked it into his trowsers: I am certain of it. I immediately ran across the road, and secured the prisoner in Budge-row; the others immediately ran away. When I laid hold of the prisoner he took the handkerchief out of his trowsers, and I took it out of his hand; I shewed it to Nunney, who asked me to give it to him, and let him go, but I kept it, and took him before the Lord Mayor. Nunney did not express a doubt about its being his. The prisoner had an old one in his hat.</p>
               <p>HENRY NUNNEY. I have no mark to recognise it by; I think I had one of this kind, but cannot say this is it; I never took particular notice of the pattern.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My father gave me that handkerchief. I was going on an errand when the officer took me.</p>
               <p>Five witnesses gave the prisoner an excellent character; one of whom was his father, who stated that he had never seen the handkerchief.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and am servant to Mr. Jeffery, of Bell-cot<lb></lb>tage, Hampstead—I have lived there eight years. On the 27th of June I had been out, and was returning to my master's at a quarter to eleven o'clock at night—about twenty yards before I got to master's gate, I turned back, and saw the prisoner coming—I rang master's bell—I did not know the prisoner before—he came up to me, and snatched at my bag twice—the second time he broke the string, and ran off with the bag, I ran after him, calling, "Stop the murderer!" and "Robbery!"—I kept on running forty or fifty yards, screaming all the way, and looked and saw a carriage—he ran to<lb></lb>ward Hampstead—I saw a gentleman a distance off walking—I called out again, kept on screaming, and kept up to the prisoner, he turned round and gave me my bag, and said, "I have taken nothing out of you bag"—I kept on screaming—be said, "For God's sake, hold your tongue, it will ruin me"—he turned back, and ran again, and I ran also—I observed my purse hanging two-thirds out of my bag when he gave it me back—he ran, and I ran, screaming, and said, "If I can get anybody to take you, I will"—I rang the bell at master's house again, as we got back there again—the man-servant came to the bell—I said, "There is a robber gone off,</p>

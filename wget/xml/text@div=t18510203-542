                  </hi>. I am mate of the <hi rend="italic">Lively;</hi> she was in the Regent's Canal basin on 16th Jan. I knew the deceased, Robert Ablitt—I remem<lb></lb>ber his meeting with his death—he was at that time heaving the winch—he was shot between twelve and one o'clock—I heard a report like a gun at a distance; I cannot say in what direction—I heard the ball whiz by me—I could not tell in what direction the ball came—there were five or six vessels in the dock in the same tier as the <hi rend="italic">Lively</hi>—it did not come from any of the ships—I do not know which is the nearest house to the spot.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 89, London-street, in the same house as the prisoner and his father and mother—the back of their house faces the Regent's Canal basin—there is a piece of ground between the house and the canal basin—there is a yard immediately behind the house—there is a wooden fence at the bottom of the yard—I believe there is a little bit of a shed in the space of ground at the back of our yard—beyond the ground they call it the Horse-ferry, where people pass and repast—on the other side Horse-ferry is the canal. I saw the prisoner with a gun on 16th Jan., the day the man was killed—I cannot say whether it was one o'clock, or before one—I was very busy washing—he was near the kitchen window, in the garden—there was a pitcher on a post at the palings—I came in, and heard the report of a gun afterwards—I only heard one report—I have not stated that I heard more than one—I heard him firing at spar<lb></lb>rows once, but not frequently—I should think the post was further from where the prisoner was standing than it is from me to the wall of this Court.</p>

On 16th Jan., from what I beard, I went to 39, London-street; I saw the prisoner, and asked him if he had fired a gun off during that day—he said he had—I asked him where it was—he said it was in the next room, a little room joining the bed-room—I went there and found it in the comer, the barrel taken from the stock—it is a gun which has been used by the army, and has been cut down—I asked him what time he fired—he said between twenty minutes and a quarter to one o'clock—I went into the yard, and measured the distance from where he stated he stood and fired, to right opposite where the Lively was lying in the canal, aid the distance was 244 yards—you first come to his own yard, and then to an open piece of ground, and then to the Horse ferry-road—there is no building between where he stood and the Lively—I could not see the Lively from where be stood; the vessels prevented me—I could not look over the fence, the ground rises continually all the way from the canal to the house—it rises three or four feet—it slopes gradually from the yard to the canal—I heard no gun fired—the prisoner said he had put a jug on the post, and had fired at it, bat missed it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a gun-maker, of Mile End-road. I have tried this gun with a bullet of the same size as this produced, with the same charge of powder that the prisoner said he used—it carried 250 yards—I fired at a piece of wood forming a target—the ball did not hit the target, but went in a bank fifteen yards beyond it—it was then quite a spent ball—the target was placed 250 yards off, as near as possible—I tried it four times—the first time I could not see the ball—the third time I fancied it fell short—I aimed right at the target, but the ball was smaller than the barrel.</p>

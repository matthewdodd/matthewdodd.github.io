               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar?</p>
               <p>Newman. I believe I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Are not you positive you know him?</p>
               <p>Newman. I am positive within my own breast that he was the man that robbed me on Saturday, the 16th of January, between the hours of seven and eight in the evening. I was going to Hampstead in the Hampstead stage, and just before I came to the halfway house, between seven and eight in the evening, I was robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any moon?</p>
               <p>Newman. No, but there was what they call the northern lights, which made it very light at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you the only person in the coach?</p>
               <p>Newman. No; there were two more; he was dressed in a great coat and a flouched hat, when he came up to the coach; he swore many reprobate oaths, and said he would blow my brains out, if I did not give him my money; I gave him some silver and halfpence; I cannot tell exactly to what amount; he said he was sure I had something else; he got off his horse and pulled me out of the coach; he unbuttoned my coat and searched me; he turned my pockets inside out; he took a handkerchief out of my coat pocket; he said I had something else, and then he took the watch from me: there was a coach came up, and he made me go into the coach again directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he a pistol?</p>
               <p>Newman Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it presented to you or to the others in the coach?</p>
               <p>Newman. To me.</p>
               <p>Q. This must have took up a considerable time?</p>
               <p>Newman. It was a good while.</p>
               <p>Q. How long?</p>
               <p>Newman. I suppose about the space of ten minutes in all.</p>
               <p>Q. You are very certain the prisoner is the person?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177302170037"></xptr>Newman. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after did you see him?</p>
               <p>Newman. We went and gave information on the Sunday morning; we were robbed on the Saturday.</p>
               <p>Q. When was he taken up?</p>
               <p>Newman. On Monday, at a house of ill same, that they call Private Thornton's, under the Piazza, Covent-garden.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you by when he was taken up?</p>
               <p>Newman. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was past seven o'clock?</p>
               <p>Newman. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You was in the Hampstead stage?</p>
               <p>Newman. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you set off from London?</p>
               <p>Newman. I do not know: I am sure it was then between seven and eight, because directly after I went to the Half-way House; it was then near upon eight.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did it want of it?</p>
               <p>Newman. Near ten minutes I think.</p>
               <p>Q. You looked at the clock for the purpose of knowing what was o'clock?</p>
               <p>Newman. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It is pretty extraordinary you should not know then what it was o'clock?</p>
               <p>Newman. I was frightened.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you so frightened, that after the robbery was over, when you went to look what it was o'clock, tho' you went for the purpose you could not recollect? I suppose you was terrified and so did not take such particular notice as you otherwise would have done: which side of the coach did the man come on that robbed you?</p>
               <p>Newman. Upon the left hand side.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any thing over his face?</p>
               <p>Newman. He had a crape over his face.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to mention that?</p>
               <p>Court. I understood him he could see his face and his clothes.</p>
               <p>Newman. There was a crape at first; I saw him afterwards; the crape flew up as he pulled me out against him; it was shoved up with his hand all the time till he went away.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might the crape continue so?</p>
               <p>Newman. About two or three minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the crape up when he pulled you out of the coach?</p>
               <p>Newman. No, it was over his face; by pulling me out, I tumbled against him, like; so with that I fancy it rumpled it or something; he took his hand and shoved it up before ever he spoke, and it continued up all the time I was out of the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Jury. Was the crape put up under his hat?</p>
               <p>Newman. It was shoved up to his forehead.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner's Counsel. Was it shoved up above his forehead?</p>
               <p>Newman. A little above his eyes; I could see some part of his forehead just above his eyes.</p>
               <p>Q. When he pulled you out of the coach I suppose you could not but be pretty much frightened, as you was so frightened afterwards?</p>
               <p>Newman. I was not so much frightened then as I was afterwards; I was pretty resolute.</p>
               <p>Q. You said there were some northern lights, did you mention that at Sir

               <p>Q. Had he more pistols than one?</p>
               <p>Newman. He had something appeared like three pistols lashed to his breast.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know which way he went?</p>
               <p>Newman. Towards London.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any girdle to fasten these pistols in, or we re they tucked in his bosom?</p>
               <p>Newman. A girdle.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a light or dark chesnut?</p>
               <p>Newman. It by that light appeared dark.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it was not light enough to distinguish the colour of the horse clearly?</p>
               <p>Newman. It was a dark chesnut or a brown?</p>

            . I live in St. George's, Bloomsbury; I am a coachman; I drove the Hampstead stage; I was going on the 16th of January to Hampstead; a little on this side the Half-way<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177302170038"></xptr> House, between the Crown and Half-way House, a gentleman a-horseback rode up very violently, clapt his pistol to me, and swore he would blow my brains out, if I did not stop. I stopt immediately; he turned to the coach door the left hand side; as I was going to Hampstead, he said the same to the passengers, and repeated the same to me several times, if I offered to stir or move. After a little space of time, he quitted his horse, and pulled Mr. Newman out. I saw him searching him, but what he took from him, I could not discorn; I heard him demand their watches and money; he expressed the same to the two ladies that were in the coach, that he would blow their brains out, if they did not deliver instantly.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not pull them out?</p>
               <p>Parsons. No, he swore he would go into the coach to them, if they did not deliver instantly. After he had robb'd him, he saw Mr. Newman get into the coach, he bid me drive on; he then went behind the coach and mounted his horse: another coach was coming from Hampstead; I asked him if he would shut the door, or give me leave to do it; he bid me shut it and rode off.</p>
               <p>Q. You continued on the coach-box all the time?</p>
               <p>Parsons. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you turn round to see him?</p>
               <p>Parsons. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. His back was towards you then?</p>
               <p>Parsons. No, his face was towards me, but I could not distinguish his face.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way did he come to you?</p>
               <p>Parsons. He came from behind the coach, as from London; after he quitted his horse, his face was towards me; when he turned round on horseback, his face was from me; when he pulled Newman out, it was towards me.</p>
               <p>Q. You could not distinguish his features?</p>
               <p>Parsons. No, but his voice was very remarkable?</p>
               <p>Q. What could you distinguish of his face, when he came up?</p>
               <p>Parsons. His hat being stap'd before, he look'd rather swarthy, and appeared to me to have a very long nose.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there was nothing else to prevent your seeing his face, but the slap of his hat?</p>
               <p>Parsons. No, not then.</p>
               <p>Q. You could not distinguish his face was swarthy, and he had a long nose, when he was demanding the money from the coach?</p>
               <p>Parsons. Yes. And I plainly saw while he was demanding the money, and when he pulled Newman out, and threw back his great coat; then I saw three pistols: I was not so near to distinguish his face, when pulling Newman out of the coach but before; this observation I made, when first he came up to me.</p>
               <p>Q. The pistols were in a belt, or something of that kind?</p>
               <p>Parsons. Yes, as near as I could observe.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe that to be the man?</p>
               <p>Parsons. I really do believe it.</p>
               <p>Q. By what you saw of his face at first?</p>
               <p>Parsons. Yes, and more particularly his voice; he came close up to the side of the box.</p>

               <p>Q. What sort of a night was it?</p>
               <p>Parsons. Very light in the air, and particularly star light; the light faced me.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you drive the Hampstead stage constantly?</p>
               <p>Parsons. Yes, for some years; but have not since this thing.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you set out from London, at this time?</p>
               <p>Parsons. A little after 7 o'clock, 5 or 6 minutes, or it might be something more, when I set out from the Blue Posts in Tottenham-court-road.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the colour of the horse?</p>
               <p>Parsons. Either a brown, bay or chesnut; rather a dark one, or a brown bay.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he dress'd?</p>
               <p>Parsons. Rather in darkish cloaths; I cannot say particularly.</p>
               <p>Q. A great coat on?</p>
               <p>Parsons. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Boots on?</p>
               <p>Parsons. Yes, and seemingly a new saddle and bridle.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a hat?</p>
               <p>Parsons. A plain hat.</p>
               <p>Q. I think your coach has been robb'd since?</p>
               <p>Parsons. I did not drive that.</p>
               <p>Q. You have had some conversation with the coachman since?</p>
               <p>Parsons. I have talked with him, but not about the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. And you never said you believed it to be the same highwayman, that robb'd both coaches?</p>
               <p>Parsons. I don't know that I mentioned it to any body particularly.</p>
               <p>Q. Recollect.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177302170039"></xptr>Parsons. I have heard several people say so; I have heard it spoke of several times.</p>
               <p>Q. You have had no conversation with the other coachman?</p>
               <p>Parsons. Not particularly concerning that.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not say so?</p>
               <p>Parsons. Not knowing that it was.</p>
               <p>Q. But you believed it was the same person; you have heard a description of the person that robbed the coach the second time?</p>
               <p>Parsons. Not particularly.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not you heard them say, that the person that robbed the other coach was very much like Mr. Whichcote?</p>
               <p>Parsons. I heard he swore in that manner, and used much the same language.</p>
               <p>Q. And robbed at the same place?</p>
               <p>Parsons. I heard it was somewhere not far from it.</p>
               <p>Q. When was that second robbery?</p>
               <p>Parsons. I do not know; I did not hear of it for some days after.</p>
               <p>Q. It was since this robbery, that the other coach was robbed?</p>
               <p>Parsons. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you drive this coach?</p>
               <p>Parsons. Six or seven years.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to leave it off upon this occasion?</p>
               <p>Parsons. I drove for a man that was ill; I had been ill before myself; the man came to work again; he took the coach on the Monday following.</p>

            . I am wife of the prosecutor; I was in the coach; I was going up to Hampstead in the coach, between seven and eight, between the Crown and the Half-way House; a gentleman rode up to the coach and bid the coachman stop; the coachman did not hear him directly, upon which he rode close up to the coachman, and then he came to the coach door and demanded his money and watch; at the same time he swore a very great oath and demanded the ladies money and mine, and told us he would otherwise blow our brains out; then Miss Davis gave him her money; he did not take mine (I had it in my hand) nor never asked me for it; he was not satisfied with the money my husband gave him, but said he had got a watch; he swore a great oath and told him he should come out of the coach; he dragged him out and felt in his pockets; I saw him search his pockets: another coach came up, and then he made him get into the coach again. My husband went out at the Half-way House.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you distinguish his face?</p>
               <p>Newman. Not till he was rifling his pockets.</p>
               <p>Q. He was close with his face to the coach?</p>
               <p>Newman. Yes; but I sat on the further side of the coach, which prevented me seeing so much; I could see but very little of his face; when he pulled my husband out of the coach I went nearer towards that side, and saw there was something of a black crape up, and that he he had got a very long nose; that was all I could observe; the crape was upon his forehead.</p>
               <p>Q. By merely seeing his nose you could not form a judgment of his person?</p>
               <p>Newman. No; I thought him a small person: but his voice was so remarkable that I thought I should know it again. I was not so near as Miss Davis and my husband.</p>

             did not ask a question of either Mrs. Newman or me, but at Hickes's Hall I swore to his voice, last Tuesday; by seeing him twice after it made the voice very particular.</p>
               <p>Q. But you was in such a fright that you could not remember a feature of his face?</p>
               <p>Davis. His hat was slouched, and I was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177302170040"></xptr> frightened that I did not look at his face, but his stature and voice are the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take any notice of him when rifling Mr. Newman's pocket?</p>
               <p>Davis. No farther notice than that he had a large great coat on.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Newman sit forwards or backwards?</p>
               <p>Davis. Forwards.</p>
               <p>Q. When he pulled him out of the coach did he go nearer to the coachman or the other way?</p>
               <p>Davis. Rather towards the back part of the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. Then as you sat backwards you must see him plainer; then could you judge much of his stature on horseback?</p>
               <p>Davis. I saw him when attacking Mr. Newman, when he was off his horse.</p>
               <p>Q. What size man?</p>
               <p>Davis. Much the size, as near as I can guess, as Mr. Whichcote appears to be; but having a great coat on he appeared to be bigger than Mr. Whichcote; his great coat was loose.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you live at Hampstead?</p>
               <p>Davis. No, in town.</p>
               <p>Q. Where?</p>
               <p>Davis. In Glanvile-street, Oxford-road.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you follow any business?</p>
               <p>Davis. Yes, a milliner.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you keep a shop?</p>
               <p>Davis. No, I am a chamber milliner.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts?</p>
               <p>Davis. No. 11.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not keep any shop?</p>

               <p>Davis. No, I am a chamber milliner.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you going to Mr. Newman's?</p>
               <p>Davis. No, on a visit to one Mr. Norton.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he swore.</p>
               <p>Davis. Very violent; the first word was a violent oath and demanded the money with the pistol in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. In a violent manner?</p>
               <p>Davis. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. What time was that?</p>
               <p>Moule. About half after seven or a little better I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went out of the house to these<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177302170043"></xptr> taylors did you leave Mr. Whichcote in your house?</p>
               <p>Moule. No; he went out to the door before me; before I went to the shop I shook hands with him, and saw him go down the street; I came back and said I had staid rather too late, the taylors would use me ill for staying so long; there was a young man there that I asked to stay and assist my servant maid if any body wanted beer; my wife was ill a bed; I looked at the clock and it wanted about five minutes of eight.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the common time that they leave off work?</p>
               <p>Moule. Sometimes by seven, sometimes it is eight.</p>
               <p>Q. Of other nights?</p>
               <p>Moule. Sometimes by seven, sometimes half after seven; if they have work to finish they wait till the work is done.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you go over without being sent for at any settled time, or do they send for you?</p>
               <p>Moule. I have no fixed time, sometimes I go a little before eight; half after seven is my general time to go over; if they have business sometimes they work till ten.</p>
               <p>Jury. Is seven the usual hour of leaving off if they are not in a hurry?</p>
               <p>Moule. Yes, thereabouts; I generally go over about half after seven; I should not have staid so late if I had not been detained by the captain; the men were waiting for me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean the prisoner when you say the Captain?</p>
               <p>Moule. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known him?</p>
               <p>Moule. Pretty near five years.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he used your house?</p>
               <p>Moule. I believe in the course of five years he may have been at my house twenty times.</p>
               <p>Jury. You have not lived there long, have you?</p>
               <p>Moule. Five years last Michaelmas.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he dine at your house that day?</p>
               <p>Moule. He only eat a piece of bread and cheese when he came in.</p>
               <p>Q. You said when he asked for the stick he said he had been tired of walking, had he been out of your house from half after three till that time?</p>
               <p>Moule. He had never been out farther than to the door very likely, to make water.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you with him all the time?</p>
               <p>Moule. I was.</p>

               <p>Day. I never saw the gentleman but once before, the last was Saturday night.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see him the night the coach was robbed? you know the time do you?</p>
               <p>Day. Yes; I saw him that night at the Blue Bear in Long Acre.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of night was it?</p>
               <p>Day. I did not look at the clock; I have generally done about eight, I cannot ascertain to a quarter of an hour; I remember seeing him with two men: I was then paying my porters; I saw him there with a great stick in his hand (he is shewn the stick;) it was that sort of stick.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe that to be the stick?</p>
               <p>Day. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say whether it was before eight or after?</p>
               <p>Day. It could not be above ten minutes either way; if any thing, I rather think it was over eight, because I spoke to our people that were in the box with me, that were sitting down and having a tankard of beer.</p>
               <p>Q. Who left the house first, you or he?</p>
               <p>Day. He. I will tell you the way I came to take notice of him that night: the man of the Blue Bear was gone out; he was fitting along with two young men in another box; Mr. Whichcote was in liquor; after he had drank his pot of beer, as I was talking to our people at the fire, he took me for the landlord; he came up and said, well, landlord, I have no halfpence or money, will you trust me the beer? I said I would; he said I will call again and have something better next time and went out.</p>
               <p>Q. He appeared to be in liquor, did he?</p>
               <p>Day. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before he went out after you came in?</p>
               <p>Day. I think about ten minutes, I will not trust my memory as far as that.</p>

            . I live at a house called Private Thornton's under the Piazza's Covent-garden.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect Mr. Whichcote's coming to your house on the 16th of January?</p>
               <p>Walker. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did he come in?</p>
               <p>Walker. Between eight and nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any liquor?</p>
               <p>Walker. A Madeira Negus.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he pay for it?</p>
               <p>Walker. He did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he stay in your house?</p>
               <p>Walker. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect how he was dressed?</p>
               <p>Walker. He had neither great coat nor boots on; he had the same clothes he has on now and a silver laced hat.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember a piece of wood he brought in his hand?</p>
               <p>Walker. Yes; that is the piece of wood I believe.</p>
               <p>Jury. There is no occasion I believe to give the Court any more trouble.</p>
               <p>Court. The prosecutor has had no person to confirm him in one circumstance: the coachman never said, a word of a crape over his face, the prosecutor says he had the crape on when he came to the coach all the rest have not said a word of the crape, but it is impossible that evidence can weigh against this.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the prisoner. We have more witnesses.</p>
               <p>Jury. There is no occasion to call them.</p>

On 30th January, about 1 a.m., I was on duty in Tottenham Court Road, and saw the prisoner, who had left a four-wheel cab standing alone—I asked him for his badge—he said that it was at Scotland Yard, and made several excuses—I found he was drunk, and took him to the station, and also the cab—I found this purse (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on the box of the cab, under the driver's cushion—I searched the prisoner, and found on him a bad half-crown and shilling, and some good money—he said that he knew nothing about the purse—I asked him about the bad money in his purse—he said that he had been to Victoria Station, and must have got it there.</p>

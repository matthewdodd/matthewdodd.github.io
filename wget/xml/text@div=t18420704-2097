                  </hi>. I am servant to Charles Henry Lee, a butcher, at Horasey. We lost six ducks early this morning—they were safe between seven and eight o'clock last night, in the pen under the open shed—the pen was shut, and the yard fastened—they could not stray—we had six<lb></lb>teen last night—the officers called my master up early this morning—they had taken the prisoner with six ducks in a coarse canvass cloth, which was safe last night.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was on duty about half-past three o'clock this morning, in a lane near Mr. Lee's house, and saw the prisoner between two hay-stacks, on Mr. Lee's premises, in a stooping position, and putting some poultry into a cloth—another constable came up—the prisoner saw us, and immediately ran—I pursued him about a quarter of a mile from the hay-stack, and took him—I asked what he had done with the ducks—he said, "What ducks do you mean? I don't know any thing about any"—I took him back to the place, and found six ducks, which appeared to be recently killed, in a cloth—they were bloody, and quite warm.</p>

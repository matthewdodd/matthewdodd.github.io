               <p>Q. What part of your house were they taken from?</p>
               <p>Day. From out of a place we call the buttery.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who took them?</p>
               <p>Day. I saw the prisoner at the bar take them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know her before?</p>
               <p>Day. She was my next door neighbour. I lay below stairs. We were in bed, the buttery is just by my bed's head; she threw a hanging shelf down which gave the alarm, I got up and went to the door, and saw her taking the things out; she was putting them out at the window; I seized her about five minutes after, at a neighbour's house, and charged the constable with her; she at first denied it, but afterwards she owned it, and fell on her knees and beg'd I would forgive her, and said she would forsake the place of Highgate, and never come there again.</p>
               <p>Q. How did she get in?</p>
               <p>Day. She or some of her accomplices broke the window; I did not see her get in not go out; but I know she must get in at the window: the window was broke enough to get at the turn-buckle of the casement to open it, which was done; then there was room for any-body to get in, it is eighteen inches wide; it is very likely she had somebody with her, I do not know how she could get the goods out herself.</p>

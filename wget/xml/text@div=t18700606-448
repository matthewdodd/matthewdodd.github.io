                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Kent, accountant, of 55, Basing-hall Street—I have been acting as accountant for the bankrupt—I prepared various accounts for him at the request of the Court of Bankruptcy—I made out an account of his dealings with Mr. Burton; I have the original draft of it; it shows from whom he bought the goods, when, at what price, when they were sent to Mr. Burton for sale, and what the goods realized—that account was made out in pursuance of an order of the Court of 16th February, 1869—I saw the bankrupt about it two or three times, while I was preparing it—I made it out from invoices, generally—I got from the invoices the particulars of the goods supplied, and I got from the books the dates, and the amount of money received from Burton, and in that way I made up the account—I did not see the bankrupt after the account was complete; the last time I saw him about it, I had about a couple of hours more work to do to it—he dictated this memorandum to me to write upon it—(<hi rend="italic">Reads:</hi> "Memorandum. I kept no account of the goods which I sent to the said William Burton for sale; I have applied to him for the particulars thereof, and he informs me that he has no account of the same; I have therefore made out this account to the best of my knowledge")—A copy of that account and memorandum was filed by me in the Court of Bankruptcy—(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. POLAND</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">stated that the account extended from February,</hi> 1868, <hi rend="italic">to August the time of the bankruptcy, and showed a loss, during that period, of</hi> 316<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.)—The goods sold to Mr. Burton were bought of the Chinese Tea Company, Thorns, Williams &amp; Co., Roper Brothers, Nash, and Arnold.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> In making up that account, did the bankrupt give you every information as far as he could? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Very little information indeed, he was unable; he gave it as far as he could—he went to Mr. Burton's for the express purpose of ascertaining—he said that he was unable, even with Mr. Burton's assistance, to do what was wanted—that account was made out from what information he could give me after seeing Mr. Burton, and also from consulting the invoices—the bankrupt gave up twenty or thirty books to the assignees—I have had an opportunity of seeing those books; they were very well kept—in the ten days statement the stock in trade is stated as sold for 269<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by Messrs. Broad &amp; Pritchard, the auctioneers to the assignees—I believe Messrs. Honey &amp; Humphreys were first instructed; I saw Mr. Baggs, their managing clerk, at the Police Court, and heard him examined as witness for the prosecution—I was first consulted in 1868—I did not go on the premises in August, 1868—I am not aware whether Mr. Baggs did—the prisoner told me that Honey &amp; Humphreys' people had gone over his property and made an inventory of it;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187006060005"></xptr>
               <p>I did not see it—the prisoner told me they had estimated his stock at the time of the bankruptcy at 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at cost, and that Mr. Baggs afterwards estimated it at 270<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he said he had given up possession in August, and they had carried on the business, and that there were no returns of the takings during that time—he said he thought the stock was worth more than they had put it down at—I can't remember whether he said it was worth 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I found no return of the takings during the six weeks they carried on the business—the amount of ready money sales was about 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month—the amount of sales from 1st February, 1868, to August, was 6916<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in<lb></lb>cluding ready money sales—all that money was brought into the concern and paid away to creditors or expended in the business—the ready money sales in that period only amounted to 2100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the rest was book custom—about 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid by the prisoner to <hi rend="italic">bond fide</hi> trade creditors in the course of the last month, August—during the last three months he paid to Williams &amp; Co. 32<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., to Nash 116<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the Chinese Tea Company 292<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., Thomas &amp; Co., the petitioning creditor, 229<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and Arnold 119<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that makes somewhere about 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I find upon investigation that the money which came from the sales to Burton went also into the business; it is in<lb></lb>cluded in the 6916<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there is no examination of the bankrupt on the proceedings—the last examination, 21st January, 1870, was a formal meeting without any examination—the order for this prosecution was ob<lb></lb>tained on 11th March without his being heard—in making up Burton's account I have entered some of the goods as mixed; that means mixed in stock after they came from the vendor—the prices were given me by the bankrupt at the time as nearly as he could estimate them—I have no means of saying what the mixture consisted of.</p>

                  </hi>. I was a wine and spirit merchant, in 1868, carrying on business at St. Dunston's Hill—on 18th June, 1868, I supplied the defendant with wine amounting to 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I am a creditor for that amount—the defendant gave me two acceptances, one for three months and one for four months, dated 1st July—they have not been paid—I had no idea when supplying these goods that the prisoner was selling through Mr. Burton, by auction—I had no other transaction with the prisoner.</p>

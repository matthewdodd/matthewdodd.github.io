The Prosecutor deposed that Rochford came to his Shop, pretending to buy a Diamond Ring, he asked him, what price? he told him about 10 l. that he shew'd him one about that price, and the Prisoner bid him 5 l. for it; whereupon he looking in the Case to shew him one of 5 l. price; the Prisoner pointed at several, that there were five shew'd him; that immediately in comes Follard and asks for two Gold Rings, which he shew'd him, but they proved too heavy; and that then he seeing him looking for the Ring, was very urgent to be shew'd other Rings, saying, he was in haste, and if he would not serve him he would go to another Shop, that he shew'd him two others, and weigh'd them, he bought them for 23 s. and 6 d. and paid him for them, and was going away, while he saw him earnestly looking for the Diamond Ring. But he missing one of the Rings, told him he must not go; desiring a Gentleman in the Shop to stand at the Door, to prevent their going away; that of five Rings that he laid out, there was but four upon the Counter till Follard clapping his Hand upon them took them up, and laying them down there was five. The Gentleman who was waiting in the Shop deposed, that he suspecting them, observed, that though they took no Notice one of another, yet he perceived as they stood by one another, side by side, they both put their Hands down together, and that he did suppose, that Rechford convey'd the Ring to Follard, who having bought and paid for two Rings was to have got off unsuspected, while Rochford was treating about them. The Evidences deposed likewise, that Rochford being search'd, had no more than a Board-piece of Gold and half a Guinea to pay for the 10 l. Ring he asked for; and that Follard after he had paid for his two Gold Rings, had about 4 s. and 6 d. left. The Prisoners denied the Fact, and Follard said he only took up the four Rings to see the Beauty of them. Their Characters were none of the best, nor gave they any satisfactory Account of themselves; whereupon the Jury found them both <rs id="t17171016-7-verdict45" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Q. Did the other hold you at all? - A. Yes; she said; she had not got the watch, nor did not know any thing about it; I told her she had it, and if she would not give it me, I would charge the watch with her; I then called the watchman, and he came and took her; I have never found my watch again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you speak to these girls first, or did they speak to you first? - A. No, they spoke to me; they wanted me to go a little way with them, for they wanted to speak to me, and,upon my refusing to go, they shoved me up against the wall immediately.</p>

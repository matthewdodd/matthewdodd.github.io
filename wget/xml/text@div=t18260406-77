            . I am shopman to the prosecutors. On the 7th of March, at a quarter past seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came into the shop, and asked to see a watch from the window, marked six guineas; I took it from the case, and gave it into his hand; I was alone; he looked at it, and wished to see another, which he described in the window, marked ten guineas; I delivered that into his hand - I had no sooner done that than another person opened the door; the watches lay on the counter; I looked up to see who was coming in when that person threw some snuff in my face. The prisoner snatched up the watches, and both ran away. I ran out immediately; the prisoner crossed the street, towards Threadneedle-street. I ran after him to the corner, but having left nobody in the shop I arose a cry of Stop thief! pointed him out, and returned to take care of the shop; he had been talking with me for about three minutes; I am certain of him. I put a neighbour in care of the shop, then went round, and found him in the charge of Gadbury. I am quite certain he is the person. I saw the watches produced - they are the same.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. When the person came in did you think he came for any sinister motive? A. No. You are the person: I suspected you when you asked for a second watch, and as you made an obervation about having one to go without winding up, I took particular notice of you; this was before I shewed you the second watch; I should not know the other man - he opened the door, and threw the snuff in my eye without speaking; our shop is not more than twenty or thirty yards from Threadneedle-street. I saw you both leave the shop together. I saw you take up the watches the moment the snuff was thrown in my face. I knew you immediately I saw you at the watch-house - you were not pointed out to me; I have not the slightest doubt of you.</p>

            . I am evening patrol of Broad-street ward. I heard a cry of Stop thief! when I was opposite the King's Head public-house, Threadueedle-street, which is about three parts of the street from Bishopsgate-street; I turned, and saw the prisoner running towards me, and a quantity of people after him - he appeared the only person pursued. I laid hold of him, and before I could speak to him I perceived him drop something; I turned round, and desired Crow to pick it up, which he immediately did - it was two watches; I had not moved him from the spot - he stooped down, and dropped them gently; I took him to the watch-house - Sexty came up while I was waiting for the watch-house to be opened, and said, "That is the man, I will swear." The watches were delivered to Jones.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you pursue me? A. No; you ran to me - I was prepared to catch you. I never said I pursued you; I stopped you with my stick. I am confident Sexty said he would swear you was the man; I expeet no benefit from your conviction. I attempted to stop nobody before you came up.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any persons between you and me in the street before I came up to you? A. None; the street was quite clear of carraiges, and you were in the middle of the road; there might be persons on the pavement - you made no resistance. I have not conversed with Crow on the subject.</p>

            . I am a journeyman shoemaker, and live in Butler's-alley, Grub-street. I was at the corner of the Flower-pot by Bishopsgate-street and Threadneedle-street, I heard a cry of Stop thief! I saw the prisoner running across from Bishopsgate-street; from the side from the Flower-pot - a person was behind him pursuing; the prisoner ran up Threadneedle-street - the person behind returned back - I saw the prisoner go on - I called Stop thief! - and when I came up I found the patrol had hold of him - I did not see him stopped; the patrol desired me to assist to take him - I laid hold of him and was thinking about moving him, when he stooped and dropped something; nobody was near enough to drop it, except the patrol or me - I picked it up, it was two watches; they were afterwards claimed - I had them in my possession till he was taken to the watch-house - I saw Sexty come up to us as we came along Threadneedle-street; but he went away again; the watchhouse is in Threadneedle-street; he was secured there; Sexty claimed the watches - I delivered them to Daniel Jones.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Where did the watches appear to come from? A. From your hand - you stooped - with and your right hand dropped them - whether you took them from your pocket I do not know - I never said you took them from your waistcoat pocket - the person pursuing was about five yards behind you - he turned back - I did not pursue directly I heard the cry, but I called Stop thief!- Sexty came up as soon as you were in hold, but he went away and came again to the watchhouse - the watches were not pointed out to me - I saw you drop them - there were several persons round, but nobody near enough to drop them - it was impossible for any of them to drop them- I started in pursuit the moment I heard the alarm - I was only across the street - I do not swear you are the person I first saw running, but it was you who dropped the watches- persons came round to look on, but Gadbury and I were the only persons near you - they did not offer to lay hold of you; your back was to the houses - I saw you drop something - Gadbury did not point it out to me - I did not hear him desire me to pick it up - I saw you run almost to the spot where you were stopped, and came up in a minute after.</p>

               <p>The prisoner, in a long address to the Court, positively asserted his innocence, stated himself to be the victim ofdesigning men, and entered into the following narration of the circumstances:-" I was passing through Bishopsgate-<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182604060043"></xptr>street, heard a cry of Stop thief! and saw a man running whom I pursued, and, being a tolerabley swift runner, should doubtlessly have caught him had I not been stopped; the man attempted to stop him - he got from him; he then turned round, laid hold of me, and said I was one of them; I willingly accompanied him to the watch-house, not doubting that on my examination I should instantly exculpate myself; but, judge of my surprise, at finding it sworn that I was the man who came into the shop - the second swore he stopped me, and no one else, and the third, that he saw me drop the property. I have lately returned from France, my friends are in Dublin, and, relying on my conscious innocence I have not put them to the expense of coming here."</p>

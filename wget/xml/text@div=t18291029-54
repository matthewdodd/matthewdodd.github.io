On the 5th of August I was cooking the dinner - the prisoner and I had some words, in consequence of his not bringing me any money to get the children's breakfast in the morning; he had come in first at eleven o'clock with 2s. 4d. - I asked him why he did not bring it before; he said he could not get it - he threw it on the table; I was pressing a pair of trousers, and had an iron in my hand - he called me a bad name; I took the iron, and hit him first - this was at eleven o'clock; when I was cooking the dinner I began to jaw him - I called him some out of the way name, and he told me I had struck him with the iron, and he had a good mind to strike me the same; that is all that occurred; I put down the dinner, and dared him to do it - he took up the iron and struck me with it, and I dare say I struck him with my hand as well as I could; the first blow of the iron did not hurt me, but I screamed out, and strove to take my own part as well as I could -I fell at last; nothing happened to me on the ground.</p>

             sworn. - The two shillings were both marked, I lost them on Sunday night, or Monday morning, I saw them about seven or eight o'clock; I took the money out of my pocket, and set down the marks upon them; I went to bed between nine and ten o'clock, I had put them in a purse in my breeches-pocket; when I got up, I searched my purse, I found three shillings were gone, there were only two shillings found upon her, and a sixpence, when she was searched, this was on the 29th.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Did you ever ask two hundred pounds to make this up? - A. I never did make any demand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you or did you not, desire Mr. Furnehough to write to Mr. Cannon to come up and settle this business? - A. I delivered the message to him as the prisoner at the bar desired me; to tell him the situation of the prisoner, and to desire him to come up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you or did you not, enquire of Mr. Furnehough whether her brother was a man of great property? - A. I enquired of him whether he was or was not.</p>
               <p>Q. And whether you said to him, that your circumstances were embarrassed, and that two hundred pounds, or any considerable sum, would be of great use to you? - A. I said, I had lost money to the amount of two hundred pounds, and which way I should recover myself I did not know, and I hoped I should make friends; I never demanded two hundred pounds of any one, nor a single halfpenny.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you or did you not, go to the New Inn, or the Bull, on Saturday night? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. You deny being at the Bull and at the New Inn on Saturday? - A. I was at the Bunch of Grapes, and drank a pint of beer, and I heard the clock strike nine; I was not near the New-Inn, nor the Bull.</p>
               <p>Q. As your housekeeper had the keys of your bureau, she might have been in the habit of going there, or to your breeches, to get money to buy something in for the house? - A. She never had the keys of my bureau but when I was ill, she had them once.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer: I went by the desire of the prosecutor and searched the prisoner, I found on her two shillings and sixpence, I produce the money and the purse.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. You found this money in her pocket? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Prosecutor.) Q. Look at this money? - A. They are my property, I put them in my purse; and on the same paper I put them down. I produced the original at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. That is not here, that I should like to have seen; I don't like your copies.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left her defence to her Counsel.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. (To Furnehough.) Q. Did the prosecutor desire you to write a letter to the prisoner's brother? - A. He did; he asked me first whether I thought Mr. Cannon would come forward and settle the business; and he asked me whether he was a man of property.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I ask you, whether it was at his desire that you wrote to Mr. Cannon to come up? - A. It was; I told him that Mr. Barker had been with me; I represented the case, that Mr. Barker said he would settle it without bringing it into Court.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Mr. Barker said so to you? - A. Yes; I told Mr. Barker I wondered he had not called on me before she was committed.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times, altogether, has he been at your house? - A. Ten times.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you at any time heard him say how much he asked? - A. Two hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he at your house last Saturday night? - A. Yes; and, upon my oath, I saw him on Saturday at the New Inn, in the coffee-room, I was with him at least an hour there.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the New Inn from the Bunch of Grapes? - A. Yes; the coffee-room is down the yard.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Fowler.) Did you see Mr. Barker at the New Inn on Saturday? - A. I do not know that I did; I saw him at the Bull in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Dodwell.) Did you see Mr. Barker at the New Inn on Saturday? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in company with Mr. Furnehough and Mr. Cannon? - A. Yes; and I saw Barker at the Bull in the evening.</p>

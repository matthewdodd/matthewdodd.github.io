I keep a grocer's shop and a post-office—Robins is my assistant—he gave me this coin when the prisoner came in, and I asked her where she got it—she said, "From Captain Parkinson, Onslow Gardens"—I said, "What for?"—she said, "For my wages," and that she had come from there; but after I gave her in charge she begged me not to do so, and said she was a widow with three children, and had just come up from Southampton, and had left her boxes at Victoria Station—I do not think the coin was bent so much as it is now—Roberts made this mark on it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a draper—the prisoner came into the shop and asked me to show her some linen—I did so, and she asked for five yards, and tendered me a spurious coin, very similar to this—I thought it was slightly bent, and knew it was bad by the sight of it the moment I got it into my hand—I said, "This is not good enough for me"—she said, "Is it bad?"—I said, "Yes"—she said that Captain Parkinson, of Onslow Gardens, gave it to her—I said that she had better take it back and get 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11 3/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it, as it was only worth a farthing—I made no mark on it. Albert James. I am a draper, of 118, Horseferry Road, about two minutes' walk from Mr. Rowsell's—on 24th February, about 12.30, the pri<lb></lb>soner came in for somo Berlin wool and put down a coin similar to this—there were no marks on it, and I did not see that it was bent—I said, "What is this?"—she said, "A sovereign"—I said, "It is not"—she said that it was given to her by a captain; she did not say for what—I cannot swear to the name—I then cut a mark on it with a knife—there are three other marks on it, which were not there then—she said that she had no other money, and left with the coin.</p>

I keep a coffee-shop at St. Peter's Terrace, two or three minutes' walk from Horseferry Road—on February 24th, a few minutes after 1 o'clock, the prisoner came in for a cup of coffee, and as I went to get it she said, "Have you change for a sovereign?"—when I brought the coffee she put this coin down—I did not notice any mark on it—there was no cut on it, but my husband bent it very much in the tester—I returned it to her, and she left.</p>

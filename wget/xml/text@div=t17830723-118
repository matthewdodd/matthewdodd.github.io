               <p>I live in Drury-lane, at the Barley-mow, opposite the prosecutor a few doors, I saw nothing go forward at their house on Friday night; on the next morning, Saturday, the 19th of July, at four o'clock, I was looking out of my window, and I saw the two prisoners come from out of Mr. Webb's, Hollis came out first, I had frequently seen the prisoners pass backwards and forwards before, and one of them I have seen carry beer for Mr. Webb, the young man in light coloured clothes, which is Hollis, came out first, and next came the young man in grey clothes, with a little box under his arm, covered over with a napkin or a cloth, they were both together as near as they could, one after another, there was one door between Mr. Webb's and the corner, and as he turned the corner, the wind blew, and I saw part of the box, I at first thought it was a little coffin but I thought it was too small, it was a little wooden box, I am not mistaken in the prisoners, I am perfectly sure as to their persons, it was four o'clock and very light, they left the door upon the jar when they came out, and did not shut it close.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Fletcher's Council. How came you to be up so early? - We are open at three o'clock every morning.</p>
               <p>Which way did they turn? - They turned through vinegar yard, that is before they came to our house, they turned and smiled one at the other.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178307230129"></xptr>Jury. What distance is Vinegar-yard from your house? - Some little distance, there is an apothecary one door, and a broker the other, there is only one door between Vinegar-yard and Mr. Webb's.</p>
               <p>Is Vinegar-yard between you and Mr. Webb's? - It is the same side that Mr. Webb's is on, but nearer us.</p>
               <p>Could you distinguish the persons that came out of Mr. Webb's? - Yes, I did, and as they came nearer I could more easily distinguish them.</p>
               <p>What window was you looking out of? - The tap-room window.</p>
               <p>You never came out at all? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you know Buck? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you see him go out that morning? - No, I have seen him go out many times, but I did not see him go out that morning, he goes earlier than that, I had been but a quarter of an hour at the window.</p>
               <p>What makes you so punctual as to time? - Because the printers were just going away, and I looked at the clock and said, Gentlemen, you are going very early this morning, I hope you will not get fuddled to day, they came in for some refreshment, they print the Morning Post, and the Morning Herald, I have kept my house nineteen years, the printers quitted my house about half past three, it was four when I went to the window.</p>
               <p>How many people went by that morning? - There was not many on that side of the way Mr. Webb's was on.</p>
               <p>PRISONER FLETCHER'S DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I am innocent of it, I came from my lodging about half after eight o'clock as usual, and went to have my breakfast, I saw the house was in confusion, and the prosecutor's wife asked me to walk into the parlour, I went in, and they directly chastised me with being guilty of the robbery; I consented to any thing, I was taken up and searched, they asked me where my lodging was, and took the key of my box, and found nothing.</p>

I am a shoemaker, at Vicroria-road, Pimlico—the prisoner was in my service—she was a parish apprentice—I received 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. premium with her twelve months ago. On 29th Jan., at half-past twelve o'clock, I came home, told the prisoner I had missed half-a-crown, had her searched, and found 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on her—she said her aunt gave it to her when she came to see her—I was present when her aunt was there, but did not see her give her anything—I said nothing about forgiving her—when I was going to give her in charge she asked me to forgive her—I told her I had had so much trouble with her that now I should sent her to prison—I went to the relieving-officer before giving her in charge—he told me to do what I liked with her—she said at the station that she had taken the half-crown out of her mistress's pocket—I asked her where she changed it, and she told me—her mistress had left her pocket up stairs for about two minutes.</p>

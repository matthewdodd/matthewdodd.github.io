                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Policeman</hi> 728). On the 9th December last I was in Great Tower Street, in plain clothes, about 5.15—I saw the two prisoners there, and watched them—Gorman went into the "City Arms" public-house, and Ford remained outside—when he came out they walked along East-cheap, and went to the post-office at the corner of Pudding Lane—Ford went into the office—I looked in, and I saw him put something down on the counter—I saw the clerk in the post-office give him some change and a stamp—I afterwards went into the post-office, and made a communication to the clerk, Alexander Skinner—in consequence of what I heard from him I followed the two prisoners as far us Fish Street Hill—I there met Pascoe, another officer, and with his assistance I took the prisoners to the station—Ford struggled very hard to get away, and tried to get his hand between the railings of the chapel in Fish Street Hill, and Pascoe took out of his hand</p>

               <p>two shillings and five penny pieces—I searched him at the station, and found a sealed envelope addressed "Pension Paymaster, Southampton"—there was a blank piece of note paper in it and a penny stamp—I received a counterfeit half-crown from Skinner—I found this purse and a farthing on Gorman.</p>

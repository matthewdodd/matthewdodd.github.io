                  </hi>. I live at No. 56, Paddington-street, Marylebonne, and am a stationer. Smith was in my service up to the Saturday this occurred—he did not sleep in the house—on Saturday morning 29th April, at 4 o'clock I heard a bell ring very violently, my servant went down and found the police at the door, but nothing was missed then—about half past 7 o'clock I went down, examined the till and missed a bag containing a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bank note, a sovereign, two half sovereigns, and 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver, which I had left safe when I went to bed at 11 o'clock the night before—the shop was locked up, and the key left on the inside of the door—we found marks on the wall in the court, the persons had come over the wall into my yard, and from there through the parlour window which had been shut, but there was</p>

April, I was on duty in Paddington-street, and between 3 and 4 o'clock I went down Grotto-passage, into which the prosecutor's door opens from the yard—I found that door standing wide open, and the back room window level with the shop was open—I called across to a brother constable, and left him at the front while I went and rung the bell—the servant came down and searched the under part of the premises, but everything seemed correct—I did not go to the till nor did the servant, for I was there the whole time—about half past 7 o'clock, I was fetched to the house again—the entrance had been effected by getting over the wall in Grotto-passage, and then through the window—I saw marks on the wall of climbing over.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police sergeant, D</hi> 4). I went to Mr. Shee's house and examined the outer wall, I found marks of nails on it—I afterwards took Smith into custody, and took his shoes off—on the same Saturday about 11 o'clock, I found Reeves at home in bed, I awoke him—his father came into the room, there were three females sleeping in the next bed, and two or three children—I said, "<hi rend="italic">Harry</hi>, I want you"—he said, "What for?"—I said, "For <hi rend="italic">shoving Jim</hi> Smith over the wall, where the <hi rend="italic">crack</hi> was in Paddington-street"—<hi rend="italic">crack</hi> means, "burglary"—he said, "I did not <hi rend="italic">shove</hi> him over, he got on a piece of wood and got over"—I said, "Be careful what you say"—but before I could finish what I was going to say a female tumbled out of bed in a fit, and I immediately went into another room with the father, and then his father said to him, "<hi rend="italic">Harry</hi>, if you know anything about it tell the policeman the truth"—(I know the father to be a very honest man)—I said, "Be careful what you do say, do not say more than you will like me to mention again to a Magistrate"—he said again that he did not <hi rend="italic">shove</hi> him over, and he said, "I did not get in at the window"—and he said, "<hi rend="italic">Jim</hi> opened the side door, came out, and said he did not get anything, and he did not give me anything; I only had some beer at the Black Horse in High-street"—his father said, "Tell the police<lb></lb>man the whole truth"—I said, "How about the stone between the door and the sill?"—he said, "Yes, he put it there"—I understood him to mean Smith—he said Smith opened the door pf the passage and let him in, but that he only put one foot inside, he did not go in; that he was with Smith at the Black Horse at 10 o'clock, and they left there and separated, as <hi rend="italic">Jim</hi> said he did not want him to go along with him, and met again about 12 o'clock—he said they had a pint of beer to drink—I said, "Were there not four of you?"—he said, "No, there was only us two."</p>

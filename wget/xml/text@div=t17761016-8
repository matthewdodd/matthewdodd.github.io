             sworn.</p>
               <p>I believe you are the unfortunate gentleman who had a transaction about the 2d or 3d of March last, by the means of Mr. Fuller, with the prisoner at the bar Davis? - I had.</p>
               <p>Tell my lord and the jury what passed about your advancing 2000 l. upon India warrants, I believe? - It was; I believe it was about the 3d of last-March, but I cannot charge my memory to the day, but I have a paper in my pocket which will I believe inform me; the prisoner married the daughter of Mr. Fuller, who I have known many years; he was a bookseller, but has left off that trade and is now a stock broker; he has bought and sold stock for me, and is an old acquaintance; Mr. Fuller told me his son was concerned very capitally in the drug and watch trade, but the business he came on was to desire me to advance 2000 l. upon India warrants; I told Mr. Fuller, that I did not understand these kind of things; that I never saw one of those warrants in my life, but that I had a tenant, a Mr. Maud, a grocer in Carnaby-market; that I did imagine they were something in the way of tea warrants, and would call upon him; Mr. Maud told me India warrants were very good things, and that money was frequently advanced upon them; I got Mr. Maud indeed to go with me on the Monday to look at these warrants; it was on the Saturday preceding that they applied to me; we went to the Antelope tavern, I think, but no warrants were produced then; I had some Scotch Air bonds by me, I carried nineteen in my pocket, which I left with Mr. Maud, and desired him to look over the warrants, and if he found them proper to give the bond to Mr. Fuller, who was likewise present; Air bonds bore at that time, I believe 6 l. premium; I left the business at that time with Mr. Maud and Mr. Fuller; I was very easy about Mr. Fuller; he has had 4 or 5000 l. of my money at a time; I heard no more of it till the Wednesday morning following; Mr. Maud sent his nephew and the prisoner, and Mr. Fuller along with him; they had not sold all the bonds; Mr. Fuller said, if he had sold the whole in one day it would sink the premium, but he had sold 500 l. Air bonds at 5 per cent. premium; they said they would go to Mr. Dornford's a wine merchant, who they said had advanced money upon these warrants, and when they had sold the rest of the bonds they would bring me the warrants; Mr. Davis told me, that his warrants were in Mr. Dornford's hands, who wanted his money, and that he borrowed the money of me to take the warrants out of Mr. Dornford's hands.</p>
               <p>Had you any note, or any acknowledgment from the prisoner? - Not till a day or two afterwards; I believe not till the whole transaction was settled, three or four days, or a week afterwards; the note was given for three months, that note is destroyed.</p>
               <p>What was the value? - For 1900 or 2000 l.</p>
               <p>The supposed value of the bonds? - I suppose so; I waited frequently upon the prisoner in Charterhouse-square; I be spoke indeed a watch of him, I begged he would be punctual to the time, for I could not let my money out any longer; when the three months came he could not let me have it then; he said he was going into Scotland and had a great deal of money due to him, and that if I would let him have it for three months more, he would certainly pay it at the end of that period; I told him the warrants he had lodged in my hands were things I did not understand; he had delivered the warrants to me.</p>
               <p>What number? - I don't know; I said you must give me a power to go and claim these goods, and have them sold.</p>
               <p>You have got the warrant in your hand which is the subject of this indictment, be so good as tell us the number of that? - 540.</p>
               <p>What is the lot? - 934.</p>
               <p>Now that he delivered to you as an East India warrant for the delivery of these goods? - Iimagine so.</p>
               <p>When was it? - I will not take upon me to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177610160010"></xptr> swear that this is the very identical thing that was in my custody; they were delivered at three different periods.</p>
               <p>I understand you to say that you cannot be positive that that was the warrant? - No.</p>
               <p>But something that he represented as a warrant he gave you? - These sort of things to be sure I had of him.</p>
               <p>Did he at that time give you any list of the warrants that he delivered to you, or any acknowledgment for the money under his hand? - Here it is (producing it).</p>
               <p>That is his hand writing, is it? - To be sure it is.</p>
               <p>Was it before or after the note was given that he delivered these warrants? - Certainly before, for he must take the lists from what he left.</p>
               <p>What time was it, in March, April, May, or when? - I received three different parcels at three different times, which I apprehend was in the month of March.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner. That list you received from Davis? - I did.</p>
               <p>When did you receive it from him? - This was a second engagement after the note of hand was given for three months, the 25th of June 1776.</p>
               <p>Did you upon the receipt of this deliver up the note he gave you in the March preceding? - I did.</p>
               <p>Did you receive any note from him then? - Ie ceived that.</p>
               <p>Any other paper? - No; there is a power in that to sell these goods.</p>
               <p>(It is read).</p>
               <p>"Three months after date I promise to</p>

               <p>Did you or not find it necessary to have these warrants indorsed, and what happened upon indorsing them? - As I take that engagement, it meant if he did not pay the money I was to sell the goods at the time; I asked Mr. Hodges, who keeps a lottery office the lower part of my house in Pall-mall; as he often goes to 'Change I mentioned the transaction to him; I gave him a couple of these warrants, and asked him to enquire if they were good; he brought them back to me, and said they were good, but they ought to be indorsed; that when they were indorsed he would carry them all together and examine them; I applied to the prisoner for them to be indorsed; he said he would bring the broker to indorsed them at any time.</p>
               <p>Did he say who was the broker? - Barbaud: I went to Mr. Davis's house and desired he would get them signed; he said he would bring the man, but he never did; I told him he used me very ill, there was no difficulty in bringing the broker to my house; he at last appointed a coffee house at Charing-cross, and there they were indorsed; I did not go with them myself; I said I did not like coffee houses, I would not go among a mob of people; I sent

               <p>Was this warrant you have produced one of those that were so indorsed? - I cannot say; all the warrants that I had at that time in my custody were, except two or three that I have at home in the name of another broker.</p>
               <p>All that are contained in that list in the name of Barbaud were indorsed then? - They were.</p>

               <p>COURT. How came you by it to-day? - I had it of Mr. Chetham.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetham. Who did you receive it of? - Mr. Sims.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Crown. They are all marked by Sims.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner. Have these papers been in any other hands since you received them than Mr. Hodges and Mr. Mais? - That I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Have you parted with them to any body else to look at them or examine them? - Yes, I have to Mr. Rutt, a stock-broker in Birchin-lane; he had them for an hour or more out of my custody.</p>
               <p>When had he them? - I believe it was in the month of June or the beginning of July.</p>
               <p>For what purpose did you give them to him? - To ask him if they were a proper security.</p>
               <p>And what Mr. Rutt did with them you don't know? - He brought them to me again.</p>
               <p>Did you deliver them to any one else? - I have shewn them to different people.</p>
               <p>Then besides Mais and Hodges they have been in the custody of some other persons? - Hodges had them a week or ten days before he carried them to be examined.</p>
               <p>And others have had the possession of them some time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner. Had they not been in the custody of somebody else before you delivered them to Mais? - They had.</p>

               <p>You are, I believe, clerk to Mr. Hodges, who keeps a lottery office in Pall-mall? - I am.</p>
               <p>Did Mr. Drybutter at any and what time apply to you about India warrants? - He did some time in July last; he desired that I would see some East India warrants indorsed; I was to go to a coffee house that same evening to see this warrant indorsed; I think it was Old Slaughter's coffee house in St. Martin's-lane; I was to meet a Mr. Barbaud there in company with Mr. Davis; Mr. Drybutter delivered me the warrants; I went to Slaughter's coffee house ; Mr. Davis only was there at that time, and he appointed another day; Mr. Drybutter spoke to me again and said, Mr. Barbaud will be at the Golden Cross coffee house at Charing-cross.</p>
               <p>What did the prisoner say to you at Slaughter's coffee house? - He said something or other detained Barbaud; Mr. Drybutter gave me the warrants, and I went afterwards to the Golden Cross; I was introduced to Mr. Slop and Mr. Davis.</p>
               <p>You did not know either Barbaud or Slop? - No, the prisoner at the bar said, this is the gentleman; he did not call him Barbaud; I produced the warrants, and Mr. Slop took them and inspected into each before he indorsed them, not only that, but he returned three, which he said were not to be indorsed in the name of Barbaud, and which, I believe, Mr. Drybutter has now in his possession.</p>
               <p>How many were indorsed with the name of Barbaud? - I cannot say; I did not inspect into the contents of them.</p>
               <p>When they were so indorsed, what did you do with them? - Returned them all together to Mr. Drybutter; Mr. Davis went with me to Mr. Drybutter, and I left him and Mr. Drybutter together.</p>
               <p>Did Davis say any thing to Slop? - He did<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177610160012"></xptr> not say any thing to Slop; he said, this is the gentleman.</p>
               <p>But the first time you went to Slaughter's coffee house, you went expecting to meet Barbaud? - Yes; the person that was to indorse the warrants.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner at the Golden Cross say any thing of Barbaud, or mention his name? - I asked him if he expected to see Mr. Barbaud; he said, he supposed Mr. Barbaud had business in the city, but he should see him that day or in a day or two, and he would appoint a time.</p>
               <p>And when you came into the Golden Cross, Charing-cross, he said, this is the gentleman? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>You don't know how many were indorsed by Slop? - I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Did Davis at that time when you met him in the coffee house at Charing-cross, inspect these warrants? - He gave them to Slop; I apprehended Davis did not inspect into them, or else he must have seen that three warrants were not to be indorsed by Barbaud, and he would not have presented them to Slop.</p>
               <p>How came Davis by these warrants? - They were put upon a table, and he gave them, I believe, one by one to Slop.</p>
               <p>Did he give them separately or all in a lump to Slop? - I think separately.</p>
               <p>But he did not inspect them? - I do not recollect that he did.</p>

I told him I did not know any thing at all about him; he said he is the broker, he is gone abroad, and has forgot to indorse the warrants, and I want you to indorse them; now, says he. it is a mere matter of form, as I have paid the money; I thought myself that it was a mere matter of form, as Mr. Davis said the broker was gone to America as a soldier or an officer; I told him it was very well, I would indorse them; he took me to a coffee house at the bottom of the Hay-market, the Prince of Orange, I believe it is; he asked for a private room, they had not one; he went from there to the Golden Cross at Charing-cross, there he asked for a private room, and we were introduced into a back room; Mr. Davis called for six-pennyworth of half and half, and a pen and ink, the pen and ink were brought; Mr. Davis took a piece of loose paper out of his pocket, and wrote

               <p>"that will do;" the first is Mr. Davis's writing; the second is my copying of it; he said, I will go to the gentleman that lent me the money: Mr. Davis went out; he returned in about a quarter of an hour with Mr. Mais to the Golden Cross; Mr. Mais had the warrants in his pocket; he took out the warrants; they were tied with a bit of red tape; he untied them and delivered them to Mr. Davis; I indorsed about six or seven of them, and then merely out of curiosity I went to look in the inside of one of them; Mr. Davis took it out of my hand, which rather gave me some suspicion, though not a very strong one; I looked very much confused, and entirely forgot the name; Mr. Davis said,</p>
               <p>"Mr. Barbaud, you will continue<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177610160013"></xptr> " to indorse them;" I did continue, and indorsed them; I now understand there were twenty-three of them; I drank a glass or two of punch and came out: as I was walking along it ran in my head that I had not done right; I fancied so by the manner in which he took it out of my hand; sometimes I thought there was nothing in it, at other times I thought there was.</p>
               <p>When you indorsed the warrants, who delivered them to you for that purpose? - Mr. Davis presented them to me one by one.</p>
               <p>Did he look into them before he put them to you to sign? - I think he did, but am not positive in that particular.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect what number you indorsed? - I did not count them, I know now that the number is twenty-three; I delivered them to Mr. Davis when they were indorsed.</p>
               <p>Did he part with them to any body in your presence? - I don't recollect.</p>
               <p>Mais was there all the time? - He was.</p>
               <p>Look at that, is that the warrant you indorsed? - It is; I then went home, it was too late to go to Mr. Matevia's service; in the morning when I went I called Mr. Clarke, Mr. Matevia's book-keeper aside, and told him what I had done.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>

               <p>How long had you been a clerk there? - Not quite a year and a quarter.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether Mr. Davis had a character of you from any body? - I don't know; he did not tell me he had; Mr. Clarke told me Mr. Davis had spoke to him.</p>
               <p>How long had you been in his service before he asked you to do this job for him? - I was not in his service when I did it.</p>
               <p>Then this was by way of essay, to see whether you was fit to serve him? - No; he wanted me very much, I could not leave my place directly.</p>
               <p>You made an agreement with Mr. Davis at what wages to serve him? - I did.</p>
               <p>How long before this? - I cannot say how many days.</p>
               <p>Did you afterwards go to live with him at all? - Yes, on the 17th of July.</p>
               <p>How long was that after the business you have given an account of? - I do not remember the day of the month when I signed the warrants.</p>

               <p>You knew at the time when you appeared before the justice, that you had this piece of useless paper, as you understood it, in your custody? - I did.</p>
               <p>How came you to preserve such a scrap of paper as that, which you thought of no use? - That was mere accident.</p>
               <p>And yet, still you readily recollected that you had such a thing in your pocket? - Yes, because when I went to the privy I had frequently torn pieces from it.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see an India warrant before this? - I have, but I never inspected into the clerk's signing them.</p>
               <p>You understood the nature of India warrants? - I was not conversant enough in it readily to fill up one.</p>
               <p>But you knew enough of warrants to know that it was necessary to indorse the warrant in order to entitle the person that was a bearer of it to the delivery of the goods? - I did not know about the indorsement so much as I do now, I knew it was some form.</p>
               <p>But you knew it to be a necessary form; you never saw one forged before I dare say? - No.</p>
               <p>You did this thinking it a mighty innocent thing? - I did.</p>
               <p>How came Mr. Davis to apply so readily to you at Mr. Matevia's counting-house to do this office for him, why could not he have done it himself? - Mr. Davis must know that best himself.</p>
               <p>All the names of Barbaud that you wrote upon that paper, were wrote at the coffee house? - No, only the one immediately under that wrote by Mr. Davis.</p>
               <p>Where did you write the name of Barbaud upon the warrants? - At the coffee house.</p>
               <p>All of them? - Yes; in the morning when I went to Mr. Matevia's counting-house I spoke about it to Mr. Clarke, as he understood business very superior to me; I called Mr. Clarke out of the counting-house as there were two other gentlemen there; I told Mr. Clarke that I had indorsed a parcel of warrants in the name of Barbaud, and asked him whether he knew

               <p>To whom else did you disclose it afterwards? - Nobody else then, till I heard that Mr. Davis was taken up for the forgery; his mother-in-law told me first of it.</p>

             touching the indorsing of some India warrants? - Mr. Slop one morning, about three months ago, acquainted me, that at the request of Mr. Davis, he did the day before go with him to the other end of the town, and that by the way Mr. Davis told him, the business he was going upon, was to borrow money upon East India warrants that were made out in the name of Mr.

               <p>Did you give him any advice, or say any thing upon the occasion? - He expressed an uneasiness at the part he had taken, and asked me if he run any risque; in the manner he related what had passed, I really did believe it was a mere matter of form; that the fact was as Mr. Davis had stated it; that the warrants were real, and that the name of Barbaud's not being upon it was an omission, as he had represented it to Slop, and that the consequence of Slop's indorsing the name of Barbaud would not be detrimental to him.</p>
               <p>So you told him it was a mere matter of orm and could not be detrimental to him? - I told him, that from the manner of his relating it, I thought it a mere matter of form.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see Mr. Davis write? - I have.</p>
               <p>Look at that paper (the forged warrant) is any part of that his hand writing? - It has undoubtedly such an appearance to me, but I really cannot say whether it is or no.</p>

             from giving evidence against the prisoner at the bar at this trial?</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner. I object to that question.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner ever speak to you about it? - Never.</p>
               <p>Had you yourself any conversation with the prisoner upon the subject either before or after? - Not till after.</p>
               <p>Had you ever any conversation with the prisoner about Slop upon any occasion whatever? - I was with him one evening at Newgate, it was on the Friday evening in the last sessions; Mr. Davis desired my brother to give a character for one 'Squire Vaughan, who was to come to town, and who had sent his servant to take lodgings for him; when the maid servant came to me I did as my brother desired me; that evening I was with Mr. Davis, he informed me, he was exceedingly sorry he had deceived me, or to that purpose; that there was some scheme that had been in hand and he found it was frustrated; I was much agitated about it; he then told me, that the house that I desired my brother to give a character for, was for two men, who had taken it for the purpose of conveying Slop away, but not, says he, as I know any thing of it myself, but two men came to me at the prison about it, two rascals he called them; he said he knew nothing of what their scheme was, but only under some pretence to serve him they came to him.</p>
               <p>He did not approve of it? - No, he seemed concerned that I had been imposed upon, and seemed much concerned that they had taken the steps they did take, and appeared as if he knew nothing about it.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>My lord, the defence that I can make is, that I did not know that the warrants were forged; Mr. Drybutter said, that he had shewn the warrants which I had delivered to him to several persons, and at last he testified his uneasiness; he said he was afraid I had deceived him; I told him I had not, I had received them from another person, and the warrants that I had, I knew were good, and they may be agreeable to the list that Mr. Drybutter has shewn, but I am sure the warrants I had were good; and there is Mr. Dornford the wine-merchant knows very well that I dealt in drugs, and that I paid at that time a large sum; about 4000 l. for these warrants; I deposited 2000 l. in the hands of Mr. Dornford, he has got them now, and the other 2000 l. worth I borrowed money now and then upon, when I wanted money to apply to my business; I borrowed money upon these from Messrs. Smith and Payne several times, and from other bankers, and I redeemed them when they desired I would; the warrants that I left with Mr. Drybutter, were certainly not forged, or else I am deceived in 2000 l. myself; Mr.

            , who is absent by illness, lent me 5 or 600 l. upon a parcel of warrants; Mr. Lloyd came to me once upon 'Change, and, said they were not indorsed, I went to the broker and got them indorsed immediately; as for these I am quite ignorant of them, if they are forged I am deceived in the sum they purport; there are a great many gentlemen well known that will appear to my character, and I believe it will be found, that I am not guilty of such things; they will convince your lordship and the gentlemen of the jury of my fair dealing.</p>

               <p>What has been his general character for these last six years? - Exceedingly good; I have myself known instances where he has interfered in the support of his family in a most exemplary manner.</p>

               <p>I am a merchant, and live in Philpot-lane, Cannon-street; I have known Mr. Davis above ten years, his character has been always very good; I had such an opinion of him that I have frequently lent him money and assisted him from time to time in the course of these years that I have known him.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of Slop? - I know so much of him as this, that he was clerk with a brother-in-law of mine where my son was apprentice, he happened to mention this affair; and I saw him once upon 'Change, there were a knot of people gathered about him, and he appeared to be in a good deal of displeasure, and I heard him say he would hang him if he could.</p>
               <p>You are positive of that? - I am quite sure of it.</p>
               <p>And the prisoner has always-bore a very irreproachable character? - Yes, and I have lent him considerable sums of money upon warrants at different times; I lent him about 13 or 1400 l. upon 2000 l. worth of warrants, and have them in my hand to this time, and they are very good I believe.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Crown. Had you known Slop previous to this time? - I had.</p>
               <p>You was not in conversation yourself with him? - No; I heard him talking with other people.</p>
               <p>Are you any relation to the prisoner? - None at all.</p>
               <p>In no shape? - In no shape in the world.</p>
               <p>COURT. It was mentioned by Drybutter at the beginning of the trial, that the prisoner told him you had these very warrants in your possession? - I know nothing of these warrants, I have warrants in my possession to the amount of about 14 or 1500 l.</p>
               <p>You have nothing to do with that transaction with Drybutter? - No; Mr. - my relation, bought a great number of goods for Mr. Davis.</p>
               <p>COURT. Do you remember about Midsummer last delivering any warrants to the prisoner that you had of him? - It was very frequent to deliver warrants, because as these warrants were deposited as the goods were sold, the money was paid and the warrants delivered.</p>
               <p>Whether about Midsummer last you delivered 2000 l. worth of warrants to the prisoner by way of changing the security, because he represented to Drybutter that he wanted to discharge your securities, and therefore, borrowed this money of him; now whether you at that time did or not deliver out 2000 l. worth of warrants will make a great difference in this business? - I don't recollect that I did.</p>
               <p>You must recollect if, he redeemed 2000 l. worth at that time? - No.</p>
               <p>How long have you had the warrants in your custody of Davis's? - For these two years they have been changed.</p>
               <p>Have you received any since last Midsummer? - No.</p>
               <p>Then all you have now in your hands, you had in your hands; before Midsummer? - About that time I suppose it may be.</p>

               <p>I am a coal-merchant in St. Martin's le Grand: I have known the prisoner five or six years; he has an universal good character; I have done business with him, he always dealt with honour.</p>
               <p>After Mr. Justice BLACKSTONE had summed up the evidence, the prisoner addressed himself to the Court as follows:</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, I am informed there is an evidence ready to be examined in my behalf that has not yet been called upon; he was in the country and is just arrived; he will prove how I came by the warrants; his name is Larpell; he is at Snow-hill, I have sent for him; he will prove I received the warrants of one Evanson, who, it is reported, upon my being taken, drowned himself.</p>
               <p>To Mr. MATEVIA Do you know any thing of the payment of these warrants, and how they came into Davis's hand? - I know nothing of the warrants; I have paid warrants for him, and he has given me money.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. If I said from the anxiety I must be in through my unfortunate situation that I had this warrant of Mr. Matevia, I did not mean so; I am deceived in these warrants, and your lordship will find so; I had them of one Evanson, who, when I was taken, drowned himself; I did not pay him the full amount; I paid him as much as I could.</p>
               <p>COURT. Where did Evanson live?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. In Tower Royal.</p>
               <p>COURT. At what time did you receive them?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I received these warrants about the middle of June from his clerk at my house.</p>
               <p>COURT. What time of the day did you receive them?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He came early in the morning; I could not accommodate him then with the money he wanted; I gave it his clerk in the afternoon; the clerk's name is Larpell; I believe there was a person at my house at the same time that can confirm it; I gave him about 14 or 1500 l. in the afternoon, part of which I borrowed of a Mr. Northy.</p>
               <p>COURT. You made an application to the court last sessions to put off your trial upon account of the absence of a material witness, Mr. Lloyd; Mr. Lloyd has only given you a character by hearsay, you never mentioned this witness then?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That was another person, a Mr.

               <p>Prisoner. Whether he did not bring about 2000 l. worth of warrants to me?</p>
               <p>Larpell. I brought some paper from one Mr. Evanson in May last; I don't know whether they were warrants or not.</p>
               <p>COURT. What time in May was it? - About the middle of May.</p>

               <p>Are you Evanson's clerk, or did you ever act as Evanson's clerk? - No.</p>
               <p>You don't know what the papers were? - Not exactly, there was Mr. Barbaud there at that time; they said they were India Bonds or some such things.</p>
               <p>Did you bring them to Davis in the morning or the afternoon? - It was about the middle of the day.</p>
               <p>Before dinner? - Yes certainly, I left the papers with Mr. Davis.</p>
               <p>Did nothing else pass? - Nothing as I remember.</p>
               <p>Did he give you no papers in the room of them? - What he delivered to me I delivered to Evanson; I don't know what it was.</p>

             was set to the bar with the rest of the capital convicts to receive sentence, upon the clerk of arraigns putting the usual question, What have you to say why Judgment of Death should not be pronounced upon you? he addressed Mr. Serjeant Glynn, the Recorder, in the following words:</p>
               <p>I have nothing more to say than that though my heart shudders at the thoughts of the sentence which your lordship is going to pass upon me; yet, what am I more than my fellow companions in tribulation? will your lordship suffer me to lay my unfortunate case before you in a few words?</p>
               <p>Though a young man, I am the father of three helpless children - a husband of a loving wife big with a fourth - a son of a tender and an aged mother; all of whom I have supported for many years, not as may be thought by the gain of deceit, but by means of my honest labours.</p>
               <p>If justice condemns the action, I can appeal to the Searcher of hearts that it does not my intentions, for I did not intend to deceive any man; I intended to have paid my prosecutor on the 28th of last month, and in order so to do, to have gone to Scotland to receive a sum that was due to me, sufficient for the purpose: were my intentions to deceive, I should have had art enough to have made it appear otherwise before your lordship and the gentlemen of the jury - if instead of fulfilling civil engagements to the amount of 10,000 l. which I have paid the greatest part of; which my credit (which I was very tenacious of) would not have been hurt if I had put it off - I paid 10,000 l. as appears by this book, which I humbly submit to your lordship, and Mr. Smith my banker, who is here, can confirm it, perhaps it may be immaterial - if I had intended to deceive, I should certainly have reserved a sufficient sum to secure to myself greater peace than I now enjoy; for I might have gone off with a much larger sum than 1900 l. in the course of four months after I received it, and I should not have suffered myself to be taken in my own house by Mr. Drybutter, a very little man, who I could have put down with one hand; he took me in my own house, where the greatest opportunity was offered me for escaping - I might say a great deal more, but it would be an intrusion upon your lordship's time.</p>
               <p>I beg that in the midst of judgment you will remember mercy, and suffer the cries of a helpless mother, a loving wife, and my helpless children to have access unto your ears: then the blessing of them who are ready to perish, will fall upon you; for my own part, I shall ever pray that the same mercy that has often been extended by your lordship, may be extended to you when you shall appear before a much more awful tribunal than I now have the misfortune to appear before.</p>

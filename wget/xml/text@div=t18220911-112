I put my hand to my fob, and found the watch was safe; the moment he had committed the robbery, he called Stop thief himself. I immediately followed, calling Stop thief also.</p>
               <p>Q. In what way did he run against you - A. He pushed me not violently, he merely ran against me to shove me off my guard; he shoved me on one side, for half a yard, or three quarters and broke the watch chain.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that shove prevent you from protecting your property - A. It did, my Lord, it was a push. As soon as the chain broke he ran down the yard, and I followed; he was out of my sight for a moment or two, while he turned the corner; he was then secured. I am positive of him. It was about dusk. While I was pursuing him, some persons came round, pretending to inquire what had happened, and endeavoured to stop me. I drove through them, and immediately after somebody struck me a violent blow over the arm; it was very sore next day. I still pursued; he was in custody of Page, when I overtook him; nobody was running between me and him; there were plenty following us. My seals were found on the spot where he was taken; he said nothing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. It was dark - A. Yes; I had a good view of his face; he had a hat, a black coat, waistcoat, and black handkerchief, but I saw his face by the light from a public-house window; he ran about a hundred yards before he was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had not lost your watch, or been attacked, you would not have noticed the push - A. No; I should have felt my fob immediately; he rushed up against me - I was alarmed.</p>

I went on my beat at about ten o'clock, in White Lion-street, and heard of the robbery; and about half-past twelve o'clock that night, under the window of an eating-house in White Lion-street, I picked up the seals, and the gold ring and key were about half a yard from them.

Nobody was running before him - I had not met a person all the way from Prescott-street. He wished me to let him go, saying he saw the thief running ahead; I said I was positive nobody was ahead of us, and I thought he must be the thief. I detained him till Clark came up. I did not hear any thing drop from him. He put his hand down by his side when I told the prosecutor to take hold of his arm.</p>

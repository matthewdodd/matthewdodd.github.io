            . I am a patrol; about six o'clock on Saturday evening, I had been to the ward beadle, for the key of the watchhouse: going from there to the watch-house, I saw three men that I knew perfectly well to frequent the Ward; I saw them go up a court opposite the watchhouse; I unlocked the watchhouse door. I saw the carman stop his cart, then I pushed the watch-house door open, and run backwards and got the cutlass down, and coming to the door again, I saw three men nearly close to the cart; one of them was on the pavement, and the other two, the prisoner was one of them, pulled the truss of goods off the cart. I immediately threw the cutlass down in the watchhouse on a bench, ran out and seized the prisoner by the skirts of his coat, or the collar, I cannot be sure which now, and he dropped the goods. I immediately called out, a thief, a thief, in case the others should come and rescue him from me; by that time the carman came up; he was the next man that laid hold of him. The prisoner then pleaded that he did not know any thing of it, nor was he the man that dropped it when I catched hold of him; he had it in his arms, and would have got it on his shoulder, if I had left him a minute. I then sent for an officer, I never let him go until I took him to the officer's house, and searched him, which was near to the spot; I gave the goods into the possession of

                  </hi>. I am a polisher, and live at 21, New Montague Street, Spitalfields—on Saturday, 30th January, I saw a girl named Caroline Mills in Finch Street, she spoke to me—Cain was with me—I did not hear any chaff pass—on the Monday night, about 9.30, I saw Dempsey standing at the corner of Frostick Place, which runs out of Finch Street—Caroline Mills was with him; she hallooed out my name—I took no notice—she called me again, and I went over—she asked me who it was that hallooed out "Big-headed Dempsey"—I said I did not know—she said "If you don't tell me you will have a b----y punch on the nose," and Dempsey said he would punch me on the nose—I then went home—the next night, Tuesday, I was coming through the same street again about the same time, and saw the prisoners and Mills—I was alone—Dempsey challenged to fight me in the road, and before I had time to pull off my coat I was knocked down on the back of my head insensible—Leary knocked me down, leastways Cullerty I should say—it was with his leg I went down, he was behind me, I saw him do it, they were all round me—I got up and told them I would not fight anymore, I had not fought; Dempsey asked me if I was going to fight, and I said no—on the next night, Wed<lb></lb>nesday, I was coming through Finch Street between 9.50 and 9.55,1 saw Caro<lb></lb>line Mills—she told me that Dempsey wanted me—I said I did not want him—after that I saw Dempsey in Frostick Place, and Leary, Cullerty, and I should think about ten more at the other end of Frostick Place—Morris Cantor was with me—Dempsey asked me if I was going to fight him, I said I would not fight, and I went away—I saw Denis Maddigan and John Gray and Jenner come down Frostick Place, Dempsey again challenged to fight me, and I was about to fight him when Maddigan told me not to fight as he had got a white-handled knife in his right hand—I then saw the knife, and I told him I would not fight—Dempsey then made a rush at Maddigan with the knife in his right hand, holding it so</p>

               <p>(<hi rend="italic">down by his side</hi>), and Maddigan hit him in the mouth, and knocked him down—he got up and hallooed out "Knives out and <hi rend="italic">chivs</hi> ready"—i then saw Cullerty with a knife in his hand, and I saw him make a stab at Maddigan—Maddigan stooped down, and the knife went over his head, and it struck his own friend Dempsey—Dempsey fell on his knees, got up again and cried "You have stabbed your own <hi rend="italic">pal, Pudding</hi>"—Cullerty turned round and said "Have I, it can't be helped, I will have my temper out on some one else"—I then ran into the road, and before I had time to return I heard Gray say "I am stabbed"—I went over to him, and saw the prisoners all running up Frostick Place, and when they were half way up Frostick Place they said "Come on, we will put the knife into you"—I don't know who it was said that—I and Maddigan went and assisted Gray from the ground; he said "Keep your eye on that man, don't lose him whatever you do, it was him that stabbed me"—he pointed to Cullerty, he was then about a dozen yards up Frostick Place, he was behind the rest, and about a dozen yards off—Leary came back, and I saw him make a kick at Gray while he was on the ground—I did not hear him say anything, he went away after that—I did not see any of the prisoners stopped—we assisted Gray to Doctor Squires—I did not go to the hospital—I did not see Cain on the Wednesday night.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. M. WILLIAMS</hi>. I said at first that it was Leary, who knocked me down on the Tuesday, but that was a mistake, I pointed to Cullerty, I could not recollect his name—Frostick Place, is about two or three times as long as this Court—I did not go into the court on the Wednesday night—I was coming through Finch Street, the first time—it was in Frostick Place that the knives were used—the first time I was there was about 9.30—at that time I was living with my parents in New Montague Street, I am now living at a coffee shop in Osborn Street—I should not have to pass down Finch Street to get to New Montague Street—Frostick Place has an entrance at each end—I should not have to go through it to get to New Montague Street—I was coming from the whitechapel Road—I left work at 8 o'clock and had been for a walk—I went from Whitechapel Road down Osborn Street, and through Finch Street, Morris Cantor was with me, no one else—Caroline Mills was at the Finch Street end of Frostick Place—there was nobody else in the court that I could see at that time—I could see right through the court from end to end—Mills ran away, and then about fifteen were fetched back with her—I was not there three minutes—I was standing talking to Cantor, and when Mills came back there was a lot at the other end of the court—the Old Montague Street end—I did not know them, I never saw them before—they were none of the prisoners; the prisoners were at the Finch Street end—I walked about 3 yards away from the court, and was standing talking to Cantor in Finch Street—the three prisoners were then at the Finch Street corner of the court, and Mills was talking to Dempsey—I did not see anybody else—Maddigan and Gray came up together when we had been standing there about ten minutes—Dempsey wanted to fight me, and Maddigan told him he ought to be ashamed of himself to fight a lot of little boys like us—all that were there were bigger than Dempsey—Dempsey did not take his coat off—I did not see the knife in his right hand till Maddigan told me—he did not double his fist when he asked me to fight, he stood in that manner, with the knife under his coat, and said 'Come on, fight me now"—Maddigan was about half a yard from him—I</p>

I live at 9, Flower and Dean Street, and am a fish porter—I am nineteen years old—on Wednesday night, 3rd February, between 9.45 and 9.50, I was going through Finch Street, no one was with me—I met John Gray going through Finch Street, he lodged in the same house with me, Jenner was with him—they stopped me, and Gray asked me to have some beer—after that I noticed a crowd at the corner of Frostick Place, Finch Street—we went up to the corner and saw the three prisoners and King and Cain standing against them—I knew Cain before, and King only by sight—Dempsey asked King to fight him, and he sparred with his left hand and in the right he had an open-bladed white-handled knife under his coat like that (<hi rend="italic">with his hand to his shoulder</hi>)—when I saw the knife I said to King "No, you must not fight; he is too big for you"—with) that Dempsey would have put the knife into him; I</p>

               <p>saw his right hand move—he made a clout at him with his left hand and drew out the knife in his right from his coat, but I prevented him—I pushed him back, or else the knife would have gone through King—Dempsey then said to me "You can take it up if you like," and I saw the flash of a knife go across my head—he then cried out "Knives out," and Cullerty and Leary and a few more behind them said "<hi rend="italic">Chivs</hi> already"—it was a general cry, meaning "Knives ready"—Cullerty then made a stab at me with a white-handled knife: it did not strike me—Gray pulled me away, and said "Look out, here is a knife"—I fell on my knees, and the knife went into his own friend Dempsey—I saw the knife in Cullerty's hand; I am quite sure of it, it was a white-handled one, the same as Dempsey's—it struck Dempsey somewhere on the shoulder, and he fell to the ground with the effect of the stab, and said "Do you know who you have stabbed? You have stabbed your own <hi rend="italic">pal, Puddingy</hi>"—Cullerty said "It's done now and it can't be undone; I will have my revenge out, and put it into one of them for it"—with that he made another stab at me—Gray pulled me on one side a second time, and it went into Gray just here (<hi rend="italic">the breast</hi>)—this is the coat I have on now that Gray was wearing; here-is the mark where the cut was—Gray fell to the ground—I put my hands round his waist and fell a-top of him—he said "I am stabbed," and pointing to Cullerty he said "Don't let him go"—I called on Jenner to get hold of Cullerty; I could not leave Gray—Jenner caught Cullerty by the head—he had a cap on—Jenner kept the cap and Cullerty got away from him—what happened then I do not know—there was a scrambling in the court with the three prisoners and Jenner—they all got away—Leary returned and made a kick at Gray while he was on the ground, but he kicked my forefinger; he kicked at his side—I assisted Gray to Mr. Squires' shop—he was not attended to there—we got a cab and took him to the London Hospital—he died shortly after he got there—he bled a good deal on the ground—I saw the three prisoners at the hospital—the two took their friend Dempsey there—Gray was between twenty-three and twenty-four years of age.</p>

I am fourteen years old, and live at 9, Flower and Dean Street—on the Saturday before this occurrence I was with King and saw Caroline Mills—I did not bear anything called out—on the Monday night I saw King, Dempsey and Mills, Mills said she would get King a b----punch on the nose—King said "Who is big head?"—Dempsey turned round and said "I am," and asked if he wanted anything—King said "Yes, come down here"—Dempsey would not, and King said "Well, I will come round to-morrow night," that was to fight—on Tuesday night I saw Dempsey round there with Caroline Mills—I saw King about half or three-quarters of an hour afterwards—Dempsey and King were going to fight, Mills goes away and brings Cullerty and another <hi rend="italic">chap</hi>, I could not catch sight of the other one—Dempsey and King had a fight—Cullerty ran over to me and several others who were standing by and made a blow at me, he asked me what did I want—I said "Nothing"—he ran at some man that was there, then a constable came and they went away—they said they would tight on Wednesday night—I think it was King who said that—on the Wednesday night, about 9.30, I was in Finch Street—I went there alone—I first saw Mills and Dempsey, and I saw King and Maddigan going through Frostick Court, from the Finch Street end into Old Montague Street, they were going to the Black Bull to have something to drink—I saw them come back in five or ten minutee—King stood by Dempster and Maddigan, Dempsey asked if King was going to fight, Maddigan said "No, you shan't light, if you use your two hands you may"—I saw a knife under Dempsey's hand, I don't know which hand—I think Maddigan struck Dempsey, and then they halloaed out" Knives out," and "<hi rend="italic">Chivs</hi> are ready"—I don't know who who it was that holloaed out—I then ran away—I saw Cullerty and Leary there, they were there all the time, I did not take much notice of them, I did not know anything about them, Cantor was there, I saw him round Finch Street.</p>

I live in Nelson Court, Whitchapel—on Wednesday, 3rd February, I went into Frostick Place—I saw the three prisoners there, and King; Maddigan, Gray, and Jenner—I saw Dempsey challenge King to fight, King said he would not fight him—Maddigan said "You should not begin with little <hi rend="italic">chaps</hi> like them"—I did not notice anything in Dempsey's hand—I saw Maddigan strike Dempsey and heard "Knives out and <hi rend="italic">chivs</hi> ready "called, I did not notice who by—Maddigan and Dempsey then began fighting, and then I saw Gray stabbed in the heart—I could not see who stabbed him.</p>

I am a porter, and live at 24, Lambert Street, Commer<lb></lb>cial Road—on Wednesday night, 3rd February, I saw a crowd in Finch Street—I was in Finch Street passing by—I saw Jenner run after Cullerty (that was what I first saw) down Frostick Court, towards Montague Street—he got hold of Cullerty, and said "I wont lose you," and Cullerty made a stab at him with a knife—I did not see the knife—I saw him cuddle him round the arms, and he had got something in his hand, but I could not see what it was—Cullerty got away, and Jenner kept his cap—I then went away—I afterwards went to the hospital; I there saw Cullerty, and he said</p>

                  </hi>. I was house-surgeon at the London Hospital, on Wednesday, 3rd February, when John Gray was brought there a little after 10 o'clock—he was perfectly blanched and bloodless—his clothes on the left hand side were saturated with blood—I discovered a wound in his left shoulder above the armpit; it did not enter the chest—it was about 1 inch in length and 21/2 inches deep—it was not bleeding much at the time, but it burst out again, and he died about three minutes after his admission—I afterwards made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination, and found that the main artery in the arm had been completely divided, which was the cause of death from loss of blood—in all probability it "was a stab wound, any knife would do it—there were no marks of violence on his body—Dempsey was under my care in the hospital for three weeks—he had two knife wounds, one on the right shoulder behind, and one on the top of the left shoulder—they were not very deep.</p>

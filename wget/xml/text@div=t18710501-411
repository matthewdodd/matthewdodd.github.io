                  </hi>. I am a boiler-maker and greengrocer, at 27, Stanley Terrace, Deptford—on Saturday night, 25th March, about 9 o'clock, I was standing at my shop-door, near the Merry Cricketers public-house, and saw the prisoner and the deceased having words, and in the act of fighting—old Mr. Woolnough had his coat on his arm—they both seemed to have been drinking—there was a police-constable between them, and Woolnough made a blow at the prisoner, and struck him about the face and chest—it seemed to be a slight blow, I cannot say exactly where—the policeman separated them, and asked Woolnough to go home—he said that he would—he turned round, and had got about ten yards, when the prisoner rushed by the policeman, and made a blow at Woolnough, and knocked him down in the road, close against the kerb, and fell on him—the prisoner then got up, and I went and picked Woolnough up—he seemed to be a little bit stunned, or stupified—he complained of being hurt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not see the deceased fall against the door-post of the Merry Cricketers as he came out—I heard them quarrelling, but could not hear the words—I did not hear Woolnough say "I will fetch my son to you, or I will fight you myself"—I did not see him pull his coat off, it was on his arm when I first saw him—I did not see him give the prisoner three blows in his chest and stomach, and say "Now hit me"—I did not hear him ask the landlord to hold his coat, or say that he would fight half-a-dozen as good as the prisoner—I did not hear him say "Will no one hold my coat?"—the policeman was between the two when I first saw them—Woolnough did not go round behind the officer to strike the prisoner—I saw him strike him, and the officer slightly stopped the blow—I did not see Woolnough make a false step, and come to the ground—I think I was about two yards from him when he fell—the officer was just alongside of me—I did not see the prisoner put out both his hands to save Woolnough from falling—it was a rush and a blow that be gave him—I took Woolnough home, and gave him in custody of his wife and a daughter or two at the door—they took him inside, and I heard a heavy fall on the floor—I looked through the window, and saw him on the floor—I concluded he had fallen—he had been drinking, but he could walk straight enough with me—I have never seen him drunk in my life—he seemed to be a strong man—I believe he was about fifty years of age.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I should say about five minutes elapsed between the time of the last blow being struck and the time the prisoner knocked him down—they were still <hi rend="italic">haggling</hi> together all that time—as soon as Woolnough. saw the prisoner coming up to him he seemed to put himself in an attitude to prevent him.</p>

I am a steam-mill sawyer, and live at Robinson's Place, Rotherhithe—I was standing outside the Merry Cricketers—the deceased came out, smoking a cigar; he staggered, and fell against the door-post—the prisoner was coming down the road at the time, and he accused him of some thing concerning a van—the deceased said "I will fetch my son to you, I will fight you myself!"—he pulled his coat off, and jobbed the prisoner three or four times in the stomach with the tips of his fingers, and said "Now hit me!"—he asked me to hold his coat—I said "No; you had better take your coat home "—he then went in to the bar, and asked the young man there to hold his coat—he said "No, my good man; take your coat home "—he then put his coat on the bar, and asked the landlord to hold it—he said "No, my good man; take your coat, and go home "—he then went out, and said "Will no one hold my coat""—I said "No; put it on, and go home "—the prisoner was walking up and down the road, in front of the house—the deceased said "Wait a minute, I will take my coat home; I can fight half-a-dozen like you;"and I believe he was going home at the time, the policeman came along, and he came back and hit the prisoner in the face over the policeman's shoulder, and the prisoner made a rush behind the policeman, and the deceased went to step out of his way, and he stepped back off the kerb and fell in the road—they both fell together—I don't believe the prisoner could avoid falling on him—not a second elapsed between the blows.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of Plough Road, Rotherhithe—on Saturday night, 25th March, I was called in to see the deceased—he was in a state of collapse from some internal injury—there were no external marks of violence—he died on the Wednesday morning—I made a post-mortem examination—the cause of death was rupture of the bladder—that would produce pains in the lower part of the body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I don't know that any fall would cause rupture of the bladder: the person must fall in a peculiar manner, so that something shall impinge on the region of the bladder—the injury must have occurred shortly before I saw him, which was about 8.45—it might have occurred an hour before, or a half or quarter, not much longer—there may be a single instance where the bladder has been ruptured, and the person has not known it for hours afterwards, but generally it is not so—in this you allude to, the rupture was so small that the whole extravasation did not take place at once—there is evidence of such a case in Dr. Taylor's work—I examined every part of the body of the deceased—the fiver was not ruptured, it was discoloured at the edges; that did not betoken that the man was a hard drinker, but that he did drink a little, not necessarily to excess—you would have hardening of the liver in hard drinking; a bladder distended by drink would be more easily ruptured than one in a natural state.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Shortly after an accident of this kind I should expect to find a person cold, in a state of collapse, with excessive pain in the abdominal regions, and tenderness on pressure—the time within which that would take place would depend upon the quantity of extravasation that had taken place—in this case there was three-quarters of a pint found in the peritoneum after death—the rupture was a considerable one—I could get the end of my little finger into the hole—he died of peritonitis, produced from extravasation of the urine—the kidneys did not act after I saw him—no urine was drawn away when we passed the catheter.</p>

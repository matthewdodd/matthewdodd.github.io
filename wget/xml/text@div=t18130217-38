             - A. I know him well. I have known him about ten years. He has been a <rs id="t18130217-38-deflabel220" type="occupation">pensioner of that parish</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18130217-38-defend343 t18130217-38-deflabel220"></join>.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he applied to you lately for that pension - A. On the 15th of January, he applied to me, as he had done many times before. He came to me about half past nine o'clock in the morning. I had just done breakfast.</p>
               <p>Q. Did anybody come with him - A. I believe not. My eldest son opened the door to him. I went into the passage where I met the prisoner, nearly three parts down the passage. I have no recollection to any former period that he ever entered my passage at all. On this occasion he had advanced four or five yards in the passage. I went up to him, and enquired his business. He then stated, that he came to know if I was now prepared to do that for him; without saying what. I enquired, what. He replied, to pay me that which is due to me, which now amounted to between six and seven pounds. He said so. I told him, that I had frequently informed him before that his pension was now stopped, in consequence of his being in a good situation, being able well to provide for himself. I then stated to him, that I could by no means, on my own authority, grant him what he applied for. I also expressed myself surprised at him that he should apply to me personally, on a Friday morning, as he knew the officers of the parish met in the Vestry-room every Friday afternoon, at three o'clock. I advised him, if he had any case to state to the gentlemen, it would be better to apply to them at three o'clock that afternoon. I stated also, that I was by no means friendly to his claim, and considered that I should be robbing the poor people, many of whom paid the taxes, if I was to pay him his arrears; yet, if the overseers, when they heard his case in the afternoon, would recommend it to me, what they advised I would comply with. In reply to which, he said he thought it was of no use applying at the Vestry in the afternoon, that he had as little chance of redress from them as from me. I, in reply, said, that there were magistrates continually sitting in the City of London every day to defend the cause of the poor, and if he thought the officers of the parish dealt unfairly with him, he would be able to state the case to the magistrate, who would see that the point of justice should be done. He seemed not to know, at least I thought he seemed to be in a considerable state of agitation, what reply to make. I stated to him, that I really could not spare so much time as he wished I should devote to his case. I had been conversing with him about ten minutes coolly in the passage; finding that he hesitated, I said it was necessary that he should make his election whether to apply to the overseers in the afternoon, at three o'clock, or to the magistrate at Guildhall, at noon. He hesitated again. I shuffled up rather closer to him, supposing that good manners would induce him to retire from the passage. I stood as close to him as possible I could; he then retired towards the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you touch him - A. Not in the least. He retired, stating, that he would come to the Vestry-room at three o'clock in the afternoon. He advanced towards the street door, which had been quite shut until the present time. I followed him with intention of shutting the door after him, supposing he was about to retire. When we came to the street door he took the street door in his hand, as if about to shut it, instead of which he placed it half to. Suppose the door open, leaving half the space of the whole, he stood in the open part, so as completely to fill it up; the wainscot of the passage was so near, when the door is placed half to, there is but room for a person to stand between the door and the wainscoting. When he had placed the door in that position he stood in the open part, and turned himself round towards me, in the passage, who was close behind him.</p>
               <p>COURT. He turned towards you - A. Towards me. He stood in the open part of the door, so as to prevent persons in the street from seeing into the passage, and when he turned towards me he put his hand of the side of his great coat pocket, to the best of my recollection a large brown great coat, and to the best of my belief the same coat that he has on now. I do not know whether it was a pocket; he took the pistol from his side; and while in the act of putting his hand to it, he said, in a low voice, as you will do nothing for me, I will do something for you, and that minute he took his aim. He took the pistol from under his coat and rested it on the other hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, how was it with respect to your person - A. It stood about eight inches from my heart, in that direction. I observed him carry his eye distinctly along the barrel of the pistol. He pointed it at my left breast, I think about eight inches at the most from me.</p>
               <p>Q. When he had so presented it, what did he do - A. When he first put his right hand behind the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181302170022"></xptr>lock, his hand trembled exceedingly. At that moment I really thought it was some little diversion of his; after his hand trembled so much I observed almost the next instant that he got a steady purchase. I observed his finger towards the trigger, and when I really saw it really was a pistol, (I at first thought it was not), I uttered a cry of horror, and seized the pistol in the direction that I have stated. I saw his fingers at the trigger. He appeared to be making a great purchase. At that moment I seized the barrel with both hands, and with the greatest difficulty, finding he was a powerful man, I was enabled to turn the nozel of the pistol, so that it would not wound me mortally. I turned it of one-side. After I laid hold of it, it might have grazed my side. I do not apprehend it would have done more. A great scuffle ensued in perfect silence, between me and him. He retained his hold at one end, and I the other. He still kept using all the ability of which he was possessed, counteracting my power, and counteracting my endeavour of turning it away from me. He kept forcing it towards me, and still appearing to make a great purchase with his right hand behind the cock, as if he was disappointed on some account.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you eventually succeed in getting the pistol from him - A. As the struggle was in the passage, and as I could not get it from him, I endeavoured to point it downwards, so that it might hit me in the extremities rather than in the body; at length, I worked him out of the passage into the street, both of us having hold of the pistol, and finding that I had not power of preventing him from pointing the pistol, for fear he should murder me, I cried out, murder, as soon I passed over the threshold, both having hold of the pistol. Several neighbours came up to my assistance, and the pistol was taken from him.</p>
               <p>Q. You afterwards attended before the magistrate, and produced the pistol - A. I did. I saw the pistol examined; there was priming in it, and a heavy charge of powder in the barrel, and two leaden bullets. The whole charge occupied near three inches of space in the barrel.</p>

The balls appeared to have been rolled up in a cartridge.</p>

               <p>How long might all this employ? - very nigh ten minutes, as nigh as I can guess.</p>
               <p>Did no one come in sight all that time? - No; there is a centry at the bottom of the hill: I was just opposite the pond; when I came as far as the pond, I turned back; the water frightened me more than the men: and a man came up.</p>
               <p>When you was upon the ground, how far might you be from the centry? - I take it, about six or seven hundred yards from<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178910280016"></xptr>the centry of the queen's kitchen; that was the nearest centry to me: as I returned from pursuing them, I picked up this hat, and my own hat: I did not overtake them that night; they were taken about five weeks after, as nigh as I can guess.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen them before? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>And can you then be positive, having seen them at no one time, but during such a transaction; can you be positive to their persons? - I carefully considered; I have not swore so positive to them yet, but I could with a clear conscience.</p>
               <p>Do you swear positively to them now? - I think them to be the men.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear positively, that they are the two men; or do you doubt whether they are the men? - I do not doubt but they are the men, in the least; I carefully considered a long while before I spoke: there were several men taken up on suspicion of the same robbery; and I had no knowledge of them: but I knew these again, as soon as I saw them; I was very careful after the circumstance.</p>
               <p>Has the watch been found again? - Yes.</p>

               <p>On the 25th of August, I was going to work about a quarter before five, up Constitution-hill, to the queen's gardens; and I found this bludgeon, and a part of a watch chain, and a buckle; the part of the chain appears to belong to the chain; I found it about two hundred yards below the gate.</p>

               <p>I am serjeant of the same company the prisoners belong to; on the 30th of August, I was on duty, on guard at Kensington: the prisoner Daniels was on duty; and with the rest of the men, he took his watch out to see what it was o'clock; I observed it, and desired to look at it; he gave it into my hand; I had it half a minute; I saw the watch after, which I gave to the prisoner Daniels again.</p>
               <p>Should you know it again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Shew him the watch; (looks at it); I believe that to be the watch.</p>
               <p>Is there any thing that makes you recollect it? - Only the minutes of it, I observed then; and I have since taken notice; I have seen the watch since then.</p>
               <p>Was there any conversation passed between you, respecting it? - No.</p>

               <p>About five or six days after we were in the barracks, Daniels said he found a watch; he gave it to me to sell or pawn, and I gave it to Hodges; and his wife pawned it; I am innocent of the robbery.</p>

               <p>On the 21st of last August, in the morning, going in the park, by the canal, I saw this watch lay, and I picked it up, and put into my pocket; I shewed it to all my comrades at the barracks; I could not come out of the barracks; I shewed it all round; I know nothing of the robbery.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Lloyd. I wish to call serjeant Rhodes to my character.</p>
               <p>Court. Well serjeant, we leave it to you? - My lord, I cannot say any thing to his character.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Henry Dubber, of Stephen-street, Rathbone-place. On Saturday evening, the 22nd of July, I went into Mr. Lewis's butter-shop—while I was there I took 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from my pocket, to pay for the butter—I had it in my hand—I had 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in my pocket—as I was standing at the counter, I felt at though a hand kerchief had been drawn from my pocket—on looking round, I found my pocket had been drawn inside out, and the three shillings, three pence, and two halfpence were taken from it—the prisoner was standing very close to me—I directly told him he had robbed me, he said, "I have not robbed you," and he ran off—I cried" Stop thief" and followed him—he was overtaken, and he had more money than the 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in his hand—4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was in his hand—he ran from twelve to sixteen yards.</p>

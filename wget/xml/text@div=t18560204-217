                  </hi>. I am a porter, and live at No. 22, Old Norfolk-street, Stepney; that is opposite Mr. Hunter's, No. 3. About a quarter past 5 o'clock on the evening of 13th Jan. I saw the prisoner go several times to Mr. Hunter's door, by himself, and then I saw a taller man than the prisoner, with light trowsers on, go to the door several times also by himself, and try the door, but not so many times as the prisoner—I watched them for about three quarters of an hour—I then saw a light flash from the front room up stairs—I put out my candle, and watched in the dark; a policeman came by—I stationed him at the door, and went for another constable, and when I returned the policeman had got the prisoner in custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a builder, of 56, Lidford Road, Harrow Road—I owed Messrs. Perry and Maitland 44<hi rend="italic">l</hi>,—I became acquainted with the prisoner about four months ago as a handy man who could write, as I am not much of a scholar—he helped me occasionally to fill up cheques and other things—he had no authority to sign my name—on 4th Sep<lb></lb>tember I was in a public-house with Foskett and Mr. Breeze, talking about the debt to Perry and Co., who had sued me—Foskett said the money must be paid at once; he wanted 44<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said 42<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was ample; he said "It is no good my taking that, I must have 44<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I drew a cheque for 42<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which was destroyed, and he filled up another cheque for 44<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by my directions; he promised to pay the money—I signed the cheque; it was payable to the order of Messrs. Peckham, Maitland, and Peckham, the solicitors—this is it—I never gave the prisoner instructions to endorse or cash it—the next thing was the brokers being put in my house—I had received no receipt, as the correspondence was carried on between Messrs. Peckham and the prisoner—if I said I had a receipt at the police-court it is a mistake—I believe the endorsement on the cheque is the prisoner's—I saw him on the following Saturday, after I had re<lb></lb>turned from the City about this affair—I said "What have you been doing? you ought to be ashamed of yourself for forging the name of Peckham and Co. on my cheque;" he said "It is all nonsense, every<lb></lb>thing is settled"—I gave him no authority to deduct 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he was impertinent, and I went to the police-station with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was not in difficulties—the prisoner did not arrange anything—I employed him to settle matters, but he did not do it—he attended to other business, and did as badly by it as in this—I had out-standing bills, and had to get them renewed—he paid 41<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Peckham—he arranged for the renewal of a bill for 84<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not know that it was at the same time—interest would be charged if the bill was renewed—the prisoner would not have to pay it, but the interest would be added on to the renewed bill—the debt to Peckham and Co. was 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, the rest was for costs—the prisoner has signed my name to letters, but not with my authority—people might have answered him, but it was kept from me—I gave him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to pay a debt with, and he kept it—I know Ratcliffe—I never went to him in my life—the prisoner did not arrange matters with Ratcliffe for me—I know Massiter—I have had to pay 140<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. through this affair—the prisoner has not arranged matters for me with Massiter, nor Nash, nor Odell—I never did business with Odell in my life—the prisoner did not tell me that he should be obliged to take cash to the solicitors, as they would not receive a cheque, it not being a legal tender—he never said to me that he could get no money from me, nor that he had lost four months over my business.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 63, Warlock Road, St. Peter's Park, and am a traveller—on 4th September I was in the Skiddaw public-house with the prisoner and Mr. Stephens—Stephens asked Foskett to fill up a cheque for Perry and Co.'s debt—a cheque was filled up, which was not for the right amount, and another was drawn for about 44<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which Mr. Stephens signed; I could not swear positively to the amount—another cheque was written by Foskett for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and signed by Stephens—this, I believe, was payable to Foskett.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I never heard Mr. Stephens ask Foskett to send in his account—I live close to the prosecutor, and am on intimate terms with him—I have been in Foskett and the prosecutor's company often—I have not seen any money paid to Foskett for what he has done—I never advised Foskett to send in his bill—I never heard Foskett ask Stephens for an account of how they stood—I heard Stephens say he did not want to go on with this case for the sake of Foskett's wife and family—the Magistrate said the case had better go on.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 34, Lynn Road, Stoke Newington—I am managing common-law clerk to Messrs.

I retained the 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but gave him a receipt for 41<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he said he would bring the balance in a day or two—he did not bring it—on 22nd I wrote to Mr. Stephens—the amount was not paid, and I put in an execution for the balance—I did not communicate with Mr. Stephens personally—the cheque produced is not signed by any person authorised by Messrs. Maitland—Mr. Maitland signs and endorses all cheques—the elder Mr. Peckham is dead, and his son is never at the office—I have never seen Foskett write.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The endorsement on the cheque is not similar to Mr. Maitland's writing—Foskett had called on one previous occasion when I saw him—Foskett did not tell me he had other business to do—we should not have refused the cheque had it been presented—I wrote to Mr. Stephens, telling him we should put in an execution two days before the execution was put in—the. letter has not been returned—I addressed it to Mr. J.

            , Jun. I had observed several times that there was a deficiency in the bullion, and laid a plan to discover it. We applied to Mr. Parker and Mr. Field, to assist us. On the 10th of December, we were at work upon silver. The prisoner had been <rs id="t18230115-1-deflabel6" type="occupation">employed at the Mint</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18230115-1-defend51 t18230115-1-deflabel6"></join> for some years, to do whatever he was desired. On the day in question, he was employed in cutting the silver out into round pieces, which we call blanks, for the purpose of being afterwards stamped. Our practice was to give out a certain quantity in the morning marked with the weight on it, and in the evening after it is coined it is weighed again. On the 10th of December Mr. Franklyn, Jun. informed me of a deficiency - and I stationed Parker and Field to stop the men and boys as they came out on leaving work. I was present and saw Field take hold of the prisoner - a tin box then dropped from him, containing a blank key waxed over for the purpose of taking the impression of the wards of a lock, a few blanks for the manufacture of crown pieces dropped from him at the same time - he was searched, and in all were found thirteen blanks upon him, weighing upwards of eleven ounces, the value of which was full 3 l. The Mint is in the parish of St. Botolph's, Aldgate. All who occupy apartments there, occupy them as the servants of the Crown.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. In delivering it out in the morning, do you ascertain the weight - A. Yes, My Lord; each quantity has a ticket on it denoting the weight.</p>

            , JUN. I am one of the moneyers. On the 10th of December, I weighed the silver up at the end of the day; a ticket is always put on it with the weight marked on it - 539 lbs. 10 ozs. were delivered out that day - on weighing it I found it only 538 lbs. 5 ozs., and 10 dwts.; the deficiency being about 1 lb. 4 ozs.

            . I have been engaged in business connected with the Mint for some time with my father. Deficiencies had been discovered before, and on the 10th of December I met Mr. Atkinson in the neighbourhood of the Mint, and accompanied him there in consequence of a deficiency being discovered. As the workmen were about to leave, I stopped them at the gate; and took them back into the moneyers hall - the prisoner was among them; I immediately separated him from the rest - his hand was then in his great coat pocket, and as I drew it from the pocket, and there fell on the ground a tin box, which opened in the fall, and a skeleton key and a blank waxed key fell out, the skeleton key has had wax upon it, and is not quite finished. A key being waxed enables a person to take an impression of the wards, and file it to fit them; and some cotton was in the box for the purpose of laying the key on when it has received the impression, that it might not be rubbed out in carrying it. I took both the keys to the strong hold of the Mint, where bullion and other things are deposited - I found the pipes of the same bore at the locks; the one nearly finished would not quite pass the wards. I searched him further, and in taking off his coat three or four round pieces of silver fell on the ground, from his waistcoat pocket I believe, and immediately afterwards a bag containing more pieces fell from him; there were thirteen in all; they were blanks intended for crown pieces. He said he found the keys in his way to the Mint - with respect to the silver blanks, he supposed somebody must have put them into his pockets. I produce the thirteen silver blanks.</p>

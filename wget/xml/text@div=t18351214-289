                  </hi>. I am an engraver, and live in Fann-street, Goswell-street. I know the prisoner Balls—I first knew him about the 16th of September, 1834—he applied to me to know the price per 1000 of impress<lb></lb>sions from a plate, which he brought with him—I told him what they would cost—he did not tell me what they were—he went away, haring heard my estimate on one plate—he returned the same day, and brought me a little plate—I do not remember what letters were engraved on to—I should know it again if I saw it—(<hi rend="italic">Ruthven here produce some plates</hi>)—this is the plate he brought me first, and this is the smiler one, which he brought afterwards, with two little ovals for embossing—5000 impressions were taken from one—as near as I could imagine, six or seven trails were taken off at first—I belive six or seven were taken also from the smaller plate; and the small plate made a mark at the back, which was an object<lb></lb>tion made by the party who brought it, and he asked me how it could be remedied—I said by having a back plate of the size of the front plate—Balls asked me what it would come to—I said the letter part would come to about half-a-crown—I specified that I could not do the whole of it my<lb></lb>self it rested with an ornamental engraver, likewise the machiner to do the ground-work of it—he went with me to Mr. Froman, who is my orns<lb></lb>mental</p>

               <p>engraver, who agreed to do it—my letters were first done—I out<lb></lb>lined the letters, and then took the plate to Forman, who laid the ground, and Mr. Bacon, with his machine, made the ground—I applied to Forman for it afterwards, and received it, and paid him for it—I had no occasion to do any thing else to the plate—this is the plate I had to do, with the ex<lb></lb>ception of this fac-simile—there is a name engraved above it, which I knew nothing for the reverse—the front plate while this was being prepared for the reverse—the front plate never went to Forman's—the paper was brought to me by Balls—when there were 500 worked from the front was brought to me have 500 finished from the back—he wished 5000 altogather—I completed them 500 at a time—500 front, then 500 beck—he took them away 500 at a time—on the reverse plate there is the autograph of a signature—that was not on the impressions which I took.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Could you what these engravings were for? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He called them "Mining tickets"—I never asked the least explanation, but that is what he termed them—I did not not understand hem, not being able to read them—on one occasion he brought two oval pieces of copper—they were produced with the backing plate, the first say I saw him—the ovals were to be used to make an emboss on the blue paper, upon which they were impressed—I was paid for them as I delivered them—I received half-a-crown for the backing plate—I was paid 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per 1000 for the impressions—taking 5000, they were 28<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per 1000—Balls came to my house to make an alteration, in the course of my taking off the impres<lb></lb>sions—I cannot say how many had been taken off at the time as I kept no account—I belive I altered the plate twice—the figures—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a plate</hi>) here are my marks, made by the hammer and my anvil—when I erased the front, I had to knock the surface up, and replace it, making a dent in the front—he which to have the number altered, but assigned no reason to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Look at that plate; can you form a judgment whether it has been used since you parted with it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There are two figures on the plate which I have naver seen before—they are two nought—a plate wears won<lb></lb>derfully in taking impressions—this plate has been used a great deal since I parted with it—I am positive of that, and the backing plate also.</p>

               <p>and found in a portmanteau the key of which I took from Malls (and which opened it,) this tin box, with these blue papers in it, and in this card case, a circular impression—I did not know Harri's lodging at that time—I heard where it was afterwards—I belive from himself's and also from Mr. Salesman—It was in Sadler's-half-court, No.5, I belive—I searched, and there found these impressions at the bottom of a number of duplicates, wrapped up among other papers in a cupboard by the bed side, under some linen—I have ex<lb></lb>amined the plates which I produced, against one of these prices of paper, and they agree with it, except that the numbers differ—I found nothing else at Harris's—I afterwards took Moses into custody, on the same day, at the Strand coffee-house, in the Strand side of Temple-bar—I found him in the room, when I went in he—was sitting by himself in the coffee-room—Mr. Saltzmaun, and Fletcher were with me—I saw mosses sitting in a box with a parcel on the table before him—I went towards him, and he removed the parcel further on the table, towards the side of the room—I put my hand upon it, and got possession of it—I have it here—It contained the three plates I have produced, 104 notes, and a piece of board—I have compared, the three plates which were put into Labon's hand with the impressions I found on Moses—I have no doubt they are im<lb></lb>pressions taken from the plates, but the numbers very, and two parcels of the notes have a different signature at the back—some are without any signature at all, and some without numbers—I have compared the two pieces of paper found at Harris's, with the same plates, and as far as I can judge, they appear to be struck off from the same plates—one of them has a number on it, and the other has not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you find any numbers on any of these, similar to the one at Harris's? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; the one found at Harris's with a number, corresponds with the number of one found on Moses—also the signature at the back corresponds with some of those I found on moses—I afterwards searched moses lodging in the Tenter-ground, by spitalfields, but found nothing there—I had seen Balls and Harris frequently meeting at the Flying horse, and at the Eagle, in the City-road—I had seen Flaum with them many times—on every occasion when I saw them, he was with them—my attention was particularly drawn to them—I observed nothing which struck my attention only their meeting, 'and talking together, from the 24th of August, till the 9th of November this year, and during that time I was in communication with Mr. Saltzmaun.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Ball's Defence</hi> (<hi rend="italic">written.</hi>) My lord, and Gentleman of the Jury.—It is at all times a hard task for a plain-dealing tradesman, who has not enjoyed a libe<lb></lb>ral education and is not accustomed to public speaking, to address a nume<lb></lb>rous assembly, and so to frame his address, as to carry conviction home to the minds of his heares; but hard as such a task is, under any circumstances, it becomes almost insuperable to the guiltless man; who arrigned as a criminal, has to plead in his own defence, and feels that his liberty, his honour, his standing in society, his own welfare, and what must be far more precious to him, the honour and welfare of his deatr fmily, in short all that can rendar life desirable is at stake; and must be lost or preserved, according to the impression he makes on his juddges; accoding to the more or less plain and lucid manner in which he is able to state the facts as they really occured, and demonstrate his innocnce. No wonder if he feels the awful natures of his position. No wonder if he is overwhelmed by the consiciousness of his own utter inablity, and if confused at being placed in a situation so entirely new to him, and called upon to perform a duty to which he is altogether unaccustomed; no wonder, I say it is—If under such trying circumtances he should lose his courge, his presence of mind—nay, every hope, save in an uprighteous and omniscient Judge. Suchgentleman of the Jury, is my case now; I cannot I dare not rely on my own efforts to prove how wrongfully I am accused; but there is a God who protects the innocent, who knoweth the secret workings of the heart. May he enlighten yours, and I shall have no cause to dread the result of this trial.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183512140114"></xptr>
               <p>Gentlemen of the jury, I am accused of havinf engraved plates, for the purpose of forging notes, purporting to be issued by the Bank of Vienna, in Austria, but I do not know any foreign language; I have never occu<lb></lb>pied myself with studying the custom and istitutions of foreign countries, and I can with truth most solemnly over, that until I found myself, most unexpectually and to my great surprise, apprehended on this charge, I never knew there was any bank at Vienna, much les that the Bank of Vienna issued notes. Pursuing the public excreise of my trade as an agent, I was accustomed to take orders for engravings, I was accused by my fellow prisoner, Mr. harris, who introduced to me a Mr. Kerschbaum, a foreigner. They told me they wished me to engrave a plate for some tickets, to be used as shares for a mining company abroad. They produced a specimen in a foreigen language, a precise fac-simile, of which they required me to engrave. we agreed as to price, they paid me a deposit, and I set to work. I had no doubt nor hesitation on my own mind, nor the slightest misgiving as to the truth of their representaion, for the specimen did not at all look lik any bank-note I had ever seen or heard of. The language it is true, I could not read nor understand; but that gave me no uneasiness; nor was I indeed acquinted with any person who could have translated the purport of the ticket to me. I set to work publicly. I gave the work to workmen. I did not caution them to keep the work secret. I did not attempt at all to conceal what I was doing; with that candour and fearlessness which can only spring from a good conscience, I would rather have exhibited to al men, than con<lb></lb>cealed from any one, an order so creditable to my skill as a workman. When the plate was finished, I went to the coffee-shop where my employ<lb></lb>ers had directed me to meet them—and there, in a public room, in which dozens or men might have been present, I openly produced the plates which had been ordered of me. Nay, when the officers came and took me into custody, I still perserved in the same open and candid line of conduct. I made no attempt at concealment, but told them at once where they might find the specimen, after which I had engraved. And mark, I pray you, Gentlemen of the Jury, in what part of my house I kept this document, so dangerous to any one acquainted with its real nature, and intending to use it for future forgeries—It was kept in an open trunk in my parlour, to which my wife and my children could at all times have access.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen of the jury, this is my simple statement. It is true—your own common sense will tell you it is so; and the inference is a plain one. A man who is about committing a serious crime, which the laws punish with severity, will use every precaution in his power to hide what he is about; but if, on the countrary, a man is concerned in doing that, which the laws of his country visit with a severe punishment, but which, nevertheless, he does so openly, without fear, and without any attempt at concealment, the presumption must be, that he is ignorant of the criminal nature of the action in which he is concerned. I put it to you, Gentlemen of the Jury. You yourselves are tradesmen; perhaps blessed with greater aflluence than has fallen to my share. But still you are tradesmen—you have wives and children to maintain, rents and taxes to pay. You depend upon your trade, upon the honest exercise of your industry, as the means of meeting your many wants. If one of you were an engraver; if he had been caled upon by a man of whom he had some previous knowledge, and who, as a friend, introduced a wealthy foreigner, who came to give him employment in his trade; what would he have done under those circum<lb></lb>stances?</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183512140115"></xptr>
               <p>Would he have hesitated to accept the order? Would he have said to himself? "This man, introduced by a person whom I know, and who appears so respectable, is a scoundrel, who wants to make a tool of me; is a villain, who wishes to entagle a barmiess and unoffending man—and to destroy the happiness of an innocent family; I wil have nothing to do with him; I will not execute his order?" I ask you, Gentlemen of the Jury, would any one of you, were he placed as I then was, have come to such a conclusion, as the one just mentoned; or, would you not rather have acted as I did, and taken the order? And if you had done so, if perfectly unconscious of any wrong, you had executed that order, in what would your conduct have differed from mine? what could have saved you from standing at this bar, as I do this day? I put the question to you, sad I appeal to your sense as men, to your feelings as fathers of families, to your duty as British jurymen, to answer that question, as you will once have to answer it before your God.</p>
               <p>If the mere fact of having these plates in my possession is sufficient to render me guilty in the eye of the law, I neither can nor will deny that fact. But if it is the intention which consitutes the crime, if it is <hi rend="italic">the guilty knowledge</hi> which rendes an action criminal, I can, and do most solemnly over before God and man, that I am not guilty.</p>

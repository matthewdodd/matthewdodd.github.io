             sworn.</p>
               <p>On the eighth of December, as I was going up Holborn, I lit of the prisoner. I told her I was not well, and asked her to get me a lodging. She took me to a publick-house in <placeName id="t17781209-56-crimeloc332">Feather's-court</placeName>

I went up stairs. The mistress of the house demanded the money for the lodging. I had changed a guinea before I went to bed, and put my breeches under my head. I went to sleep, and slept till eight in the morning, then I waked; I found a woman in bed with me; I immediately felt in my pocket and missed eight guineas, the change of the other guinea was left in my pocket. I said to the woman, you have robbed me. She said she had not.</p>
               <p>What time was it when you met the woman? - Past eleven o'clock. I had been in the city.</p>
               <p>Are you in any employment? - I have been ill all the summer almost. I have lived with Alderman Townshend, and since that with Mr. Banks.</p>
               <p>What house had you been at? - The Sun Tavern. My lodging was at the Greenman, Green-street, Grosvenor-square. I was not able to get to my lodging, I was rather in liquor; my head ached, and I wanted to lie down.</p>
               <p>Did you not know the woman was a woman of the town? - No; I did not; I had seen her before. I did not know that she was a woman of the town.</p>
               <p>Did not you know that it was a disorderly house? - No. I never was in it before.</p>
               <p>How came you to ask her for a lodging. Where had you seen her before? - In Newtoner's-lane . I went to speak to her.</p>
               <p>What did you go to speak to her about? - I thought she was a pretty woman, and went to make love to her.</p>
               <p>Did you look upon her as a woman of the town, and go with her as a woman of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177812090074"></xptr> town? - No. I did not go to bed to her; she came to bed to me.</p>
               <p>What time did you go to bed? - About half past eleven.</p>
               <p>Did you go to bed instantly as you got there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you drink nothing there? - Yes sixpenny-worth of liquor.</p>
               <p>Where was she when you went to bed? - She came up into the room with the landlady of the house.</p>
               <p>What time did she come to bed? - I do not know. I went to sleep. The door was fastened.</p>
               <p>Was she in the room or out of the room? - I believe in the room.</p>
               <p>Who fastened the door? - I believe I did; it was only latched, there was no lock to it.</p>
               <p>Who keeps the house? - One Duffin; he said that was his name.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>This man knew me very well; he had been at my house several times. I met him in the street; he asked me to take him home; I said I could not; he asked me to take him somewhere else; I said I would not go; he pulled me about; then we went to this house; we had some brandy and water, and then went to bed. I said there was no lock to the door; he said never mind that, come to bed. When I waked in the morning he was getting up, and felt under the pillow for my pockets; he said he had been robbed, and wanted to search my pockets. He searched me; there was nothing found upon me.</p>

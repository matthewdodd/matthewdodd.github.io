               <p>about half-past 12 or 1 in the day—I saw the prisoner Naughtou there, carrying something in a piece of canvas concealed in her apron—it was below her apron—I stopped her, and fonnd in it seven pairs of new boots, they had not been worn at all—I asked her where she got them from, and she said she got them from a man to sell, he was a traveller, but she could not tell me his name—I took her to the station house—Watkins, another officer, was with me—at the station house the prisoner said that a woman named Burke gave them to her—she lived at a shoe warehouse in Smithfield—she did not mention the name of it—she said it was a large warehouse—I went to Smithfield and found Burke there—she said some<lb></lb>thing to me when Naughton was not there.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, R</hi> 265). On the night of 30th April, or the morning of 1st May, I was on duty in the Exhibition-road, Kensington, about quarter past 12 o'clock—I saw a number of persons there, I think about thirty—I saw the prisoner; he was in his shirt sleeves—I also saw another man in his shirt sleeves with him—the deceased was sitting down against the fence, and there were two, three, or four persons about him, or there might be more—I had previously passed them, and they were then trying to get him home—when I found him sitting down near the fence, I made some inquiry, put him in a cab, and took him to Dr. Christian and then to the station, where Dr. Christian's assistant came to see him; the deceased was then dead; I think he died before I got him to the station—in conse<lb></lb>quence of information, I afterwards went to No. 8, New-road, Chelsea, that same day—I found the prisoner there in bed—I told him he must consider himself in custody for killing one Thomas Weller—he said, "Have I killed him?"—as I was taking him to the station, he said the fight was not his own seeking, the deceased had been bothering him for several days; he had met him on the Saturday night previous and he wanted to fight then, but he, the prisoner, would not fight, and the deceased was determined to have it out on this night, and they went to the Exhibition-road to fight—after the charge was made against him at the station he said it was not his own fight, it was the deceased's own seeking—he said the quarrel had occurred at the Queen and Prince Albert public-house, Knightsbridge, on the Saturday night previous—I took the body of the deceased to the Chelsea workhouse.</p>

                  </hi>. I am watchman to Mr. Freak, a builder—on the 30th April, about 12 o'clock, I was at the comer of Princes Gate—I heard a noise down the road and went to see what it was—I saw the prisoner and the deceased fighting; the prisoner was stripped to his shirt, the deceased had got his waistcoat on; but his coat was off—I should say there were nine or ten persons present—I told them they had better give over; they did not, they continued fighting—it was exactly four minutes past 12 when the last blow was struck; at the last round they met each other, and the deceased fell and the prisoner fell upon him; to the best of my belief the last blow was struck under the ear of the deceased, but I cannot posi<lb></lb>tively swear—I saw the prisoner strike him somewhere about the face; after the deceased fell he laid there till he was picked up; he never moved—he was taken up by two men and taken about 200 yards down the road, and they placed him in a sitting position against the fence.</p>

               <p>other at the same time—I don't mean that the hands of one struck the hands of the other, but their hands were in a hostile position—the deceased in making his blow struck rather on one side and missed the prisoner, but the prisoner's blow told—the deceased was a bigger man than the prisoner in every way.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at 5, Cavendish-street, Chelsea—On the night of 30th April I was near the new Horticultural gardens, employed watching there—I saw some men come down the road, the prisoner was one of them; another one was with him and there were two or three more behind—I saw the prisoner and the other man strip, and they fought for about a quarter of an hour, or a little better—I don't think there was above five or six rounds—I saw some blows given by them—at the last round the prisoner hit the deceased at the side of his head, and caught him as he was falling—they both fell; I can't say who was uppermost—the deceased never got up again—a policeman came up soon afterwards.</p>

                  </hi>. I was at the Queen and Prince Albert public-house, at Knightsbridge, on 30th April—there was some singing going on there—I heard no quarrel between the deceased and the prisoner—after leaving the room I followed them to the bottom of Park-place; and on getting down the prisoner put out his hand and asked the deceased to shake hands—that was before they made it up to go and fight, about twenty paces from the public house—the prisoner wanted to shake hands, he did not want to have any row whatever—the deceased put out his right hand and said, "No, I would rather fight to-night," and then walked towards Kensington—the prisoner did not wish to fight, I know, but the deceased would not leave him an inch, he never left him at all—I went with them—the deceased had got his coat off before I got up to them, and was rolling up his shirt sleeves—I had known him before—he lived in our house from two years of age—his name was Thomas Weller—I saw them'fight.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am a physician and surgeon, living at No. 1, Ovington-terrace, Brompton—On Tuesday, 1st May, I went to the Chelsea Workhouse and examined the body of the deceased, he appeared to have been dead twelve or twenty hours—I found several external bruises on his knuckles and face, and a jagged cut on the back of his head—it was a large wound—there was a swelling nearly as big as a lady's fist under the left ear—I opened his head and found a ruptured vein in connexion with that swelling under the left ear, just where the vein enters the brain—I found a quantity of blood effused on the base of the brain at the left side—I examined the whole of the body generally; the rest of the body was healthy—I believed he died from pressure of the effused blood on the brain; I have no doubt of it—that might have been caused by some direct external vio<lb></lb>lence applied directly behind the vein—the swelling was such as might have been caused by the blow of the fist—there was nothing else to account for death—the jagged wound behind was a severe one, bub there was no internal injury of the brain from that, and I do not believe it had any connexion with his death.</p>

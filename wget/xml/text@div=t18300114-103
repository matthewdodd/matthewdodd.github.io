On the 31st of December, he and another man knocked at my door and inquired for one of my lodgers of the name of Turner- I said he was at work; they said he was not - I said then I could not tell where he was; they went away, and I went in doors - in five or ten minutes. I heard some person go up to the garret; I went to listen, and presently I heard a person come down - I looked out at my door, and three parts down the yard I saw the prisoner with something on his shoulder; I followed him, and saw him with the trunk on his shoulder - I asked what he had got; he threw it down and ran away - I pursued, crying Stop thief! and the Police-officer took him - I am quite sure he is the person who was with the other, and knocked at my door; he was carrying the trunk - this is it; it contains the property stated.</p>

            . I am the mother of the child that was killed. My father asked my brother to go for some meat, to carry for one of his master's. My father was at that time eating his dinner. My brother made use of very bad language to my father, and in the heat of his passion, he threw the knife down on<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181604030035"></xptr>the table, and it rebounded off, and hit the child on the head; the child was in my lap by the fire side. I am not a married woman; it was my child. My father used to kill cattle with the same knife also. The child bled very much, and I went to Dr. Senior, and told him. The child lived until the Monday, from the Saturday, and then died.</p>

             SENIOR. I am a surgeon. The child was brought to me on the Saturday, and on removing the cap which it had on, I found a wound on its head of about an inch in length; it had been inflicted by a sharp instrument; I prebed the wound and found neither fracture nor depression, and I conceived the death of the child to be occasioned by the loss of blood prior to my seeing it; it was a merescalp wound.</p>

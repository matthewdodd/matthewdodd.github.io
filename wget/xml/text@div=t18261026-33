            . I am a piano-forte-maker, and live in Southampton-place, Camden-town. On the 12th of September, about half-past five o'clock, I was near the New Southampton Arms public-house - my attention was attracted by a grain-cart, and on looking behind I saw a van coming up behind with four horses; the cart was on the left, its proper side, going at a slow pace - the driver was in front, but whether on the horse or shaft I cannot say; the van came at a more rapid pace, and in about half a minute came in contact with the cart - I saw the deceased fall from the near side of the horse to the further side - he fell towards the middle of the road, strait on the shaft by the side of the horse, and from there to the ground, with his face downward - I immediately ran to his assistance, and as I passed the front of the van, I lost sight of him - during that time I heard the cart fall from the van with a heavy jerk, and the wheel of the cart went on the man's body - I went to lift him up, the blood was flowing copiously from his mouth and nose, and right ear - a person desired me to raise him up - the rattles immediately came in his throat, and he was dead - the prisoner drove the van.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were the van and cart going the same road? A. Yes; the cart went at the usual rate of a horse and a heavy cart - the van was not going faster than could be expected.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Both were on the proper side? A. Yes - the van had turned more into the centre to pass the cart, and the wheels caught - it stopped us soon as it possibly could.</p>

            . I am a nurseryman. I was about twenty yards behind the van, which went at a proper pace - the prisoner was on the box - the van was about four feet from the cart, and getting out into the road to pass - there was room enough to pass, but it afterwards got nearer to the cart, and the near hind-wheel knocked against the cart-wheel - I saw the cart pass on, and the man laying down behind it - the wheel had passed over him lengthways - the man died instantly - there did not appear any thing wilful or careless on the prisoner's part.</p>

My servant locked the door over night. I generally go to bed about eleven. I was alarmed in the morning by a man going by, who called, Mr. Lowe, Mr. Lowe, (it was not quite day-light) he said the windows were broke open, but the sash was shoved up and the window-blind gone. I was a good deal alarmed, having lost one hundred and fifty pounds some nights before. I came down, I found the inside shutters were not open. I had made them secure over night, and hung bells upon them. The same man came to me again, and said, a watchman's staff had been left there. I sent my servant to the beadle to know who was watch there for that night. My servant was ordered ot ask me if I had lost any thing; the watchman having brought a window-blind in his hand to the watch-house, who said, he bought it. I thought it very odd for a watchman to buy a blind at that time of the night. I went to the constable<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176912060012"></xptr> with the beadle and my servant to ask after the watchman, who was gone home to bed. (It was the prisoner.) We knocked at his room door several times. He would not make any answer. I came down after that. I was informed he was at home. We went up again. There was the prisoner and my blind laying in the room. We found also a dark lanthorn, and several tools set to break open houses with. This was about ten in the morning.</p>

            . I am apprentice to Mr. Lowe. On that Sunday morning, being alarmed by a man that the window was broke, master went down, and found the window-blind was taken away. While the carpenter was mending the shutter in the morning about seven, I observed the prisoner went backwards and forwards and stood and looked at him. The man that told master of the house being broke, said, he had got a watchman's staff, and brought it to master. When we went to the beadle, he asked if we had not lost a blind. We said, Yes. Then he said, the man that is now at the bar brought in a blind into the watch-house, and said, he bought it. I told my master of it. We went and got a constable, and went to his room; not making him hear, they were going away. I put my head to the door and heard him snore; then the constable broke the door open. The prisoner appeared to be asleep. We spoke to him two or three times before he got up. The blind stood against a chest in his room; there was nobody in the room but himself. I saw the chisels lying in a cupboard, which had marks upon them as if they had been used in bricks; there was a dark lanthorn with a piece of candle in it in a drawer.</p>

            . I am a beadle belonging to St. Luke's parish. I sit up every night in the watch-house. I have seven watchmen under my care; and when I have a vacancy I put one in that man's room. I had a vacancy that night, and I put the prisoner in. He came in late in the morning. I asked him why he staid so late. He pulled off his coat and hat, and sat down his lanthorn. I said, Where is your staff? Said he, I know nothing of it. Then I saw a mahogany blind. I said how came you by that? Master, said he, I found it. Said I, then it is proper it should be left in the watch-house. Said he, I'll tell you how I came by it, I bought it and paid for it honestly; then he took it home. Between eight and nine in the morning, Mr. Lowe's servant came to my house to know what watchman went Old-street beat. Said I, is any thing the matter? The servant said, Yes, my master's house is broke. I said, Has he lost any thing? He said, a mahogany window blind. I said, My watchman has got it. He said, his master desired to speak with me. When I came there, there was the constable; then we went to the prisoner's apartment (he was the watchman that went Old-street beat that night. I had employed him when a vacancy has been) we could make nobody hear. When we found somebody was in bed, we forced the door open; there was he in bed, and the blind in the room. We saw several other things, watchmen's staves, lanthorns, and caps, that had been stolen, which had been used by my own watchmen some time before. We got him up, and carried him to New-prison; it being Sunday, the next day we carried him before the Justice. We found also in his room a dark lanthorn, a tinder-box, and a great many tools, a great deal of worsted yarn, mohair, and other things, that a lady had been robbed of a fortnight before.</p>

               <p>I was a watchman, and beat every hour. I beat after four o'clock. My fellow watchman went up to the Wind-mill in Goswell-street, and had a pint of purl. I went in, and found this blind lying in a box. I took and carried it down to the watch-house. We were all coming in. My beadle was fast asleep. I carried it home in my hand thinking I should hear of an owner.</p>

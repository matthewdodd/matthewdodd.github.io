                  </hi>. I am the wife of Philip Andrews, of Red Lion-street, Richmond. I had a gold wedding-ring in a drawer in my house just before Christmas—I missed it, with other articles, on the 26th of Dec.—the prisoner was in the habit of coming to my house—I was out at work at the time the things were taken—I found the drawer locked, but the ring was gone—I do not know whether I left it locked—the key was in my pocket—I have not worn the ring—it fitted tight when I bought it, last summer, as my own was broken—I have no mark on it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker, and live at Old Brentford. On the 8th of Jan. the prisoner pawned this ring—he said he pawned it for his mother, Sarah Douglas, to pay her rent, whom I knew as his mother—he had often been at our shop with her.</p>

In consequence of informa<lb></lb>tion, I went to Burford's, and found a ring answering the description given by Mr. Andrrews—I got a description of the boy who pawned it, went to the prisoner's house, took him, and told him the charge—he denied all knowledge of it—I took him to the station; and while being charged there, he said he had pawned the gold ring, but <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi> Andrews gave it him—I examined the drawer—there was a mark of a chisel, or some blunt instrument, on it.</p>

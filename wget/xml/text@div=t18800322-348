These are the original depositions which I took—they are correctly taken—there is no summons attached—there is an exhibit marked E—this is the plaint in the County Court—it was produced by the solicitor on the hearing—that was a plaint in which Doughty was the plaintiff and Austin the defendant—it contains the defendant's Cross-examination—this stated, "I do not know who my landlord is. I took the house from Brown, and considered him as my landlord until he told me to take my rent to Mr. Miller. I did not read the receipt marked D when my sister brought it back to me. At that time I believed Miller was my landlord." The defendant swore that he had not sworn in the County Court that Brown was his landlord, and that he was ready to pay him, and that was repeated more than once—he was cautioned with respect to that statement and he repeated it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The Prisoner.</hi> I said that I acknowledged Brown as my landlord until I paid Miller—I said I had two receipts for one quarter's rent, and if Miller altered it to June I would pay it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am usher at Lambeth Police-court—Mr. Pitt Taylor is the Judge there—it is part of my duty to swear the witnesses when the Registrar is otherwise engaged—I remember being present when Doughty v. Austin was tried—I examined the plaint note and saw the defendant sworn—he was asked if he owed the money and he said, "Not to these parties"—the Judge said, "Not to the plaintiff?" and he said, "Not to the plaintiff"—I will not be sure whether the solicitor or the Judge asked who he did owe the money to, but he replied, "To Brown; I took the premises of Brown"—after that evidence the Judge nonsuited the plaintiff.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have no recollection of your saving "I acknowledged Brown as my landlord until I paid Mr. Miller"—the simple question was put, "If you do not owe the money to these parties, who do you owe it to? and you said "To Brown"—I did not say so before, because I was not asked the question—I answered the questions put to me by the solicitor, and if the same question had been put to me I should have answered as I do now.</p>

I am a solicitor, in partnership with Mr. Prince, at 64, Cannon Street, City—we are solicitors to Mr. Doughty, the freeholder of 63, Lingham Street, Stockwell—I was solicitor for the plaintiff on, I believe, December 5th, at Lambeth County Court, on the trial of Doughty v. Austin, it was an action for an Rejectment—before I went into the merits of my case the Judge asked the solicitor what the nature of his defence was, and the defendant was put into the box and sworn—his solicitor then produced an agreement purporting to be for a</p>

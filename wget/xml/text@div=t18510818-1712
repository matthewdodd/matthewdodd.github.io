                  <hi rend="smallCaps">DANIEL HARRINGTON</hi>. I am eleven years old, and live with my father and mother, in Spring-gardens, Mile-end New Town. On 27th June, about 9 o'clock at night, I was going home—there was a great crowd—I saw the prisoner up at his window, the third pair—they said he had <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> his wife out of window—he <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> a brick out at me, and knocked me down—I did not see him <hi rend="italic">chuck</hi> it, the people said so—it struck me on the side of the head, and I do not remember anything else.</p>

The boy was brought there—he was in a confused state, from the effects of the blow—there was a contused lacerated wound of the scalp, on the left side of the head, above the temple, a little more than an inch long—it might have been done by a brick—he was three weeks under my treatment, and is quite recovered now.</p>

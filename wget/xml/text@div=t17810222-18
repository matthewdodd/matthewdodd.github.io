               <p>I was employed by Mr. Garfield to carry four flats of butter for him in a cart to Newgate-market. I loaded them myself as I was to carry them. I left Oxford market about a quarter after five in the morning and got to Newgate-market a quarter after six. In Newgate-street I took down the tail board of the cart and took one of the flats to carry to Mr. Fellows; I left three in the cart. When I returned to the cart I missed one of the flatts; I ran directly towards Newgate; I met a man and boy; the boy said there was a man going along with a flatt on his shoulder. I pursued and overtook the prisoner with the flat; I took it off his shoulder. He said there was a man behind him who was to give him part of a pint of purl to carry it to Spitalfields.</p>
               <p>Did he show you the man? - No; as I took the flat off his shoulder he turned to run towards Giltspur-street, I laid hold of the flap of his coat and secured him; I delivered<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178102220027"></xptr> the butter into the possession of a constable; it has since been sold but the flat is here.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman,</hi> 218). On 6th Oct. I was on duty, at 8 o'clock in the morning, in the Old Bailey—I saw the prisoner going down Fleet-lane, with this flat on his shoulder—I went after him, and stopped him in Bear-lane—I said, "Bring this back"—he said, "What for?"—I said, "Where did you get it from?"—he said, "It is not likely I should tell you"—I said, "I shall take you in charge"—he said, "If you do you shall carry it; I will be d—d if I do"—he <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> the flat down, and threw it almost on me—I took him to the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cheesemonger, in Sloane-street, Chelsea. On the morning of 6th Oct. I went and saw this flat at the police-station—it contains 42lbs. of butter—it is worth 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I had bought this and two other flats in Newgate-market that morning—I employed a man named Jones to carry it to the cart.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was there any private mark on it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I had fixed a mark to the butter—there is no mark on the basket, but there is a peculiarity in the tying of it, which I had done myself—I made the mark on the butter with my fingers.</p>

The Drawer deposed that the Prosecutor rung and sent him for a Constable, that he saw the Prisoner raised up in the Chair feeling about her Petticoats; that he found 4 Guineas under the Chairs she sat in, and the Bag just by her; that a little after he found two more, and one dropt from her Petticoat; that she acknowledged nothing then, but swore and tore and made a great noise for a long while. The Constable of the Night deposed, that the Prisoner made so great a Disturbance, that he sent for another Constable to his Assistance, who searching her before him, took 11 Guineas and half, and some Silver out of her Pocket, and gave it to him, who perceiving a Six Pence mark'd ask'd the Prosecutor if he had any remarkable pieces among his Money; who reply'd Yes, a Sixpence mark'd with three Letters, viz. 1 E S, which answer'd exactly to one of the Six Pences taken out of the Prosecutor's Pocket; that the Drawer, when he took up the Bag, also gave it to the Constable, which was remarkable for its being dearn'd with White Thread on one side, which the Prosecutor also described. The other Constable confirmed the same. The Money and Bag were produc'd in Court, and the Bag and remarkable Sixpence swore to by the Prosecutor. Also the Person who that day pay'd the Prosecutor that remarkable Sixpence among other Money, appear'd and justified the same. The Constables likewise deposed that when they took her the denied that she had any of the Prosecutor's Money, or knew any thing of it, which she did also before the Justice, and said that she had about 5 l. in Gold and Silver about her of her own. The Prisoner in her defence said, that the Prosecutor and she had been acquainted together for some time, and that she had received several Sums of Money from him, he using to call upon her when he came to Town; that while they were at the Tavern together he gave her half a Guinea, but she complaining that she had then urgent Occasions for a greater Sum, he said she should have it all if she would do him some Services, and gave it to her; that they were very Friendly at the Tavern without any Disturbance a great while, that he paid two Reckonings there, and when she refused him some Requests, would have had his Money again, so sent for a Constable, and said that she had robb'd him. The Prisoner call'd the following Evidence to prove what she had said in her Defence. A Woman who deposed that the Prosecutor met her in Cornhill, and ask'd her to drink a Glass of Wine with him, but she shov'd him away, and bid him go about his Business; that the Prisoner, then going by, he went to her, and she saw them go together down Grace-Church-Street towards the Bridge. The Drawer of the Hoop-Tavern being also call'd again, deposed, that they were there two Hours and upwards, and had paid two Reckonings before any Disturbance happen'd, and that afterwards the Prosecutor complained she had had pickt his Pocket in the House; One of the Constables deposed also that he said he lost his Money there; and that neither of them were fuddled. The Prosecutor denied that he was acquainted with her, or that he ever saw her before to his Knowledge, and that he was in a great Surprise when he said he lost his Money in the House.

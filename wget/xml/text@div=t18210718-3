I saw a man dancing about with his hat cut in strips, and vandyked round the edge, I followed them nearly a hundred yards, keeping on the opposite side of the way to them, and as I got to the corner of a street, they suddenly darted across, and occupied the whole of the foot pavement, and the greater part of the street; I was hesitating how to avoid them, when they all, at that instant, made a rush on the side the child was, with great violence, and rushed against me, and nearly knocked the child down - they came against me with very great violence.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was that the first thing they did - A. Yes; my Lord, and immediately after I felt my watch drawn from my fob, they rushed against me, and drove me back a considerable distance, and I then felt my watch drawn from me. I left the child with a person, and followed - I can positively swear to Summers and Edwards being two of them. Edwards is the man who was dancing about - he was within five or six yards of me; I do not know that he crossed over, or that he ran against me - nor did I observe Summers do any thing; I did not observe him till I went in pursuit of them, he was then within six or eight yards of me when I first saw him, which was immediately after I had been robbed, and he was one of the men who were running away. I followed Summers and some other men for about ten minutes. I observed him the moment I began the pursuit - he ran, and I followed. Reynolds, the constable, joined in the pursuit; we followed them into a court which was no thoroughfare, and there lost sight of them; we crossed Whitechapel, and returned and in about five minutes Reynolds took Summers in Wentworth-street, in a state of exhaustion, from running, and in a violent perspiration. I identified him, and am sure he is the man. I saw Edwards in custody with eight others, at Worship-street, next morning, and am sure of him; I had observed his features particularly, and the curious way his hat was cut. I had not noticed Emanuel in the crowd myself. I have not found my watch - it was safe when they rushed against me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. Q. Was not Edwards very drunk - A. I observed him particularly, and do not think he was from the manner in which he acted - when the people pushed him he pushed them again. Several people rushed against me. My watch was gold.</p>

            . I am a constable of Christchurch. On the 21st of June I saw the three prisoners in company with twenty or thirty others - I knew them well before. I first saw them about half-past eight o'clock in the evening; Edwards was at their head - they called him the bull. I watched them, and saw Mr. Jennings come by on the opposite side of the way to them; when they got opposite to where he stood they all rushed across the road towards him - Edwards was the first that crossed, but they all crossed together, rushed right on Jennings, and immediately afterwards turned round, and ran away. All the three prisoners ran with the rest, I am sure. I pursued, and saw two of the men had hold of something, and saw the watch-chain between them, this was immediately after they separated from the prosecutor - I do not know what became of it, nor who they were - whether they were the prisoners or not; I came up with Summers, and stopped him, standing at the corner of a street, with two others; before I seized him, he turned round, and asked what was the matter - I said he knew, and pushed him into a house - he resisted, and called others to assist him. I was obliged to handcuff him. I took him to Spitalfields watch-house, Jennings came up, immediately as I stopped him, and said</p>
               <p>"That is the man." He made no answer. I went with Lickfold and Barrs in pursuit of the others; we took Emanuel in about half an hour, on the same spot, in Wentworth-street. They were searched, but nothing found on them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you know Edwards - A. Yes. he had neither shoes, or stockings, on, I am certain, he was not drunk. I have known him but a short time, and never saw him dressed so before, I have known the others, twelve months.</p>
               <p>Prisoner EMANUEL. Q. How did you know me before - A. He belongs to a desparate gang.</p>

            . I am an officer. Reynolds brought Summers to the watch-house, and gave me a discription of Emanuel, and in consequence of that description, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182107180005"></xptr>apprehended him in Wentworth-street - we met him. I afterwards went with Barrs, to look for Edwards, into Bell-lane, leading into Cox-square, and found him in bed with his clothes on, about twenty minutes after twelve o'clock, at night, he appeared to be asleep. I pulled the bed clothes off, and said</p>
               <p>"Here he is, take him." We told him we wanted him for the robbery that was committed in Brick-lane - he made no reply. I searched the room, and behind the door. I found his hat, which I produce.</p>

            . I am an officer of Christchurch. About a quarter after six o'clock on the evening of the robbery, I was in a hair-dresser's shop, and saw Edwards, come out of Rose-lane, into Fashion-street. and there make a stand; I believe the hat produced to be the same he wore at that time. I saw a mob after him throwing cabbage leaves at him - I did not see Jennings. I did not know any of the others who were with him, I afterwards went with Lickfold, and we took him.</p>
               <p>Q. When Edwards was being taken to the watch-house did he say any thing - A. I told him we wanted him on suspicion of the robbery of a watch in Brick-lane, he said it was hard he should be pulled for it, and that he had none of the swag. I said</p>
               <p>"Had you none of the swag?" He said</p>
               <p>"No, by God, I had none of it." (It means the stolen goods.) I then said to Lickfold,</p>
               <p>"He says he had none of the swag." We took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When you first saw him he had a cap on - A. Yes and no shoes or stockings, nor had he when he was in bed. I wanted to bring him away as he was, but he got a pair of slippers from his mother below.</p>

            . I know Edwards. On the night of the robbery, I was charing at the Arches, public house, Osborne-street, he came in there about four o'clock quite insensible with liquor, his hat was not cut then. Several persons who were there were going to pick his pockets, they took his shoes off, I said it was enough for him to spend his money, without being robbed. He went out tumbling about the street, and a parcel of children followed hooting him.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Where do you live - A. At the Arches public-house, in Osborne-street. I have known him great while, but not in that neighbourhood. About two years ago, he lived at his mother's, in Bell-lane, Widegate-alley, that is about a quarter of a mile from the Arches. He left at half past four o'clock, I looked at the clock when he went out. The landlord and landlady were in the bar.</p>

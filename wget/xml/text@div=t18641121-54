On Thursday morning, 20th October, about 3 o'clock, I was on duty in Bell-lane, Spitalfields, and saw the prisoner carrying a large bundle—I stopped him, and asked him where he got it from—he made some answer, which I could not understand—I made him understand by signs that he must take them where he got them from—he took me down several courts, and at last to 9, Dimes-buildings—I knocked at the door; some one answered from within—I turned to answer them, and the prisoner dropped the bundle and ran away—I pursued him as far as Petticoat-lane, where I lost sight of him—I ran back and got the bundle, which contained materials for twenty-eight coats, which the prosecutor identified—I heard about half an hour afterwards that the prisoner was taken—I went to the station and identified him—the bed-room window has no fastening, and the prisoner had climbed a lamp-post level with it, and got in that way.</p>

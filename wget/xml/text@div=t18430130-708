                  </hi>. I am a widow, and keep the White Bear, in King-street, Hammersmith. The prisoners are customers at my house—on the 26th of Jan. they were in my tap-room the greater part of the day—they were there before I came down stairs, before ten o'clock in the morning—Brazier and Bates went away about ten minutes before six—Bristow had gone away about half an hour before them—Richards and Folley were left there, and I heard them quarrelling, as I thought—I went into the room where they were, I knocked my foot against a piece of wood, and had nearly fallen down—I asked what they had been doing—Folley said they had been dancing; and I found the floor was broken to the extent of about half a yard long, and about a foot wide—I looked down the hole, and saw a bottle in the recess where I keep wine, in the cellar under that floor—(there were two holes in the floor, but one of them did not go into the cellar)—a person could not go down the hole, but by putting their hands down they could reach the wine—I called Carter—he went down into the cellar—I went down, and missed three bottles of port wine—I knew they had been there before, because I had taken stock on the Wednesday evening, and this was on the Thursday—when I came back from the cellar Richards was gone—I said to Folley, "Some of you have been at my wine, tell me who it is"—he said, "I know nothing at all about wine"—I had been in the bar, and had not been in the tap-room for an hour or more before I found the hole—the last time I had been in the tap-room I did not perceive any hole in the floor—no one had been in the tap-room but Jeremiah M'Carthy.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a builder, and live at Hammersmith. I was at the White Bear about a quarter past six o'clock in the evening, on the 26th of Jan.—I was called into the tap-room by Mrs. Meacock—there were Richards and Folley in the room—two holes had been broken in the floor—I could reach the wine which was in the recess from one of the holes—I went into the cellar, and found the wine had been disturbed—three bottles had been moved—two of them were gone, and had been emptied and put back, but not in its right place—I had taken an account of the wine the night before, and taken one bottle from that tier; and on Thursday morning, at nine o'clock, there were seven bottles on that tier, and I found only four bottles full of wine and one empty—after the floor is washed they throw sand on it, the sand runs through the cracks, and settles on the top bottles in that recess—the empty bottle that was in the recess I gave to the constable; and the other empty one that he had had got sand on it, the same as the one I gave him—I know the prisoners.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a fire-man, belonging to the new fire office. On the 24th of July, in the morning, after the large fire at Ratcliffe, I was on duty, then going down London-street, I met the prisoner at the bar, and saw something under his coat, underneath his arm, I thought he had something that did not belong to him, at that time of the morning, it was rather before five o'clock, the fire was still burning.</p>
               <p>Q. How far from the fire was it? - It was almost to the sign of the Cricketers; I met him a great distance from the fire, I suspected that he had something that did not belong to him, I followed him into the public house, the Cricketers; he placed himself down on the bench in the tap-room, along side with his wife, as he said she was; and I went and stood by him for a minute, and I looked to see waht he had got under his coat; and I asked him what he had got there? he said, indeed, man, I have got my wife's sheets; I told him they did not look to be sheets, I insisted on seeing them, I told him I did not know but what it belonged to some gentlemen that were insured at our office, and he and I had a bit of a skirmish to get it from under his arm; when I got it from under his arm I see a table cloth, I asked him before I opened it, what was in the inside? he said he did not know, but whatever it was it was nothing to me; then I opened it, and took out his plate, I asked him how he came by them things? he told me he picked them up in the street; I looked on the cloth and found there was no dirt on it, and told him it was no such thing; then he said a genteel man gave them him, coming along the street; I asked him where the man lived? he said, he did not know nothing about him; then I called in one or two of my fellow servants, and we took him to the watch-house; as he was going along he tried to make his escape into a public house, below Limehouse, but we prevented him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. The first thing that excited your suspicion, was, seeing him that time in the morning. Don't you know that he was burnt out that morning? - I don't know that.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170096"></xptr>Q. Did not you see his wife there in the public house, and his children? - I see his wife there as he said it was.</p>

               <p>Q. Did not he desire you to stop a little, and that he expected for the man that gave them him to come there for them? - No, he did not, he told me I had no business with the property, it was his own.</p>

I think you belong to the ballast office; he said he did, he said, will you take it to where these things of your's are, that you said you saved? he said it was at the Cricketers, in London-street, and he would take care of it, and presently after I parted with him.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you take any notice of the man? Was he an old man? - He was a middle aged man, he had his hair tied behind, and a brownish coat on.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he a working man? - He seemed rather better drest than a working man.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 12th of September, I saw the prisoner and two others in Gray's-inn-lane - I watched them for half an hour - when they got into Holborn, they followed the prosecutor, who was coming toward the City - one of them made an attempt at his pocket, but did not succeed; the other two were close to him - when they came to Mr. Thompson's wine vaults, I saw one of them take the handkerchief from the prosecutor's pocket, and give it to the prisoner - I seized him and found it on him.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received an excellent character.</p>

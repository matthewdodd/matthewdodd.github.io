                  </hi>. I live with my brother, Benjamin Riley, the prisoner was in his service. On the evening of the 13th of September, I was up stairs in the second-floor, and heard the door open—I looked out of win<lb></lb>dow and saw the prisoner come out, take off his cap, and take out a parcel which he placed behind a shutter—I came down and told my brother, who went out and brought in the parcel, which contained the cheese—he said to the prisoner, "Henry, do you know any thing of this?"—he at first said, "No," and when the policeman came, he said he did place the cheese there—my brother asked him why he did it—he said a young man who had been out of a situation nine months had induced him to do it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a lock and whitesmith, and live in Charles-place, Kensington-square. On the 12th of January I went to the house of Mary Leary, at No. 36, George-street, Bloomsbury—when I got there the prisoner was sitting down partaking of food with Mrs. Leary and her children—Mrs. Leary asked me to partake of it, and I sat down for that purpose at a different table to the prisoner—I sat sideways to him, and his back was to me—I think within two minutes after I sat down the prisoner got up from his seat and took the plate which had been provided for me and was before me, but I had not began to eat—it slipped from his fingers, and fell into my lap—at the same time he took the plate from Mrs. Leary's mother, who was at my table, and that fell on the floor—he had taken the two plates one in each hand—he then, to the best of my knowledge, took up the fork which had been given to me, and plunged it into my eye—I cannot swear that I saw him take the fork up—I was sitting down at the time—I jumped up, and Mrs. Leary asked me to fetch a policeman, which I did, and he was given into custody—I have been under medical care—the sight of my eye is quite gone—I had not said a word to him after entering the room.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at No. 36, George-street, Blooms<lb></lb>bury. On the 12th of Jan. I was at home with my family—the prisoner and his wife had been staying there with me for four days—he was in a state of intoxication between five and six o'clock on that day—I sat down to dinner with him at that time, also my three children and mother—Thompson came in, and I gave him some dinner—he sat down at my work-table, at the back of the dinner-table—the prisoner took up the plates and they were broken—he then took the fork and plunged it into Thompson's eye—he appeared very much excited by drink—he was tipsy—I told Thompson to fetch a policeman, as I did not like to leave my children—he fetched one, and the prisoner was given in charge.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was he not kept by you in a state of continual intoxication from the time Groves and him came till this happened? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was not at home when he came, but at eleven o'clock at night, when I came in, he and his wife were in the bed, where my children should have been—he had been frequently at my house, but never to sleep—had I been at home I would not have allowed them to go to bed—the police station is nearly opposite my house—I did not know where his friends lived—I had been to Mr. Weather, his agent, fre<lb></lb>quently, to draw money, at his request—I went there for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., after he was confined, to buy Mrs. Bennett clothes—I had no money from Weather while the prisoner was in my house, nor from any of his friends—it was not the day before this happened—the morning he was taken into custody I went with Mrs. Bennett for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he was at Clerkenwell at the time—it was the morning after he was taken—I was out several hours each day while he was at my house—I took part of the drink—it was gin and porter—they were in bed almost all day—they both had porter before breakfast, and gin—he never had breakfast—there were no bottles of gin fetched.</p>

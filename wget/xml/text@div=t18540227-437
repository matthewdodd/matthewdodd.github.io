                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Coles Child, a coal merchant, at East Greenwich—I am a trouncer—I have to pull the sacks back, and help to carry—the prisoner was in Mr. Child's service. On 26th Jan., I went with the prisoner; we left my master's premises between 10 and 11 o'clock—we had a wagon and four horses—we took about five bushels of forage; it was composed of chaff, beans, and oats; a kind of black oats; and in addition to that, the nosebags were full—we called at the Green Man, which is on the road to Bromley—we stopped there in going, and we stopped there when we returned in the afternoon; I should think about 2 o'clock—we then had the five bushels of forage in the sack—the sack had not been opened for taking out provender, from the time we received it in the morning till we came back at 2 o'clock to the Green Man—when we got there, I got up in the wagon, and threw the sack down to the prisoner—the wagoner and he filled the nosebags from the sack; I helped to hold them while the prisoner filled them—the four bags would hold about a bushel and a quarter—there was then about two bushels and a half left in the sack, and the sack was placed against the fence, near the stable yard—I placed it there—I buckled two nosebags on, one on each of two horses, and left the prisoner to buckle on his two, and I went in the taproom—I left the sack against the fence—the prisoner came in the taproom shortly after me—we remained there about an hour; we had a pot of beer, which the prisoner paid for—when we came out of the tap-room, the sack was thrown on the side of the wagon, with about a peck of forage in it—I took the whip to drive home, and the prisoner said, "Stop a bit;" and I saw the horse-keeper, or ostler, give the prisoner some coppers—I drove along towards home, and the prisoner said we would stop and have a pint of beer on the road—as I had gone before, I asked him for a penny, and he said he had no money; and when he said we would have a pint of beer, I said I supposed it was the money he got for the horses victuals; and he said, "Yes, it was"—I drove right away home—I did not stop and have any beer—I gave information to the next witness.</p>

               <p>Child's employ? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say; about two or three months—I had been previously in the employ of Mr. Bond, on the railway—I left him, because I did not get money enough—this is not the first time I have been in a court of justice; I have never been a witness before—I stood once in the dock in the other Court; I had twenty-one days—that was not in this gaol.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Coles Child, as horse-keeper, and have been for ten years. The prisoner was his carman for six or seven years—I remember the wagon and horses going from my master's premises on 26th Jan.—they took out five bushels of provender in the sack, and the nosebags were full as well—the forage consisted of chaff, oats, and beans—I remember the wagon returning that day, and the last witness made some communication to me—the prisoner was given into custody in two or three days afterwards.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What time did the wagon come back? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> As near as I can tell, between 5 and 6 o'clock; the nosebags full and the bag full is what is ordinarily taken to feed the horses during the day.</p>

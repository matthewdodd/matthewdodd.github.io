                  </hi>, Esq. I am a conveyancer, and live in Lincoln's Inn. The prisoner was my clerk and had been so nine or ten years, he was a valuable clerk—I had a great opinion of his honesty and integrity—I prosecute him with the greatest regret—his duty on the receipt of fees was to pay them to me immediately—he had no authority to retain them without informing me of receiving them—I did not know that he had received from Mr. Chadwick nine guineas on my account—he never ac<lb></lb>counted for that sum.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Have you reason to believe it was his intention to return the money to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think it was—I think he had a reason<lb></lb>able expectation of being able to do so.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner received an excellent character.)</p>

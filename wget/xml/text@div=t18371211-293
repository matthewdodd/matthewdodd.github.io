                  </hi>. I live at No. 44, Cotton-street, Poplar, and am a sailor. I came from sea. met the prisoner, and asked him to show me some place to sleep at—I was quite sober when I fell in with him—I had then a watch, three sovereigns, and two half-sovereigns—I proposed to drink with him, being an old friend of mine—I ordered something to drink—I got drunk, and asked him to take me to sleep, not being much acquainted with places—after being asleep some time, I awoke, and he was not there—my watch and money was gone—I did not give him the watch—I was</p>

                  </hi>. I am a baker, and lodge at No. 5, Church-lane, White chapel, that is a coffee-shop. I remember, at half-past six o'clock on Saturday, the 9th of December, the prosecutor being brought there by the prisoner—the prisoner came into the coffee-room himself first, and then went and fetched the sailor, who was very tipsy—the prisoner appeared to have been drinking, but was quite sober enough to recollect what he was doing—the landlord asked me to assist the sailor up stairs, and I did—after that the prisoner said, "You may go down now, I will manage him"—I said "No, I would rather stop and see him into bed"—I did not leave him—I assisted to support him upright until the prisoner took off his coat and waistcoat—then we sat him on the bed—he took off his white trowsers—in taking them off, some money rattled in the pocket on the floor—it did not fall on the floor, but when the trowsers came on the floor there was money in the pocket—it was gold by the rattle, as far as I could judge—after he was put to bed, the prisoner went and took the trowsers off the chair—he said, "I must take care of this money for him"—he took the trowsers off the chair, and took the money out, and dropped a half-sovereign, and picked it up—that was the only money I saw—I said if he would put the trowsers under his head it would be quite safe, no person would have access to the room but himself—he did not do that—he took the money down—when I came down, he said he had got 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in his pocket, and took the money out in his hand—he then inquired for a bed for himself, and was told they were full—he said he would call in two or three hours, or otherwise he would call in the morning at eight o'clock—he then went away—he did not say where he lived—I did not see him again until the next evening at the station-house.</p>

               <p>about a quarter to nine o'clock on Sunday night—I believe that is half a mile from the coffee-shop—I went and asked him his name and address—he would not tell me—he said that was his business—I took him to the station-house—I did not tell him what for until I got to the station-house—I asked him what he had done with the watch—he denied all know ledge of it—he said he did not know—he would hardly speak—I said, "What have you done with the man's watch?"—he said, "I don't knot what you mean"—I said, "What have you done with the man's watch that you have taken away, and his money?"—he would not make me any answer—he was in liquor, but he was able to walk—I proceeded to search him, and found this watch, a shilling, and a halfpenny, but no sovereign, nor half-sovereign—he gave no account of the watch.</p>

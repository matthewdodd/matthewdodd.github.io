             sworn. - I am a baker: I was going into Mr. Anderson's house about half past three o'clock, on Saturday last, I saw the prisoner at the bar taking some canvas over the half door; I gave the alarm, and he was pursued and taken; I did not join in the pursuit; there was another man with him, the prisoner had a jacket on, I think it was a kind of fustian. I saw him again on Monday at the Mansion-house, he was at the bar; to the best of my knowledge he was the same man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You are sure this is the man you saw at the Mansion-house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. But you will not be positive he is the man that you saw in Throgmorton-street? - A. He is to the best of my knowledge, but I did not take much notice of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see his face? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Had he the same dress on at the Mansion-house that he had on at the prosecutor's door? - A. It was a kind of a green fustian, or velveteen; it was like mine. (The witness had on a drab coloured great coat).</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. How far were you from your master's house when you first saw him? - A. About two hundred yards. (The constable produced the property, which was deposed to by Mr. Anderson).</p>

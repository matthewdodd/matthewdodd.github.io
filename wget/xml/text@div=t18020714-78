             sworn. - On the 5th of June, about four o'clock in the morning, as I was loading my cart, I saw the prisoner go by with a sack on her back, and had rather a suspicion of her; she is an old rag and bone picket in the street; on my return to breakfast. I heard of the robbery, and knowing where she lived, I went to her place, and searched the room, where I found this mallet and gimlet, (produces them); I said, old girl, what did you do with the rest of the tools you had in the sack this morning; she said, it was paper; I searched her, and she took something out of her pocket; which she wanted to put into her mouth, but I stopped her, and it appears to be the duplicate of these planes; she wears breeches, and in her breeches pockets I found this book and other duplicates. (Produces them.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. As I was going over Westminsterbridge, I asked a man for work, and he said, he wished I would pawn the planes for him, and he would give me 4d. which I did; I went down the area for the purpose the man has stated, but never touched a plane.</p>

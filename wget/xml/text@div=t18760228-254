                  </hi>. I am the wife of William George Owen, an artilleryman—we were married on 9th October, 1875—the prisoner is my husband's brother—on 21st January I was living with my mother, Mrs. Hill, at 151, Regent Street, Lambeth, and at 430 I was upstairs dressing to go out—I called to my mother to bring up my boots and heard the prisoner say to her "I want to speak to her, I will take up her boots"—he knocked and opened my door and came in and gave me my boots—I said "Thank you <hi rend="italic">Harry"</hi> took them out of his hand, and put them on, and he went over to the mantelpiece and leaned on it—I then took the key from the inside of the door and was putting it on the outside when he said "<hi rend="italic">Lizzie</hi>, I want to speak to you"—I turned round and said "Very well, <hi rend="italic">Harry</hi>"—he came over from the mantelpiece with one hand in his pocket and held me so tight with the other that I could not holloa, and then he took his other hand out of his pocket and struck some instrument into my throat, saying "I have been waiting for this opportunity for some time"—I could not call out, but I stamped my foot, and when he found that I did that he held me tighter and stabbed me again in my throat—I stamped again and then he knocked my head against the wall—I heard my mother say "Oh! she is fainting," and then she came upstairs—as soon as the prisoner heard heard her coming he let go of me, and then I pulled my door open and got out on the stairs and said "Oh! mother, <hi rend="italic">Harry</hi> has cut my throat"—she laid hold of me and as the prisoner went downstairs he said "Whose throat?"—I said "My throat"—he went out of the house—I was attended by Mr. Scott.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have known the prisoner's family three years—I have not been on bad terms with the prisoner during that time because I had no occasion—I had seen him the day before this, he was in the house with me and my mother—we were on the usual friendly terms the day before—when he said that he had been waiting for an opportunity, I don't think he said waiting for an opportunity of speaking to me for some time—there were two wounds—he has the reputation of being steady and quiet—he was always at home with his mother—I had no reason to anticipate his doing anything of this sort—I have never had a word with him since I knew him—I was not aware that he bore me any ill will, and I have no reason for believing that he had any motive for the act or that it was due to jealousy—he has never paid me any attention so as to make me think it was done through jealousy—I did not see him inflict any wound upon him<lb></lb>self.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The only time he said anything about an opportunity was when he stabbed me—his mother lives in the back parlour and he has come there or four times a week when his brother was at home—my husband has not been away since we have been married—his regiment returned before we were married.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Hill, of 151, Regent Street Lambeth—when I went upstairs my daughter said "Oh! mother, <hi rend="italic">Holry</hi> has cut my throat"—he was inside the room and holloaed out "Has cut whose throat?" and followed us downstairs—I then attended to my daughter—there were two wounds on her throat—I put a wet towel to it and sent for a doctor who attended her for a month.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner came to the house between 3 and 4 o'clock that day, and was having a cup of tea; he was there the day before—I know of no ill-feeling between him and the prosecutrix—I never saw them behave otherwise than friendly to each other.</p>

                  </hi>, M.D. I live at 231, Kennington Road—on 21st January I was called to Mrs. Owen and found a stab on her throat about an inch deep, and a cut about an inch long by the side of it—this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) would cause them—I attended her till 10th February—the stab would require con<lb></lb>siderable force.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I saw the prisoner the same evening at 9.30, and found him suffering from a very severe wound in his throat—it was not dangerous—it might have been inflicted with this knife—it did not injure any danger<lb></lb>ous part—it was a dangerous cut, but it was only one quarter of an inch deep, and 3 or 4 inches long—to the best <hi rend="italic">of my</hi> belief, I do not think he knew what he had been doing—I did not mention it to him—his wound was on the left side of his neck—it might have been inflicted by himself, and I think he said that he had inflicted it himself—he appeared not conscious of having committed an act of this sort—I have had experience in the question of the human mind, and have had experience in lunatic asylums—in my opinion it is possible that lunacy or mania may exist in the mind without previous symptoms having displayed themselves—there is no doubt that this young man was labouring under morbid ideas for some time—I believe they were both in love with the same woman—he did not say or do anything to induce that belief; it is general observation—he did not say anything about being in love with this young woman; I heard that from somebody else—in some cases the act itself may be the only evidence from which to judge of a man's mind—taking the whole circumstances of a particular case they alone may be sufficient to lead to a belief whether or no a person is sane at the time—taking the fact that a man has committed an attack of this sort upon a person with whom he has been on good terms, or more than good terms, occupying the position of a brother-in-law; that, in my opinion, is evidence of insanity, taking the whole circumstances of the case—a man stabbing a woman without apparent motive, and then attempting suicide, is evidence of insanity to the best of my knowledge—the sudden impulse is also a mat<lb></lb>ter from which I should judge—I do not think the prisoner knew the nature and quality of the act he was doing—I do not think he knew that it was a wrong thing to do at the time he did it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> From the prisoner's behaviour to me I infer that he was insane at the time—he did not seem to know what he was doing; he seemed quite uoconscious of having committed any wrong act—he said nothing at all—it was not simply from his silence that I inferred that he did not know</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187602280088"></xptr>
               <p>that what he had been doing was wrong, but he did not seem to be aware <hi rend="italic">of what he had</hi> been <hi rend="smallCaps">
GUILTY</hi> of—I <hi rend="italic">have no other reason For forming that</hi> judgment—the fact of a man having done a thing of this kind, and rendered himself liable to a criminal charge, might be enough to confound him, and produce a <hi rend="italic">kind of feeling which only implied that he had committed</hi> a criminal act—it might be the confusion of a sane person reflecting on the consequences of the act he had <hi rend="italic">committed.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">By</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">THE COURT</hi>. He was in a state of mania to the best of my belief—I was induced to believe that he was insane from his general appearance and deportment; I formed the conclusion that he laboured under some disease of the mind—he did not seem to know what he had been doing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">By</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. DOUGLAS</hi>. I did not ask him any questions; I was not with him half an hour, only while I was attending to his wound—he remained per<lb></lb>fectly quiet and allowed me to dress it and said nothing—I then went away—the policeman was not there—the belief in my mind was that he had a morbid feeling of love for this woman—I cannot say that the act was dic<lb></lb>tated by motives of jealousy—there are cases where a person murders a person he is in love with because his affection is not returned and commits suicide afterwards—I had heard about his being in love with the woman before I saw him, and I was under the influence of that belief when I formed my opinion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then it appears by your evidence that this was not an act which had no motive; you say now that you formed your opinion because you believed he had a motive of the strongest kind, namely, jealousy or unreturned affec<lb></lb>tion, or seeing the person he loved the wife of another man? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That was the feeling in my mind.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">By</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">THE COURT</hi>. I had heard of the circumstances of the act, but I did not give any thought to his having committed the act from unrequited affection—he seemed to be acting very stupidly and did not seem conscious of what he had done to the girl—I mean to say that where a person from a belief in his own mind, he being in love, that his affection is unrequited, stabs a woman and attempts to commit suicide, that that is evidence of in<lb></lb>sanity alone, to a cortain extent—I do not mean that in all cases where a man makes an attack of this kind from a motive of jealousy he is exempted from responsibility for his actions—by jealousy I mean disappointed feelings from affection unrequited—it is my belief that a person perpetrating an act of this kind under feelings of unrequited love is not sensible enough to be responsible.</p>

I am surgeon to the Gaol of Newgate—my atten<lb></lb>tion was first called to the prisoner when he came in on Tuesday week and I have seen him every day since; my object was to ascertain if there was any derangement of his mind—I knew the case—he has been perfectly rational since he has been under my observation—I have conversed with him every day and have had conversations with him upon this act—he does not appear to be under any delusion with regard to it; he informed me that he had been drinking rather hard for a week before—he has no delusions—I have heard the latter part of Dr. Scott's evidence—I have had considerable experience of lunatics—I have been surgeon to this gaol for more than twenty years—I do not agree in jealousy being an indication of insanity—I cannot resolve the mere feeling of disappointed affection which arises in the mind when affection is not returned, into insanity—I should not consider an act of violence done under that feeling to be reasonable evidence of in<lb></lb>sanity,</p>

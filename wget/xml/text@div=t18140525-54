            . I am an officer. On the evening of the 4th of May, I was sent for to a room in York-street, Saffron-hill, on account of a riot. I went to a room kept by a Mrs. Lee. I saw these borders laying in the room: I saw a hair bag laying in the room. I asked her how she came by the bag. In consequence of her information I went to Levy, the prosecutor, and brought him to the public-house where I had taken these things. I asked Cagell how he had come by these things. I said I had been to Lee's lodgings; he said he had them of Davis, he lived in the City. Cagell and Davis were both present. I had sent for them both. I asked Davis whether he gave it to Cagell, or not. He said he had; he had given him a hair bag for a covering or sacking of bed. This is a tippet we found in the cellar where there was a man dying skins. Mr. Levy picked these things out. I saw them selected out of a large quantity in a bag in the work shop. This seal skin and these borders he also picked out. I afterwards took the things to the office.</p>
               <p>THOMAS BEVAN. I live in Water-lane, Fleet-street; Davis lodged with me. I went into the lodging of Davis; I saw part of the things found there by the officers.</p>

He went through the yard, into the dye-house. Cagell was in the dye-house. I went into the yard, and perceived them in close conversation. Afterwards, I saw Davis going out of the back door of the dye-house with a bundle in his hand. There were some furs hanging out of the bundle. They were fur tippets, called stone martin tippets. By the size of the bundle, I suppose it contained about a dozen tippets.</p>

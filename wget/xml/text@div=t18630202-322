                  </hi>. I carry on the business of a lithographer and wholesale stationer, at 136, Minories, in partnership with Mr. Field—in the latter part of last year the prisoner Marcus called upon me—it was about two months ago: I can't say positively, it might be longer: it was about six weeks before I went to the Mansion House—he produced the two tickets which I have in my hand, and asked if I could manufacture tickets similar to those—I said I could—I asked what they were—he said they were tickets issued by private individuals over there—I surmised that he meant Poland, but</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186302020037"></xptr>
               <p>that was all he said—he then said that Poland was in a state of insurrection—that they were going to have a new King, and that was the reason that these tickets would be wanted—he said they were equal to our pro<lb></lb>missory notes used over here—he asked me the price for 5,000 and 1,000—I told him if he called again I would let him know—he said he would call again the next morning—I saw nothing further of him until Thursday, 11th December—he was then alone—he first produced ten slips of paper which I have here, and asked me if I could manufacture similar ones—I said I could, but I suspected that they were money—he asked me the price for doing 100 of etch sort, that would make 1,000—he said he had heard from his father with reference to the two former tickets, and they would not be wanted—I told him to call again next day—in the meantime I made a communication to the Russian authorities and the police—on the following day Marcus called again with a companion, not now in custody, ordered the tickets, 100 of each sort, and left 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. deposit—he wanted them completed by the Tuesday—that would be the 16th—I said I would try to get them done by that time—he called on the Tuesday and wanted to know if the tickets were ready—I told him to call again on the Wednesday, which he did—he said he particularly wanted to have all the tickets delivered by Saturday, as his friend was going over on that day (I am reading from my notes taken at the time)—he impressed upon me very strongly the necessity of having the tickets done so that no one could tell them from the originals—on Thursday, December 18th, Marcus called again and I showed him the lithographic stone which is now before me—this is it with the body of the ticket upon it—on showing him the stone, he went to the door and called in the other prisoner, Herman; that was the first time I had seen him—the two examined the stone together—Marcus professed satis<lb></lb>faction, and introduced Herman as his friend who was going over on Saturday—Marcus asked me if I was willing to deal with Herman in stationery, and in return I should be favoured with a continuance of his orders for various tickets all the year round in very large quantities, provided they gave satis<lb></lb>faction—while they were looking at the stone they spoke to each other in a foreign language; I heard them, but could not make out what they said—I promised that the whole of the tickets should be done by 12 o'clock on Saturday—they then left—on the following morning about 11 o'clock I had visit from Marcus—he expressed dissatisfaction that the tickets were not completed, and said he would not have them at all, unless the whole of the order was completed that day, as his friend who was going over could not wait—I again showed him this lithographic stone—he promised to return at 4 that same day—he did so, and I showed him one of two speci<lb></lb>mens of the tickets—he wanted to take one away, but I retained it, and told him to call again at 5—he did so, and I gave into his hands fifty-two completed tickets—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are them—he took them away with him—I told him if he came on the following Monday he might have the remainder of them—this stone has impressed upon it the back and front of this ticket—that stone was lithographed by me, and the tickets printed from it, by Marcus's direction—this other stone has lithographed upon it the border of the ticket, that was also done by his direction.</p>

I keep the Prince Rupert coffee-house, in Prince Rupert-street, Haymarket—I know the two prisoners—I first became ac<lb></lb>quainted with Marcus about three or four months ago; he used to come and have his meals at my house—at first he paid on every occasion, and after that he appeared to be in want of money—he told me on one occasion that he expected his father to fetch him home; that was not in relation to money—he afterwards said he had had a letter stating that his father was not coming, but that his brother was coming—I can't say when that was—I should think it was about a week before his brother came—on Thursday, 11th December, Marcus came about the middle of the day, and asked if he could have lodgings for himself and his brother—he said his brother had arrived the overnight—I said I should be glad to receive him—about half-past 5 the same day, the two prisoners came together—Marcus introduced his brother to me, and paid me a few shillings that he owed me—he did not say how he was enabled to do it—they remained there part of the evening, but went out to sleep; I had no bed for them that night—they returned next morn<lb></lb>ing, and from that time they continued to lodge with me—Marcus said he and his brother were going home on the following Tuesday—they did not go then, and I asked Marcus when they thought of going—he said on the Thursday if their business was settled—on the Thursday or Friday I asked him again, and he said on Saturday, if their business in the city was settled—they went out about 10 or 11 o'clock on Saturday morning—they came back about the middle of the day, and went out again between 3 and 4—they did not return any more.</p>

I am a detective officer of the City—in consequence of information conveyed to me, I went on Thursday, 18th December, about 12 o'clock, into, the Minories, in the neighbourhood of Messrs. Tewer and Field's establishment—I was alone on that occasion—I saw the two prisoners coming down the Minories—Herman stopped in a doorway, three or four houses away from Mr. Tewer's shop, while Marcus went in—after a short time Marcus came out, beckoned to Herman, and they both went in together—I saw them in the shop looking at the lithographic stone; they remained there about ten minutes; they then came out together and went away—on the following Saturday, the 20th, I was in the Minories again, in company with Sergeant Brett, between 11 and 12 in the day—Marcus left Herman, who again went into a doorway, he going into Mr. Tewer's shop—he remained inside four or five minutes, then came out, and both went away together—about 4 o'clock the same day I and Brett were together, and saw the prisoners again come down the Minories—Marcus left Herman as before, and went into Mr. Tewer's shop, and Herman again went into the doorway, as he had done on the previous occasions—Marcus came out in a few minutes, joined the other, and they both went away together—about 5 o'clock the same after<lb></lb>noon I again saw them coming down the Minories together—I then went first into Mr. Tewer's shop—I had not been there above a minute or two, when Marcus came in—after some little conversation with Mr. Tewer, I saw Mr.</p>

               <p>Tewer give him these pieces of paper—I heard Marcus say to Mr. Tewer that he was sorry he had not got them all done, and he would take what was done—there was a great deal said between them that I could not hear through carts passing along the street, and not being close enough, but that was what he said in going out—when he left the shop I went after him—I saw him join Herman; they walked together about 100 yards up the Minories, and I went to a window where there was a strong gaslight—Marcus gave the papers to Herman, and Herman was in the act of examining them close to the window, when I went up, took them out of his hand, and took him into custody—I said, "What have you got there?"—he did not make me any answer—I said, u Where did you get them from?"—he still made no answer—I then turned to Marcus, and said, "Can he speak English?"—Marcus said, "No"—I said, "Where did you get these papers; what are they?"—Marcus said, "Me? I know nothing about them"—I said, "Ask him where he got them from?" pointing to Herman—he said something to Herman, who made some reply, which I did not understand, and then Marcos told me that Herman said he got them from a printer's—I then told him that we were officers, and must take them to the police—station, which we did, and searched them—Brett searched Herman—5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in money was found on Marcus.</p>

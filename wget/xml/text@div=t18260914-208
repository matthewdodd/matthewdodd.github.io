On the 25th of August I put half a sovereign, 4s. 6d., and a piece of paper, into my piano-forte, by the side of the door, in my first floor; I went out, and returned about ten o'clock in the evening; I cannot tell whether the room door was locked; when I returned the money was gone - I made inquiry, and the servant gave me information - I got an officer, and he went to the prisoner's door; I said "Mrs. Nash, I want to speak with your boy (who is about nine years of age);" the officer went into the room - she wanted to push him out but he would go in, and asked the little boy if he had any pictures, and while he was searching the boy, the prisoner took up a caddy, and ran down stairs with it - the officer ran after her, and stopped her - she screamed "Murder, for God's sake! one shilling is mine;" this money was found in the caddy.</p>

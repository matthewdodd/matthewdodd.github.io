                  </hi>. I live at Amersham. I was porter at a sale at Iver, on the 28th of September, and there was a quantity of Venetian stair carpeting knocked down to Mr. Samuel Mason—he came for his lot on the Saturday, and it was gone—I saw it again before the Magistrate at Uxbridge—Mr. James Stratford was auctioneer and agent—it was lot No. 40, which is now produced—the sale was in Sandstone Cottage, which is in Iver, Bucks.</p>

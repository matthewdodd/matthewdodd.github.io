            . I went home on the 17th of September, between ten and eleven at night, and found my dwelling broke open, I missed a pair of cheeks, and a grate-bar, there was nothing else in the room. I saw my cheeks hang up to be sold at a smith's, in Red-Cross-Street, I cheapened them, and the smith asked me 4 s. for them, and said they were worth five. I asked him where he had them, for they were mine; he said he bought them about three weeks ago of a man with a parcel of iron; said I, that can't be for I have not lost them so<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174410170020"></xptr> long, upon which his wife came down, and said, No, you did not buy them, I bought them last week of a woman: she said she knew nothing of the woman; and the smith said, if I would give him the money they cost him, I should have them. I knew I must be at the charge of a warrant, and I said , I'll give you a shilling if you will let me have them again, and he let me have them. They sent to me afterwards, and said the same woman came and offered them a pair of cheeks, and a grate bar; I went there and the Prisoner owned the selling the cheeks, and that she had 15 d. for them.</p>

            , I was in the shop when Mrs. Blay bought these cheeks of the Prisoner, and some other old iron, but there was no upper bar of a grate brought then. Mrs. Springham came about four or five days afterwards to buy them again, and I went with her to try if they fitted her grate, and I believe they are the cheeks that belonged to her grate.</p>

               <p>Gooding. I don't know what she gave her.</p>

               <p>Gooding. She came with a pair of cheeks, an upper bar and some old iron, and we stopped the iron and sent to Mrs. Springham.</p>
               <p>Jury . Are you sure those are your cheeks?</p>
               <p>Springham. I verily believe those cheeks to be mine, they were made to the grate by my order, (the grate is 60 years old) one is thinner than the other, and there are no tops to the back part of them. - I think I can be positive they are my cheeks. <rs id="t17441017-17-verdict112" type="verdictDescription">

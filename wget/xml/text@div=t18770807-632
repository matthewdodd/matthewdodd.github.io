I did, and gave you a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note and some gold—I said 'You never did"—he said "On your luncheon table"—I said he must be confusing me with my predecessor, Miss Vincent, who had left me only five weeks—I have never sent him to cash a cheque for me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am head butler of the Albemarle Club—I have known the prisoner ever since he has been at the club, ten months—we always found him an honest lad—on Friday, 20th July, I sew him at 9 a.m. when he came to the club, that was plate-cleaning day, and he was in the pantry, in a line with the hall, cleaning the plate in his dirty undress suit—I do not remember him going out of the club from morning till night—I was in the hall in a line with him between 9 and 12 o'clock and 1 never missed him once—I grumbled at him because he was not dressed just before 12 o'clock—I made him hurry and from that time I never lost sight of him till our first luncheon came in at 1.45—he went into the bar to relieve the porter and let him go to his dinner at 1.30, and stopped in the box till 1.45—he came up from the servants' hall at 12.40 and went into the porter's box—I was in the hall while he was there and can say that he remained in the porter's box constantly from 12.40 till 1.45—I do not know Mr. Pearson, he is not a member of the club.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was at the police-court, but did not give evidence because I was not called—the hall porter is not here; he was put into the box at the police-court, but could not remember the date—he was examined for a time—I do not know whether the prisoner's solicitor withdrew his evidence because the Magistrate did not believe it—he did not give the whole history of the morning, he only got as far as the date, and then he said he did not know whether it was last Friday or Friday week—I remember the date by it being plate cleaning day, and by it being brought to our minds so soon as the Monday following—I mean to say that only one Monday followed the date I am speaking of—I was there the whole morn-ing, and never saw the prisoner out of the pantry—I was in the coffee-room or the hall, except when I went down to the servants' lunch—I had not my eyes on him in the coffee-room, but as I went in and out; I stand at the coffee-room door mostly—the other witness who is going to be called was in the pantry with the boy the whole time, from 9 o'clock till nearly 12 o'clock—I made the prisoner hurry to dress to be down at 12 o'clock—he dressed in the pantry and 1 kept by his side and hurried him—I went down to dinner with him and he sat by me at dinner—I did not lose sight of him</p>

               <p>till the first luncheon commenced at 2 o'clock—I did then because I was in the coffee-room making out bills—this was first brought to my mind on Monday morning, the 23rd, when the cheque was sent from Scarlett's, and Miss Clackworthy said "Here is somebody has been passing a bad cheque at Scarlett's with my name on it"—I wanted to see it, and she said "The boy brought it down"—I said "The boy could not have been out that morning, between 11 and 12 o'clock, because he was not dressed, he was cleaning plate and was dirty"—I did not name that to Scarlett, or to Cave, the policeman—I named it to the solicitor the first time I saw him, and on the morning the boy was brought up on Wednesday, at the police-court—I was at the club the whole time, Miss Vincent was there—she left six weeks ago—here is "Mary Gardner" on the cheque, I never heard that name, nor do I know the writing—the writing on the other side is not Miss Vincent's, hers is a large bold writing—we have only one porter.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with Mr. Muggeridge. On the 16th of Oc<lb></lb>tober I saw Arber there with his cart, between one and two o'clock—he purchased a sack of barley of Mr. William Muggeridge—he paid for it and both he and Mr. Muggeridge signed the book—Mr. Muggeridge asked him if he wanted any oats to-day—he said "nothing else"—I delivered the sack of barley to him—Mr. Muggeridge then left him—I was then sent up stairs by Holyhead—I had suspicion, and was determined to see how it was going on—I saw Arber throw an empty sack out of his cart into the warehouse—it was taken into the warehouse, three bushels were put</p>

               <p>in below, on the floor—he threw the sack in, and another bushel was fetched from the floor above, by Holyhead—he put it into the sack—Arber held the sack open, and both assisted in putting it into the cart—I heard nothing about signing the book at that time—I am quite sure Arber had said before that he wanted nothing else to-day—he went off with the cart I followed it over Blackfriars-bridge—I hallooed to him, "Hoy," and as soon as he saw me he said, "I have got nothing but what is my own" he whipped his horses, and gallopped away—I went after him, stopped him, and said, "If you have nothing but what is yours, why run away?"—I brought him back—Mr. William Muggeridge gave them both in charge—Holyhead said, "I have got the money, and I meant to pay you for them"—Mr. Muggeridge then said, "There was a sack of oats on Tuesday," but they both denied seeing each other on the Tuesday.</p>

On the 16th I sold Arber a sack of barley, for which be paid me—I asked if he wanted any oats—he said, "No, nothing else to-day"—Holyhead then ordered the men up above, and I left—when 1 went into the warehouse again, Holyhead told me Arber had left—he had said he would wait till four o'clock for some papers—he was afterwards brought back—I never received the money for the oats.</p>

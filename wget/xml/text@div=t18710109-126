                  </hi>. I am a clerk, and live at 2, Houghton Street, Clare Market—on Sunday, 1st January, I returned home about 1.15—when I entered my room there was a lamp alight, hut turned down very low—the fire was just out, and my wife was in bed and asleep, and a little child in bed with her—I sat down, and smoked my pipe, and drank some beer—about 1.45 I was going to light another pipe, as I was reading rather an interesting book, when I noticed the valance of the bed raised up—I went and pulled it up, and there was the prisoner underneath the bed—I pulled him out, and asked what he did there—he made some rambling statement, and pretended that he was drunk; that he did not know how be got there, but he thought his mother used to live there—when I went into the room I found my wife's things on the floor, entangled in a chair, at if they had been thrown down—there was money in the room, and several things belong<lb></lb>ing to my wife, which might have been taken—I did not notice that any<lb></lb>thing had been removed—I asked the prisoner what he was—he said he was a steward on board ship—I awoke my wife, and said to her, in the prisoner's presence, "What is the meaning of this, how did he come here?"—she said she did not know, and looked very frightened—he said he was drunk, and he was very sorry—he could not make out how he could have got there—I took him by the collar, and took him down stairs—he was not so drunk but he could walk down the narrow part of the stairs without stumbling—as I went down I called to my father-in-law, who lives on the first floor, but as I could not make him hear, I let go of the prisoner for a moment to knock at his door, and he hid himself in a recess; I got him again, and gave him in charge to a constable—I heard him give his address at the station, at Green's Sailors' Home, East India Road, and he was steward of a ship—I asked him what sort of steward—he said "A first-class steward"—he did not say of what ship—there is a window on the staircase, which had been broken, and a piece of cardboard put over it—in the morning I found that gone; a hand could then be put in to open the window—there were marks on the sill as if a person had sat there and let himself down.</p>

About 2.15 on Sunday morning, 1st January, I was called to take the prisoner into custody—he made a rambling statement, and said "Oh, I don't know where I am," and such like—I shook him, and told him I should have to take him to the station, and he made a remark as if he did not understand, but was regularly drunk—as I was taking him to the station he kicked me in the shin several times, and tried to get away, and bit my thumb—I had to get assistance to take him to the station, and then he was as sober as anything—I asked him his address—he said "Green's Home, East India Road"—I noticed the window next morning—a person could easily put his hand through the aperture, and open it.</p>

I am seventeen years old, and live at Deptford. lam in the employ of Joseph Levy, as assistant collector of tolls at the Stamford-bridge-gate, in the Fulham-road—on Wednesday evening, the 7th of Oct., about six o'clock, I received from William Gulliver, the toll collector there, two parcels of money, wrapped in brown paper—I was to take them to the Kensington-gate, and give them into the hands of Mr. Levy—I was in the habit of going there with the money—on my way there I had occasion to come into the Gloucester-road, in the parish of St. Mary, Kensington—when I got there, between six and seven o'clock, the prisoner Lampert passed me—(I had seen him a few day's previously,) when he got a few yards ahead of we he looked round and looked in my face—when I got 300 or 400 yards further into the cross road leading to Fulham (I was walking in the middle of the road) the prisoner Greeney stepped out of the side of the hedge and mur<lb></lb>mured</p>

               <p>something—as I did not understand him I stayed to hear, and then he and four others rushed on me—Lam pert was one—they forced me to the ground—two took hold of me by the throat, another covered my eyes with his hands—I had the money in my outer coat pocket—they began rifling my pockets—this lasted a few minutes—they kicked me on the head, or hit me with a stick, I will not be certain which—it was a violent blow, and made a large swelling on my head—there was blood on my ears from a kick or hit—that was while they were taking my money—they all ran away—I hardly knew for a minute or two where I was, but on recovering I got up, put my hand to my pocket, and found my pocket was cut out, and the money gone—I went on, met Sparks the constable, and told him what had happened—I returned to Kensington and told Gulliver, and then went to Mr. Levy—I had seen Lam pert two or three days before when I was on the Honey-lane bar, Fulham-road—he came there one day and said to me, "Halloa!"—I said, "Halloa!" he said, "Who is down at the other gate?"—I told him, thinking him to be one of the other turnpike men, but I did not know him.</p>

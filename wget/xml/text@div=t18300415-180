            . I am a watchman of Islington. I met the prisoner at half-past six that evening, with a bundle over her shoulder; I asked what she had got; she said clothing; I said I had some suspicion it was not right, that she must go to the watch-house, and if it was right she should be let go - in going along she said, "Let me go home;" I said, "You shall if it is not too far;" she said, "I live up here," and took me to her master's, who owned the property; while we were examining the bundle she got out backwards - another watchman pursued and took her.</p>

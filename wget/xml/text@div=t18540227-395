                  </hi>. I keep a lodging house, at No. 10, George-street, St. Giles's. On Sunday, 26th Feb., the prisoner came there with another young man—he asked me for a night's lodging; I said he could have it—he gave me half a crown in payment—I gave him the change, and put it in my pocket—he then asked me if his friend could have a lodging; I said yes, and the prisoner gave me a second half crown—I gave him change for that also—I had no other half crowns, only some coppers—the prisoner and his companion then ran away, and I examined the half crowns and found that they were bad—I took two policemen with me, and found the prisoner about half an hour afterwards at a lodging house—I am sure he is the same man—I gave the half crowns to the policeman.</p>

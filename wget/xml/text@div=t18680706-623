I am the daughter of the prosecutrix, and live with her at 53, Roman Road, Ford Road, Bow—I am single—my mother and the prisoner have been living together for about eight or ten years—about 4.30 on Sunday, 21st June, I heard a knife being sharpened, and I heard the prisoner say, "I will do it"—I knew it to be the prisoner's voice—I saw him about five minutes after—he came from down stairs, and went out of the street door, walking rather sharply—I saw his hands with blood on them as I stood at the door—just before he went out I heard a knife fall on the floor—I went into the room shortly after, and found mother sitting in a chair, bleeding very much from the right leg, close to the thigh, and I went and fetched a doctor—my mother and the prisoner had been quarrelling ever since 12 on the Saturday night till 4 on Sunday after<lb></lb>noon—the prisoner had kicked me down stairs just before I heard the knife being sharpened—I remained down there till I heard the noise—I brought the doctor back with me.</p>

On 21st June last, I took the prisoner into custody on the charge of stabbing Mrs. Williams—I found this knife lying in the front room before I took the prisoner—there was no blood on it—he said he was sorry he had not put the knife through her heart, and then through his own—on the way to the station he said, "She lifted up her clothes and asked me to stab her through the heart, and then, after I had done it, I put my hand on the wound, and that is how my hands came over blood."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, in the Old Ford Road—on 21st June, I was called to the house of the prisoner, and saw the elder Caroline Williams—I found a wound on the right thigh—she was in an exhausted state—it was an incised wound, about an inch long and three-quarters of an inch deep—this knife would produce such a wound—I could not say whether it could be inflicted in a struggle or not—it must have been done with great force—the dress and petticoat were cut through.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. This was a pure accident. My wife had a fall out with the girl, and she was so excited that she broke everything to pieces with a hammer. I got up to take it away from her, and we had a struggle. She said, "William, I am stabbed." I said, "Where?" She said, "In the thigh. I put my hand to the wound, and said, "I will go and fetch my mother." When the policeman came, I said, "Do you want me? I expect so," and I went out of the house with him. That is all I have to say.</p>

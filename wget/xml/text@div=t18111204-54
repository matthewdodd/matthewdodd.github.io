On the 15th of November between two and three in the afternoon I came home, I was fatigued, I laid down on the bench and fell asleep; I had eight and six-pence in my breeches pocket; a three shilling token, one shilling, and three eighteen-penny tokens. I was awoke by the prisoner's hand in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any other persons in the tap-room - A. There were two other persons by the fire, they did not see her in the act. I laid hold of her instantly, when I found her hand in my breeches pocket, she stooped then down, as if she was going to do something to her shoes, I examined my pocket, I found it had been robbed of all its contents, I charged her with it, I took a three shilling piece, and one shilling out of her hand, I asked her where the rest was, she said that was all she had taken, I found one eighteen-penny token in her shoe, I got a candle, and found a eighteen-penny token under the bench, but the other I could not find, I sent for a constable, and had her apprehended, I put the money on the table, and delivered it to the constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen the prisoner in the house before. - A. I have seen her in the house.</p>

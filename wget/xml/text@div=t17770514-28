               <p>I am a surgeon: I was called to look at the man the day after he came to the hospital; the account given of him was, that he fell off his cattle; he seemed to me to have symptoms of an oppressed brain; he had vomitting and purging, and he raised his head and complained of it at times; I examined his head, but there was no external mark of any injury; I dissected him after he was dead, but could find nothing; he died about two hours after I first saw him; when I opened him I could not observe any thing that I could assign as the cause of his death.</p>
               <p>Do you mean by that that you suppose the man died a natural death? - I suppose the brain had received some contusion that was the cause of his death; I could not see any thing when I opened him.</p>

Lewis said, No, he could not give him any, because he was only an interloper himself; Britain made answer, then I shall take care of you as well as other; so one word brought up another, and then they went out of doors to fight.</p>

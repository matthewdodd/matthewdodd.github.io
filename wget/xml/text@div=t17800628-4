             came to my master on Thursday the 1st of June with a letter from Mr. Bird at the Museum. He looked at a horse in the stable, and thought it would do for him. I put a saddle on the horse and went with him to show it to Mr. Bird.</p>

I went to enquire for him; he had not been in town all the week, whereas Price said he saw him the night before; they said he would not be in town for the rest of the week; when I came out of the door, the prisoner had rode away with the horse, and I heard no more of him nor the horse till my master had taken him up; my master heard of it at the Nag's-head in Leather-lane; I believe that was on the Tuesday, when the prisoner was taken up.</p>

               <p>Do you know the prisoner? - I never saw him but once in my life, that was at the Red-Lyon in King-street, Bloomsbury, where I heard there was a horse to dispose of; I went and saw the prisoner; he said he had two to dispose of if it was convenient for me to make a purchase? I said it was not convenient to make a purchase, but I had one at the Nag's head in Leather-lane, if he would come and look at it, I would make an exchange with him.</p>
               <p>Do you keep the Nag's-head? - I have some part of the stable.</p>
               <p>Did he come down? - He came to me and tried every thing he thought necessary, and then asked three guineas in exchange. I told him it did not suit me to disburse any money, nor would I, as I thought one horse as good as the other; on this he went away, and came back again; he sent for me and came back the third time and said, his brother kept the King's-head; that it was his horse; that if I would take his horse with all faults, if any, he would take mine the same, and we exchanged in that manner. He said I will not exchange now unless you give me half-a-crown for my own trouble; I gave him half-a-crown and said it must not be a dry bargain but a wet one. He called for a shilling's worth of brandy punch. I shewed the horse to Mr. White; that is absolutely the horse I had in exchange from the prisoner.</p>

               <p>On the Monday before the Thursday I had a letter from Mr. Bird to get him an horse. I got one. It was not fashionable enough; I went to Mr. White to see if he had one that would suit. I was very much in liquor when I went; I was opposite a publick-house; this man asked me if I had got an horse to sell, and said if I would come to Leather-lane he would swap an horse with me. I went down to Leather-lane, and being drunk, desired to lie down in the stable. After some time I got up; then I drank with him and went to lie down again; afterwards he shewed me an horse, I do not believe it was the same horse; when I came away, I found the horse to be a broken-winded horse. I said if it was found in the wind I would swap with him if he would give me half a-crown; he gave me half a-crown and then brought me another horse. I refused to take it. He said I might have that or none; that he had sold the other for four guineas. Mr. White put it under my care. Mr. White said he would not sell his horse for any thing under ten pounds, as it was same, that it might not be returned to his hand.</p>
               <p>To the Prosecutor. You say the letter is Mr. Bird's hand writing? - He said so.</p>
               <p>To Matthews. Was the prisoner on the horse when he went with you to Mr. Bird's? - Yes.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I keep the Red Lion in King-street, Bloomsbury. I have known the prisoner from an infant; he was always a very honest lad; he lived three years under me, when I lived<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178006280011"></xptr> butler to a gentleman in Bloomsbury-square, I lived there seventeen years and an half; he always had a good character.</p>
               <p>His brother keeps the Kings-head in Bloomsbury? - No; he always called me brother; he having been brought up with my father and mother.</p>
               <p>Did you see him at your house on the 8th? - I did; very much in liquor, so bad that he desired to go and lie down on one of my beds, which he did an hour or an hour and an half; then I thought him something soberer, but not so sober as I could wish.</p>

               <p>Was any horse with him then? - Yes. Two I think.</p>
               <p>Was one of them a brown bay horse? - It was.</p>
               <p>Your house is not very far from the Museum? - No, not far.</p>
               <p>Out of sight of the Museum? - Yes; it is at the back of Lord Mansfield's house.</p>
               <p>Were the horses at the door with him? - Yes; he was riding them up and down and jockeying them about.</p>
               <p>What time of day was that? - I cannot say, I did not take notice.</p>
               <p>To Matthews. What time did you go with him? - About half after eleven.</p>
               <p>To Morgan. What time of day was he at your house? - Most part of the day; he came down when he had made the swap and said, he had done the worst day's work he had ever done in his life, for he had swapped a good horse for a broken-winded one.</p>
               <p>What time of day did he come to you with the two horses? - I cannot say, it was the fore part of the day; it must be before twelve o'clock; he came back about half an hour, or an hour after and said he had made a bad bargain.</p>
               <p>He wanted to exchange again? - So he told me when he came back, but the man would not; he sold that to an hackneyman then for two pounds, two shillings, and sixpence.</p>
               <p>Was he sober then? - No.</p>
               <p>What is he? - A breaker of colts and rough rider; he has broke colts for many gentlemen who have subscribed to him; he always bore an honest character.</p>
               <p>To Matthews. Did you look after him after you missed the horse? - Yes, for two hours; before I went back to my master's; I went all round Bloomsbury and down this street, where he says he was, but did not see any thing of him.</p>

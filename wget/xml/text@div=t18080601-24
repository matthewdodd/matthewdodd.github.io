               <p>Q. Are you a labouring man - A. No, I cannot labour, I have lost the use of my left arm; I let out lodgings. On the 26th of May, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I was in the house. I heard some small noise, and I went to the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your wife in the house at the time - A. Yes; about thirty yards from the door, I saw a man putting his shoes on.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner, did you see him. - A. Yes; I saw him putting his shoes on, he was sitting; after he had put his shoes on, he had got a basket, he put a green apron over it and tucked it all round to cover it; he pulled up his small clothes, and took this basket and walked away; I returned into the house, and shut the door. I turned my head and missed the carpet out of the little hall; I called to my wife to ask her about the carpet; she told me she knew nothing of it; I pursued the prisoner and took him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the prisoner before - A. I had seen him before; I hit the prisoner on the side of his head, and then I took hold of his collar and brought him back to my house with the property with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he carry the basket or you - A. He carried it himself; I took him to the beadle and delivered him and the basket and all.</p>
               <p>Q. You examined the basket did not you - A. Yes; the basket contained a carpet, shirt, stocking, one pair mine and two pair my wife's, and a tin ink stand; I knew them to be my property; there were some rags also.</p>
               <p>Q. You told me you heard a small noise - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you - A. I was in an adjoining room to where he took the things.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose the passage into the adjoining room is by the hall - A. Yes; the street door leads into the hall.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180806010021"></xptr>Q. How long before you heard the noise had you been in the hall - A. A few minutes before.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the carpet then in the hall - A. Yes, in a chair rolled up; the other things were in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q.I suppose you go from the hall into the kitchen - A.Yes. the kitchen door is always open.</p>
               <p>Q. What room was your wife in - A. She was up stairs in the garret, in bed.</p>
               <p>Q. When you was in the hall was the street door open or shut - A. Shut, I am pretty certain of that.</p>
               <p>Q. Being the street door, you generally keep it shut A. Always, except any person is in the hall or is coming in.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you pretty sure that no person had come in the hall sometime before you heard a noise - A. I am sure of that.</p>
               <p>Q. How does your street door fasten - A. With a spring lock.</p>
               <p>Q. How does it open on the outside - A. With a key; when we come in we shut it too, it locks, and when we want to come in we open it with a key.</p>
               <p>Q. A stranger then who had not the key must open it by force or with a false key - A. Yes; there is no latch at all; he must come in by a false key or by force.</p>

Yes, and a basket, I have had it in my care ever since; this basket was searched before he went to the watchhouse; Mr. Waring recognized his property; I searched him at the watchhouse, I found a number of pick lock keys in the prisoner's pocket; there is a turnscrew, phosphorus bottle, matches and every thing for house breaking; I found all these things in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. There is one key which I verily believe would open it, I did not try it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live in Canonbury-lane, in the parish of St. Mary, Islington. The prisoner was my cook I left home on the 12th of August, and went to church—I returned in the middle of the day—I went to church again in the evening, and when I returned, found the prisoner intoxicated in the fore-court—she was brought in and put to bed, and after counting my money in my box, I found seven sovereigns had been taken away—the box was still locked—I believe I had left my keys in my room, but I am not exactly sure—I sent for a constable—we went into the prisoner's room, and found six sovereigns and nine shillings and sixpence in her pocket—she was taken to the station-house—I found my keys hanging in a drawer in a chest in my own room.</p>

               <p>but the seven sovereigns were my own, and not connected with the school—I had counted my money on Saturday night, the last thing before I went to bed—it was in a common wooden box—the money taken was my own—there were forty-two sovereigns in the box; eighteen were in a purse, and there were six papers, each containing four sovereigns-five of the papers had been opened, and one sovereign extracted from each—it was not joint property—the prisoner was insensibly drunk.</p>

On the evening of the 17th of September, about half-past eight she would call the following evening if the housemaid would be at house—he ask me of the housemaid was at home, and while I went down stain to tell the housemaid, I heard the door <hi rend="italic">slam</hi>—I another lad ran up—when we got to the street door, Mr. Atkins came out into the hall to know what the noise was, and said there was a clock taken—I soon after missed a hat and umbrella—they were kept in a stand, right facing the parlour door—the clock was safe when I opened the door to the prisoner—nobody else had come in who could have taken it—it was Mrs. Atkins's cloak—she is in town now—I am sure the prisoner is the man who could—the umbrella belonged to John Clews, and the hat to Mr. Richard Goldham.</p>

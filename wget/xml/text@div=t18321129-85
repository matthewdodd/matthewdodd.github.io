On the 28th of November, between four and five o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came in, with another woman - the prisoner asked for some ribbon, and some were shown her; they bought two yards, and the prisoner paid for it: they then left the shop - I suspected, and brought them back - I saw this piece of ribbon fall from the prisoner, and I picked it up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Was your shop pretty full? A. Yes; there were others there; we do a good deal of business - I did not see her take this ribbon - when I brought her back she sat down in a chair, and I found the ribbon under the chair; I suppose it fell from her hand, which appeared to be under her apron - I did not see her hand; she might be half a yard from the counter - it could not have fallen from the counter, as there is a brass ledge, and the ribbon-drawers had been removed; I looked on the chair, and on the floor, before I brought her back.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Did she suggest, at the time, that it might have been bought in the shop? A. No; I was not aware that she had taken any thing - it was only on suspicion that I followed her.</p>

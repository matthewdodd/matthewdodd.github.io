               <p>Where were the other six? - I do not know; it was pretty nigh eleven, as bright a night as ever I saw, but I did not see any moon to my knowledge, but a very fine light night, they were with me four or five minutes, as near as I can recollect.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178209110071"></xptr>Prisoner Counsel. No moon that night? - I believe there was not.</p>
               <p>Believe, why do not you know? - I did not see; I have not the least doubt in the world but they are the men.</p>
               <p>How near was you to the man with the one eye? - Close to him.</p>
               <p>He let you look at him? - The man behaved very civil, I assure you, I received no damage.</p>
               <p>No, I do not believe you did; you went afterwards to the King's-head in St. Giles's? - Yes Sir.</p>
               <p>Who keeps that? - Mr. Reynolds.</p>
               <p>Did you sit down to drink at all? - Yes I did.</p>
               <p>Were not the prisoners sitting drinking in the house? - No Sir, upon my soul.</p>
               <p>Your soul is gone long ago; how long did they stay ? - As soon as ever I saw this Vercol, he put me all in a trouble, I went and told the constable of the night my story.</p>
               <p>Then these men and you never were drinking together in the least in the house? - No Sir, not at all.</p>
               <p>What box did you sit in? - They sit in the box facing me.</p>
               <p>Then you had a full view, and you told the story of being robbed? - No, I did not Sir, I said nothing at all about it.</p>
               <p>Then upon your oath you did not sit down in the box with these two men, and tell them the story of your robbery? - I told young Stevenson out of door, I did not tell him in the box.</p>
               <p>Did you tell him that these were the men? I told him that was the man, one of them.</p>
               <p>But you are as clear about one as the other ? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How came you not to tell them about Past? - I do not know whether Past was at Mr. Reynolds's that night; I did not trouble my head with any body but Vercol.</p>
               <p>Did not you take up this man in liquor there? - Mr. Reynolds came and said all out.</p>
               <p>Just now you said there was not a man there? - No, I said not a man drinking, I had some words with Mr. Reynolds.</p>
               <p>Did not the prisoners account before the justice for where they were all the day of the robbery? - I really cannot tell, I did not mind that over and above so much; I am very clear of the men, positive of the men, God forbid I should offer to hurt mankind for the sake of a half-penny or a farthing.</p>
               <p>During the time you drove for Mr. Davis how often was you robbed? - Never.</p>
               <p>Did not you tell Mr. Davis that you had been robbed of your fare frequently? - Never told him so in my life, so help me God, once, I vow to God I never did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Davis is here present? - I do not care.</p>

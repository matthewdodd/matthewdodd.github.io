            . I live at Poplar, and have dealt with Messrs. Wilson many years. The prisoner was eight years in my service, and was so on the 4th of August; I did not send him for this cloth, nor have I received it - he never fetched goods for me without my order; I have oc<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182609140173"></xptr>casionally sent him, as he lived near there - he told me he meant to pay me for the goods, and that he did it in a drunken frolick.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were no materials got and applied to your business without your order? A. Yes; I never allowed him to get goods on my account, except a shawl, which his wife had; I gave given him a written order for a parcel on my account - he paid me by instalments.</p>

            . I am a butcher, I live in Swallow street, Piccadilly; she stole a piece of mutton on the 10th of October, between six and seven in the evening; as she past the shop she took it up and put it under her arm; I ran after her, fetched her back, and took it from her. I called my master, he came in and sent her about her business; then she turned the corner into Glasshouse street and cut off a handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. That you have nothing to do with - how came you to prosecute her after your master told her to go about her business - A. After he found she stole the handkerchief then he prosecuted her; the mutton was worth about one and nine pence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went into this butcher' shop to buy a piece of meat, I smelled at it to see whether it was sweet; it was not sweet; he took the meat out of my hand and turned me out, and I jawed him; a gentleman and lady were in the shop; I do not think he would have done it else. I stood with my barrow at the corner of Glasshouse street; he was obliged to broil the meat to take it down to Marlborough street, because it was not sweet. I only took it up and smelled at it: he said go along, you Irish faggot.</p>

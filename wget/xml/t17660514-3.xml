On the 12th of April the prisoner came into my shop, between 3 and 4 in the afternoon, and asked to see some muslin. I and my wife were in the shop, my wife shewed her some. She did not agree with my wife. She came to me to see some long lawn. I was at another counter. She bought a yard and a quarter; I changed her half a guinea, and she paid for it. Then she said, let me look at that muslin again, I had rather be served by you than your wife. I shewed it her; she bid me measure it; she sat down by the side of the counter; while I was measuring it, she was fumbling about her stays; I saw her drag something from under the bundle that I was measuring; it put me all in a tremble. As she was pretty well dressed, I thought she was some tradesman's wife. I observed her hiding it under her stays. I measured it, and said, Pray madam do you sell muslin? said she, What is that to you, if I pay you for it. There was 18 yards and a quarter of it; she said, You will send it to the Bell in St. Martin's lane; I said I did not know it; she was going; I said, Madam, you must walk into my parlour, you have got something of my property about you, deliver it, and you shall go about your business. She would not deliver it. There was a woman that keeps a fish-stall, went for a constable; the constable said, Madam, you had better be searched; she said she would not; as she advanced towards him, she dropped the piece of muslin; my servant took it up, it had been near her body, it was quite warm (produced in court, and deposed to)</p>
               <p>Q Was this any part of that which you sold her?</p>
               <p>Fitzgerald. No, it was not; it was quite a different sort: this is called book muslin.</p>

I asked the prisoner if I should search her; she said I should not, she would not be searched without a constable, but pulled up the bottom part of her stays, and said, Have I any thing or no? After the constable came, I picked up this piece of muslin under her, it was quite warm.</p>

               <p>I went into this shop, and wanted some lawn; I bought as much as came to 4 s. 6 d. I took out three guineas and an half from my pocket; there were other people looking at muslin; I went and put my hand under it, and asked what it was a yard. He said six shillings; and asked me if I chose any, I said no, not at present; he said I had something under my stays; I said I had not, and shewed him I had not; he told me to go about my business; I said I would not till a constable came; they took me to the Justice, and searched me there, and I had nothing upon me.</p>

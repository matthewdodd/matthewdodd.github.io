It appeared that the Prisoner was deliver'd on the 4th of November, and the next Day took a Lodging at one Mrs. Linegar's, and after she had been there two or three Days her Landlady smelt an unusual Stink in the Room, and perceiv'd it to come from the Prisoner's Trunk, whereupon she sent for a Constable and had it open'd before him, where they found the Child ty'd up in a Cloth by the four Corners, which they believ'd to be full grown; that when the Cloth was unty'd its Limbs fell at their Length, and were very Limber. The Prisoner in her Defence said that the Child was Still-Born; and called the following Evidence to prove it, and her having made Provision for it. Her first Evidence deposed that the Prisoner sent for her, and told her that she was in Labour; and bid her take the Key of her Trunk to fetch the Child's Linnen, that when she return'd the Child was born, and she turning up the bed clothes perceived it to be a wrong Birth, and still Born. Another deposed that she was with her about a Fortnight before, owned she was with Child, had made some Preparation, and would make more, and take a Lodging (being then at Service) and desired that she would come to her Labour when sent for; that she was sent for and found her out, but it was over before she came, and the Prisoner told her the Child was still born; that she saw the Child's Linnen: Another Evidence deposed that she complained she was not well all Day, went to Bed in the Evening, and desired her to send for her Sister, which she did, and when her Sister came, this Evidence went to Bed and Saw Linnen the next Day. There appeared no Marks of Violence upon the Child the Jury <rs id="t17191204-9-verdict46" type="verdictDescription">

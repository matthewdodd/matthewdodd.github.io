                  </hi>. I am a silk-manufacturer, of Fort-street, Spitalfields. I have three partners—the prisoner was in our employ, attending generally on the duties in the warehouse, and partly serving customers—on 29th Sept. I went into the velvet-room, and a piece of velvet was found by Hallington, in my presence, in a box, under a number of empty boxes—I had asked the prisoner, about two minutes before, if there was any velvet in any of these boxes—he said there was not; they were all empty—he then withdrew—I called the prisoner into the room, pointed to the velvet, and asked what that was—he said, "It is some of my doings"—I asked what he meant—he said lie had sent some of it away to Derby; he believed seven yards, or seven yards and a half—the piece of velvet ought to have been down-stairs, in the selling warehouse—there was a ticket and private mark on it—the piece was thirty-two yards and three-quarters long; it was marked to sell at 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., a yard—I examined my stock, and found this piece was missing from the place where it ought to be—I did not give the prisoner into custody then—on the Monday following he said he wished to have an interview with me, and he had made a mistake in stating the length of the velvet he had taken: it was only five yards, and not seven and a half—I had examined the piece of velvet on the Monday, and found ten yards and a quarter were gone, and when the</p>

               <p>prisoner said he had only taken five yards I told him it was ten yards and a quarter short, and I asked him whether he had not taken it at twice—I cannot say that he said he had, but he did not deny it—the value of the whole piece of velvet was about 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—he had no right to send any of it away without asking my leave.</p>

HUDDLESTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long had he been in your service? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Ten or eleven years—he had never given us a bond—he married the niece of a foreman in our employ—he has been in the habit of getting goods out of our warehouse—the proper course would be to ask me before he took them—two or three years ago I found he had charged himself with articles that he had not spoken about, and I found it necessary to put a stop to it, and gave express orders that nothing should be taken without my permission—he owed me about 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for goods he had had, which he was paying off at this time—I never knew him to cut off a portion of velvet, and not ask me, but once, which is about two years ago, and in one instance, which I have found out since—he charged himself with it in the books, but it was when the piece was brought down-stairs to show some customers, he asked me if he might have three yards of it, and I have since found there is four yards and a half deficient—his wife is a dressmaker—I found this out on a Saturday; I did not give him into custody then—he went home on Saturday as usual—he did not come on the Monday till the evening, when he came with his brother; he then went down to Derby—I gave him into custody about a month afterwards—I speak as nearly as I can to the words of the conversation; I will not pledge myself to everything—there was other velvet in that room, but not of that description—I did not speak of any particular velvet; I pointed to these sixty or eighty empty boxes—velvets are kept in that room that are not wanted for sale—the velvet is here—the number of yards is marked on the ticket, thirty-two and three-quarters; that is written by Godfrey, our clerk—I ascertained the deficiency by measuring what remains, and deducting that from the number of yards on the ticket—the number of the piece is 42,333, and by that I was able to refer to the book, and ascertain the description.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Mr. Robinson's errand-boy. I know the room where the empty boxes are kept—about a month before I was in that room with Mr. Robinson, I was there with the prisoner, looking for a box that Mr. Robinson wanted—I saw a piece of black velvet in a box, under some other boxes—I took the lid off, and showed it to him—I told him where I had found it—he said, "Give that to me," and put it into a box, and put the box down by the side of the fire-place, in a corner, and said, "I will see to that"—he put four empty boxes on the top of it, and told me to put the rest on the top of it, and pack them up in the corner, which I did—I told a person in Mr. Robinson's employ, the day afterwards—I went with Mr. Robinson into the room on a Saturday, and found one piece of velvet.</p>

               <p>on Saturday, 19th July, soon after 12, I was walking along the Water<lb></lb>loo-road—when I got to the top of Herbert's buildings, I made a stop—there was a man and woman quarrelling—as soon as I stopped the prisoner came from behind me and took my watch out of my pocket—I caught hold of the chain and it broke—two more men then came up and wanted to abstract it from my fingers, and two others came and threw themselves over my arms—I was overpowered, and all my senses were clean taken away—they tried to pull the ring off my finger, but could not—the watch was taken, with the swivel, but not the chain—I had seen the watch five minutes before.</p>

I am a chairmaker—I did live in Union-street., South<lb></lb>wark—I now live and work at North Woolwich—on Saturday night, 19th July, soon after 12, I was passing along the Waterloo-road, near Herbert's-buildings, and saw the prisoner quarrelling with a woman—I and a friend stood listening—as soon as the prosecutor came up, they left off quarrelling and surrounded him, about five or six besides the prisoner—they caught hold of him and knocked him about, and knocked him down—I called out to them, "Let the man alone"—the prisoner said, "You b—, we will serve you the same way, if you don't stand still—two policemen came up, and they all ran away—I gave them a description of the prisoner—I know him by seeing him about for three or four years—I know his voice, and am sure he is the man.</p>

On the night of 19th July, about ten minutes or a quarter past 12, I was near Herbert's-buildings—I saw a large crowd—the prosecutor had gone to the station when I came up—Bevan gave me some information, and a description of a person, in con<lb></lb>sequence of which I apprehended the prisoner on the night of the 25th—I told him he was charged with being concerned in the robbery of a watch—he said, "Why did not you take me before this?"—I told him I was not certainly informed, for I had another prisoner in for it, who got three years to-day—I had seen the prisoner on the evening in question, about four or five minutes previous to the robbery, about 100 or 150 yards from where it took place, and spoke to him and told him to go home.</p>

On the 18th of May, in consequence of information, I went to French Horn-court, Beech-street, Barbican, to a private house; and in a room there I found sixty-seven pieces of print - I cannot say in which room they were, but I found the prisoner close to the bedside, with the prints spread out on the bed - I secured him - he had a plaister on his lip, which the witness Bignall had described to me. I said I wanted him - he said nothing. I have ten pieces of the cotton here - the Magistrate said I might give up the rest.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Bailey, who is a carrier. On Tuesday morning, the 18th of May, my cart stood in Bread-street. The prisoner came and asked if I belonged to it - I said Yes - he said bring it to Pattison and Dudley's. I followed him to Milk-street, and saw him with a bale of goods - he said,</p>
               <p>"Here, my man, I have got the bale ready for you;" he was at the corner of Milk-street; he told me to turn about; we got a person to help us with the bale into the cart; he rode in the cart, and wanted me to go in great haste to Barbican; and when I got to the end of Barbican I said,</p>
               <p>"Where is the place;" he said,</p>
               <p>"Go farther, and I will shew you." I drove to French Horn-alley; he told me to drive up the gateway, which I did; he said,</p>
               <p>"Set the bale down here, and I will not detain you any longer;" he went into the house, and fetched me 3 s. 4 d. for the cartage, and I went away, leaving the bale in the court. A man came out of house, and I saw them rolling the bale over, but did not see it taken into the house. When I got to the cart-stand, an officer was making inquiry - I told him where I took it to, and I went to Guildhall on the same day, and again next day. The prisoner had a cut lip, and a black plaister on it, at the time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. You said before that I stood with the bale close to a hairdresser's shop - how could that be, if I fetched the cart - A. You ran up the street before me, and when I came up you stood against the bale at the end of Milk-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the officer offer you 9 l. to come and swear against me. A. No, he offered me nothing - he said he would lock me up with you. I did not notice what mark was on the bale.</p>

I examined the goods at Guildhall - every piece has our private mark, which is put on by my partner, when he purchases them at Manchester - the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182406030027"></xptr>goods agree with the invoice. I can swear to the private mark, and it corresponds with the price charged for the goods.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was in Cheapside, and accidentally met a stranger, who told me to get him a cart. I was near Milk-street. He said if I went half-way down Bread-street I should get one. I went, and employed this man; and the person said, if I would take it to his lodging he would be there and direct me what to do with it. On arriving he was waiting for me - he took off the wrapper, and went away with it - he told me to wait till he returned, and in the mean time the officer came up and took me. How it came from the prosecutor's house I don't know.</p>

About the beginning of June the prisoners came into the shop, and wished to look at a silver watch at eight or ten guineas - they said they would point out one in the window, which they wished to see; they both spoke: one of them went out, and pointed to a watch: I said the price was twelve guineas, which they objected to, and wished to see some others. I shewed them a hunter, which they objected to. I rang the bell for Mr. Viner, who was at ten - he came out, and among others shewed them the twelve guinea watch, and agreed to let them have it for less, which they seemed satisfied with, and said they wanted it for a lame brother, who was going to India; they said they liked it, and as soon as they had consulted with their brother they would return and settle for it. Mr. Viner went into the parlour, and in about a quarter of an hour he returned to the shop, and sat down to work; and in a quarter of an hour after that he asked if I had moved a gold watch off the glass-case on the counter - I had not noticed one there myself: we looked about, but could not find it, and suspected the prisoners; they did not return to the shop; they were not there above ten minutes. Mr. Viner was about five minutes with them. Nobody came into the shop after they left.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Has your master any partner - A. Yes, I believe he has, but I do not know whether he has anything to do with the shop in Bond-street; but is in partnership with him at another shop in Sweetings-alley. I am the only shopman. They came between six and seven o'clock: they both spoke, and I think both went out to the window. I am positive they are the men. I found them in custody five or six weeks after.</p>
               <p>MR. VINER corroborated the statement of the last witness; but it appeared that the property stolen was only part of a watch, being without dial or hands, and otherwise imperfect.</p>

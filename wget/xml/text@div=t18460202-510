                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Graham, and live in George-street, Blackfriars. On the afternoon of the 21st Jan. I went to Wapping-wall, to receive 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I received it, and it being a very wet day as I came back I went into a public-house and had some warm beer—I held the money in my hand—it was a sovereign and other money—I saw the prisoner in the public-house—she had some of the beer with me, and I treated her to some gin—I went with her to another public-house—she then aaked if I would go and take a cup of tea with her—I am not acquainted with that part—she took me up a street which I did not like the appearance of—she took the money out of my hand—I put the sovereign in my mouth for safety, when she tried to get the rest of the money—she took the rest out of my hand—I cannot say what became of the sovereign—I lost it in the scuffle—I called out for a policeman—I do not know whether I lost it then—I had three or four half-crowns and some shillings in my hand, which she took—I am sure she is the woman.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Were you not tipsy? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not say I was sober; Mr. Ballantine asked me whether I was sober enough to know what money I had in my hand; I did not say I was; I said I knew what I was about; the house I went into was the Bell; I had a young female with me, but she parted with me and went to Shadwell; she was not with me when I lost my money, nor was any one but you; I did not pay for a pot of ale and dance up and down the room till the landlord put me out; I was not in company with any man, nor with two girls; I had never seen you before; I did not give you in charge for robbing me of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I said I had lost my money; there was not a sovereign found in my stocking at the station—the policeman did not place two on the mantle-piece, nor did I take one and place it in my stocking and say it was mine, nor did the policeman say it was his; the little girl did not state at the station that there was a man and another female in my company; I was locked up at the station; Mr. Ballantine said I must appear there at six o'clock in the morning, and I stopped there; I was "sensible tipsy;" I did not ask you in the morning what I was there for, nor what you were there</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable K</hi> 99.) Between four and five in the afternoon of the 21st Jan. I was called to St. George's-court, Bluegate-fields—I found the prosecutrix there crying—she was not sober, but was sober enough to know what she was about—in consequence of what she told me, I went in search of the prisoner—I found her in Back-road, St. George's, which was about 300 yards off, with two females and a man, all drunk—I should say she knew what she was about—I told her what I wanted her for—she said she had had some gin with the woman, but knew nothing about the money—I took her to the prosecutrix—as we went along I saw her put her hand in her pocket, take something out, and pass it towards some females at the corner of the court—I did not see what it was—I took hold of her hand, and found in it three half-crowns, two shillings, and five pence halfpenny—I asked how she came by it—she said she had pawned a sailor's coat.</p>

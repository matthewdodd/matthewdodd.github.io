                  </hi>. I am an accountant at 57, Coleman-street, City—I have been investigating the accounts of the Commercial Dock Company—I went down to the Dock-office to make some inquiry about the receipt of the rent in respect of premises occupied by the last witness, and I had an inter<lb></lb>view with the prisoner—I spoke to him of the non-entry in the ledger of the Company—I told him there appeared to be five years' rent not received by the Company in respect of those premises, and asked him for an explanation—he said he had been in the habit of receiving the rent from Mr. Goodhew—I asked him if there was a rent-book in which the entries ought to have been made; he said, "Yes,"and he produced it—I produce the book now—in this book I find three years' rent accounted for as paid over by the prisoner to Mr. Smithers—I did not find the rent for December, 1856, or the following year entered in this book at all—as near as I can recollect, I asked if the rent had been received for the years 1856 and 1857, and to the best of my knowledge he said, "Yes, I have received those two years' rents, but owing to something to be settled about the income-tax I have not accounted for</p>

               <p>them, but the amounts are in my desk"—I am uot quite clear what he said about income-tax, but there was something to be settled about income-tax—Idon't think it was "dispute"—I was present during the whole of that day—at a subsequent period of the day, Mr. Cox having accounted in the interim for the balance of his cash-book, he was asked for these rents, when I understood him to say he had not got the money.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Who was present at the interview with the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Mr. Carter, one of the directors of the Company: there were two other directors present, Mr. Brandt and Mr. Meux—the ledger I alluded to was kept by Mr. Smithers, who is at present in Milbank-prison—when I asked the prisoner, in the presence of the directors, who received the rents from Mr. Goodhew, he hesitated, and said he had been in the habit of receiving them himself—in the most direct manner he gave every information I desired—when I asked for the rent-book he went and got it immediately—I then discovered that there had been three years' reat paid over to Mr. Smithers; the entries are initialed by him, that satisfied me at the moment that he had received them, and my impression has been since confirmed by seeing Mr. Smithers last Saturday at Milbank, who stated the fact amongst other matters—the prisoner Cox, at the interview I had with him, produced this book now in court, for the purpose of showing what rents he had received, and what he had handed over to Mr. Smithers—it was his duty to hand them over to him, as the secretary, who was the responsible person—in the course of his duty the prisoner received at all events moneys to the amount of 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, on behalf of the Company—during our con<lb></lb>versation, I think the prisoner said he had often paid rent over to Mr. Smithers without deducting the income tax—I did not understand him that in doing so he left the matter about the income-tax to be settled—he handed over so much without deducting the income-tax, and in order to set it right he would charge his petty cash with having paid the income-tax—he did not declare that he had never retained any of the money for his own use, he admitted that he had—when a man tells me he has not accounted for particular sums of money he has received, I conclude that he did not tell me he had never been guilty of the slightest dishonesty in regard to the Company—he did not protest that he had never kept back the money for his own uses—I made a memorandum of the conversation I had with him when he said he had the money in his desk—he conveyed to my mind that though he had not accounted for those sums of money, he still had got them in his desk to account for—I do not know whether on that occasion he said that during the many years he had been in the service of the Company, it was impossible for any one to perform the various and complicated duties he had to perform without assistance—I have heard he has said so—I have heard him complain that he was overpressed with his duties—I have understood he had worked hard at the accounts till very late at night—some men do their work much quicker than others—he did state something to the effect that the non-entry of some of the items I pointed out to him was through inadvertence in consequence of the pressure of business.</p>

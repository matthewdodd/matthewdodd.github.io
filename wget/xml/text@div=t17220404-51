That he had not gone twenty Yards before he mist the Wig, which he saw in the Box a little before he met the prisoner. The Constable depos'd, that Lee came to him a little in drink, and said, for God's sake go with me, for I've been rob'd of a Wig. Do you know who took it, says he: Yes, says Lee, I know him very well. They then went into Mr. Fen's, in Coleston Court, in Drury lane where they saw the prisoner sitting. Lee spoke to him, and drank with him, but told the Constable he could not see the Thief in that House, and therefore desired him to go with him to another. One Evidence depos'd, that Lee said he lost the Wig out of his Master's Shop. and another depos'd, that he said he lost it in Princes Street. Mrs. Johnson depos'd, that Lee, (her Husband's <rs id="t17220404-51-viclabel271" type="occupation">Apprentice</rs>

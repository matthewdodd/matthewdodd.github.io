               <p>I live in Baker's Row, Whitechapel, I was going over to Mr. Robertson's facing my house, I was upon my own steps about half past five o'clock in the evening, and the prisoner came up to me and laid hold of the coat, I was not willing to give it up, and he pulled it so hard that I slipped down the steps; it was a child's great coat, belonging to Mr. Robertson, the publican, I am sure the prisoner is the person.</p>
               <p>Court. Did the prisoner forcibly take it from you? - Yes, he said nothing to me, and after he had got the coat, he took his hat off his head and violently threw it at me; I picked up the hat and carried it into Mr. Robertson's house, and told him I was robbed, he pursued the prisoner, who ran away with the coat.</p>

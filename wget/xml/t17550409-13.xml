            . I am a pawnbroker; the prisoner brought this saw to me to pawn on the 1st of March, about eight o'clock in the morning; I stopped the saw, and the prosecutor came to inquire for it the same day, and I delivered it. Two days after, the prosecutor and others brought the prisoner to me to see if I knew him, I said he was the man that brought it. I suspected he was no carpenter by his dress.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. How came you to suspect the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. There were others had lost their saws, they seeing this prisoner lobbing about, secured him, and I took him to the pawnbroker's house, and he said that was the man that brought it to him.</p>

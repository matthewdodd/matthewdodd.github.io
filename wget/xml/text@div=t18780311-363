I live at 15, New Martin Street, Whitechapel—I am a seaman—on Saturday, 16th February, I was near Neptune Street—I was the worse for liquor—when in Neptune Street with a few friends three chaps pounced on me, knocked me down and took my money from my left waistcoat pocket—I had between 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. which I saw safe before this occurrence—I did not know what condition I was in till I got into the fresh air—I am sure I had my money then.</p>

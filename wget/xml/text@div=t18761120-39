I live at 2, Mar Buildings, Drury Lane, and am a lodging-house keeper—on Wednesday night, 25th October, the prisoner came to my place and inquired for a room, accompanied by Annie Thompson, who he said was his wife—I told he could not have a bed there, but I could put him in another house, No. 6, Parker Street, and sent Cochran, the deputy, there with him—about half an hour afterwards, in consequence of informa<lb></lb>tion, I went to No. 6, Parker Street, and found the second floor back room full of smoke; I could not see the blaze on account of the smoke—I went in twice and was nearly suffocated with the smoke; I had to go in on my hands and knees at last—I found the bedding on the floor, the sheets were burning; the mattrass was on the bedstead, that was blazing, and the bed<lb></lb>stead was blazing—I sent for the police, and the fire was extinguished—the prisoner was not there, he had gone—a number of persons were sleeping in the house, two families and <hi rend="italic">two</hi> sisters—there are four rooms in the house—the prisoner was not smoking.</p>

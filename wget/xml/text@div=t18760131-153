                  </hi>. I live at 56, Green Street, Grosvenor Square, when in town—in May last I left town and went to Maidenhead—before leav<lb></lb>ing I locked up various articles of china in my dining-room and took the key with me—on making occasional visits to town from May up to the end of September I placed other articles in the dining-room and again took the key with me—I left the prisoner Norah Lynn in charge of the house; she was the sole person in the house in my employ—I returned to town for the winter on 18th October—on going into the dining-room I missed a great number of articles that I had placed there—in consequence of that my suspicions were aroused—I received information on the 19th and went to Mr. Wertheimer's in New Bond Street, a well-known dealer in china—I had an interview with him between 4 and 5 o'clock in the afternoon, in con<lb></lb>sequence of which I went on to the shop of the prisoner Jewell, 496, Oxford Street—I there saw a shopman who I had never seen before to my know<lb></lb>ledge</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187601310009"></xptr>
               <p>and I don't think he knew me—I asked him if he had got any good china for sale—he said "Would you buy a very fine Bristol cup and saucer," which he produced—I said "This is very fine; what is the price of it"—he said "100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said that was rather a high price—he said that was the usual price that was given for them, and he produced a book in which there was an entry opposite the words "Bristol cup and saucer" of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 100 guineas—I had very little doubt that it was my Bristol cup and saucer—there are one or two others in existence—there are five in existence—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the cup and saucer—I gave 78<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it at Christie and Mason's sale on 10th May last year—I then said to the shopman "Have you got anything else in Bristol"—he went to the same safe, which he unlocked, and produced these four Bristol figures—he said the price of them was 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the two Cupids and 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the other pair of figures with musical instruments—I said "They are very fine; where is Mr. Jewell"—he said that he had gone out, but he would be back in a few minutes—I at once-identified these as my property—I then walked round the shop and saw a Bow figure in a cupboard and two blue oriental plates on a side table—1 at once knew them to be mine—I then went away and went to the police-station to engage the services of Marshall, the detective—I returned to Jewell's shop in about half an hour, leaving Marshall outside in the cab—I went into the shop and was met at the door by Jewell—I said "Mr. Jewell, you have got a very fine Bristol cup and saucer; would you let me see it?"—he replied "I cannot; it is sold"—I said "Indeed, that is curious, because I saw it only half an hour ago; it was offered to me for sale—would you let me see the four Bristol figures?"—he said "I can't show you those either, they are all sold," and he then pointed to a gentleman at the end of the shop and said "This is the purchaser, Mr. Mendoza;" and Mr. Mendoza said "Yes; I have bought the lot"—I said to Mr. Mendoza "What did you give for the lot?" he said "I bought them in a lot for 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said "Would you let me see them again"—he said "I cannot, as they are gone away; I am going to submit them to a gentleman in Liverpool"—I asked Jewell if he thought Mendoza would resell them to me at a profit—Mendoza replied that he could not sell them to me as he had to submit them to Mr. Matheson—I believe he is a collector in Liverpool and an M.P.—I asked Jewell what he had given for the cup and saucer and where he had got it from—he said he had bought it from a man in the street, who went about as a traveller, and that he had only given 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it as he did not know it was Bristol—I then looked round the shop to see if there was anything else of my property and I saw the two blue plates which I said I would purchase, and the Bow figure which I also agreed to purchase—the price named was 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the Bow figure and 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the plates—I said I should like to see the Bristol cup and saucer and the four figures; Mendoza said "I am not going to show them to you at this time of night, I will show them to you to<lb></lb>morrow"—I had the articles I purchased for 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. put in paper, and they were carried to the cab door by Jewell—when there I said "Mr. Jewell' I am very sorry to have to inform you that the Bristol cup and saucer and the four figures as well as these plates and figure that you have put in paper, have been stolen from me"—he replied "I was not aware they were stolen"—I asked who he got them from—he said "From a man in the streets"—I asked if he had had anything else from the same man—he re<lb></lb>plied "I had a lot, of rubbish from him the other day which I don't know if</p>

               <p>it belongs to you"—I said I should like to see it—he then lighted up the back part of the shop, and took me to a small table on which I saw about 20 articles of small value, all of which I recognised as my property with the ex<lb></lb>ception of four small pieces of china at the corners—I then said to Jewell "I must call some one in to identify these articles "and I called in Marshall—I then made a list of the articles on the table belonging to me, and gave Jewell notice not to part with them or with the Bristol cup and saucer, and the four Bristol figures, and I then again asked him the name of the man he had brought them from—he said he did not recollect, or he did not know—I then asked him to produce his day book—he produced it rather unwillingly; he did not produce it at first, he did afterwards—he said "I don't know that I am obliged to show it to you"—he said to the shopman "Here, can't you find that card that the man left," and then he said "I think it was Clark, or something, or some name like that"—Marshall had told him when he came in, that he was a detective officer, and I think he asked him one or two questions, he asked him where he got the china from—he said he bought them from a man who came in as a traveller, but he did not re<lb></lb>member his name—this is the book he subsequently produced. <hi rend="italic">The follow<lb></lb>ing entries were read from the day book</hi>—"24th September, 1875, Bristol group, 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; Chelsea figures, 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1st October, Clark, china, 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; Mirror, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4th October, total 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5th October, Clark, china, 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6th October, Clark, china, 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11th October, Clark, china, 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12th October, Clark, china, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., making a total of 92<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said "Can't you find the card "the shopman said—"I can't find it, but I will have it for you to-morrow morning if I have to sit up all night"—before I left I said "Mr. Jewell I give you notice not to part with any of these things on the table or with any of the things I have seen to-day belonging to me"—he said he would not—I said to Mendoza "Cannot you show them to me to night" he said "They are at my house, and I am not going to be disturbed at this time of night, if you will come to-morrow morning I will show you what I bought"—I then left—next morning the 20th, about 10.45 I went again to Jewell's shop in company with detective serjeant Butcher—I saw Jewell and Mendoza there—I said to Jewell "Have you found the card "he said "I have" and produced it—this is it. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Alfred Clark purchaser of ladies' and gentlemen's, and children's wardrobes, 76, Crawford Street, Marylebone. Every description of carpets bought, boots, shoes, &amp;c. Ladies attended at their own residence.") He said "This is the card that I promised to find for you"—I then said to Mendoza "I should like to come and see the Bristol cup and saucer, and the four Bristol figures that you promised to show me"—Mr. Jewell was there—Mendoza said "Well the fact is I have been talking to my lawyer, and under his advice I don't mean to show them to you"—that was the gist of what he said—Butcher said that he was a detective officer, and he had better be careful, and he said "Won't you take me round to your house to show me the things"—he said "No, not if you wait for a week"—Butcher then said "Well, Mr. Mendoza, I know your address, and I shall go round to it myself"—upon that he said "Well, if you are determined to go I shall go with you"—we then all three, Butcher, Mendoza and I, went to Mendoza's house, leaving Jewell in the shop—Mendoza's house was 27, Bloomsbury Square, about 200 or 300 yards off, we were shown up to a room on the first floor—it was a sort of picture shop—we remained there about a quarter of an hour—Mendoza left us when he took us into the room, and returned in about a quarter of an hour</p>

               <p>bringing the Bristol cup and saucer—we then returned with it to Jewell's shop—I think Mendoza went in first, and he and Jewell talked privately to<lb></lb>gether, they merely whispered together—Jewell then went to a safe and pro<lb></lb>duced the small pair of Bristol figures, the same I had first seen—I said "These are my property, but I want to see the large pair of Cupids"—Jewell said "I can't show them to you, as they are not here"—I asked him where they were—he said "They will be back by-and-bye"—I said "Who has got them?"—he said "Well, they are out on approbation"—I said "Did not I tell you last night that you were not to part with them; who has got them on approbation?"—he said he did not know the man's name or address—I then said "Do you mean to tell me that you sent out figures worth 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with a man whose name and address you don't even know"—I think Butcher said so too—he then said "Well, I think the man's name is George, but I don't know where he lives"—I said "Well, I shall go to George and see if I can see them"—George bad showed me that same pair of figures some days before and had left his card with me, I did not know him before he called at my house; that was before I knew of the robbery—I did go to George's, 124, Albany Street, Regent's Park—I did not see him or the figures, I came back in about half an hour and I then saw the two Cupids on the table—I said "Those are my property, what I wanted to see"—I said I had been to George's and I had not seen them—that was practically the end of the matter on that day—I knew Jewell before this, I had been in his shop before—I had not had any dealings with him—to the best of my belief he was at Christie's sale when I purchased the cup and saucer; there was a good deal of competition for it, it was handed round, I bid for it myself and it was knocked down tome—after the warrant had been granted I went with Butcher to Jewell's premises—I was first of all shown round by the shopman—I had previously received this letter. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Oct. 20, 1875. Dear Sir,—I have induced Mr. Mendoza to resell to me the goods I sold him, which are now on my premises, and which you can inspect in order to see if they are any portion of the goods you state have been stolen from you. Yours, &amp;c, David Jewell.") Jewell was not there when I went with Butcher, he came in afterwards—I went round and found a large number of articles belonging to me placed on a table at the back of the shop—I made a list of them at the time and have it here—I had not seen any of those articles on my previous visits to Jewell's—I put the prices against the pieces, they are as near as I can say the actual amount paid for them; the total amount is 472<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that is without the Bristol cup and saucer and the four figures, the Bow figure and the plates—I paid 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the pair of Cupids and 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or ten guineas for the other pair of Bristol figures—for the Bow figure with another I paid 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the plates, and 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I think, for the group sold to Mr. Wertheimer—the total value of all the articles found at Jewell's was 711<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Jewell came in during the time I was going round the pre<lb></lb>mises, and I said to him "These are all my property, and they have been stolen from me"—he said "I have induced Mr. Mendoza to re-sell these to me"—he was then referring to the things on the table as well as the Bristol cup and saucer and the four figures—I think that was all he said—he was then taken into custody—I first went to Clark's premises on Wednesday, 20th, in company with Butcher, about 5 or 6 o'clock in the evening—I saw Clark there; before speaking to him I saw some carpets in the shop—it is a small shop in Crawford Street with second-hand clothes hanging outside—to some extent it corresponded with the address on the card, it was the</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. I have been for about five years a collector of old china—I have made it a complete study—I think I can tell pretty nearly the intrinsic value of old china almost the moment I see it—I have studied Continental and Oriental china as well as English—I think that information is confined to a few—I think it requires a certain amount of study—I don't think it quite approaches to a fine art; it is akin to the study of pictures—I have not indulged in the study of autographs—it sometimes happens that china of this kind is bought at an extremely low price and sold again at a very high price, but that is uncommon; important and well-known pieces vary very little in price—the Bristol cup is not the article that I set most value upon, I set considerable value upon it—the two Cupids are in reality Plymouth china, but it is very much the same as Bristol; the other pair is also Plymouth; they are known as Bristol—the cup and saucer was not originally sold for a mere trifle, it was purchased by a well-known connoisseur, and the history of it is well known; the ser<lb></lb>vice was purchased by a Mr. Walker, of Bath, a well-known collector, some seven or eight years ago; he sold the complete tea service by public auc<lb></lb>tion, and various persons who are well known purchased several articles—Mr. Walker purchased it from abroad, I don't know the exact sum he gave for it; I should think more than 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a cup—I have known a Bristol cup and saucer to be sold for 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I have seen them sold at public auction at Christies for 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. during the last two years; not similar to this; I have never known one of these sold for anything like that price; there is a coat-of-arms on them with an inscription by which they are well distinguished; that is on this cup and saucer, and they are known among collectors by the paste, by the material they are made of—my cup would be known to be Bristol by the paste, by the general appearance of it; there are five of these chocolate cups and saucers in existence, and there are five or six tea cups and saucers; these were originally made for chocolate—there was a teapot, cream ewer, and sugar basin which the late Mr. Callender possessed; he was a collector—I have purchased china at a very small price which is worth a good deal more now than what I gave for it—I purchased a group in Italy, for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which I value at 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have never purchased any<lb></lb>thing at 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that I value at 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I never had such luck; if I had I should not object, if I was convinced it was honestly come by—I describe this as a Bristol cup and saucer which is extremely rare, from the fact that the manufacture of Bristol china lasted only a few years, and the history of it is well known—the coat-of-arms is the coat-of-anns of the celebrated Edmund Burke, and it was presented to him by Mr. Champion, the master of the works at Bristol, and there is an inscription to that effect; it was manufactured and painted at Bristol—I have known of several sales of old china at Wilkinson's, Sotheby's, and Christie's during many years—I have not known of a tea service sold for 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and afterwards fetching 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I remember Mr. Lizardi's sale being advertised—I never heard of vases which he bought for 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. selling for 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not know of four cups</p>

               <p>bought for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and selling for 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not know of Mr. Werthiemer's buy. ing silver vases and figures for 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and selling them for 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or of a china service purchased for 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and selling for 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I know Captain Lee as a collector—I do not know of five plates that he used for dog's drinking troughs which he sold for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. fetching 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. immediately afterwards—I have not known Chelsea vases bought for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and selling for 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I have known them bought for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and sold for 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have been in the habit of going about looking after old china at sales and curiosity shops to pick up a, good bargain at the lowest price—to the best of my belief I saw Mr. Jewell on one occasion at the sale where I purchased the cup and saucer it was a three days' sale—I saw him there the day the cup was sold—to the best of my belief he has returned to me the whole of the china that he received—the first time I went to his shop I saw the shopman, that is the gentleman (Mr. Jones), and when I came in half an hour afterwards I saw Mr. Jewell—he said he had bought a lot of rubbish of Clark when I told him that the Bristol cup and saucer and the figures were stolen from me, that was on the 19th instant—I think I stated before the Magistrate that he said he had bought a lot of rubbish, I am not quite sure, it is so long ago—he said "I have bought a lot of things not worth much," or "A lot of rubbish"—it may not have been those exact words, it was "A lot of things that are worthless" or "A lot of small value," or something of that sort—the ex<lb></lb>pression he used was that he bought them out of the street or from the street; that the man brought them in to him from the street—I under<lb></lb>stood his meaning to be that he had come in from the street casually and sold them to him—I did not see Mr. Mendoza in the shop when I first saw Mr. Jones—when I came back he was there and Mr. Jewell referred me to him as the purchaser of the china—I don't remember his saying that he should have much pleasure in showing them to me; he said he would show them to me—I am quite sure that the Shopman produced the Bristol figures out of a safe—I am quite sure they were not exposed for sale; they were not where I could see them—he produced them from under the desk where the safe was—I saw the safe afterwards in the same place where he brought them from—it was a desk about the middle of the shop, at the end of the first part of the china shop—it is not a regular counter, it is a desk where accounts are kept; it is a kind of double shop; there was a good deal of valuable property in the shop—I should think 7,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 8,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth—the cup and saucer were produced out of the safe—I did not know Mr. Jones—I don't know whether he knew me, I don't think he did—I did not give him my name—I never bought anything of him—I had been to Jewell's shop once or twice before without purchasing—my motive in purchasing the Bow figure and the two plates was to take them away and to be able to swear that they were my property, and also to ascertain if they were ex<lb></lb>posed for sale—the Bow figure was in a cupboard, the two plates were on a side table—the cupboard had a glass front to it; it could be seen if you looked into it, without unlocking it—there were several other things with it; it was a small cabinet—I did not hint to Mr. Jones the first time I saw him that the cup was stolen—I was not at first quite sure that the cup and saucer were mine—there are others in existence, but very few—there was very strong evidence to my mind that they belonged to me, but I was not then aware that I had had one stolen from me—I was not quite sure till I saw the four Bristol figures, then I was quite certain—the possessors of these cups are all known, I have a list here of all of them—I got the in<lb></lb>formation</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187601310015"></xptr>
               <p>from a friend—the group I saw at Mr. Wertheimer's was produced by him from the back of the shop on the second day, a friend of my wife's bad seen it there—the Bristol figures that I saw at Mr. Jewell's shop I had seen two or three days before—they were shown to me by Mr. George, of Albany Street—I did not then recognise them as mine—I was not then aware I had been robbed; it struck me they were very like mine, but I thought they might be a similar pair—they are uncommon, but there are others in existence—I don't think the group sold to Mr. Wertheimer had been redecorated—I think I gave 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—I have said that Mr. Jewell rendered me assistance to recover all I have got—I believe everything Mr. Jewell had he has returned to me—when I told him on the 19th that these things had been stolen he said "I am extremely sorry to hear it; I had not the least idea they were stolen"—when I gave him into custody on the 22nd he said I should have to answer for it, and I believe he said he con<lb></lb>sidered my conduct harsh, or something of the kind, I don't remember the words.</p>

               <p>Jewell's family these forty years; he came from abroad I think four or five years ago—since then he has been carrying on business in Lincoln's Inn Fields and Oxford Street, buying china and <hi rend="italic">curio</hi>—I bought some china of him last year—this is the list which Mr. Salting bought of me and took away, "Four enamelled boxes, one pair of Chelsea figures, two ditto small, one pair of Chelsea figures in bowers, one female figure, a Flora, two small Etruscan vases, three Worcester cups, one Dresden figure, one pair of Vienna cups and saucers, one apple green ditto, a cup and saucer, and a silver mug"—for those I paid 76<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I think on the 12th October—when I appeared at Bow Street on Jewell's first examination I told Mr. Salting and Mr. Humphreys, his solicitor,-that I had been buying some china lately of Jewell, and I at once returned it, taking Mr. Salting's undertaking to return it in the event of its not being his.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. I have acted as solicitor for Mr. Jewell, and for his father for nearly thirty years—I never heard anything contrary to the character of an honourable and honest man as regards Mr. Jewell—I issued the writ for him against Mr. Wertheimer—he intended to en<lb></lb>force that claim—of course if it had been resisted there must have been a public inquiry—when the cheque was stopped I issued the writ by Mr. Jewell's direction—I afterwards gave notice to Mr. Wertheimer not to answer to it, because I was going to return the china to Mr. Salting—that was after the first examination at Bow Street—Mr. Jewell came to me on the 20th, and said there had been a noise about the china he was buying—I said "Who have you been purchasing from?"—he said "A man that keeps a shop in the Edgware Road"—I said "What is he?"—he said "A dealer in china and all manner of things?"—I said "If you have bought of a shop-keeper you can't get into any trouble"—he said "They want to look at my books"—I said "I don't know that I should show them all my books, but I should ask them to refer to any particular items and refer to your books, but I should not like any detective or anybody else to overhaul all my books"—I gave him that advice on the 20th—he told me the shop-keeper had informed him that he had bought them from a lady who had been kept by a noble<lb></lb>man, that she had not seen him for eight or nine months, and she was dis<lb></lb>posing of different articles that she did not require, for the purpose of main<lb></lb>taining herself, as she did not know what had become of him—he said "Do you think I might buy them from the lady herself"—I said "Certainly not, you had much better buy them from the shop-keeper, because the gentleman may come back and complain of the lady selling his property."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> He did not tell me who the customer was—he said "A man living up by the Edgware Road, a general shop-keeper who is selling them on behalf of this lady"—I am sure this conversation took place on the 20th, in the evening about 6.30, it. might have been 7 or 8 o'clock—I believe it was the 19th or the 20th, and I think the 20th—he did not mention the name of Mendoza.</p>

I am a furniture salesman—I know Mr. Jewell—1 went on the 19th October with a message for him to Mr. Mendoza—I was present on that date in Mr. Jewell's shop when Mr. Mendoza Mr. Salting, and Mr. Jewell were there—I did not know then who they were, but I do now—Mr. Jewell on that occasion asked me to take a parcel round to 27, Bloomsbury Squre—that was between 5 and 6 o'clock in the evening—I found Mr. Mendoza, the old gentleman; he opened the door, and I said "I have brought a parcel from Mr. Jewell'"—I went on another errand that day for Mr. Jones; about an hour afterwards, but Mr. Mendoza was not at home the second time—I went back and told Mr. Jones.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. STAIGHT</hi>. When I first went round to Mendoza the gentlemen were not in the shop—I only saw Mr. Jewell—I am a furniture salesman, but often at Mr. Jewell's—I am employed by his brother, next door but one—he is a furniture dealer—I never saw Mr. Salting until the present time to know him—I won't swear to seeing him on the 19th, be<lb></lb>cause they were too far away for me to see who they were—they might have heard the conversation between Mr. Jones and myself—but the shop is very long.</p>

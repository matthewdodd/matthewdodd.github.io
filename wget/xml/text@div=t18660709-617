                  </hi>. I am proprietor of the house, 5, High Street, Chelsea—I live in the house and let part of it—on 5th May the prisoner hired two rooms in the upper part at 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a week—about nine or ten o'clock that night I opened the door to him—he had a bundle in his arm, from which proceeded a moaning noise—I said to him, "For God's sake, is that a child you have there, or an animal?"—he said, "Yes, it is a young b—, four years and a half old. It is a great trouble to me and my <hi rend="italic">missus</hi>. I wish the young b—was dead"—nothing further passed—he went upstairs with the bundle—he had a woman, whom he was living with, and three or four children—he remained in the apartments until he was apprehended, about three weeks—the deceased child was removed to the workhouse about a fortnight after he came there—during that time I know that all the children wanted food—I have heard them crying for food during the prisoner's absence, and I have supplied them—I did not go into the room until after the deceased child was taken away—the prisoner was never in the house after nine in the morning, except on Sunday—he used to come home at eleven, twelve, one, and two in the morning, and the woman generally came home after him—the children were generally left from nine in the morning till that time, except on Sunday—the woman went out too, I don't know where to—the eldest child was about eleven or twelve—all the furniture in the rooms was two half mattresses, a chair without a bottom, a broken table, a French bedstead, and a half butter firkin, used as a urinal and water<lb></lb>closet—that furniture belonged to the prisoner, what he brought to occupy the rooms with—there were no blankets, sheets, or anything of that kind—all the children were most filthily dirty—there were no bed-clothes—after the deceased child was removed to the workhouse I went into the rooms—they were filthy and dirty, and a strong smell throughout—the butter firkin was used for the purposes of nature—there was plenty of convenience of the kind attached to the house.</p>

I wish it was dead. It is more trouble to me and my mistress than enough"—they then went upstairs—some 8 or 9 days afterwards I went into their room—I saw the child that is now dead on a bundle, I could not say whether it was rags or flock—it was very filthy and dirty—I have often heard it cry, particularly when the prisoner has been the worse for drink—it has cried for bread, and for water—it has been left without its father or the woman from nine in the morning till eleven, twelve, and perhaps one o'clock—I could not say that the children were left without food all that time, but they have been left by themselves, and have cried for food during the day, and we have relieved them in the house—I knew the prisoner three years ago, and he was a bad man to his wife then—she has been dead about three years.</p>

I am matron at Chelsea Workhouse—the deceased child was brought there on 23rd May by a person named Fleming—it was very much emaciated, very much bruised, and very dirty, and covered with vermin; it had scarcely any clothes on, except mere rags; it was very hungry—I ordered some arrowroot, with a little brandy as a stimulant—she gradually sank, and died on 28th—I saw the prisoner once, on the night he was given into custody—he did not see the child after the time it was ill, nor after its death.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon at Battersea—on 30th April the deceased child was brought to my surgery for medical advice by some relation, I believe by the woman with whom the prisoner lived—it was a very small stunted child, unusually small for its age—it had disease of the lungs, tubercular deposition in the lungs, and disease of the mesenteric glands—I saw it several times between that period and 23rd May, when it was brought to me by the grandmother—the second time it was brought to me by a woman named Sweeney, with whom the prisoner lived—on 23rd May it was very much worse indeed; in fact, it had sunk rapidly from the time I saw it before—that was the last time I saw it—deprivation of food, and want of clothing and other comforts, would have a great deal to do with accelerating its death—I must say in fairness that the child undoubtedly would have died at some period, and at no distant period, from the disease under which it laboured, consumption both of the lungs and the mesenteric glands, but the absence of food and clothing would accelerate its death; in fact, the child was in a starving condition on the last occasion when I saw it.</p>

               <p>23rd May I was called to see this child—it was very much emaciated, very dirty, bruised, and suffering from diarrhoea—I attended it until its death, which occurred on 28th—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—externally the child was in the condition I have described—the left lung was con<lb></lb>sumptive to a considerable extent, and there was extensive disease of the mesenteric glands—the disease was the cause of death, both the lung and the mesenteric—they are the same disease, only in different parts of the body—it was scrofulous disease—the deprivation of food and the want of proper care, cleanliness, and attention would accelerate the death—in my judgment the child would not have died so soon as it did if it had had proper food, care, and clothing.</p>

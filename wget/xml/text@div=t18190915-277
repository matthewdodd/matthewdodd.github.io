On the 7th of August, about eight o'clock in the morning, I was called down, and found my daughter had been serving the prisoner with silk - she had lost a quantity; the prisoner had just left. I went with the constable to his house; he denied it, and said we might search - he pretended to turn his pockets out, but did not produce the silk. I asked him to produce that which he had bought? He said he had lost it. He afterwards produced some, which he said he had bought. He is a tailor.</p>

            . I went to the prosecutor's shop. While the prisoner was being served, I saw him take up a handful of silk, and put it into his pocket - he was served and went out. I also saw him open another bundle, and take some silk, which I thought he put into his pocket. I told a woman in the area of it - I am sure I saw him take it. It was raven-grey silk.</p>

            . I was serving the prisoner; he bought a skein of olive silk, and asked for some ravengrey. While I was serving him, Fleetwood made a motion to me, but I did not know what to do. I let him go as I knew him before - he always came to our shop before breakfast.</p>

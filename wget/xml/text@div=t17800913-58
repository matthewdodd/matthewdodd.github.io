               <p>I live with Mr. Alderman Sawbridge. On the 11th of September, at past twelve o'clock at night, I went to Guildhall Coffee-house to fetch a suit of clothes for my master; I took a coach at Charing-cross, it carried me there, and I got the clothes, and ordered the coachman to drive to New Burlington-street. The man said his horses were very tired, he had been out all day, and begged I would discharge him. I said I would not discharge him without he got me another coach; in Cheapside I got another coach. I paid him his fair and ordered the <rs id="t17800913-58-deflabel346" type="occupation">coachman</rs>

I had been riding post for several days; I lay down on the seat and went to sleep. Near <placeName id="t17800913-58-crimeloc347">St. Giles's church</placeName>

I awoke with it, and was going to jump out of the coach; I saw him go from the coach door and get upon the box; then he drove on as fast as he could before I could get out; the door was open and the step was down. I put the step up and shut the door. I called to him to stop all the way; when he got into Oxford-road he stopped the coach and said, Master, did you call to me? I said, yes, certainly you have robbed me of my watch and my money. He said no, master, I have not robbed you, indeed I have not; and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178009130067"></xptr> I will drive you safe home. Upon recollection, I thought if he would drive me home to where I was known, it would be better to detect him than where I was; accordingly he drove me to New Burlington-street. I got out of the coach, laid hold of his collar, and called the watch; one watchman came up to me; I desired him to ring his rattle, to get some more watchmen. I got three or four watchmen about him. I desired them to keep him till I went up to Mr. Sawbridge, who was in bed, to know what to do with him. We took him to the watch-house, and the next morning I went with him before the justice. I never found any of my things again.</p>
               <p>What did you loose? - My watch, a pair of buckles, and three shillings in money.</p>

               <p>I took this gentleman out of another coach in Cheapside; he bid me stop in Newgate-street to take a girl up, and bid me set her down in St. Giles's. He said I need not put the step up he would put it up himself. I had not gone far before he said he was robbed. I said he could not be robbed without it was by the person in the coach with him, that I would drive him safe home.</p>
               <p>To the Prosecutor. Did you stop to take any person up into the coach? - No, upon my oath.</p>

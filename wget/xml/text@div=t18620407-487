                  </hi>. I am a Government inspector, and lived at 8, Acorn-Btreet, Woolwich, last July—I have moved now—on a Monday even<lb></lb>ing, early in July, I was at the Pavilion Gardens, North Woolwich, between 7 and 8 o'clock, I think—I was looking at a man walking across the tight-rope, and I felt something pulling at my chest, and when I looked down the prisoner had my watch in his left hand, and was giving a twist to the chain with his right—I took hold of him and gave him in custody—I got hold of him, and prevented him going away—I am sore he is the man.</p>

I was called by the last witness, he gave the prisoner into custody—at the station he heard the charge, and said, "I did not attempt to do anything of the kind," or something to that effect—his words were, "You know I never did anything of the kind; I never attempted to steal your watch," or words like that—the signature to that deposition is my writing—it was read over to, me before I signed it—(<hi rend="italic">The witness's deposition being read, stated,</hi> "He said 'You are mistaken; it was not me at all")—it might have been those words—it is some time since—those are the words—the prosecutor was holding him when, I came up—I was up a very short time after it took place.</p>

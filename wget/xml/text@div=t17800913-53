               <p>On Thursday the 3d of July I was told by a gentleman that a man was gone out of the ship with a pudding on his back; I followed him immediately to an old stuff shop, and saw the pudding. They turned him out of the house. I said if they would not buy it I would take him to a place where he might dispose of it; I took him to the yard and sent for an officer.</p>

               <p>I never gave it to him. The ship is since sold. I was then captain of her. I had some labourers at work the day before; I told them to be sharp, and I would give them some short pieces which lay upon the deck. This was in the hold; that on the deck was of no use.</p>

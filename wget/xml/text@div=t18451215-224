The prisoner was in my service as maid of all work—I gave her leave to go to Chelsea on the 23rd of Nov., and after that I went to her box, and there found my gloves, silk, and needle-case—the velvet she had taken to Chelsea—when she came back I asked her about it—she denied it, and when she was taken to Marlborough-street office, she said she had taken it to her previous lodging—this is the velvet—it is worth about 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and these are the other things found in her box—they are worth about 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my son as silk manufac<lb></lb>turers in King-street, Cheapside—our warehouse is the first floor—the house is occupied by Mr. James Walmsley—Mrs. Burton sleeps on the premises—the entrance is from the front door in King-street; that is common to me. and Mr. Walmsley; but his warehouse is partitioned off from the passage—I left on 19th August about 6 o'clock in the evening—as far as I know I was the last person there—I locked the door of my warehouse on the first floor—we have three locks on it—I locked them all—I left a quantity of property in that room—my son opened the warehouse the next day—I went a little before 10 o'clock on the Saturday morning, and found the place had been quite ransacked, and almost every thing taken away—the cash boxes had been broken open and money taken; and I missed silk to the value of about 480<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there was a clock there which was going when I left the night before; it had stopped at half past 1—in my judgment it would take a great deal more than an hour to ransack what I found ransacked in that place—I have seen some of the silk at the Mansion house, and some is here—this is my silk and some that was taken that night—we missed twist silk and balls and reels, and bundles, which is called purse silk—I applied to Mr. Loveridge to take some steps in the matter.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my father—I left the premises before he did on 19th August—I went the next morning a little before 9 o'clock—I had a difficulty in opening our own door, and sent for a locksmith to open the locks; when the door was opened every thing was in great confusion—some burglars had been there and taken as much property as they could lay their hands on—the locks that I could not open led to the front room on the first floor—we have a front room and a back room, and a passage between them—all the drawers in the front room were open—a panel had been cut out of the door, and they had let the panel lean against the place so as not to excite alarm—what I saw could not have been done in less than three hours—the clock was stopped at half-past 1 o'clock; it must have been stopped; it is a capital clock—the silk we missed was worth 475<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash, and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of postage stamps—I have seen a list of the property which has been recovered—it is about one-fifth part of what we lost—we missed 150 lbs. of silk twist of various colours; some portion was on reels, but the bulk was in balls, and 176 bundles of purse silk like this; they weigh 11b each—we lost 32lbs. like this, on reels, and about 201bs. Of what is called machine silk—I do not see any of that here—this that is here is our property, and a part of what we lost—I can swear to the whole of this—the iron safe was broken open and three cash boxes.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cab-driver and live at Walworth—I was employed by the officers to take them to Nicholl-street—I saw a man drop a bundle and run away—the prisoner was taken in custody—I followed Mr. Loveridge to the door of the house in Nicholl-street and found some silk tied up in a sheet—I took it to the cab and went back, and in a closet in the house I found this iron <hi rend="italic">jemmy.</hi>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>). On the afternoon of 1st September I went with Knight and saw a cab go down Nicholl-street—I waited and saw the prisoner and another man come out of the court in Nicholl-street, where this house is—I got out of the cab—the other man ran away, and I seized the prisoner—I put him in the cab and drove off to the station—as we were going along the prisoner took this life preserver from under his clothes—he said, "I give you this; I did not mean to give it you, I meant it for the man that has put me away; he is a great rogue, but sooner than I would sell my mate I would cut my throat or suffer death"—this bag did not contain the whole of this property, some was in a sheet and some in a shawl—I found in the prisoner's waistcoat-pocket this small memorandum: "132 ball, 82 two 2 ounce reels, 47 1/2" do.</p>

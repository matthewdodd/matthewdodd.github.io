                  </hi>. I am resident engineer at the Victoria Docks, belonging to the London and St. Katherine Docks Company—in the early part of this year the company wanted to fill up a hole with rubbish, and entered into contracts for that purpose, sending out tenders—there was a very large quantity of earth required—these tenders were put out, and I received this letter in answer to them from the defendant Carter. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Winning Horse, Brumel Street, C. Town, March 24, 1876. Gentlemen,—I, Thomas Carter, hereby agree to do the undermentioned work required by you for filling up of shed with good dry rubbish in the Victoria Dock at the following price of 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per load.

               <p>to the gatekeeper, which were sent to Ellis, the police-officer, and ultimately I came to me at my office—the master carman sent in his account which checked I with the number of tickets that I had taken each day—in consequence of some information I received on the 6th June, I wrote to Carter on the 30th for his account—after writing two letters I received this account (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on 3rd July from Carter—on the same day I saw him at his office and I showed him this account—I asked him if it was correct and he said "Yes "—Mr. Griggs, in my presence, called his attention to a particular part of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at East Ham, and have been in the service of the London and St. Katherine Docks Company for eleven years—in May last I was gatekeeper in their service, and on May 23rd I was on duty at the south gate of the Victoria Docks when,—between 9 and 10 o'clock in the morning, I saw Carter at the gate—he asked me if I would like to get 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for beer—he said my mate did, not the man on last week, but the week before—he said "I will give you ten passes extra to what had passed dur<lb></lb>ing the day, that would be 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for you and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for me"—I said there was some one tallying below—he said there was not, and if there was there would be two to one—I declined, and he went away—I saw him next day between' 3 and 4 o'clock in the afternoon at the same gate—he said "There is no occasion to take so many as I said yesterday, take five which will be 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each, or as <hi rend="italic">few</hi> as you like"—I said I had my wife and family to study—he said he had the same, "I wouldn't ask you if it was not all right;" he then went away—I believe on the 6th June I made a communication to Ellis, the chief constable,—it had been the practice of Carter to give me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a day for keeping the cart-road clear and giving right information, a check, in fact, on his own carmen for the quantity of loads that passed in and out—the Dock Company did not know that I got that 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a day until I reported—the name of the man at the gate the week before the 23rd May, was Fair-weather, and the man who preceded the week before that was the prisoner Griffiths.</p>

I should think I have been the gatekeeper about seven or eight years, during which time I have seen Carter, I cannot say particularly often—I do not know that he has constantly had contracts with the Docks—he came up to me as usual and paid me the ls. and asked me to take ten passes—he came to give me the 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. every day—there was a good deal of traffic that day when he made the proposition about the ten passes; I refused it—I did not make any communication that night—he gave me the 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. five days that week—there was nothing doing on the 6th day—I kept my information to myself till 6th June—I have never had</p>

Griffiths and I were both gatekeepers, and I have known him for some time; I have never had anything unpleasant with him—I subscribe to the same benefit lodge, the Beehive—I have been sick and taken round a petition to be signed to obtain me some benefits which Griffiths refused to sign—I did not tell him I would be even with him and do him an injury; I cannot say how long that is ago—I don't know that I said before the Magistrate that of my own knowledge I knew Griffiths was the second week before Fairweather at the south gate—I might; they didn't ask me that question—I believe Carter told me that the man who was at the south gate the second week before him had taken some tickets—I did not say who it was before the Magistrate; I would not tell a lie if I knew it.</p>

I am head-constable to the London and St. Katherine Docks Company—it was the 5th June that Homeyard made a communica<lb></lb>tion to me; on the Monday, Bank holiday—it was the duty of the gate-keeper who took these tickets to bring them to my office every night, and I handed them on to Mr. Adamson, the engineer—on the 29th June, Griffiths would be the gatekeeper, on which day he returned to my office these twenty tiekets (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was also part of Griffiths's duty to make an entry in a book he kept for that purpose of the number of loads brought in, and I took this book from him on the 29th June (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—that entry at the top of the page "29th June" is in his handwriting; "Thursday, 29th June, 1876, loads of rubbish brought in twenty, William Griffiths"—I com-pared the entry in the book with the account sent in by Carter to Adamson, and found the number of loads charged in the account corresponded with these tickets—I afterwards examined these tickets that Griffiths brought, and found eleven of them folded in a peculiar manner; the other nine appeared to be quite fresh—Griffiths was gatekeeper from May 8th till I May 13th; Fairweather the next week from the 15th to the 20th, and then I Homeyard, and then Rudkins, and then Prowse—Griffiths came on again I the week ending the 26th June—this is the book from the south gate—I can speak to my own knowledge as to the gatekeepers at the gates.</p>

I am an inspector of police at the London and St. Katherine Docks, and <hi rend="italic">my</hi> office is at the London Docks—on 6th June, in consequence of information I received from Ellis, I gave instructions to Palmer to watch the south gate on 29th June, and from information he gave me I saw Griffiths and said "Griffiths, there appears to be some mistake in reference to the number of loads of rubbish that passed in your way; you appear to have taken twenty tickets whereas only eleven loads have, gone in;" to which Griffiths said "I don't know how many tickets I have, for each ticket, however, there was a load of rubbish passed in; I don't know anything wrong"—I then looked at the book which he had, and I saw he had an entry of twenty tickets; that is the red book you have seen—I saw he had twenty loads entered therein—on the following morning, the 30th, I went to the Victoria Docks again when I saw Griffiths—I told him this appeared to be a very serious matter, and whatever he had to say he should be cautious, as I did not know what the result might be—I said "How do you account for twenty tickets in, your possession when only eleven passed in?"—he repeated that he did not know how many tickets he had taken, but he knew he took a ticket for every load—I saw him again shortly after, the same day, at Mr. Adamson's office, in his presence, when the account in which the twenty loads are charged on the 29th was presented—Carter was asked if that was his account and he said yes, that was his account for the 28th and 29th June—I said "There must be some mistake, twenty tickets were issued and only eleven loads passed in; how do you account for that?—he said "I don't know; I gave my men some tickets in the morning, and I whatever is left they return to me in the evening, and if there is anything wrong I don't know anything about it"—this is the account produced—after the interview with Carter on the 30th I sailed on Mr. Adamson to send in his account, and Mr. Adamson had some difficulty in getting in the account—I beg to re-call the interview as regards this account; no account was produced on 30th June; it was on the 3rd July, I believe—Carter's atten<lb></lb>tion was called to it and he was asked if it was a correct account, and he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187608080131"></xptr>
               <p>said "Yes and I said "How do you account for twenty loads on the 29th June, whereas only eleven loads passed in <hi rend="italic">V</hi> and then Carter said "I don't know, I am sure, anything about the loads; I gave my men the tickets in the morning, and if any are left they return them in the evening"—I said "How many tickets did your men return this evening?"—he said he thought, perhaps, two or three—"How many tickets do you, as a rule, <hi rend="italic">give</hi> to your men in the morning?"—"Oh, about ten or twelve, I am not particular, it might be ten or twelve, I cannot say which"—I asked him the names of the men who had charge of the carts on the 29th June, and he said one was Boulden and the other was Bennett.</p>

I should think my recollection of this con-versation was very accurate—I had the conversation in the office—I have had some experience in criminal matters—I told them there was something and went on to ask them these questions—I don't know that I ever got anything from a prisoner without first cautioning him—I was called on this occasion to investigate a matter for the company, as to whether there was something right or wrong and I found something wrong—Carter told me the name of his carman—he did not tell me he gave out from twelve to twenty tickets to one carman—I believe as many as sixty to all of them—he told me he had given some of the gatekeepers money to keep the road clear for his carts to pass through—I remember the names of the carters he mentioned to me—I don't think he mentioned Swain—I went to Duncan that night and made enquiry there.</p>

             sworn. - I belong to the Woolwich tender: I met the prisoner about the middle of Rosemary-lane, about eleven o'clock at night; I was very much in liquor; she seemed to be very sober; I went to a public house with her and gave her a quartern of gin; then she asked me to go home with her; I did; I had fourpence halfpenny in my pocket, and I gave it her for gin, and she brought a quartern, and some bread and cheese; she asked me if I would not go to bed; I went to bed; I pulled off my trowsers, and she said she would put them under my head, and I had hold of one end and she the other; I felt her pull my watch out, and she ran away directly, and I followed her, and laid hold of her gown, but she got away; then I dressed myself, and was two hours looking for a watchman; I found a watchman, and took him to the wrong house; and then I went to the right house, but she was not there; I found her between twelve and one o'clock; the watchman and I looked round the room, and saw a loose brick, I took that out, and there I saw her in the chimney, naked, with the watch-case in her hand; and I found the rest of the watch was picked up, thrown over a brick wall.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a painter, and live at 15, Derby Road, Kinger land Road—on Saturday night, 8th of May, I was in the Whitechapel Road, going home—I was drunk—the prisoner McCarthy came up to me, and took hold of my arm, and took what few half-pence I had in my pocket, a shilling, and two or three half-pence—he twisted me round my neck, and threw me down—I feel the effects of it at the present time—he found he was not quite enough for me, and Hill took me by the legs, and held me down—I called out "Police!"—the prisoners are the two men who came up to me—I lost all the money I had.</p>

About 2 o'clock on Sunday morning, 9th May, I heard cries of "Police!" in the Whitechapel Road—I went up and saw these two men on the top of the last witness—as soon as they saw me coming, they rose from the man, and one walked very quietly along the pavement towards Mile End—and the other crossed the road—I took McCarthy, I searched him and found on him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and two half-pence on him—he said, "I am not a thief, I am an honest man."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Hiles Defence.</hi> As I was going home, I saw two men holding another man; he called out, and I went to see what was the matter; he seemed very drunk. I was trying to get him up, with the other young man, and fell down, and hurt my leg a good deal, and when I started to go towards home I had to walk very slowly. The constable came from the other side of the road and I stopped, as I thought he wanted to ask me a question. He struck me several times, and knocked me down. I did not know what I was charged with till I was at the station in the morning. I am quite innocent of this charge.</p>

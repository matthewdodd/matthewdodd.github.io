                  </hi>. I am clerk to a merchant at 46 East-cheap. On Saturday last, September 18th, about 8 o'clock I was in Little Tower-street, looking into a print shop—a lad told me my chain was banging down—I observed that my watch was gone—in consequence of something said to me I ran down St. Mary-at-Hill—I saw the prisoner running down the hill; I pursued—I came up to him just as he got to the bottom of the hill—I was close behind him when he dropped the watch—I picked it up, and caught him almost immediately—it was my watch—I am sure the prisoner is the person that dropped it. I did not lose sight of him—I caught him within a few yards of where he dropped it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. I did not have his watch at all; he caught hold of me opposite the Custom House. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. No, it was a very few yards from where I picked up the watch.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi> 564). On Saturday last I saw the prisoner running down St. Mary-at-Hill, followed by the last witness—I saw him just before he got to the bottom of the hill—I did not see him pick up the watch—I saw the prosecutor catch him and deliver him up to me—I asked the prisoner his address at the station, and he said it was 14, Devonshire-street, Commercial-road—he afterwards told me it was no use going there, for I should hear nothing of him, for he had been out in the country—I was coming out of Billingsgate Market and saw him jump from the kerb into the road, and the gentleman caught hold of him.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Vine public-house, Vine-yard—I know the prisoner by sight—I knew the deceased Townsley—I remember him and the prisoner being at my house together last Saturday night fortnight the 7th of Feb.—I saw them both in the tap-room—I had seen them in my house before on that night—not in company but in separate parties—I saw the prisoner first about ten o'clook in the evening, and Townsley at twenty minutes before twelve o'clock, when I went to clear the house, and both were then in the tap-room—both appeared to me to be very tipsy—they went out among the rest, sepa<lb></lb>rately, perhaps two or three minutes apart—Townsley went out last—I suc<lb></lb>ceeded in clearing the house, and got my door shut before twelve o'clock—about ten minutes after the door was shut I heard a disturbance outside—it appeared to be people quarrelling—I heard angry voices—I went out and saw the prisoner and Townsley down on the pavement—Towmley was uppermost—I assisted them up and advised them to go away—they both insisted on fighting again—I did not hear them say anything, but when they got up they ran at each other—they were wrestling with each other and both fell down again, very heavily, on the pavement—I do not think either of them was undermost—Townsley was quite as large a man as the prisoner—they got up again—I helped them up and kept them apart—I had sent a messenger for the police—I could not keep them apart—they would go at each other again—they both appeared equally desirous of fight<lb></lb>ing—I could not see any particular blow given—I do not think they hit each other, but they were pulling and hauling—it was more like a wrestling-match—Townsley fell again, but the prisoner did not—they had hold of each other just before he fell—they held any part they could get hold of—Townsley fell backwards, and his head struck against a door I think, for it was in a door<lb></lb>way—he did not get up—I went to assist him and he appeared to be dead—I</p>

               <p>never saw him revive after the fall—I heard him give a groan when on the ground—I said to the prisoner, "<hi rend="italic">Sam</hi>, now come, you have done quite enough; now help this man up"—he said, "I will"—the policeman then came, and I said, "Don't lose sight of that man"—the prisoner went with me to help the man—I do not think he was aware of the harm that was done—I cannot tell whether the fall was owing to the scuffle, or whether the deceased fell himself, but they had hold of each other until the moment he fell—he did not revive while I was present—I thought he was dead when I lifted him up—he was quite helpless—Tate took charge of the prisoner—the sergeant came up—I went into my house to get them a chair, to take Townsley away, and saw no more—I did not know his Christian name, except by hearing people call him <hi rend="italic">Bob</hi> for about a fortnight before when he came into the tap-room—I never heard the prisoner call him by any name.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant at Guy's Hospital. I remem<lb></lb>ber a man being brought there at half-past twelve o'clock on Saturday night, the 7th of Feb.—he was dead—on Monday, the 9th, I opened his head, and found, on removing the scalp, several contusions and bruises, and one larger than the rest on the top of the head—on removing the skull-cap and the membranes covering the brain, the brain was found in a state of great conges<lb></lb>tion, and blood poured out from the surface of the brain—his death was caused by the blood pouring into one of the most important cavities of the brain—there was no bruise exactly over the part where the blood filled the cavity, but there was one on the top of the head which would occasion a rup<lb></lb>ture at the base—there was no indication of his having been drinking—if a man was drunk, and fell backwards on the pavement, that might have occa<lb></lb>sioned all I saw—it was very likely to do so—he was a well formed, power<lb></lb>ful young man; not quite so powerful as the prisoner—if he was in liquor when he fell, that would be likely to make the fall more dangerous, and pro<lb></lb>duce the appearances on the brain.</p>

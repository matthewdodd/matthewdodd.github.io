Last Friday fortnight I had some acquaintance came to see me, they were going to Hownslow; I was going as far as Hyde-Park corner with them. We had been at the Sugar Loaf in King-street, Drury-lane; I was something in liquor; I went out of the Sugar Loaf to find the vault; there was a girl in the entry asked me to give her something to drink; I refused her. I went into <placeName id="t17681207-5-crimeloc29">Parker's-lane</placeName>

I got the half guinea and 18 d. again. I struggled with them for about five minutes; after I got the door open I went away directly to the public house, and my friends were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been absent from them?</p>
               <p>Wane. Not a quarter of an hour. I went to Justice Fielding, and had a constable, and we took the prisoner up.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to put your money in your waistcoat pocket?</p>
               <p>Wane. I generally do when I have been drinking, because sometimes the others have none, and they may want to borrow; then I show them I have none.</p>

               <p>I was sitting by my own fire, the other woman asked him if he would give her any thing to drink; he went out and fetched some liquor: he was gone near half an hour. She went away, then he came in again and said he was robbed, and that I was one of the women.</p>

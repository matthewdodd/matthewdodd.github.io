I know the prisoner, and knew his wife—she was mostly called Mrs. Williams, but I have heard her say she was not married—her own name was Catherine Weston—they lived in the same house as me—they had a room there—I had known them about four months—they lodged overhead, on the first floor—I lodged on the ground floor—this happened on Saturday night, the 30th of December—I saw the deceased that night, first about half-past nine o'clock—she came into my room—she appeared to be sober then—she went out in about two minutes—I did not see where she went to—she came back, and I went out with her after tea o'clock—we went to the Freemason's Arms—she called for James Turvey, and we had a quartern of gin between us three—I left her there, outside the door, talking to James Turvey, and went home—she came in two or three minutes after me—we went into the yard together, and when I came out of the yard I met the prisoner just at the foot of the stairs—he was going</p>

               <p>up stairs—the deceased came in, out of the yard, in a minute or so, and went up stairs, and the door of their apartment was locked—the deceased tried it, and could not get in—I asked the prisoner at the foot of the stairs to open the door, saying she had only been into the yard with me—he then opened it and let her in—he was in the room at the time—in a short time after I observed them both go out together, and they came home again to<lb></lb>gether—when they came down stairs they both went out into the street together—the prisoner had been drinking—I observed that when they were going out together—the deceased did not seem as if she had been drinking when she returned the second time—I did not hear her say any<lb></lb>thing to the prisoner when they came in together, but the prisoner went out again, and the deceased stopped down with me, standing at the street door—when the prisoner came back again she said to him, "Come in, <hi rend="italic">Dick;</hi> come in, my dear;" and they went up stairs together—I do not know whether they went into their own room—I saw the deceased after<lb></lb>wards go out for some supper—that was about half-past eleven o'clock—I went out myself, and on my return I found her in my room, crying—she again went up stairs, and came down again—no liquor was sent for into our room—we had a pint of beer—me, my husband, and the deceased, drank it, and after that the deceased went up stairs again—I did not go with her then—she had only been in our room a few minutes—when she went up I heard her try to get into her room—she asked the prisoner to open the door—she pushed against the door, and asked him to let her in—she was very violent—she pushed the door violently, and called him a cock-eyed b—she then came down stairs again.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you observe, after drinking with you, whether she was the worse for liquor? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She did not appear the worse—she kept crying very much—she only remained a few minutes down stairs with us each time, and kept going up stairs—she asked me to ask him to let her in, and I did—I went up stairs, but the door was shut—he used a bad word to me, and did not open the door—I came down stairs again, and left the deceased stand<lb></lb>ing at the door—she was up there at the time I went up—she came down again into my room, and staid there two or three minutes.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What time was it when she left you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The last time she left my room was a little after one o'clock, and in a minute or so I heard her up stairs, trying the door—I had not seen her go up, but heard her up stairs, trying to force the door open, by pushing it very violently indeed—she con<lb></lb>tinued doing so, and directly after I heard a noise as if the prisoner had jumped out of bed, and went across his room in a hurry—I heard a noise, and then heard a faint scream, and a fall down stairs immediately—I immediately struck a light, and went out—I found the deceased lying down, with her head on the threshold of the passage—her head was at the bottom of the stairs, and her feet on the third stair—there are twelve stairs in that flight—they are rather high stairs, and rather steep—I found her mouth moving, rather working about—she was not sensible—there was a graze and some blood on her forehead—that might have happened in her falling down stairs.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live in the room opposite to where the deceased lived. I went out with the deceased that night about seven o'clock—three of us went out together—we came home at half-past nine o'clock—we drank a glass of spirits each while we were out, besides beer—I think we had about three pots of porter between four of us—another person had joined us—when we came home I went into the room, and the deceased and the prisoner seemed perfectly comfortable—I went to bed at a little after ten o'clock—Turvey was in bed with me—he had been with the deceased and me—the prisoner, the deceased, and me, had been down to the Ship tavern to him, and we returned with him—Turvey did not partake of the liquor with us—we had a glass of rum each at the Britannia Tavern—the prisoner was with us—he went out with us at seven o'clock—he was one of the three that drank with us—when we returned, he and the deceased remained in my room a short time together, and they seemed quite comfortable between themselves—it was then near ten o'clock—I saw the deceased again, about ten o'clock, in Salmon's-lane, standing talking to young Turvey, James Turvey's son—I passed her at the door, just spoke to her, and went on—I did not see her again till after one o'clock, when she broke my bed-room door open, after I was in bed—she said she would be b—if she would not break the b—door open, and she did break it open, and sat down in a chair.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Could you then see in what state she was? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She certainly was in liquor—I did not rise out of my bed to see, and did not speak any more to her—she sat down a few minutes, and then she said she would break the prisoner's b—door open—she arose and left my room, and broke his door open, which is facing ours, and a very short space from it—I should not think it is more than three quarters of a yard—when she broke the door open I heard the prisoner or somebody get out of bed, and cross the room—I then heard a scuffle in the passage against the door, and heard a scream and a fall—I heard the door shut before I heard the fall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Can you tell how long it was between the door shutting and the fall? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Almost instantly—I heard the policeman come, but did not get up, and did not see the prisoner—in the scuffle at the top of the passage it sounded as if one wanted to go in and the other out, and the fall was almost instantly, as it appeared to me—I have never given a different ac<lb></lb>count of that, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You are put down in your deposition as having said—"It was about two minutes between the time of my hearing the door</p>

               <p>shut, and my hearing her fall." <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. Then that is a mistake—I said before the Coroner that it was instantly, as I have to-day.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> It was before the door was shut you heard the scream? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I think so; and about a minute or two after the door shut I heard the fall—Sparrow keeps the Freemasons' Arms—the deceased was in the Ship with me, and the Britannia, and in the Victoria—four of us drank there, the deceased, the prisoner, myself, and Turvey—we drank one pint of porter there, but no spirits—that was about half-past seven—the Victoria was the next house we went to—we had there a quartern of gin and two pots of beer—the same four persons were there—she and I then went to the baker's shop together, and had a glass of gin each there as a New-year's gift—the next place we went to was the Britannia—the same four perons went there, and had a glass of rum each—we drank two pots of beer there, and one at the Ship—we had nothing but the rum at the Britannia.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know whether the deceased had been to any public-hours before that, on that day? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, she had not, for I had been with her all day—she was in the habit of going to public-houses at night and drinking; and was a little violent in her temper when drunk—my room door was locked, and she broke it quite open—it was after that she said she would break the prisoner's b—door open—she thumped very violently indeed at his door—I heard a scuffle in the passage.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever say the prisoner did not go out <hi rend="italic">of</hi> his room? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then the prisoner did not go out of his room? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—the door of his room is about three feet from the top of the stairs—she had no light with her when she left my room to go and break his door open—there was no light in the passage.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Well, the door being only three feet from the head of the stairs, and she being in a very violent state, is it not very likely that she might have fallen down stairs by accident? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I do think so; the stairs are very steep indeed.</p>

I was called in between on and two o'clock, on Sunday morning—I know nothing of what took place on Saturday night—when I got there, I found Marshall had the prisoner in custody—I saw the deceased lying in the passage—I asked the prisoner how the woman came down stairs—he said she had come home two or three hours after he was in bed, and burst open the door, that he got out of bed, pushed her out of the room, and shut the door, but he was not aware at the time that she had fallen down stairs, he thought she was sit<lb></lb>ting on the landing still—the door is two feet three inches from the tap stair—the door opens inside, and from the nearest door-post to the top of the stairs, it is two feet three inches—the lock of the door is towards the staircase—the landing itself is two feet six inches wide, and the length from the top stair to the wall is four feet nine inches—at the end of the landing against the wall there stood a pail with a tub on the top of it, which measured seventeen inches oval—it is two feet six inches from Wil<lb></lb>liams's door to Turvey's—there are twelve stairs, nine of them are very steep—there is a turn at the bottom of them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Smith, who is a rigger I live at the back part of the house, up the other staircase—the head of my bed stands against the wall dividing my room from Williams's, and the had of his bed comes against the wall—we can hear every thing that passes very plain.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was your attention first called to on this night? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I heard the deceased go up stairs, soon after eleven o'clock, and heard her ask the prisoner to let her in—he said he would not, and where she had been she might go again, for she should not come in that night—I heard her go down stairs, but whether she went out or not I cannot say—I heard no<lb></lb>thing more till after one o'clock, when I heard her go up stairs, and ask him to let her come in—he said he would not—I heard her knock violently at the door, and heard the door open.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Could you tell whether she burst it open, or whether the prisoner opened it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I could not—I heard a faint scream and a fall—the scream and the fall were nearly together, as she fell I fancy, for it was momentary—I got out of bed, and stood on my own stairs, and saw the deceased lying in the passage.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of a carpenter. At half-past eleven o'clock on this night I was awoke by a violent knocking at the door, and heard the deceased ask the prisoner to let her in—she cried bit<lb></lb>terly, and said she did not deserve it—I heard her go down stain, but where to, I cannot say—I heard her come up stairs again immediately—she knocked at the door again, and made use of an improper expression—I heard the door opened, but by whom I cannot say, and I heard the cry of murder—I was in bed at the time, and I heard a sudden fall down stairs.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live in this house. I heard the deceased shaking at the door about eleven or twelve o'clock—I cannot tell the time exactly—I was sober—I heard her go down stairs again—she was gone some time, and I went to sleep—the next I heard was, she came and burst my door open—the fastening was not very good—she said she should stop there that night, as she was locked out of her own room—she sat on the chair several minutes, then got up, used a bad expression, and went towards her own door—I heard her say, "You cock-eyed b—, I will come in"—she knocked at the door, and ran to the door, and I heard it open almost directly—I believe it was burst open—I heard the prisoner get either off the bed or off a chair.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then you heard the door open before you heard the prisoner move? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I heard a scuffle for a very short time, and heard her scream out, and heard her fall directly.</p>

                  </hi> am a surgeon.

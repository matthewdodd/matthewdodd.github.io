               <p>Q. What was his situation. - A. Cleaning knives and running of errands.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not know whether any thing attracted your notice of this boy. - A. I perceived him have a watch and a broach.</p>
               <p>Court. What age is the prisoner. - A. About fourteen.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. When you first observed them things, did you ask him any questions. - A. Yes, I asked him how he got his watch; he said his father gave it him.</p>
               <p>Q. What was his father. - A. A soldier in the guards.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the father employed by you. - A. Now and then occasionally; when he said his father gave it him it struck me not very likely that his father should give him the watch, as he had complained to me that his father always used him very ill.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you placed this ten pound note. - A. In a desk in a back room about three weeks ago; I always kept it locked.</p>
               <p>Q. When you first discovered that you had lost your bank note, was it locked. - A. Yes, the lock was injured.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you inattentive to your keys and leave them about - A. Yes, I often do.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you lost also a seal. - A. Yes, which I prized very much. I had left it on the mantle piece.</p>
               <p>Q. You have never seen it again. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And you have never seen your bank note again. - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he ever apply to you for change of a note. - A. Yes; I cannot say the day, I believe it was about a month ago; the prisoner came and asked me to give him change of a note, I believe it was a ten pound note; he said it was for a lady, No. 7, Cadogan-place.</p>
               <p>Q. (to prosecutrix) Did you ever send him for change of any note of value. - A. No.</p>

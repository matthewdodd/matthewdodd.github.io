I live at 73, Salcott Bridge Road—I attended the prosecutrix on the Wednesday afternoon, she was unconscious and was suffering from a contusion at the back of the head, which would be caused by a fall on the pavement or by a blow—she has not had fits since—she complained of numbness in her right side in the region of the hip, and a stiffness in the muscles round her head.</p>

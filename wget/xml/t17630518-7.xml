The things mentioned in the indictment were taken out of a book-case which stood on a chest of drawers in their room, which was not let to them for their use, which I believe was lock'd, but I am not sure. I missed them the last day of April. I had given them warning the Saturday before, they went away directly; the woman was first taken, and, upon being charged with taking the things, the man begged of the woman, if she knew any thing of them, to confess Then she said she had taken and pawned them at Mr. Farmer's, in Jewin-street, where we found them.</p>

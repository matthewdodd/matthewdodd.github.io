             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Raine. I am shepherd to Mr. Passingham; I went into the field about half after five o'clock in the morning, on the 2d day of May, and I found there had been something the matter among the sheep, and I searched the field, and I found a sheep's entrails and feet cut off: I informed my master, and procured a constable, and went to the prisoner's house that morning about twelve o'clock; it is in the parish of Helton, and about half a mile from the prosecutor's; there we found the sheep slaughtered, in his apartments up one pair of stairs, with a sack covered over it; my master's mark was upon the sheep; it had it's coat on.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What mark? - A. It was a mark of red across the shoulders, about as wide as my hand, a single one.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. Q. Did you try the feet? - A. Yes, and they tallied with the legs of the sheep exactly; then we went in search of the prisoner, and apprehended him; we found nothing upon him but a knife.</p>

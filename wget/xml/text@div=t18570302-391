On 13th Feb., about half past 1 o'clock, I was in the Goldsmiths' Arms, in Bedfordbury—Radford was with me—I saw the prisoner there—I desired Radford to search him—the prisoner thrust his hands into his pockets, and made his way to the fire<lb></lb>place, and threw a paper parcel out of his hand—it struck against the fire<lb></lb>place, and bounced back into the room—it contained eighteen shillings, three half crowns, and a crown piece, all counterfeit.</p>

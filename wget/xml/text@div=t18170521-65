               <p>MR. JOHN EARL. I am a barge-owner, and live at Kingston. In March last, I sent a barge to London, laden with four hundred quarters of malt and one hundred sacks of flour. Horne, Horrod, and Hubbard, had the care of the barge-it was to go to Hawkes's wharf, Whitefriars, for Messrs. Reid and Co. Hawkes's wharf is between Blackfriars Bridge and the Temple. She left Kingston on Tuesday, the 11th of March, about half past eleven in the morning.</p>
               <p>JAMES HORNE. I was captain of the barge. We left Kingston, about a quarter before twelve o'clock; Horrod and Hubbard were on board with me. We arrived at <placeName id="t18170521-65-crimeloc326">Hawkes's wharf</placeName>

We made the barge fast at half-past seven o'clock - I and Horrod went on shore for refreshment, leaving Hubbard in the barge, and returned about half-past eight. About a quarter before twelve, I heard some person step on the fore-sheets - I looked out, and called out "Shinah!" meaning Hubbard-no person answered; I thought it was Hubbard. I walked round the bulk to see that all was right, and missed nothing. I heard some person or persons talking at a distance, they were strange voices. The barge being aground I thought no person could rob it, and I returned to the cabin, thinking all safe. About a quarter before one o'clock, Hubbard returned; he had been ashore for refreshment - He said the barge had been robbed. I walked round the bulk, and missed four sacks of malt, each containing two bushels - We returned to the cabin, and missed no more; I then looked out several times, and saw the police-boats stop several other boats, but did not suspect them. As soon as it was day-light we missed four more sacks, making eight in all. I went to the Police-office; the sacks were marked"John Earl," in full length.</p>
               <p>JOHN HORROD. I was fellow-servant with the last witness, and came away with the barge. We arrived in town all safe, at Hawkes's wharf - We did not stop at all on the river. Between twelve and one o'clock I walked over the bulk, and missed four sacks, and in the morning we missed four more, making eight in all. The sacks were marked"John Earl."</p>

               <p>JOSEPH FARRANT. I am a corn-chandler, and live in James-street, Covent-garden. On the 13th of March last, a man, named Hawkins, came to me about ten o'clock in the morning, and produced a sample of malt - I agreed to buy it of him at 56s.; the price of malt of that quality would be 86s. at that time - I had given 96s. the previous week, which was the fair market price for that kind of malt; it was to be delivered to me on Friday morning, at seven o'clock (the next day). I did not know the man before, I gave information at Bow-street. On Friday morning, about half past six o'clock, Hawkins and another man brought the malt, in a cart, to my door; there were eight sacks-Adkins was in attendance. The malt was shot out of their sacks into mine. Adkins took the two men into custody and the sacks.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. I never saw either of the prisoners-Hawkins was tried here. Three of the sacks had the name of Bowell, of Camberwell. on them.</p>
               <p>HARRY ADKINS. I am an officer of Bow-street. Hawkins was tried here last Session. On Friday morning, the 14th of March, I went by appointment to Mr. Farrant's, and saw the cart come up to his house.

            . I know Hawkins. In the month of March last I got a horse and cart for him, from my house in Portpool-lane; he joined me, and got into the cart; we drove to Westminster Bridge - He directed me to drive there. When we got there he alighted, and went and spoke to a man, it was the prisoner, Thomas, he was in waiting. I did not hear what passed between them. The prisoner, Thomas, told me to bring the cart down after him. He took me down on the beach by the water-side; it was rather dark-this was a little distance from the bridge, on the Surry side of the water, and the further side of the bridge from the city. When I got to the water's-edge, the two prisoners were in the barge. Thomas told me to back the cart to the barge; I did so, and they both helped to unload it - They lifted the sacks out of the barge into my cart; this was the first time I saw them - I am sure they are the two men - They put eight sacks into the cart, and told me to drive away; I had left Hawkins at the foot of the bridge. I drove off the same way that I came,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181705210022"></xptr>and found Hawkins at the foot of the bridge where I had left him; he joined me, and we drove over the bridge to Mr. Farrant's. I unloaded the same malt that I had got from the prisoners at the water-side.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I know Hawkins's wife by sight - I have not talked to her about giving evidence here. It was about six o'clock in the morning when we got to Westminster Bridge.</p>

               <p>Q. Did they not tell you, that if you would swear to these two men, it would be better for her husband - A. No, nothing like it. It was light enough to see the countenance of a man.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not said it was so dark you could not see the man when he came up to you - A. No; I said, if I saw him I thought I should know him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say, the last time, that you had not seen him so that you could know him again - A. I cannot swear that I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you have sworn to the man at the time he came up to Hawkins - A. I cannot swear to the man that came up to Hawkins, but I can swear to the man who gave me the malt - They were in the barge and I was in the cart.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did you put your cart as close to the edge of the barge as you could - A. Yes; they lifted them up and I took them in.</p>
               <p>HARRY ADKINS. I apprehended the prisoner, Thomas, at his house at Lambeth; he is a fisherman-it was after Hawkins had been tried. I asked him if he knew Hawkins? he hesitated sometime, and said he did know a man of that name. I found Piper at his own house; he is also a fisherman. He said he did know Hawkins.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I saw their nets in their houses, and they said the fish-trade was very bad.</p>
               <p>MARGARET HAWKINS. My husband was tried here last Sessions, for stealing the malt. I know the two prisoners. I went to Thomas soon after my husband was sent to Newgate on this charge; I believe it was the day after - I knew nothing of him before - I did not find him then. I went a fortnight afterwards (which was before my husband was tried). I found him at home. I said,"my husband is in trouble concerning this malt that he had of you, and I hope you will help me;" he said I should not want while he had any thing-this was all that passed then. Thomas's wife, and the prisoner, Piper, came down to my house in Portpool-lane after this - I did not know Piper before-this was a day or two after I had been to Thomas's. I told Thomas where I lived. The morning that my husband was taken to Bow-street, Piper came and asked where Hawkins was. I said, "I believe you know, for I think you to be one of the party" - He went away. That was all that passed. I went to Bow-street, but did not see either of the prisoners there. One evening, before my husband was tried, I went to Thomas's house, to see if he would give me any money. I found him at home. I was talking about my husband's trouble, and asked him to assist me with a little money. I do not know that I told him what I wanted it for; he said he had not got any at that time - He said nothing else. I did not tell him of the robbery, or who was concerned in it, at either of these conversations. The morning after my husband was tried, I went to Thomas's house again and saw him, Piper came in while I was there. They told me that they had heard my husband's trial the night before, and said they had promised my husband 2l. 2s. towards a counsellor. They said they had not got 2l. 2s. then, but each of them gave me 10s. to help pay for the counsellor. My mother had assisted me, and this was to help to pay her. Nothing more passed. I went to Thomas's house again the week before last, to see if he could assist me a little more, as they promised they would. I did not see him then.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I had not seen Thomas with my husband - I had not seen either of the prisoners at our house-it was a fortnight after my husband was taken that I first saw Thomas, and told him I believed him to be one of the party. Thomas said I should not want. Mr. Ulmer was my husband's attorney; I mentioned it to him and was fetched before the magistrate by the officer. I never had any hope of getting my husband off. Ulmer did not tell me what to say; nor do I remember Mr. Harmer checking him and the justice turning him out; he went to the office with me, but did not tell me what to say.</p>
               <p>MR. EARL re-examined. The value of the malt was 88s. per quarter, in all 16l. or 17l. I compared a sample of the malt with that brought to Farrant's, they exactly agreed-there were three different kinds among it-and it was dried of a particular colour for Reid and Co. I have no doubt but that they are the same. I compared it with the bulk from which it had been taken.</p>
               <p>SILVESTER DRAKE. In March last I was working at the Waterloo Bridge, and found four sacks just below the barges, between them and Blackfriars Bridge-it was the 15th of March, they had "John Earl," marked on them; they appeared to have been sometime in the water, and to have had corn in them.</p>
               <p>HORROD re-examined. The barge was robbed on Tuesday, the 11th of March, between twelve and one o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>MR. EARL. I missed eight sacks, with my name on them. I saw those which Drake produced, they are part of the sacks which the malt was put into.</p>
               <p>THOMAS'S Defence. I never saw the woman or the man before. The officer asked me if I knew Hawkins, I said I did; he said it would be better for me if I did not. I walked all the way without being hand-cuffed, and might have made my escape if I had been guilty.</p>
               <p>PIPER'S Defence. I never saw either the woman or the man before.</p>

             sworn. - I am a watchman in Coleman-street Ward: On the 26th of July last, about three o'clock, I observed a light in the passage of Mr. Randall's house; I stood a few minues, and observed the light put out; I then withdrew a few yards from the door, and the prisoner soon after came out; he said he was servant to Mr. Randall, and would tell his master of my neglect of duty, in not attending to the persons who were making a noise at the door; I asked him where the light was which I had seen in the passage; he said his fellow-servant was gone backward with it; during the discourse, the prisoner ran off from me; I called out to my partner, John Farley, who stopped him, and brought him back to Mr. Randall's, alarming Mr. Randall that his servant had robbed him; then he came down, and said, he was not his servant; we searched him, and found this property; the prisoner owned the next morning every thing, and how he got in; we said nothing to him,nor promised him any favour; no promise was made him; he said, he got up the lamp iron, and entered the window of the drawingroom, which he forced open, got in and took the property; that he then went down into the pantry, and took some more plate, which he found there, and put into his waist and his pockets; that he then came into the passage with a lighted candle, unsastened the door, put his light out, and came into the street; he had a dark lanthorn, and an iron crow, inside his waistcoat, and two table-cloths wrapped round his body, besides four picklockkeys and matches.</p>
               <p>Mr. Randall. As far as I can judge, the window<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180209180024"></xptr>was down, but not fastened; any man might get in who was active; some of the articles were in the sideboard drawer, in the dining-room; the rest were in the store closet, in the same floor; I can swear to the pearl bracelet, which I bought myself; I had locked the drawer at night, and it was open in the morning; I can swear also to the pocket-book, value 2l. and I am satisfied all the rest of the articles belong to me; I asked the prisoner how he got in; he said, up the lamp iron, and in at the dinning-room window.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am a foreigner, and very much distressed; poverty brought me ine to it; I leave it to your Lordship, and mercy of the Court; I failed with Lord Cameford round the world, and I have fought for this country, though I belong to the City of Hanover.</p>

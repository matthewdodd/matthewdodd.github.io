                  </hi>. I live at No. 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Union Buildings, Woolwich; I am carman to the South Eastern Railway Company. On 31st Feb., I was re<lb></lb>turning home from an Odd Fellows' Club, and before I turned into Union Street, I saw Pearce standing at the corner, and Ginger a short way down High Street—I walked on, and when about three minutes walk from my house I heard some one behind me, I looked back, and saw that it was Ginger—I walked on, and found that he drew nearer to me, and when he was within five or six yards of me, I looked back, and got out into the road for him to pass me; he would not, but seized me by the collar—I begged of him to let me go, as I had not interfered with him—he knocked my cap off, and as I stooped to pick it up, he seized me by the throat, and Pearce came up and said, "Take his watch, take his watch"—I snatched my watch of the guard and put it in my trousers pocket, but in vain—they plundered my pockets of 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and my watch—Ginger then squeezed my throat till I became insensible, and when I came to my senses I went for the police, and found Pearce in bed—the policeman took the clothes off him and said, "Is that the man?" I said, "Yes; I suppose you thought I did not know you, <hi rend="italic">Dick</hi>, but I did"—I had known him more than twelve months about the town—Larking took him to the station, and I went with the other constable to Ginger's house, and found him in bed—my watch, and chain, and purse have not been found—I believe Pearce said he had not been in Ginger's company that night, but I am not positive—I was perfectly sober—it was a bright, moon-light night, and there was a gas lamp very close.</p>

I said, "Yes"—he asked the policeman if he had brought a piece of paper for him.</p>

I live in Union Street, Woolwich, and am a butcher's servant—on 2nd Feb., about 12 o'clock, I was in Union Street, going home, and saw some one lying on the ground—I should not like to swear whether it was the prosecutor or not—I saw the two young men close to him—the little one said, "Halloa, <hi rend="italic">Bill"</hi>—I only knew him by sight—I answered, "Halloa"—I went some little distance down, and heard some money rattle—they asked me to take the man on the ground home, but I would not touch him.</p>

On a Monday morning, early in October (I do not know the date), I met him going to the warehouse; some conversation passed. He said he had broken a blood-vessel, and had been into Buckinghamshire for his health, and that he had had a horse made him a present of, which he sold for 40 l.; he produced two 40 l. notes, shewed them to me, and said he meant to buy stock in the 3 per Cents.

               <p>Q. Was anybody, except the prisoner, in the room alone on the 9th - A. No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Had not Mrs. Baxter, the charwoman, been there on Saturday - A. Yes, she was not there alone - she still works for me. I was in the house all that day.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am perfectly innocent of stealing the notes out of the bureau - I never opened it in my life, nor did I ever see the notes. The money I paid I received from a man who owed it to me; he is gone to to America.</p>

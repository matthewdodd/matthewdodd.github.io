            's shop in Fleet-street, on the 27th of December. The words</p>
               <p>"Temple of Reason" were written up I think. I saw him serving in the shop, and bought this book of him; I wrote my name on it at the time, and paid 6 d. for it - I had seen other people purchasing at the shop, but not of the prisoner. I went straight to Guildhall, and gave the book to Mr. Payne; a warrant was issued - I went with an officer to point out the man, and asked him for another book; he was going to give it me when the officer took him.</p>

            , who belongs to Bow-street - I saw nobody employ him. I have only been paid for my loss of time; I may have received 3 l. more or less. I read part of the pamphlet as I went along the streets.</p>
               <p>Q. You found out in the streets that it was blasphemy - A. No, I did not; a former conviction settled that. I was told it was blasphemy, and I swore at Guildhall that it was blasphemous.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you be kind enough to state what you understand by blasphemy - A. Speaking against God and the Scriptures. Sedition is speaking against the King and the Constitution.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You say you have received about 3 l., is this the only pamphlet you have bought, or have you been employed about others things - A. I have.</p>

Bag with the Money and Goods mention'd in the Indictement, gon : That he believ'd the Prisoner, pretending to go to his Trunk, took an Occasion to slink into a Cellar, where he lay till the Family was a bed, and then committed the Fact. Upon this (being sure it was the Prisoner that rob'd him) he cross'd the Water to Southwark where he heard the Prisoner had taken a Shop, to search for him and at last found him going to take Water at a By-pair of Stairs; then he desir'd him to go with him to his House, which he agreed to, but when he came there, would not own any thing of the Matter he was charg'd with, tho' intreated to it in the kindest Manner. At last he was charg'd with a Constable; and as they were going before my Lord Mayor , the Prisoner was seen to drop something, which the Constable took up, and told Mr. Lisle 'twas some Buttons and a Buckle; then Mr. Lisle said, if they were his they were Bathmetal Buttons, and the Buckle was Silver, as they were found to be: Then he was search'd and the Bag aforesaid with 55 l 6 s.6 d. the Top of a Tea Canister, and other Things that he had lost, were found upon him. This was all confirm'd by the Evidence of several others. As to the Spirits and Liquors, one Maun who dealt with Mr. Lisle depos'd he had some of the Prisoner, in Consideration of a Watch he had made for him but did not think the Prisoner stole them, being then in Credit with his Master; and afterwards more in Consideration of a Clock which he bespoke of him for the Use of his House which he had taken in Southwark . The rest were found in the Prisoner's Shop; and a Porter Swore he carried them there from Mr. Lisle's by the Prisoner's Order. The Prisoner in his Defence brought a Person who swore she saw him borrow 50 l. of one Rowland in Shoreditch , and remember'd some Talk about a 4 s, and 6 d. Piece, a half Moydore, and other odd Pieces which she could not name nor distinguish. He denied he had any Buckles or Buttons of his Master's and as: for the Liquors he said he paid for them, to Cash; which Mr. Lisle denied, and proved the contrary.

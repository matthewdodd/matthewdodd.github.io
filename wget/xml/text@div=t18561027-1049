                  </hi>. I am booking cleric at the North Wool wich Railway, belong<lb></lb>ing to the Eastern Counties Railway Company. On Tuesday afternoon, 2nd Sept., a great number of passengers came down—I was engaged in the booking office between 5 and 6 o'clock, and Btitterworth came into the inner office, which is private—I told him that he had overstepped the mark, and had no business there, and he went out—I was alone—I kept my money there in a drawer—there is a telegraph in that office—I was writing at a table—Smith came in after Butterworth had left—I told him to go out and he went out—he asked me whether I had been one fighting over the water—I told him "No"—my money drawer was open, and had 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of silver in it—I shut the drawer, and then he came in again, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185610270145"></xptr>
               <p>followed a gas fitter, employed by the Company, who came in for his tools, and went out—Smith then lounged round the Fenchurch-street case, where the money is kept, and I watched him out, looked the money drawer, left the key in, and shut the door of the inner office—I was working the tele<lb></lb>graph some time with my back to the door—I heard the rattling of money, turned round, and caught hold of Smith's arm—he was standing just in the middle of the inner office, by the table—the drawer was not above a yard and a half from him—I saw a great quantity of silver in his hand, and said, "You have got my money"—he walked back to the drawer, and told me to look in it—I looked in it, and the money was all gone—he shuffled it back, and said, "There is your money"—Fountain then came, pushed me against the counter, and said, "He has not got your money"—while that was going on, I saw Butterworth rapping at the window farthest from the door, calling out for a ticket for Shoreditch—that was the Fenchurch-street window, and not the proper window for Shoreditch—Fountain and Smith then went out together, and Fountain called out, "You cannot go until you have locked your places"—I returned, and locked my places, and the money was gone—it was to follow Smith that I went out—the prisoners were then all three together, and Smith turned to the right, and the other two to the left—I met Mr. Chapman, and he and another gentleman found the prisoners, and I was afterwards taken to see them in custody, and saw Butterworth and Fountain—about a fortnight afterwards I saw Smith in custody at Shoreditch, and pointed him out.</p>

I am a lime merchant On 2nd Sept, I was at North Woolwich railway station, in the outer office; my attention was attracted by Butterworth rapping at the Fenchurch box, and calling, "Sboreditch, Shoreditch"—while he was doing this, I heard the boy say, "You have got my money"—I caught'a glimpse of a man inside the office, who had bold of his arm, but not sufficient to identify him—I went on the platform and gave an alarm, and when I returned they were in the office.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Leake. On the 25th of November last, my mistress was stopped in her coach. I attended her. As the carriage was going into <placeName id="t17781209-28-crimeloc176">Portman-square</placeName>

He was on horseback; he rode up to the coachman and desired him to stop, and I saw him present a pistol to him. As soon as the prisoner desired the coachman to stop, I got down from behind the carriage. The prisoner tapped at the coach-window. He saw I was down, and said to me, be you quiet, young man, or I will settle you; when he had said so to me, he tapped at the window again; I immediately seized his right hand which he had the pistol in.</p>
               <p>Was the window let down? - No; as soon as I had got hold of his hand, I called to the coachman; he got down and secured his other hand, and we took him.</p>
               <p>Did you pull him off his horse? - No, some other people came up.</p>
               <p>Court. You secured him before the window was let down? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You did not hear him say any thing to your mistress in the coach? - No.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I did not present any pistol, I had no pistol in my hand when I stopped the coachman, I had only my whip in my hand. I might bid them stop while I passed; the footman immediately seized my horse's bridle, and stopped me; I pulled my pistol out of my pocket; I told him to take care of himself. I did not demand their money; I had no such intention. I did not speak to the ladies.</p>

               <p>I am a grocer and oil-man. I have known the prisoner about eight or nine years. I have known him down to this time. I knew him when he lived in Dowager Lady Wenman's family. He went from thence to 'Ssquire Floyer's; he lived there till Mr. Floyer went to Madrass . From thence he went to Colonel Grant's; he lived with Colonel Grant till he went to Scotland. He had a very honest good character from his lady and masters, and was respected by his fellow-servants.</p>

               <p>I have known him some years. I live with Mr. Floyer now; I asked his permission to come to speak on the prisoner's behalf. I was in the the Indies with Mr. Floyer. I lived with Mr. Floyer before he went abroad. The prisoner was universally esteemed as a faithful, good servant, and I believe Mr. Floyer was perfectly satisfied with him. He has quitted Mr. Floyer's service about three years. No man in the world ever bore a better character.</p>
               <p>Have you known him lately? - I have seen him but once for these three years, then I happened to meet him in Piccadilly.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you see the prisoner's mother there? A.

            . I am a labourer, and live in Corder's-court, Orchard-street. On the 24th of May, about seven o'clock in the evening I was in Orchard-street, and saw McGinnis - he had got hold of Irving with one hand when I saw him; the Policeman had got hold of Irving's right arm, and as they were staggering back I saw Irving kick McGinnis up between the legs, right in *** - it was after the Policeman had got hold of him; he kicked him again, but missed his kick that time, and his foot went up outside - the mob then broke in, and rescued him from the Policeman; I am sure McGinnis was sober; he went down to the watch-house, holding both his hands to the part where he was kicked, and said he was a dead man - I afterwards carried him in a sedan-chair to the hospital.</p>
               <p>Q. Was McGinnis holding the prisoner by the collar the first time you saw him? A. Yes - I saw no blows pass before; the prisoner is the man - I have known him sixteen or eighteen years.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you there when they fell down on the ground? A. No; I was about twenty yards<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183106300052"></xptr>off - I did not see him on the ground; I cannot say whether he fell down.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I was on duty in Orchard-street, and heard the deceased, or somebody, call out Police! - I was a hundred yards or more from the place; I turned round, seeing people gathered - I ran to the spot as fast as I could, and found the deceased had hold of Irving by the collar; I endeavoured to separate them - McGinnis said, "Take this man into custody, I am an injured man;" I said I could not take him, in consequence of not having seen the assault committed - they still had hold of each other in a very violent manner; he again wished me to take him - I refused, as our orders were not to take any body, without seeing an assault committed; I separated them - Irving and his friends went home; McGinnis walked to the watch-house - I should suppose him to be sober; I cannot say whether the prisoner was drunk or sober - he is a shoemaker; I knew them both before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is it true, that after you came up the prisoner kicked the deceased, as the man has described? A. I cannot swear that he kicked him - I was trying to separate them; the deceased had hold of the prisoner by the collar, about the breast of his jacket, not his cravat - I saw no tipsy woman about, and heard nothing about the prisoner's mother.</p>
               <p>Q.Was he not held so as to prevent his breathing? A.He spoke to me; I cannot swear whether Irving kicked him or not - Irving said, "Part him, take him away from me."</p>

            . I am house-surgeon of the hospital. I was in the accident-ward on the evening of the 24th of May, when the deceased was brought in - he in great pain, and said he had received a violent kick in the lower part of the abdomen, from a man in a quarrel; there was no external mark at the time, but he complained of great agony - he was put to bed immediately; I attended him till he died, which was between one and two o'clock in the morning, on the 30th, I think - he was examined afterwards; there was an extensive inflammation of the peritonceum, also inflammation throughout the whole course of the intestines; the stomach was much inflamed - there was also an ulceration of one of the intestines, with adhesion to the peritonoceum; the other parts of the body were healthy - the severe inflammation was the cause of his death, and that was the result of some external violence; a violent kick would certainly produce such consequences - the ulceration must have been going on some time, on account of the adhesion which was under the particular part where I understand he received the injury; a blow given shortly before he was brought in, would produce that ulceration by the time I examined it - the inflammation could not be of long standing; a kick in that part was certainly sufficient to produce death - a fall, or any violence, would do it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.If in the struggle he had fallen on some hard substance, it might have caused those appearances? A. It might - the violence was rather about the groin; I conceive the ulceration to be the result of the inflammation - if inflammation had existed before, he would have complained of pain; no inflammation could be going on without pain - I should not think him addicted to drink; the liver was healthy - he was stout, and predisposed to inflammation; such an injury would be more likely to be fatal to a stout man.</p>
               <p>JOHN TUSTIN. I had known the deceased about twelve months - he was a very hardy, strong man; I saw him two days before this - he did not complain of any thing.</p>
               <p>THOMAS BATES. The blow was made at the deceased's face by the man who said he should like to have a round with him; whether the blow struck him, I do not know - I looked for Martin, and when I turned again, I saw the man who struck the blow and McGinnis on the ground; there were about twenty people about.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">WILLIAM JEFFERSON</hi>. I live at 21, South Audley-street. About April I was applied to by a person—I have a slight impression it was Henning—a book of the Animals' Friend Society had been left at my house the day before, and I gave the money, and received this receipt—the book was left with me, and I gave it to the Mendicity Society—it was like this one (<hi rend="italic">produced—this was headed</hi>, "<hi rend="italic">An Appeal on behalf of the Animals' Friend Society," and contained a long list of patrons, the names of a committee and officers, and a list of subscribers; the office was described as at 18, late</hi> 403, <hi rend="italic">Strand</hi>)—I parted with my money, believing it to be a <hi rend="italic">bond fide</hi> society, and I intended to give more largely—seeing the names of many persons I knew, and many of good standing and character, made me believe it was a good society, and I considered it was the old society of which I had often heard—I know Mr. Stevenson, whose name is in the book, and that had an influence in inducing me to subscribe: but it struck me as strange seeing" M.D." to his name, which I knew he was not—I also know Sir Charles Forbes. <hi rend="italic">Henning. Q</hi>, Will you swear it was me called at your house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No. <hi rend="smallCaps">THOMAS STEVENSON</hi>. I am a surgeon, in Upper Gloucester-street. Hen<lb></lb>ning called on me about March—some one had called before, and left this book of the Animals' Friend Society (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—Henning gave me a second one, as well as a book of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, to compare the merits of the two, and to show how little the Royal Society had done with such large means, and how much he had done with such small means—the first person who called asked for a subscription, and I paid him one—what induced me to pay it was my admiration of such a society, believing it to be a genuine one, and wishing to serve it—I believed that, from the long list of patrons and names which he brought me, some of</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184909170086"></xptr>
               <p>whom I know—the list, had very considerable influence in inducing me to part with my money—among the names there are, the Hon. Miss Vernon, who lives near me; Lord Templemore; Sir Edward Turner, and others, whom I do not know personally, but I know to be respectable; besides which, I saw some papers like this in the book, (<hi rend="italic">a subscription</hi> paper,) filled up by some persons in the neighbourhood—I believe the "<hi rend="smallCaps">HON</hi>. Miss Vernon, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>." was one, and that influenced me—my receipt is signed by Hen<lb></lb>ning and Hodgson—I paid Hodgson 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and desired him to call again—my name appears as one of the committee in some of these books, but it did not in the book which Henning gave me—I gave him no direct authority to put my name down as one of the committee, but I begged him to call again, and I would see if it was a respectable, <hi rend="italic">bond fide</hi> society, before I gave him any further assistance—he had no reason to believe I gave him permission to put my name down—I required the most positive proof that the committee were respectable, and the money properly applied, before I gave him any more assistance—he promised to send some of the committee to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Henning. Q.</hi> Did not I call on you, in consequence of a communications by Hodgson? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I conversed about the society—I afterwards received a long explanatory letter from you—I have not got it here—I received a letter from you yesterday, in consequence of which I have brought all the papers here to-day—I advised you to let a committee-man call on me, and if I found the committee to be respectable I should be happy to assist—you did not say the committee could not put themselves out of the way to do so; you pro<lb></lb>mised to let them call, and I heard nothing more of you—you said the dona<lb></lb>tion I gave should not be spent for the present year—I asked you what salary you received as secretary—you said, 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I promised to call at the office, 403, Strand, and make inquiry about the rent, and I asked you about the society being in debt—I said I would know all that, before I paid any further subscription—I do not recollect your saying you had matter at the printer's which you could not put up till you had my answer whether I would be on the committee—I have no recollection of anything of the sort—the circumstance of my name appearing there with" M.D. "to it, is sufficient proof that it was not with my authority—I believe I signed my name in full to the subscription-paper, but you will not find" M.D. "to it.</p>

Henning came there on 22d Nov., said he belonged to the Animals' Friend Society, and asked me if I had an office to let, that he was removing from the Animals' Friend Society at the West Strand, as other parties required the room—No. 18, Strand, is in the West Strand—I let him have the counting-house at 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a quarter, until I got him a room—he said it was to carry out the Animals' Friend Society—he subsequently asked me to let him have a large room for the committee-meeting—no committee ever met there, and there was never any society there except Henning—he left me a receipt, and asked me, if any-body came, to receive the subscription—I believe I did so, not above once or twice—I afterwards let him two rooms—there was a bed in one—he might have slept there once or twice, but he did not in general.</p>

Q.</hi> Did you then admit before the Magistrate that you had gone to the Police-courts and found what was stated in my book was correct? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not; I said I had made inquiry about you at 403, Strand—I was requested to attend the examination, by a person from whom you had obtained a subscription—I told the Magistrate we had had repeated com<lb></lb>plaints of your having applied for subscriptions to persons who paid you believing they were paying it to us—there was a witness then produced, who</p>

                  </hi>. I am the chief-constable of the Mendicity Society—I apprehended Henning and Roberts on 28th July—I showed Roberts two receipts for money; one he admitted to be his writing—he said, "Whatever money I have received I paid over to Henning"—I told Henning he was charged with obtaining money by false pretences, and told him there was no society—he said he could prove there was—I afterwards searched his room, and found this paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) signed by three persons, and also the books and the bill and receipt which have been produced—I afterwards apprehended Croton, and told him he was charged with receiving money under false pre<lb></lb>tences—he said" All I have received I paid over to Henning; I am very sorry I knew him; he lodged at my mother's house; I am sorry I was ever connected with him"—he said he was to have 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the first 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., he re<lb></lb>ceived and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for every other, and that he left the service in consequence of an exposure taking place at the Lambeth police-court—I have made inquiry as to who John Porch is, of St. Margaret-terrace, and find him to be a tailor, living in a back kitchen—I have made inquiry of the Hon. Miss Vernon, whose name is here, and have received a certain communication from her—(<hi rend="italic">the paper was here read, as follows:</hi> "Committee-room, Duke of Clarence, London-road, Southwark. Sept. 14,1848.—At a meeting of the committee, held this evening, present the under-mentioned gentlemen, it was proposed by Mr. Porch, and seconded by Mr. Taylor, that on account of there not being members enough to form a quorum of three, the financial part of the business of the 'Animals' Friend Society' be deferred till the Christmas quarter; but the principal object of the society, the prevention of cruelty to animals, to be persevered in. <hi rend="italic">Signed</hi>, John Porch, 9, St. <hi rend="italic">Margrett-terrace</hi>, Westminster; Robert Taylor, William-street, Kent-road John Parry Henning, secretary.") <hi rend="smallCaps">RICHARD FERGUSON</hi>.

I had directions to read a paper to them, to invite them to return on the old terms; they met in a field near the Dock, there were nearly three hundred of them. I read this paper audibly to them: (reads.) "Notice to extra coopers, employed in the West India Docks. Those men who do not answer to their names, and come to work as usual, will not be again employed in the Docks." They appeared to consult among themselves. I called Armsworth out from among them, to answer; he came from the body, and told me the men would not come to wait the ten minutes beyond the time; and, if ever they did come to work, they would have 6 s. a-day, instead of 5 s., which they were paid before. Their hours for work, were from eight till four. I gave no answer to it, but walked away with my officers about me; they remained some time assembled, and as I passed by them, they cheered once or twice, I think three times.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the first time you knew of any general dissatisfaction - A. I had given notice on the 4th, they expressed dissatisfaction before that, Saturday was the first day. The rum and sugar coopers are under different officers; this regulation did not apply to the rum coopers. We were very busy at the time. I think there were as many men employed as I ever remember.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. Q. You are minister to the Dock Company, at the sugar department - A. I am principal cooper; I had the foreman of the coopers with me. The order for them to stay till ten minutes past four o'clock, was issued on Saturday, the 4th; they walked out at four o'clock, on hearing the order, without a murmur, they would not stop. They had 6 s. a-day from 1812 to 1816; the Dock-master then gave me an order to pay them 5 s.</p>
               <p>Q. Having first reduced their wages, they then cut them off to half days sometimes - A. They did reduce them to half days, they were first paid for a quarter of a day, and then for half a-day. After reading the paper, I saw them consulting together, and called Armsworth out, as he was a man of intelligence; he was one of the sugar coopers, he was generally active, and was so that morning, he was one of the most active. I did not see any of the defendants when I read the paper.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. How long have you been in the Company's service - A. From 1802. Captain Parish came into the service five years ago; he has done a great deal of good for the coopers.</p>
               <p>Q. He did away with the quarter of days, and did not allow refreshment from the masters of the ships to the coopers. - A. That was never allowed. We pay the men by the day; if they only work one day, many of them want their money, but if they expect employ to the end of the week, they wait. The permanent men are paid at the end of the week. I only know Smith by name. I believe neither of the other defendants were ever in the Company's employ. I know they were not at that time when the 1 s. a-day was added in 1812; it was done by the men petitioning. I never heard of their petitioning against it, when it was taken off. Petitions are sent to the Dock-house. I do not remember Smith and Kirk delivering me a petition in 1816.</p>
               <p>Q. After the dispute, the men on the rum side, continued at work - A. Yes; a paper was handed about among them. Petitions are sent to the Dock-house, that is the mode in which the men state their complaints.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. There was a paper handed about in 1816 - A. I do not recollect it; a paper was handed about in the rum department, the men wanted 6 s. a-day. Captain Parish is principal man in the Docks, the 1 s. a day was taken off in 1816; when he came into the employ; the half days were made about that time, and the men were thankful for it.</p>
               <p>Q. They insisted on their stopping ten minutes, and then the murmuring began - A. There had been papers handed about before, but there was no regular murmuring, they murmured when they were reduced from 6 s. to 5 s. Some of them continued in the employ, they are only extra men who could not get work elsewhere.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any murmuring till they were kept ten minutes longer - A. No. The men were discharged on the 7th, a constable was stationed at the gates on the 7th.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell what the three hundred men assembled near the gate for? on your oath was it not to go to work - A. No; for they gave it out that they would not come to work, they did not attempt any violence to the docks, they said the night before, they would not come to work without another shilling.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182112050060"></xptr>Q. Who did you hear say so - A. One Keamer and Armsworth, he was generally a prominent man, I cannot say how long Smith has been in the service of the Company - I never heard any complaint against him.</p>

               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. To how many warehouses did this order apply - A. There are eleven, one was unoccupied, the order applied to the five beyond the clock, the most distant from the gate. I have the order here, it is dated 7th of August, 1821, and addressed to myself, signed Charles Parish; (reads) "You will give orders to the foreman of the coopers, at No. 5, 7, 8, 9, and 10, that any cooper who declines to wait at the warehouse, where he has been employed, till his name has been called in the usual way; is to be informed he will not be employed on the following day, and is to be paid that day for the work already performed."</p>
               <p>Q, They assembled on the 8th, and said they would not come to work without another shilling, was that said by Keamer and Armsworth among a number of them - A. They were in the ring, and spoke for the whole of them.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. The side the order was made for was not Smith's - A. No. I do not know whether he was among the men.</p>

            . I am principal Dock-master at the West India Dock. I have the charge of the warehouses, and property therein, I am answerable for the subordination and sobriety of the men. The order produced was written by me, in consequence of what I understood to be an objection on the part of the coopers; my first order was that they should not proceed to the gate from the middle of the dock, till ten minutes after the bell rang, to prevent too great a crush; the bell rings at four o'clock; we had 300 men in the docks at the time, besides revenue officers - the coopers had resisted the search at the gate, and had collared the constable, it is usual to search every labourer as he leaves the gate - there are two narrow, and one large gate. The order was to prevent too great a crush to prevent a search, they were not to work during the ten minutes; it is usual to call over the men's names going in, and coming out, to see that they have been at work all day. The order was issued on the 4th of August, we had one hundred more men in the docks then, than was ever employed in my time before; we had fifty ships laden with sugar unloaded on the 4th.</p>
               <p>Q. Between the 4th and 7th was any intimation given to you by the coopers - A. None whatever, the first intimation I had, was on the morning of the 7th after twelve o'clock, and I sent Adams down to explain to them the intent of the order, that it was for their comfort as well as the regulation of the Dock. There was about three hundred less at work on the 8th, than on the 7th, we had occasion for an equal number, the deficiency continued fifteen days and during the time, ships came in daily; there was ninety-four ships when the body returned, some few men returned before that; we worked from six o'clock till six, instead of four o'clock, to make up the deficiency. At this time orders were issued to get coopers from Bristol, and Liverpool, Thompson and Newman were sent down for that purpose, and about ninety men came up from the two Ports; I gave an order to the foreman of the rum coopers, for them to assist on the sugar side, they declined it to a man. I received orders to employ any coopers who offered themselves, and put a notice up at the gate to that effect - I have a copy of it, the orignal was torn down, and I have not seen it since; I had forty or fifty copies of it from the printer; twelve were stuck up, and I gave some to be sent to places where coopers resorted. I will swear this is one of those the printer sent me, for I have had it ever since. (reads.)</p>
               <p>Notice, A communication having been laid before the Court of Directors, purporting to contain the grounds of the coopers leaving the Company's service, and the terms they intend to return to their duty. Notice is hereby given that the coopers having been dismissed, is not true, and those who chose to return at the original pay are welcome to do so, but the Directors will not pledge themselves to any other terms.</p>
               <p>H. LONGMAN.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. Q. When did you first come into the Company's service - A. In June, 1816. I have authority to make orders, for regularity, I issued the order for the ten minutes extra, myself; I made regulations, which I thought for the improvement on the Dock. I ordered the half days as an improvement on the quarter days, in consequence of a representation made to me by the principal cooper. I did not make an order for the quarter day. The order for staying ten minutes, applied to about one hundred and forty men out of three hundred; I never heard of a petition about the half, and quarter day. When I entered the service, the men had 6 s., a day, being the war wages; they were not allowed to work over time then; the wages were reduced by an order of the Court, about six months after I entered the Company's employ, I have no authority to reduce wages, I made no representation to the Court previous to the reduction. Petitions go through my hands, I heard of none on the subject.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the Dock gate shut against the men in the morning - A. No; there was always two constables at the gate. I gave orders, that unless they returned to work they would not be admitted.</p>
               <p>Q. What had they done the night before - A. Run away from work, and rushed out at the gate the moment the bell rang.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they not refused admission in the morning - A. Nobody applied, they kept at a distance from the gate, to make a treaty.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What office do you hold - A. I am called principal dock-master, and sometimes principal store-keeper; I am called captain from courtesy. Smith was in the service when I entered it, he was on the rum side, I gave an order for the rum coopers to work over time, and they did, for two or three day, that was a few days before the coopers returned, or a few days after, I am not sure which. The act of parliament is imperative, that the men shall work eight hours a days without cessation, a quarter of an hour, or twenty minutes, is given by the officer, for refreshment. I presume, some of them came from a considerable distance, I considered it my duty to order them to remain ten minutes, to prevent them being crushed, or resisting the search.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear of a resistance before the order was made - A. The resistance was in consequence of the order; they collared the constable on the third,, the day before the order, they would not be rubbed down. Most men on the rum side have been on the sugar side;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182112050061"></xptr>I believe Smith is a good workman, I do not remember his bringing me a petition when the wages were reduced, it must have been years after, I never had any intercourse with him about the reduction; I have some recollection of him, and Kirk bringing a petition, about three years ago, which caused two men to be made permanent. Smith was discharged about three weeks ago, by his foreman, he was one of those who worked overtime, I had no occasion to find fault with him; I had given orders, that the one hundred and forty men should not come to work, some of them came for their tools.</p>
               <p>WR. WALFORD. Q. On the 3rd, a report was made to you of a great pressure and disturbance at the gate - A. Yes; that was the sole reason of my issuing the order. I believe the men had drank too much beer, the rum coopers worked two or three days over time on their own side, and were paid for day and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the order about half days - A. In the busy time, every man who came was employed, and when we were not busy, we could not employ all; good workmen could get employ in the trade, and indifferent ones stand at the gate every day for employ. Our work is very precarious, and at times we want a man in the middle of the day; if they worked an hour, they were only paid for an hour; my order was, that they should be paid for half a day, if they worked at all, and that they should be employed for half a-day or the whole, if they worked more than half a day, they were paid for the whole day.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you know the regulations about half days and hours, before you came to have the superintendance - A. When I came they were paid for the time they worked, these regulations do not apply to permanent coopers, they are always paid, whether they work or not.</p>

            . I was employed in the West India Docks, as sugar cooper, in August last. On the morning of the 8th, there was a meeting of the coopers, near the Dock gate, there were upwards of three hundred men, I was there; Adams spoke to me. On the next evening, Thursday, I attended a meeting, at the Lord Hood, public-house, (on the 8th,) there were a great many coopers there, but none of the defendants. On Thursday, the 9th, there was a meeting, at the Angel, public-house, in the Minories, there was so many, the room would not hold them; I was in the room, I do not know how many there were outside, there was more than hundred in the room; Smith was there. I saw the other defendants down stairs, I think I saw Hall at the door, but only saw Smith in the room. I am not positive that I saw the others, it was after seven o'clock, in the evening. I took the part of conducting the sugar coopers, I sat in the chair, the proposition was about supporting the men, several strangers spoke. Smith proprosed, that the men should have 3 s. a day, for the time they were out of employ; the proposition was carried. Some said 3 s. was too much, they could not meet the demand. I did not hear Smith say any more, he stood on the bench to propose it, and when carried, he got down. The purpose they met for, was to be supported while they were out employ, on the sugar side of the West India Docks. The money was to be rose by subscription, men were proposed to go round to the different shops, cooperages, brewhouses, and vinegar yards, and all trades that required coopers; and the men in work were to pay 2 s. 6 d., a week, to make the fund. It was said at the meeting, that the rum coopers were likewise to contribute, they were not to strike, but work, and support us while we were out of employ; I do not know who made this proposal, it was carried. We met again, on Saturday night, the 11th, at the same place, to receive 7 s. a man, which was to be distributed, I saw Hucks, Smith, and Hall there, no chair was taken, Forman was not there. I received 8 l. 15 s., at the rate of 7 s. a man, for my twenty-five men, who belonged to the warehouse, No. 9, on the sugar side, I received it off the table, Hucks counted it out. I went and gave it to my men.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you belong to the Cooper's Union, or Philanthrophic - A. I have entered it since that. We met again, the next Saturday night, the 18th, at the same place, Hucks was there, but I am not sure that I saw Smith, nor either of the others, there were thirty or forty in the room, they were coming and going. I received 4 s., for twenty-three of my men, I received for two short, as they had got employ, or had left. I attended a meeting, at the Angel and Trumpet, Stepney-green, on Monday, the 13th; Hucks was there, I cannot say who else, it was a meeting, to distribute 2 s. a man, I received for twenty-two or twenty-three, money was distributed for all the warehouses. I attended another meeting, at the Ship, Bethnal-green, on the 22d, the day before we returned to work, and received 2 s. each for my men there. I saw several men go in and come out with money. Smith was there, I saw none of the others. I saw Hall on the green in the day time; nothing passed at that time. I attended at the

            , public-house, Stepney, every one of the fifteen days that we were away. On the second Monday, in the morning, I saw Hall in the tea-gardens of the house, there were two or three hundred sugar coopers assembled, and Hall came in with fifteen or twenty men who had come from Bristol and Liverpool. Hall said he had brought the men who had come up by coach for the Dock Company, and we must take care of them, they were taken from there, and refreshment given them. Hall went away with them. On that day week, after we returned to work, I attended a meeting at the Angel, public-house, and saw Smith, Hall, and Hucks there. Forman was not there, there were nearly two hundred coopers. Smith presided, the business was for the sugar coopers to subscribe 2 s. 6 d. a week, to refund back to the Philanthropic Society, the money paid to the men; which they had advanced, different persons brought in accounts of money advanced to the Philanthropic Society. Hall claimed, and had allowed him 5 s. a day for his loss of time in conducting the Liverpool and Bristol men to the Ben Johnson public-house, and from there to the coaches, and for maintaining them whilst they were in his charge. I believe he also brought in a bill of 45 l. besides, for expences. I took a memorandum of it, (producing it) I took it to satisfy the sugar coopers that the money had been faithfully distributed. 5 l. 18 s. 6 d. was claimed on the part of Foreman, for his expences to Bristol and back, he went to inform the coopers that the West India Dock coopers were discharged, and that there were more coopers out of employ in London than could find work, he was not present. Hucks made the same<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182112050062"></xptr>claim as Hall for time and expences in attending in Lambeth-street, in consequence of a warrant issued against him by Bull and Hawkins, who, he said, charged him with carrying them from the Dock gates as they were going in to work. He was allowed 2 l. expences, and 11 l. for the lawyer's bill. Price in the Commercial-road was his lawyer. The money was voted to him, and he said he was satisfied. Hall was with Hucks at Lambeth-street. I was appointed by the meeting to inform the sugar coopers at the West India Docks of the expenditure of the money, and solicit their 2 s. 6 d. subscription.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this paper? - A. This is a paper I got from the meeting, where the accounts were adjusted; it is the receipt and expenditure of the money - it was just written when it was delivered to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. Q.Don't you think you were one of the worst among them? - A. I am not my own judge: I heard of no meeting at which I was not present.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose service are you now in? - A. When at home I am at my own service, now I am at your service. I am not in the employ of the Dock Company. I returned for about a fortnight, and then went away because I did not like to stop. I gave information when I was stopped from going into the Docks; they did not receive me, but ordered me to go to the Dock House: I went and worked three days after the men went in. I was never here before.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps never in any other Court? - A. I have been in Chancery.</p>
               <p>Q. Any other? - A. I am but a single individual, if you come to the point I will give you an answer; if you flurry me I may perjure myself. I have been at Hick's Hall.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you the gentleman who was convicted at Hick's Hall of knocking down your own father? - A. I was convicted of an assault; but it was through three prostitutes whom my father knew: the Lord Chancellor is in the possession of the whole of it. I always thought, that by the laws of this country, a man was not to be told of conviction. It was eight years ago. I was tried for a libel in charging my father with murder.</p>
               <p>Q. You were spokesman at the Dock gate? - A. Yes, I was picked out by the principal master cooper; I did not set myself up to speak for them, they quite forced me to it. The same men attended at the meeting, and they put me in the chair. I did not assume the power of keeping order, I was quite a novice at it. I stated to the meeting, that the object was to get a livelihood; others spoke before me. The meeting was in such a confused state I sat in a chair; but was not aware that I was to rule when the people belonging to the club were there; mine was like another chair, only larger, but too low for me to be chairman. They were all speakers at one time, and no hearers; the club might assemble without my knowledge, they did not always inform me; they sent a man to Bristol without my knowledge. I was present when it was agreed for one to go to Bristol and one to Liverpool. When I was sent for I went.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to the club, intending to betray whom? - A. Oh! dear Sir, quite the reverse, my principle is, I had rather be convicted.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been forced to be a witness? - A. By the law I am forced to be here.</p>
               <p>Q. When you returned to work, did you not tell the men, that as you had headed them out you would head them in? A. I said, "As we all came out together, let us go in together:" I never used the word heading.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever propose going to Liverpool or Bristol free of expense, to prevent the coopers from coming up? - A. I said, "If you are such a lover of your trade, I would go for nothing." I addressed the whole meeting; I told them I could not go down, as I had a law suit to attend to. A committee of eleven was appointed, but not by me. I was appointed first; the whole body of coopers forced me into the chair.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. After you were accused of assaulting your father, were you imprisoned twelve months? - A. Yes. He was dead when I came out.</p>
               <p>Q. You was on the sugar side? - A. Yes: I worked beyond the clock. The order applied to me - I was not a permanent man. I was there when the Dock was built in 1802.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not stimulate the coopers to resist the order, and say, if they did not resist there would be further encroachments? - A. I told the foreman I was subject to the rheumatism, and could not stop, for I was always in a perspiration when I left work, and if I stood ten minutes I should be laid up. I disapproved of the order. I recommended no man to resist. I said I could not put up with it, as I was subject to the rheumatism; but they might do as they liked. I was determined to leave the employment as my health would not admit of it. The order was, that if we did not obey we must be dismissed. Several men said they would take their money and not come again. I went to the gate next morning for my money, and went into the Dock to fetch my tools. The body of them left the service. I was not addressing the men when Adams selected me; he said they were all speaking, and he could not hear them, and selected me: three or four men came to me and said tell him this, and I told him they would not come to work unless they had 6 s. a day. I did not propose to lead them to any public house, nor propose that the rum men should be invited to join us.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you attend before any of the directors when Read was there about a petition? - A. I did; and told the committee that the Docks were considered a disgrace to the slave market in the West Indies. I was sent by the men, who desired me to repeat those words: it met the general approbation of the men. A gentleman named Hurcott interfered; I was censured for concurring with him in getting the men back. I said the rum coopers were determined we should not go in, and I had been very ill used by some of them, and said I would leave it altogether, and went to Hurcott. I was ill treated and knocked down for persuading them to go in. I did not urge the men to resist the efforts which Read and Raven were making to get them to go back, not to my recollection: I said, "Stick altogether, all go in, or all stay out, don't go away to different places; as we all come out let us all go in together." A list was to be made of who would go in or stop out: I said I was determined to go in, and at last the list was turn up, and all were going in. The rum coopers wanted us to stop out another day. I asked the rum men if they would throw away a day; they said no: then, said I, "We will not:" this was the night before we went in. I did not make a speech to the men.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Can you write? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182112050063"></xptr>Q. Look at this and say if you ever saw it before? - A. It is not my writing, I never saw it before to the best of my knowledge. I was convicted of assaulting my father in 1813; he was 70 years old. He owned on his death bed that he purchased the witnesses against me. I have been tried twice for common assaults. I was not forced to go to the meeting, I was appointed by the men to go, and went to serve them. I believe I spoke once or twice at the Angel.</p>
               <p>Q. It was all unwillingly? - A. Unwillingly; I never heard about the advance till I was out of the Docks. I did not make a speech at the gardens when the Bristol and Liverpool men came. Hall came and asked me to request the men to give them three cheers, for it was a great victory obtained in falling in with them from the different coaches; we gave three cheers, and the countrymen returned it. I attended a committee of the Dock Company after Hurcott interfered: the committee said I espoused the cause too warm.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever go to the newspaper office about this business? - A. Yes; to put three advertisements in; I did it at the request of the body. Smith said the rum coopers were to stop in and contribute alike to support the others. He did not tell me to advise them to petition.</p>
               <p>MR. SERGEANT BOSANQUET. Q. Have you been paid your wages? - A. Yes; only what was due to me for work.</p>

            . I am a cooper employed on the sugar-quay. I worked in warehouse No. 4. I attended a meeting at the Angel three days after the strike, on a Friday morning. I saw Farnworth in the chair; a man named Smith was there. Farnworth was chairman, and was holding forth before them all what was best to be done. Several persons spoke; and one called Smith said,</p>
               <p>"You certainly men have been very ill used, but if you are willing to enter into a subscription for these men who stand out for wages, they shall have at the rate of 3 s. a day." Farnworth said, "How is this to be supported, and from whence to come?" - Smith said, "I make a motion that the whole trade shall support it, as we have a bye-law that those men who are in work shall subscribe 2 s. 6 l. a week to support those who are not, to protect the rights and privileges of the trade." - Farnsworth said, "How is the money to be made up? I think there are 250 or 300, more or less." - Smith proposed that those present who were in work should subscribe, and said, "For my part, I will give 2 s. 6 d." Farnworth said he would give the same. I don't know whether he said 2 s. 6 d. or 3 s. The room was crowded. Two or three men at the further end said, "You, Mr. Smith, I want to know what you rum coopers are going to do, whether you intend to strike or not." Smith said "I beg you will not have so much to say about the rum coopers, we shall do as we like; we are not going to satisfy you whether we strike or not. I know who you are, thought I cannot get near you; you are a wrangle some fellow, and have always bred a great deal of disturbance." I returned to work on the day her Majesty was buried. I usually worked at No. 4, but I went to No. 10. I met with no difficulty in returning to work.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. Q. Farnsworth was in the chair? - A. Yes: he was entirely spokesman, and the whole body seemed to be led by him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did Farnsworth hold forth? - A. Yes; and he said it was requisite that the coopers should gain their ends, which was impossible, unless the run coopers struck as well as them. Smith (pointing to him), begged one or two to hold their tongues about the rum coopers, as they would do as they thought proper; and I think he said they had drawn up a petition, and presented it to the Dock Company, and would not strike, but wait the issue of the Company's answer. Farnsworth held forth with great violence.</p>
               <p>Q. If you were called on as a conscientious man to say who was the most violent, who would you say? - A. I have seen Farnsworth very busy at many meetings, and think him the most violent man in the company. I only saw Smith at one meeting. Farnsworth was always the most violent, and there is no doubt but all the men were led by him. I returned to work before the rest, and went to several meetings afterwards, but they would not admit me, as they said I was a spy. Farnsworth certainly urged several men to stand out; he begged of me to suffer death sooner than return.</p>

            . I am a cooper and worked in the sugar quay. I was occasionally employed by the company. I attended the first meeting after the strike; I saw Smith there soon after the business commenced; he assured the men present, that 3 s. a day would be allowed during their absence from the West India Docks: one Richards objected to it; but Smith assured the meeting that 3 s. a day would be allowed. I did not hear how the money was to be got. I received some money at the Three Lords, Minories; the first payment was 7 s. the second 2 s. and I received 4 s. afterwards from a man named Munn. I was one of those who struck. There were a great many at the meeting.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. Q. Who was chairman? - A. Farnsworth, he opened the business and conducted it.</p>

            . I was one of the extra coopers. I attended a meeting at the Green Dragon, Stepney, on the 8th; it was attended by a great many. I saw none of the defendants there. I attended another at the Ben Johnson next day, nobody in particular was in the chair; but Farnsworth generally held forth. None of the Defendants were there to my knowledge. The meeting was concerning the infringement of time made by the Company; that was their grievance; they absented themselves on that account; we met there every day till it was settled. I have seen Hall and Smith there. I received money at the Angel to pay 42 men, belonging to my warehouse, No. 4, at 7 s. each; there were 30 or 40 people there. I saw Hall in the room, also Forman and Smith. The money was ready told out on the table with my number to it; I always received the money when the company paid us, and so I received this. I attended to receive it in consequence of a note; Farnsworth I believe told us to go there, and there would be money for us. I received a second sum the following Saturday, at the same place; Smith was there, and I think Forman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODERICK. Q. Were you intimate with any of the men? - A. Yes: many had wives and large families.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Farnsworth was generally spokesman? - A. Yes. I have known Smith 5 or 6 years. I never heard his character subject to the slightest reproach; no man could work more industriously. He was on the rum side; the rum men did not strike.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Then the rum men had nothing to do with it? - A. No: the men had 5 s. a day.</p>

            . I am permanent foreman cooper in the West India Docks. On the Sunday after the strike, Adams sent me to meet the Bristol coach, six coopers came. I was to suffer them to remain in town if they thought proper, and to convey them to the Docks on the next morning. I appointed to meet them on Tower-hill on Monday morning, but they did not come. I went towards the Plough, in Smithfield, where I had left them, and met them in Cheapside, Hall was with them. I told them they were behind their time; they said they had seen some of the trade, and did not intend to go to work. I don't know whether Hall heard them, he was in front, and had a man on each side; he walked on. I remonstrated with them, and finding them straggling towards the east, I was fearful of losing them all, so I moved on with them, and got only two of them to the Docks - there appeared about eighteen altogether.</p>

            . I am an extra cooper in the Docks; Thompson hired me at Bristol at the Hole-in-the-Wall, where the coopers sometimes meet. I saw the defendant Forman there on the 18th, after Thompson had come down to hire men. He said in the presence of about forty coopers, that none of the men on the rum quay had struck, for when they received their week's money it went to support the club till such time as the Company submitted.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you to do with the coopers striking? - A. I went to see some of the coopers off, and saw nineteen go off, and had spoken to Thompson about going myself. I saw two men by the Post-office, who had partly agreed to go, and what they said led me to the Hole-in-the-Wall. Forman came in afterwards, and one of these men said he was sent down by the society of coopers to prevent their coming up, and that all the coopers on the rum quay were at work. I saw him afterwards on the Bristol quay, with

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. The cooper's trade requires an apprenticeship? - A. Yes, seven years. I have 3 s. 6 d. a day at Bristol, and work from six to six.</p>

            . I was a cooper of Liverpool. I was engaged to come to the West India Docks. I came to Ladlane by coach, and met Hall and Hicks there; they asked if we were from Liverpool. There were ten of us in one coach and three in another. We said we did come from Liverpool. They told us to come with them. They took us to the Angel in the Minories, into a large room, and said there was a regular strike among the coopers, and they hoped we would not go to work till they saw further into it. They gave us something to eat and drink; there was nobody but ourselves in the room; they found us at the Peacock, in Whitechapel; we all lodged there two nights. I don't know who paid our expences, we did not. After being there two days we went to Mr. Adams's office, told him what had passed. Five of us went to work on Wednesday and four afterwards.</p>

            . I am a cooper in the West India Docks. Smith was a rum cooper. During the time of the strike, he told me there was to be a meeting at the Shipwrights' Arms. I went to the second meeting; Smith was there, and was proposed by the general class there to be speaker. He said it was requisite to know what the rum coopers intended to do, whether they intended to strike, or what way to proceed, as it was time to come to some decision; but for his part, he would recommend the rum coopers not to strike, and that there might he means taken, such as supporting the men, and sending in an humble petition to the board. Some were for striking and some were not, and the permanent men would have nothing to do with it. They decided, that there should be a collection made of 3 s. each man, to support the men on the sugar side; the resolution was carried. I opposed it, and was roughly treated, and told I was afraid of losing my situation. Davenport also opposed it. Smith recommended the rum coopers not to go over to the sugar quay till they had a satisfactory answer to the petition, which was not then written.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Smith's advice was to petition? - A. Yes: each man was to pay 3 s.; a number of men had large families, who were distressed.</p>
               <p>Q. The subscription was to keep them and their families from starving? - A. Yes. I told Mr. Longman that Smith advised the men not to strike.</p>
               <p>MR. WALFORD. Q. When did you tell Mr. Longman that? - A. After the strike.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You are asked if they had large families; they might have had work in the Docks if they liked? - A. Yes.</p>

            . I am a permanent rum cooper in the Docks. I remember the sugar coopers striking. I was never at any meeting. Smith asked me for money for the coopers who were standing out, about a week after the strike; I said, I thought the permanent coopers had nothing to do in it, and gave him none; he said it was a general thing throughout the Dock that all the coopers were to pay to it: I said I would have nothing to do with it. We were applied to, to assist on the sugar quay.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Would you believe Parish if he swore that Smith worked over his time during the strike? - A. I believe he did two nights on the rum quay: I have known him a long time, and never heard any thing against him.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you ever suspended? - A. I am now suspended on suspicion of being concerned with a man detected in taking rum.</p>

            . I am a cooper at the Docks. At the time of the strike, Smith told me there was a disturbance among the coopers on the sugar side. He called a meeting of the rum coopers at the Shipwrights' Arms; he was there. He and Cook demanded 2 s. 6 d. each from us to support the sugar coopers. The resolution was carried; I paid my 2 s. 6 d.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember when it was proposed to the rum coopers to work on the sugar quay? - A. Yes; Smith was there. A letter was read from the Directors stating, that if we went and worked on the sugar side we should have 7 s. 6 d. a day. Several of them murmured, and said, No, no. Mr. Sturts, who read the order, said, "Not one man." Smith said, "No, not half a man."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. There was a great murmur before he spoke? - A. Yes; the proposal was not to quit our side, but to work the over hours on the sugar side. Smith has been seven or eight years in the service, and bears a good character. I was only off work one day, that was a month or six weeks ago; it was on account of this strike. I was sent down to Captain Parish.</p>
               <p>MR. WALFORD. Q. Is it the practice with the coopers to work with other coopers when they leave in the afternoon? A. Yes, I have done it myself, but now work is slack.</p>

            . I am a cooper, in the service of Barclay and Co.</p>
               <p>Q. In August last, was any information given you to collect from Barclay's men? - A. Yes: (looks at a book); I collected 2 l. 12 s. 6 d. I paid it myself on the 13th of August, at the Angel, Minories, to a person who sat there; Hucks signed the book as a receipt for the money. I afterwards attended a meeting to audit the accounts at the Angel; (looks at a paper), this is the account; I copied it from a paper which was handed round at the meeting.</p>
               <p>[This account was here read. It was a statement of cash received from different persons amounting to 177 l. 1 s. and of expenses amounting to 69 l. 10 s.]</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any other collection? - A. Yes; and paid it at the Rose and Ram, Southwark, to one Hall (not the defendant), for coopers out of work.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you know Farnsworth? - A. By sight; I saw him at the Angel. I attended no meeting till after they returned to work. Farnsworth sat next to me when the accounts were audited, and took a very active part. Smith came in at the close of the business. If a cooper is any thing of a hand he can earn 7 s. a day; and if a good one, from 9 s. to 10 s.</p>
               <p>- LONGMAN, ESQ. I am Secretary to the West Docks. I remember a petition being brought in on the 20th of August, it was laid before the Court on the 21st of 
               <persName id="t18211205-89-person1056">August. After</persName>
             that, I went down to the Docks, and saw Smith, it was between the 21st and 23th of 
               <persName id="t18211205-89-person1057">August. Smith</persName>
             was sent merely to ascertain whether the petition was to be considered as coming from the permanent rum coopers as well as the extra, or from extra coopers only: he avowed it to be the petition of both permanent and extra. The Directors desired that two of the permanent men should be sent for, I believe the officers of the department selected Smith.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You were desired to ascertain from whom it came - A. Yes; Smith was discharged three or four days before this indictment was found.</p>
               <p>The Petition was here read for an advance from 5 s. to 6 s. a day.</p>
               <p>MR. PARISH. The petition was brought down to me. I was desired to enquire if it was from the extra men or both, and to select two to meet the directors. Smith and another man were deputed by the permanent men.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did the rum coopers strike - A. No; I heard they were wavering. The rum quay is the most important branch.</p>

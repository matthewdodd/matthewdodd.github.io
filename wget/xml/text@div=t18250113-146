            . I am in the employ of Mr. Perkins, stationer, Thames-street. On the 8th of December I bought at the prosecutor's warehouse five reams of paper, of the prisoner; it was carried home by Lucas, to whom I paid four sovereigns and six shillings; he brought a bill, with a receipt at the bottom.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Would he not account for it by an entry in your book? A. That is the way he should account for it; the books were in the counting-house then, but since the 18th I have had them at Brixton, in consequence of a discovery. They came to the warehouse every morning.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How ought he to have accounted for this money? A. He should have entered it in the cash-book, which I have examined, and there is no such entry - he never said anything about it. Mr. William Lewis resides in the country.</p>
               <p>MR. RICHARD SIMPSON. I occasionally attend the business in town. The prisoner never accounted to me for this money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was there not a general account, in which he might account for it? A. There was a running petty cash account, out of which he paid small sums - I think it possible that this sum might have been paid in that account, though not brought into the books: I think it possible that if he made up his petty cash-book it might appear. We had great confidence in him.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Who pays the attorney on the other side? A. I do not know; it was his duty to account to Mr. Lewis.</p>
               <p>MR. LEWIS. The petty cash-book which the prisoner has, is merely for the weekly disbursements of stamps, wages, &amp; c. I repeatedly asked him for the account, and before the books were taken to Brixton - he always had an excuse to make. Money received should not be entered in that book. The last entry in the books is on the 18th.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have no doubt but the entry was made in the day-book on the 8th of December: if I received the money I have forgotten to enter it - but a petty cash-book account has been running from the 10th of February: I repeatedly requested Mr. Lewis to settle it, but he always put it off. Ever since the books have been removed I have had no opportunity of seeing whether my accounts are correct or not - I am therefore unable to meet the charge, as I otherwise should.</p>
               <p>JURY to MR. LEWIS. Q. Was he authorised to use money which he received, by making petty disbursements? A. He generally received a cheque for that; he was always desired to pay over all the money he received, but he has at times been allowed to use money which he has received for petty disbursements; it is possible that he might use this so, but not probable; we have not blamed him in that case.</p>

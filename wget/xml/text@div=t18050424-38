               <p>Q. On the 10th of February you observed the Maria cutter, and afterwards you went on shore? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Wren, another officer, commanded another boat? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were going in the execution of your duty, to search for the supposed cargo of the Maria? - A. I did, and when I went on shore, I heard several musquets fired; there were not any shots in the musquets; I did not hear any shots whistle.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you perceive from whence the firing came? - A. Yes, from the village.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it near the place where you found the casks piled up? - A. Close to it.</p>
               <p>Q. How many reports of pieces were there? - A. About half a dozen or more.</p>
               <p>Q. Fired at once or successively? - A. At different times, and several stones were thrown at me and my crew just after we landed.</p>
               <p>Q. When the stones were thrown at you what number of people were there? - A. I could not see many of them just at that time; they all ran away, and went behind hedges or corners of houses; there might be half a dozen or more.</p>
               <p>Q. The stones were thrown at you, and some of your men were hurt by the stones at that time? - A. I ordered my men to return the fire, to clear the beech.</p>
               <p>Q. In order to intimidate and clear the place, your men fired? - A. Yes; I made a seizure of one hundred ankers that lay on the beech, below high-water mark, very near where I landed first, and after that I found out three hundred ankers on the quay.</p>
               <p>Q. How far from where you made the seizure of the first hundred were the other three hundred on the quay? - A. Not a stone's throw.</p>
               <p>Q. At the removal of the one hundred towards the three hundred what took place; where you interrupted? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then they were altogether afterwards; how-many of your men might there be about the four hundred that surrounded the quay at this time? - A. I had thirteen men and myself.</p>
               <p>Q. What hour was it when you secured the hundred to the other three hundred? - A. About eight o'clock in the evening, on the 10th of January last.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of an evening? - A. It was rather a close evening but a very good moon-light.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore it was not totally dark? - A. It was not.</p>
               <p>Q. What took place when you were there? - A. After I secured the seizure, I hauled my boats up, as there was a great deal of sea running on the shore, to secure them from the surge.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you returned of course to protect the seizure? - A. Yes; in the course of the evening there were several men came down that appeared to be smugglers, while I was taking care of the seizure, one of which was a tall man, of five feet ten, with a whip in his hand, a great coat, and boots; he insinuated to me to give up half the seizure.</p>
               <p>Q. That you refused to do? - A. Yes; Joseph George and his wife came down frequently, and informed me that the smugglers intended to attack me, and rescue the goods.</p>
               <p>Q. Did his wife come down with him the first time? - A. No.</p>

             came down to apprize you of their intention? - A. Yes; the smugglers came down often from eight o'clock in the evening till one o'clock in the morning; about one o'clock in the morning they began to attack us with firearms and stones in great numbers.</p>
               <p>Q. How many fire-arms might be discharged? - A. A vast number; I suppose thirty or forty musquets, distinct musquets, and several discharges.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any of your men hurt with the discharge of the first firing? - A. The very first fire of the musquets one of my men was wounded in the head.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of having received their fire, what was done by you and your men? - A. Then we returned the fire as fast as we could; they were behind the boats; we could not get at them, only when they came down in numbers upon us.</p>
               <p>Q. So that they fired upon you from sheltered places, from behind the boats and houses - How long might this sort of work continue? - A. Upwards of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a constant firing kept up by you for the course of an hour? - A. Yes, we fired upon them the whole time.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner did they first come on upon you? - A. They came upon us in a large number, huzzaing.</p>
               <p>Q. During this were any more of your men hurt than you have described? - A. Four more wounded, three dangerously.</p>

             after one o'clock; did he remain with you, or go at any time towards them? - A. He did go after one o'clock, at the conclusion of the skirmish.</p>
               <p>Q. For what did you send him towards them; with any instructions? - A. I did it in order to intimidate them, if he could, to secure the seizure, and if it had not been for him we should have lost the seizure, and been fairly beat; he contributed very much to our help.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was he absent - Was his wife near you at the time? - A. She was.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you observe any other woman in the course of the night, that there seemed to have been amongst the parties? - A. There was a pike brought down called one of the fencible pikes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who brought that? - A. Mrs. George brought that to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any offence committed upon you at that time? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. In the morning you seized the goods and carried them off? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not know whether you had an opportunity of making any observations on the prisoner at the bar (look at him) prior to the skirmish? - A. I saw him there; he solicited me to give up his boat, which was seized some months prior to the 10th of January.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seized any boat of his some months before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And he applied to you on this occasion for the return of the boat? - A. I told him I could not do any such thing; he might ask Capt. Stoneham in the morning, if he pleased.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear satisfied or not with this answer? - A. Not perfectly, I thought.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he continue or stop talking with you? - A. Some little time, and then he went away; I do not know where he went.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot identify his person as being one of those who assaulted you and Mr. Wren, who are commissioned officers of the Excise? - A. Mr. Wren is not a commissioned officer; he is a cutter's mate.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. That is conferred on him by the Excise? - A. Yes, he is one of the crew of our cutter.</p>
               <p>Q. There were more than three people at the time this firing was? - A. I could not see the musquets, they were out of my sight.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear their explosion, so as to be satisfied there were more than three people at that time? - A. Certainly there were.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you form a judgment of the number that were there that fired? - A. I cannot tell that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q. Just tell the number of reports there might be? - A. Half a dozen.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you ever see three men at a time that were there? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think the firing was such, that it was impossible that all that firing came from one or two musquets, successively used? - A. There might be more than two.</p>
               <p>Q. So that the whole firing could not proceed from two musquets? - A. I think not.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you form a judgment of the number of people that were collected at the time the firing ceased? - A. About fifty; they come down with a party of twenty or thirty men with stones, and the firing lasted at intervals for an hour; at one o'clock it began, and continued for an hour, and then it ceased.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He employed me the next morning to get a boat, to assist to carry the goods off on board the cutter.</p>
               <p>Mr. Parry. I did, at seven o'clock in the morning.</p>

               <p>Court. Q.(To Mr. Parry.) At that time, did you know that he was a person, or believe that he was a person, that resisted the seizure? - A. No, I did not have any suspicions.</p>

               <p>Q. Where were you sent to? - A. To assist Mr. Parry; by the signal that we had, we thought he was on shore; we pulled within a mile and a half of the shore, and we met Mr. Parry in a boat; we went from Mr. Parry, and pulled round the bay, to see if we could find any thing, and then we pulled back again to <placeName id="t18050424-38-crimeloc223">Selin Cove</placeName>

               <p>Q. What do you mean by flashes from the shore? - A. From arms, or from musquets or pistols, we could not tell which; we hailed the shore, and some person answered, which we took to be Mr. Parry, and from that we pulled on to the shore.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you went on shore, had you observed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180504240036"></xptr>any thing? - A. No; when we came on shore, the first thing we saw was about an hundred ankers, as nigh as we could guess; Mr. Parry ordered us to carry those goods on the quay; we carried them upon the quay, and after we had done that, we hauled our boats up, and form that we stationed ourselves (by Mr. Parry's orders) each side of the goods, keeping guard over them; the people came down, sometimes ten or twelve, and sometimes three or four at a time, from eight o'clock till one in the morning; they came in different numbers, at different times.</p>

               <p>Q. What people do you mean? - A. Men came down; they had nothing with them as we saw; they kept coming down from that time to I suppose about a quarter before one; there was a good many came down and shook hands with several of us, and said, if you behave civil to us, we shall behave civil to you, and then walked away, and one of them said; d - n him who turns Judas, and walked up to the mob, and whether that man was the first that spoke to us I cannot say; they then said, one and all; they gave three cheers and fired one musquet, or something was fired, and by our officers orders, we returned the same and the cheers also, and so it continued, with heavy firing, with stones between, for ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the firing proceed from more than one gun in the course of ten minutes? - A. I suppose there where two or three musquets firing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they appear to be firing from different musquets? - A. There was a man got between the boats, and he kept a continual firing upon us, not above a stones throw from us; he fired small shot; by the appearance it was a musquet that he had got.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was he firing at the time, while the firing was going on, when you said there were two or three musquets firing? - A. Yes; one of our men presented to him, and fired at him but missed him; this man continued firing from this time a continual firing; the other part of the mob throwing stones as well; I suppose a quarter before one, I received a full charge of the slugs and shot; I had one in each hand, two in my side, and one in my head.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. I observe you to be lame at this time? - A. I have one in my knee at this time, near the bone; I have the shot to shew now which was taken out;

               <p>Q. What took place about one o'clock? - A. There was a man that came to us and shook hands with several of us, and shook hands with me in particular, and said, men, be honourable and we will be the same to you; then he went away, and said, d - n and b - r the first that turns Judas, and went up the hill to the mob, and gave three cheers, one and all, then they began heaving of stones, and fired one musquet in the first place.</p>
               <p>Q. Any firing afterwards? - A. Yes, there was firing afterwards at different places, at a corner of a house, and then again between the boats.</p>

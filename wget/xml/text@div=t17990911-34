            ; he took the deal and set it down by the gate, at the end of the saw-pit, and then he went to the gate and looked both ways, and then he came and took the deal upon his shoulder; he could not see me, but I could see him plain enough; before he was round the corner of the yard I came out, and saw him; I followed him and caught him, by the time he got into the main street, Shoreditch; I took hold of him; says I, you have stole it out of my yard; he turned round and said, I have made a mistake; yes, says I, I believe you have; the one that he had bought was about half the size of that, and only one-cut in it; that was three quarters, and the other was three eighths.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the yard was it in? - A. Not nigh where the other was; I told him, I lost two last week, and you are likely enough to be the man; he offered to pay me for it; I told him that would not do; he had got plenty of money in his pocket; he had got gold and silver, but I would not take any. Mr. Mason, the officer, happened to come by, and I gave him charge of him; he took him to the office; the prisoner told me he lived in Hackney-road, but we found out that he lived in Castle-street, at the back of Shoreditch church.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the deal board you found upon this man's shoulder was the same that was in your yard? - A. I am sure it is the same; I never lost sight of him till I laid hold of him by the collar.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is Castle-street from the Hackney-road? - A. About two hundred yards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You asked him where he was going with the board, and he told you he was going home? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You told him he had got a wrong board, and he told you he had made a mistake? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Did he take the one that he had bought besides? - A. No.</p>

             sworn. - I took charge of the prisoner from Mr. Ireland, on the 2d of July; I heard him offer to pay Mr. Ireland for it, saying it was a mistake; the board is here, and also the board that he purchased (they are produced); one is sawed in two pieces, and the other in six.</p>
               <p>Q. Must the prisoner have known that the one he purchased was only cut in two pieces and not in six? - A. Yes; it was the thickness he asked for.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. (To Ireland.) Q. The ends are left fastened together, the saw is not carried through to the end? - A. No; the end that is loose is downwards, and he looked at it, and said, it was but two pieces that he wanted.</p>

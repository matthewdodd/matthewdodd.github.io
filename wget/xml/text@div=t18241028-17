            . I am an officer. On the 16th of September, about ten o'clock in the morning I met the prisoners together at the corner of St. Paul's Church-yard; they saw me looking at them, and seperated. I took Dewell, and found two pairs of silver hand spectacles on him. I took Jessup in about two hours, but found nothing upon him.</p>

On the 16th of September, about ten o'clock, Jessup came into my shop, and asked to see a small telescope, which I reached him from the glass case, where these spectacle hand frames were, and in the mean time Dewell came in, and wanted to see a measuring tape - I turned my back to them both to reach a telescope for Jessup. Dewell said he thought the tape too dear, but would tell his friend, and away he went. Jessup had not enough money to pay for a telescope which he fixed upon, and said he would call again for it, but never did. In about ten minutes I missed two hand frames, and a telescope. The officer produced the frames.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. How do you know them - A. By their appearance. One has glasses and the other not: there is something about them by which I know them, but which I cannot describe. I have no doubt of their being mine. The prisoners appeared not to know each other.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Will you swear to Dewell - A. I certainly will not swear positively to either of them, but have no doubt of them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a mine share-dealer—on Saturday evening, 19th November, I left the Jamaica coffee-house with a friend, Mr. Tyack, to walk to the Strand—we were arm in arm, and in Fleet-street, nearly opposite Fetter-lane, there is a shop with a doll in the window—a great mob had assembled—my friend went before through the crowd, and I followed him as near as I could—when I got half-way through, I felt a shove, and a man's hand at my side, by ray waistcoat pocket, and I felt a man take ray watch—I collared him, and demanded my watch—he said that he had not got it—I told him he had; and on that, the prisoner ran up as if he was going to embrace him, and I saw him pass the watch into the prisoner's hand, who ran up Fetter-lane as fast as he could—I followed him, crying "Stop thief!"—he ran into a court, and then three or four hundred yards further into another court, where I found him in a policeman's hands, and charged him with having my watch—he denied it—he was searched, but it was not found—we took him fifty or one hundred yards further, and a little boy said that the watch was in the prisoner's hand—the prisoner grasped his hand—he dropped the watch, and I picked it up.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> The watch was given to me. I can give a description of the man. I heard somebody say, "Stop him," so I ran away.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Royal-hill, Greenwich. On the 15th of Nov. I was in Nash's beer-shop—the prisoner came in, and said, "Mrs. Nash, I have got an order for six pots of beer, from a young man named Bush, who works opposite the Circus"—he produced a paper, but Mrs. Nash still doubted it—she had only a gallon can—she said, "This can will not hold it; you have a half-gallon can at the building, you ought to have brought that with you"—he said, "Oh, that will hold it"—she put four pots and a pint into the gallon can, and desired me to take the rest down to the building with him—when I got to the comer of the Circus, he said, "Stop; do you see that man going up the plank on the scaffolding, that is our foreman; I do not want him to see us, so you go round that way, and you will find young Bush at the further end; tell him to come round to the back of the building to me;"'and when I got to Bush, he was astonished—the prisoner took the can of beer down to his lodging, instead of going to the back of the building.</p>

                  </hi>. I did not authorise the prisoner to get this beer in my name—I never allow the men to have beer without I give a ticket—I did not give him this ticket on the 15th of Nov.—it is not my writing, nor was it written by my authority—I did not send him with it, or know of his going.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman</hi>.) I apprehended the prisoner in a public-house—he was pointed out to me by the prosecutor—I said, "You are charged with getting six pots of beer in another man's name"—he said a man gave him the ticket, and he was answerable for the beer—he said,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184411250178"></xptr>
               <p>"There is no name signed to the paper, and what can they make of it?"—on going to the station, he said he took the beer home to his own lodg<lb></lb>ing—that was the day after it happened.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did not I say, "What is the charge for? I am guilty of no crime, I shall pay for the beer? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He said he would pay for it if I allowed him to wait.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. The prosecutor would not wait till I received the money for it on Saturday night. At half-past two o'clock, on the Friday, Bush gave me an order for three pots of beer; the rest of the men said, "Are not you going to send us a drop?" I said, "I don't know." I was intoxicated, and not capable of writing. I met a young man, called Roving Dan, who 1 was very happy to see, understanding he had been killed in the tunnel. I said to him, "Go back to Bush, and ask him to make this order into six quarts of beer." I thought he went to him, but it seems he did not; he returned to me with this paper. 1 did not know it was not Bush's writing. I went to the public-house, and told the publican I had an order for six pots, and the man came with me with the three pints. I told him to go to Bush and say I had received the six pots of beer; but he did not return, and I went home with it to my lodging to treat the young man. I was willing to pay for the beer.</p>

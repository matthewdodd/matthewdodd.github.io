            . I live at No. 17, Pollard's-row, Bethnal-green.

             - it was with my mother's consent; he lived with me for about a fortnight after in my mother's house - I think it was in July that I became acquainted with him - I afterwards found, from his own mother and father, that he had been married; when he was taxed with having a wife he went away, saying he would get sufficient proof that he was not married, and he never came back to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Your first acquaintance began in an omnibus? A. It was a Paddington coach - I think it was an omnibus; I was going from Paddington to the City - I cannot say on what part of the road he first spoke to me; when I got out he followed me- I do not know whether I went to Bridge-street, but I crossed the water with him in a boat; I saw him again in two or three days, for the purpose of knowing about my letters - I afterwards saw him by appointment; I did not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183104070041"></xptr>go to the play with him the first time - I did not introduce him to my mother, he introduced himself; I cannot say how long I had been acquainted with him then; I should think it was more than a week.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you go to the play with him before he had seen your mother? A. I did; he wished to speak to me about seeing my mother - I said he could not, being a stranger; he said he would - he left me, knocked at my mother's door, and walked in.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Then you think it was a week or more before he introduced himself to your mother? A. Yes, a week or ten days - I had been twice to the play with him before that; I think this was in July, and we were married in August - I think I could swear it was three full weeks before we were married, but I should not like to swear it; I could not tell where my father was at the time I saw the prisoner - I believe during my acquaintance with the prisoner he was at an aunt's of mine in sloane-street; he was not a prisoner in Whitecross-street: he was not in the habit of visiting us - I never was acquainted with my father's residence; the only time I ever saw him in Whitecross-street was about two months after my marriage - I was twenty-one years of age in January last, which was five months after my marriage; my father never consented to my marriage, to me, because I never asked him, but he did to a part of my family - my name is

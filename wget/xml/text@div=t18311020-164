            . I am a constable of Bayswater. On the 25th of September I saw the prisoner in a field belonging to Mr. Fortesue - I asked where they were going, as it with no therefore, they said, was it not, then they would go back - Gibson's brother, who is younger than these boys, was with them, and he had something with him; they then turned to go behind Lord Hill's - I said there was no thoroughfare that way; I then asked the little boy what he had got - he made no answer; I looked, and found a fowl in his pinafore - I said,"Where did you get this?" the prisoner Gibson replied, they found it across the fields on some hay; I said, "You stole it;" I took the little one and the fowl, and these two prisoners ran away - a gentleman stopped Gibson in the field; Bennett got over the hedge, and was taken there- I took them all, but the little one was dismissed; I found on them a quantity of sun-flower seed, which fowls are particularly fond of.</p>

            . I am the wife of William Nunney - we live in Durham-place, Kensington. We had some fowls; this one produced by the constable is ours - I had seen it safe at half-past three o'clock that day, and it was brought back between six and seven; we live nearly half a mile from where it was found.</p>
               <p>Gibson's Defence. We were all going black berrying, and saw the fowl under the hedge.</p>
               <p>Bennett's Defence. The little boy saw it, and put it into his piuafore: we told him to put it down.</p>
               <p>A witness gave Bennett a good character, and engaged to take him into his service.</p>

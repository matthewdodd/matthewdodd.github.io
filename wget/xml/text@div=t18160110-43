At twelve o'clock, I went home, and went to bed; she lighted my fire, and she bid me good night; I did not lock the door, because there was no key; there was a handle went through the door, and fastened it with, which she took out, and took away with her. She took away the only thing which fastened the door; I did not go to bed directly because she came up in a few minutes again; I had lodged with her about nine weeks. She asked me where my pocket-book was; then she said, you have left it at your washerwoman's; then she told me I must come to the washerwoman's with her; the washerwoman lives in Chancery-lane. I owed Mrs. Lewis about fifteen pounds for board and lodging. My husband wrote to me, if I received the ten pounds in James's-street, Adeiphi, to give her half; I had got five pounds in the Adelphi, and I offered her the whole five pounds in the morning, and she would not take it; I told her I would not give her my money, when she said, she would have my money or my heart's blood, because she said in the evening that I should not eat any more victuals in the house. When she came in she took hold of me, and knocked me down, and struck me three times on my face; I hallooed out murder! Her husband ran up stairs very quick, and told her to open the door, or he would break it open; she opened the door, and he said, Susan, what do you mean by this conduct. I took her up on the Monday following.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable H</hi> 125.) On Saturday night, the 9th of March, I was going along Brick-lane, Spitalfields—I saw the two pri<lb></lb>soners before me—they stopped a gentleman, and spoke to him—he was a little the worse for liquor; and I saw Limbert put her arm round his waist and take a handkerchief from his pocket—Carter was talking to him, but I think she must have seen what Limbert did—Limbert put it under her arm, and went down Wentworth-street—Carter followed—I followed them—Carter held out her hand to take it, and I took them into custody—Car<lb></lb>ter tried very much to get her from me—I do not know who the gentleman was.</p>

               <p>Q. Was that the same description of logwood as you had on board the Abingdon - A. It was, the Abingdon had about eighteen hundred weight of logwood.

               <p>Q. How long has Quelch been with you - A. Eight or ten months.</p>

            . I am a Thames Police surveyor. On Tuesday the 26th of June, at four o'clock in the morning, I was going down Limehouse-reach in a boat. I saw a lug-boat with a tarpaulin over it. I was coming up the river at the time. M'Bride was rowing the boat up, and the tide was running up. I went along-side of the boat and boarded her; I found the boat to contain logwood. I took M'Bride and the logwood into my custody, and brought M'Bride to the Thames Police. The logwood and tarpaulin were shewn to Mr. Thompson the next day. The tarpaulin is marked TS upon the corner, and Thompson across it. I weighed the logwood myself, thirty-one pieces, eighteen hundred weight.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You met M'Bride on Tuesday morning was it - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The tide was running of the Surry side, was it not - A. At that time the Channel run of the Surry side, but he was of the Middlesex side.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. to Mr. Thompson. You saw that tarpaulin at the office - A. I did, it was mine, the same that I saw in the cabin the day before; I marked it TS with paint, that was only for the Abingdon.</p>

            . Q. I believe you were a watchman in the employ of Mr. Thompson - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On the evening of Monday the 25th of June did you go to your master to receive orders - A. I did. Mr. Thompson's servant told me there was no message for me I met Quelch in Seething-lane close by the house. Quelch said, I can put a pound or two in your way if you like, because I know you are poor and got very little work. I said, I would be very willing, provided it was without any danger. He told me that he had been to a man of the name of Cuff, that lived in Thames-street, Bank-side. Cuff told him he had a punt at Stoney-stairs, and we were to put the logwood into it; his boy would take it away the next morning. He told me to go to Cuff to tell him that he sent me to him, to be sure to send the punt up to him the next morning, and if Cuff would not do it I was to go to 
               <persName id="t18100718-30-person327">Brown</persName>
             the prisoner, and tell him Quelch wanted to see him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known Brown before - A. I had seen him before, he lived in a court in Tooley-street. I went to Cuff's house, there was nobody at home; then I went to Brown. I saw Brown that same evening. I told Brown that Quelch wanted to see him. He asked me what it was about, I told him it was some logwood. He said he wanted a job; he came with me to Sabs-passage near the Custom-house, for the purpose of consulting with Quelch at Sabs-passage. Quelch met us the same night; it was dark; I cannot say the time. We all went into a public house and had a pot of beer. Brown said, he must go<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181007180022"></xptr>into Upper Thames-street to get a key of a friend of his to get a lug-boat. When he got me there he left me in the street, and when he came back he told me he could not get the boat he wished to have, but he could get another boat, there was nothing wanted but a tarpaulin. I told him there was a tarpaulin in the Abingdon barge, on board which Quelch was going down. We went on board the lug-boat at Trig-wharf. We went through the bridge; then Brown said he must get a wherry to go on shore. He told me to put the boat into the Custom-house lower road, and that Quelch was waiting for me at the stern vessel of that teer. I took the lug-boat there; I found Quelch there with a barge; Brown came to us in a wherry. There were some people walking on a vessel that was moored there, we did not think proper to do business there. We went to the South side of the river, Brown in a wherry, I in the lug-boat, and Quelch in the barge; we crossed the river and there it would not do; we had fastened the lug-boat to the barge, and Quelch and I were in the barge together, and Brown in the wherry; we found the coast not clear; we did not do it there; we hauled the lug-boat to the side of the barge; we drove down the tide towards Blackwall, putting the logwood into the boat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Brown come on board the barge - A. No, he never was on board the barge, I and Quelch handed the logwood from the barge into the lug-boat.</p>
               <p>Q. How near did Brown keep to you - A. He was rowing about in case any thing came to alarm us.</p>
               <p>Q. How much logwood did you and Quelch hand out - A. We meaned to take a ton and no more.</p>
               <p>Q. And while this took place you were floating down the river - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How far had you got when you compleated your point - A. Very near to what they call the fifth mill, near Blackwall.</p>
               <p>Q. Now in your going down where you sometimes on one side and sometimes of the other - A. It is necessary to go sometimes on one side and sometimes of the other to be clear of the teers; we were sometimes of the North side while we were handing out the logwood. When we had taken a ton, Quelch took the tarpaulin out, and covered the logwood over; Quelch told me to make her fast to the first teer that I could get hold of, and stay till flood tide; I made her fast to a teer by the fifth mill, on the North side of the river.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that you parted with Quelch where was Brown - A. Brown parted with us a little time before Quelch told me to go to Cuckold's Point, and Brown would meet me there, then I was to go where I pleased.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Brown parted with you before the tarpaulin was put over - A. About half an hour before.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see him while the logwood was handing out - A. Yes, he was after us, before us, and about us, he knew what we were doing; he was about us on the North side, and on the South side.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. When you had parted and made fast to a vessel, what became of Quelch - A. He proceeded towards Blackwall; I made fast to a vessel at the teer, and when the flood tide came I floated up the river, and between four and five o'clock, I was met with by Mr. Rye, he took me, and the lug-boat, with the logwood, altogether into custody.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. We are to understand from you, that Quelch proposed to you, that you might get a little money by assisting him in robbing your master - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you went to carry a message to Brown in Surry - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You say that when you crossed over from the Custom-house Brown was in his wherry, and Quelch was in the barge with the lug-boat attached to it. Now, Sir, I ask you, and is not the fact so, that Brown rowed directly across the river, and went away - Did not you at any other time say, that he went away and separated from you altogether when you left the Custom-house - A. No, I said he was sometimes before and sometimes behind.</p>
               <p>Q. You were apprehended by the Thames Police officer on the Tuesday morning, at that time you were in possession of the stolen property - A. Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>Q. You was apprehended on the Tuesday; when was Brown apprehended. - A. I did not see Brown till I saw him at the Police office. I believe it was on the Monday following.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give any information about Brown until you saw your master at the prison - A. I did not. I sent to my master before, but he did not come.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not for the purpose of saving yourself that you accused Brown - A. I could not stand such an untruth.</p>
               <p>Mr. Andrews. You are a watchman employed occasionally by Mr. Thompson - A. Yes, my business is to take care that nothing is lost when I am employed.</p>
               <p>Q. When Brown got this lug-boat then, he wanted nothing but a tarpaulin; upon which you told him there were plenty on board the Abingdon - A. Yes, I knew there were two or three in her. I was at work for Mr. 
               <persName id="t18100718-30-person328">Thompson</persName>
             that day; I knew they were marked with Mr. Thompson's name.</p>
               <p>Q. And upon being taken by Mr. Rye, you turned tail upon your companions to save yourself. - A. My own conscience was one thing, I was not happy.</p>
               <p>Q. You intended to take a ton, what share were you to have of it. - A. I suppose I was to have the third or fourth part of it.</p>

On the evening of the 26th I apprehended Quelch in the city at Mr. Thompson's house. I told him it was necessary that he should go with me to the Thames Police office to give some account of the transaction.</p>

            . Q. Are you the wife of Nathaniel M'Bride - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On the morning of Tuesday the 26th of last month, did either of the prisoners call at your house - A. Quelch did soon after I was up, a little after eight o'clock. He asked me if my husband was at home. I told him he was not. I asked him if he had any message to leave; he said nothing material; he went away. Soon after nine o'clock Quelch's wife came to tell me that my husband was in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. On the Monday morning after were you with your husband. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of any thing your husband said to you, did you go with the officer and Mr. Thomson to Brown's house - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you while your husband was in custody, gone to Brown's house before that - A. I had, twice, I went the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181007180023"></xptr>first time, as soon as I heard my husband was in custody, I went to the police office, and I think it was that same day I went to Brown, I did not see him then.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you went with Mr. Thompson and the officer on the Monday; did you go first leaving them behind - A. I did. I saw Brown on the Monday, I had never seen him before; his wife told him who I was, he asked me how my husband did; I told him he was very indifferent indeed; he told me to make myself easy, on the next day he would send me a pound or two; nothing more past, I came out, and Mr. Thompson and the officer came in.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You went over to Brown's house directly after you saw your husband in custody - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The Monday after you went and saw him - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. So that a week had elapsed and Brown had not absconded, though he knew your husband was in custody - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you know Brown, or Brown's wife, before this - A. I never saw them before in my life, I never saw Brown before the night he was taken, I know nothing of them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. to Mr. Thompson. What number of pieces were there in the Abingdon before she went down - A. I cannot say; there is a person here who shipped them at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there marks upon these pieces corresponding with the remainder - A. There were when the wood came from Plymouth, the wood had a ship mark corresponding with the remainder; there was a cross mark upon some of them, not upon the whole, and there was that cross mark found on some of the pieces in the lug-boat.</p>
               <p>Gotty. There were thirty one pieces taken in the lug-boat, about half of them were marked.</p>
               <p>Court. Q to Thompson. What were the directions that you gave to Quelch, about going down with the Abingdon to Blackwall - A. I told him to take the Abingdon barge down to Blackwall at high water; I further told him, I could not tell him exactly, whether the ship lay at the Foley-house or the Orchard; I then told him to leave her at day-light, and bring up another loaded boat from Blackwall; and if he could not find out the ship, to call upon me in the morning, I would give him further orders; he had nothing to do with unloading her. He called upon me in the morning, between ten and eleven o'clock, he told me that he had not found the ship out when he went down, but since, he had heard where the ship laid; I told him, immediately, to go and put her on board the ship where she lay, and he went away.</p>

            . I am in the employ of Mr. Mallin, a wharfinger. I took the weight of the logwood, and employed the men that put them on board, there were nine hundred and seventy nine pieces put on the board.</p>
               <p>Q. Who received it on board - A. At the forepart there was nobody in it, towards the latter part the prisoner Quelch came.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore, when the whole was actually put on board the lighter, Quelch was on board to receive them - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Quelch's Defence. My master, he mentioned; in regard of the tarpaulin being in the barge, and there was no such thing; more than that, he said he makes a common practice of going over his craft, sometimes he is not on board them a week, and we have been obliged to go and take tarpaulin's from other peoples' craft, to use instead of his own.</p>
               <p>Brown's Defence. It is false evidence; I am innocent of what I am charged.</p>
               <p>Quelch called two witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Brown called five witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

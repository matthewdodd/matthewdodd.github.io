             came into my bed-chamber a good deal frightened, and told me that the house was broke open. I got up and came down stairs. I went in the first place into the little parlour on the ground floor, there I found a window-sash up, and by the violence with which it had been forced, the screw that fastens both the sashes together was broke in the middle, and the hinge of the shutter was wrenched off; it is a folding shutter, and the hinges of one of the shutters happened to be on the outside; one of these hinges it was which was wrenched off, and in the parlour there were several little paper boxes; the papers were all scattered about the room. At the farther end was a bureau desk, which was broke open, and the papers it contained were some of them scattered about. From thence I went into an adjoining room (a parlour.) Upon the marble flab I found the blade of a sword and the scabbard, but the hilt was broke off and gone, and the door of the closet had been broke open. From thence I went into the butler's pantry, which is on the same floor, the door of which, I believe, had not been locked, and there I missed the plate.</p>

               <p>Q. Was nothing gone from the closet?</p>
               <p>Powell. Nothing at all; there was only china in it.</p>
               <p>Q. What plate did you miss?</p>
               <p>Powell. I can't be particular. Then I went into the one pair of stairs room forwards, (a bed-chamber) I found the clothes-press, the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177007110015"></xptr> folding-doors open, and some suits, one or two plain suits scattered about the bed and about the room. From the next room, (a bed chamber) from the back of a chair, we missed a plain suit of clothes, sea green, quite new. Afterwards as I was going out of that room, I observed the green baize door stand open; there are double doors. I thought it extraordinary that it should stand open, as there was a spring to it, under the door, in order to keep it open. I found this chissel. (Producing a large flat chissel.) I went immediately to Sir John Fielding's, and took the chissel in my pocket. There was a suit of scarlet clothes laced with gold, gone out of the clothes-press, but we did not absolutely know what clothes were lost till the butler came to town. I went to Sir

            . I am butler to Mr. Harley. I went out of town on Saturday with my master; my master ordered me to come to town to get his things ready for dressing against he came to town; when I came to the stable, the coachman told me the house had been broke open.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you leave any plate behind you when you went from town?</p>
               <p>Woodham. Yes, in my pantry; it was left on a shelf, and I believe the pantry was not locked; the key was in the door, it was very seldom locked when we went out of town, other servants being left in the house. I was told my master had lost a pea-green suit of clothes with silver lace. I went up into the room my master laid in, and found them; the drawer in which they were was not broke open. I missed out of the clothes-press a suit of scarlet and gold full trimmed. From thence I went into the room where I lay, which is the next room to my master's, there a suit of sea-green with gold buttons was gone. From thence I went to my master's dressing-parlour, and missed a gold stock-buckle out of a drawer belonging to a dressing-glass. I went then into my pantry, and missed a pair of silver candlesticks, a silver coffee-pot, a silver waiter, five large silver tablespoons, three or four tea-spoons, I am not certain which, a pair of silver tea-tongs, a silver pepper box, and a silver cream-pot. We went into the kitchen, and they said there was a pair of buckles of Mr. Powell's, that were taken from the fire-side, and another pair of my master's, from the marble slab in my master's dressing parlour, which we did not recollect; then there was a new hat which had never been wore, taken off from a pinon the pantry; there were two shirts taken out of a drawer in master's bed-chamber, one with point, and another with other lace, and two fringed; I saw the blade of the sword, the hilt was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your master's sword left there?</p>
               <p>Woodham. It was left in that parlour; it was a silver hilted one. I can swear that I saw every thing but the scarlet clothes in the house that morning before I went out of town. I found the hat upon

Then we went to the back of Bartholomew-close, in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177007110017"></xptr> Little Britain; we were disturbed there. We were going home from there; we left the remainder part of the things, besides one chissel and one crow, the two pistols we had with us, the rest we hid under some dung, a tinder-box, a lanthorn, and a chissel. We went into Smithfield; a bullock ran out of Smithfield down Little-Britain; we followed it, and the bullock turning short upon us, we ran up a court there out of its way. Donaldson said, Don't let us go away from here yet, we may get something may be; it was a paved court, I don't know the name of it; there were iron rails at the farther end, and steps went down. He got over them iron rails, and opened Mr. Harley's yard door, which was a wooden door, and went down into the yard. I went in, and bolted the door after me. We went and tried at the windows of the house; none of the sashes would shove up of themselves, because they were screwed down, so we forced up the farther sash on the right hand side of the house, with a chissel and a crow.</p>

               <p>Holland. The prisoner. Then he called to me; I went and helped him to get the sash up. After he had forced it a little way, he got the inside shutter open by getting off the hinge, and so got in. Before he got in, he pulled out four or five pair of shoes that were upon a settle in the window, and threw them down in the yard; then he got in and took down the bar, and opened the shutter, and I got in. We went to a little pantry where the plate was; after that we came to the place we first got in at.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you take out of that pantry?</p>
               <p>Holland. Two candlesticks, a coffee-pot, and some small plate; I don't know rightly what besides. Then he left me in the room, and went up stairs, and brought down a suit of light green clothes, and a suit of scarlet, trimmed with gold lace. He said, he would go up again. I said, if he did, I would not stay. He said, there was a gold watch hung up over the bed, and that Mrs. Harley was in bed. He wanted to go up and fetch it; I said, if he did, I would go away and leave him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know whose house it was?</p>

            . I laid down to sleep upon her bed; in about two hours time Donaldson awaked me, and gave me eleven guineas and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of Donaldson?</p>
               <p>Holland. The money was paid to him, and he paid me; who paid him, I don't know. Here is a hat which was taken from me, that we took from Mr. Harley's, from off a hook in the pantry; he had one, and I had the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know this chissel?</p>
               <p>Holland. Yes, this is my chissel; he told me he left it sticking in a door to keep it open. I was not quite up stairs, so I don't know where he left it. He wanted to go back to fetch it; I said, it was too late; St. Paul's clock had struck five before we came out of the house; we were in the yard when he wanted to go back.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the chissel?</p>
               <p>Holland. Yes, very well; I broke that corner of it off myself. ( Note, the chissel had part of the shoulder of it near the handle broke off.)</p>
               <p>Q. Do they make the chissels often so?</p>
               <p>Holland. I am not a judge of that; I stole it out of a carpenter's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. How old are you?</p>
               <p>Holland. Eighteen next April.</p>

               <p>Holland. About six months, or rather more; I was bred a poulterer.</p>

            . I belong to Wood-street Compter. Donaldson came to me on Sunday morning. and desired to speak to me; I told him I could not come then; as soon as I could I went to him. I took him into a yard; we walked there an hour or half an hour. He asked me whether Holland was admitted an evidence; I said, I could not tell. He asked me if any property was found; I said, Yes, some buttons and some lace; there was nobody but him and I in the yard. He gave for answer, that he thought it was a hard matter to swear to lace and buttons. I said, there is a hat they took off from Holland's head; but that Holland said, it was not Mr. Harley's. He said, Will you do one thing for me? I said, I would, if it lay in my power. He said, Tell Holland to say, when he is upon his evidence, that he bought the hat of a Jew before the robbery was committed. I told him, it was not my place to do any such thing, neither would I. I think he asked to speak to Holland himself; I said, that was not in my power to admit. He asked if Holland's wife was along with him; I said, I believed she was; he desired I would tell her. He said, I can't think what the Devil could possess me that night we broke Alderman Harley's house open, for I had above twenty guineas in my pocket at the same time. I was certainly bent upon wickedness that night, for when I went up stairs into Alderman Harley's room, there was somebody in the Alderman's bed; there was a green and white cap lay upon the pillow, and I thought it stirred; I took the pistol in my hand, says he, and said that if he got up, I would blow his brains out; with that, he said, he never saw the cap stir afterwards. He said, he brought some clothes down out of the room; he said, they melted down the silver, and that there was above a hundred ounces of it. He said, As to that lace they have got, if it is Alderman Harley's, it is what that damned bitch or whore, I don't know which he said, has cheated

               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been acquainted with Donaldson?</p>
               <p>Brown. He worked with the city carpenter; our prison wanted repairing, and he worked upon it; I have known him about half a year.</p>
               <p>Q. He knew you was a turnkey of the gaol, I suppose?</p>
               <p>Brown. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And so, he without any inducement whatever, told you this story?</p>
               <p>Brown. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. It seems pretty improbable he should tell this story to you?</p>
               <p>Brown. He told a good many of these witnesses, Wood and Phillips, That as for Brown, if he had held up his finger, he should have followed me all about London; and that he did not think I should have deceived him.</p>
               <p>Q. What could induce him to make such an ample confession as this to you?</p>
               <p>Brown. I imagine he took me to be a friend, and expected I would tell him every thing that had passed about Holland's being admitted an evidence.</p>
               <p>Q. When was Holland admitted an evidence?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177007110019"></xptr>Brown. The night we took him: we took him to Alderman Harley in Bucklersbury.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any expectation of being admitted an evidence before this?</p>
               <p>Brown. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner's council to Holland. Do you remember any thing of this man's coming in and asking you how you came to say that hat was not Mr. Harley's?</p>
               <p>Holland. I don't remember any such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. to Wood. Do you remember Brown's saying any thing to you about this?</p>
               <p>Wood. I came to the lodge on Sunday morning; he said, Wood, I have heard more than what you are aware of; and told me the same as he has said now. When I took him, he said, if he had seen me five minutes sooner, he would have blown my brains out.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>With regard to what Brown has sworn against me, it is as false as God is true: he asked me twenty questions, but I would give him no reply. I know nothing of the robbery: I can bring proof who I lodged with the night Alderman Harley's house was broke open. The reason why Holland attempts to take my life away, is, we quarrelled once about a supper at Lumley's; I beat him; he brought a pistol and fired at me; I turned the pistol off, and the ball went under my arm; there is a man in Mr. Akerman's custody, that can prove the same.</p>

               <p>Prior. I can't recollect that day particularly what time he came home. He hardly ever came home later than eleven, excepting half an hour on a Saturday night.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he never out?</p>
               <p>Prior. Never out of a night since he lodged with me; he generally dined with me of a Sunday, and paid for his dinner.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the whole time he has been with you, he has not been out of a night?</p>
               <p>Prior. Never to my knowledge; I always lock the door, and take the key into my room.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is your room?</p>

               <p>Prior. Between five and six o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he get out of a morning?</p>
               <p>Prior. I let him out.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you always up at that time?</p>
               <p>Prior. Yes; if I was not, he always called me up to let him cut.</p>
               <p>Q. So you take upon you to swear that he never laid out of your house a night all the time he lodged with you. Do you know where he worked?</p>
               <p>Prior. No; I have seen many of his tools, and have bought chips of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Holland?</p>
               <p>Prior. Yes; I have seen him in my house, but not to know him; only they said that was Holland.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not you seen him often?</p>
               <p>Prior. Only once or twice.</p>

               <p>Field. Yes, and fasten the door after me, and go to bed again.</p>

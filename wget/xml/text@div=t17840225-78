               <p>Court. Then the only money he had were these four guineas that you put into his hand? - Yes, he was searched, and he put it down, he picked it up again, says I, you have put that in your pocket, which I have worked very hard for, he denied it.</p>
               <p>Court. Was any guinea found upon him? - He was over-hauled before the Justice and a guinea and sixpence were found in his pocket.</p>
               <p>You had no marks about the four guineas that you had? - No, there was a bit of dirt on one.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen of the Jury, it is not necessary to take up your time by going on with this business, for if the prisoner has taken this money, still I think the indictment cannot be maintained, because there was no felonious taking whatever; for he tells you that he gave him the money, and gave him a compleat possession of it for weighing; but likewise he cannot identify the guinea other than by a bit of dirt, which is not sufficient, and it is very probable the prisoner might have another guinea in his pocket; but however that may be, I am clearly of opinion that there is no felonious taking whatever, and therefore you must acquit the defendant.</p>

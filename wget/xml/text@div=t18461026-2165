                  </hi>. I live with my father, in Little Guildford-street, Southwark. On the 16th of Oct., about tea o'clock in the morning, in con-sequence of information about my sister I went to No. 6, Butler's-buildings, which I understood was a bad house—I understood my sister was there—I saw the prisoner there—it was his house—I asked him if my sister lived there?—he said, "No"—I said she did live there—I came away, and heard at the top of the court that she did live there—I went home and returned there again between three and four o'clock in the afternoon—I knocked at the door—the prisoner called me to the window—I went to the window—he lifted it up and said there was no Irish wh—e lived there—I said she was there—he said she was not, she lived at the Irish wh—'s next door—I made no answer to that, but was returning from the window—he lifted it up again, and said, "Here, I want you"—I returned, and he cut me with the poker over the back of my head—I staggered from one side of the court to the other—I did not fall till I got to the next door, and then fell in the passage—I remained there till the policeman and doctor came up, quite insensible—I have been very ill, and under the doctor's hands ever since—I have not rece<lb></lb>vered—it is very painful now when I stoop—I had a bonnet on At the time, but it flew back when the blow was given—I gave him no provocation at all.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 5, Butler's-buildings, next door to the prisoner. On the 16th of Oct. Sculley came there—she asked if her sister lived there?—the prisoner said there was no Irish wh—there—Sculley said she was told she did live there-the prisoner opened his parlour-window, rushed right across, and struck her with the poker as heavy as he possibly could, saying he would have her b----y life—he certainly struck with consi-derable violence—I stood on the step of my door—the moment he gave the blow he made his escape over the wall back into the Cornwall-road—Seulley reeled towards my door and fell in the passage—I took her into my parlour, put her on the sofa, and sent for the doctor.</p>

                  </hi> I am a surgeon. On the 16th of Oct., I was called to No. 5, Butler's-buildings, and found Sculley perfectly sensible then, but she became insensible while I was there, and went into two or three fits—there was a wound on the top of her head, about two inches long, not very deep—it did not go to the bone—it broke the skin—the edge of a poker would do it—she is getting very much better, and is nearly out of danger—the blow was likely to produce considerable derangement, unless she took great care of herself, and avoided all stimulants—it required great caution on her part—it was a blow struck with considerable violence.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman at Gregory and Co. 's, drapers, of 11 and 12, London-street, Greenwich—on Friday, 24th March, the prisoner came in, and asked to see some prints—I showed her some—she then wanted some silk dresses to be sent to Miss Hart, of Vanbrough Castle, May's Hill—she said that she was parlour-maid there—there is such a place, and Miss Hart has been a customer occasionally—the dresses were to be sent at 7 o'clock—she then wished to look at some black shawls for one of the servants, and wished to take two with her, one of which would be selected and paid for when I went up with the dresses—I let her have them, believing her statement to be true—they were worth 31<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—in the evening I went up to Miss Hart's with the dresses, and found they were not required—I gave notice to the police.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> In consequence of what did you let her have the shawls? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Of her saying that she was parlour-maid at Miss Hart's—I did not see her again that day—I saw her three or four days afterwards—that was before she appeared before the Magistrate—I had not seen her in the interim.</p>

I live at Vanbrough Castle, May's-hill—Miss Hart who lives there is my aunt—I have lived there off and on for the last twenty years—I never saw the prisoner till I saw her at the police-court—she has never been in Miss Hart's service—no person was sent out to the draper's that day—I spoke to Mr. Strickland when he called.</p>

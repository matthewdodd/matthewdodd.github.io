            </rs>. This was the Charge in the Indictment, which was opened at large by the Council for the King and Queen to the Gentlemen of the Jury, setting forth all the Aggravating Circumstances that attended such a Politick Invention; especially in that it tended to weaken the Government of this Kingdom, and served to alienate the Hearts of Their Majesties Subjects against them, and to Raise and to Stir up the Seeds of Sedition and Rebellion in the Hearts of the King's Enemies, &amp;c. It was proved in Court, That Mr. Harris paid 25 l. Mr. Rutland 25 l. Mr. Tysoe 5 l. Mr. Watts 10 l. and Mr. Gandy 9 l. This was fully proved by the Book of Policys, which was produced in Court as a farther Evidence against them, &amp;c. The Prisoners Argued by their Council that they had no evil Design in doing it, it being a customary thing, long before this time, to venture Money upon the Insurance of Ships at Sea, or the like; and that several Persons had done this as well as they. But the Court highly resented it as a thing of very dangerous Consequence, telling them, That they ought not to take upon them to Ensure the Government.

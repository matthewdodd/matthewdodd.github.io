I live at Stockwell Street, Old Kent Road, and am in my brother's employment—he sent me to Wapping with my van, five or six months ago—I got there about 8.30 a.m., and saw Edwards, who asked me if I had come from the Kent Road—I said "Yes"—he told me to come down to the wharf, and load—I went to Cinnamon Street Wharf; that is Messrs. Middleton's, I believe—I got three bales of wool or cotton—Baker and two men not here put them into my van—I do not think either of the others were present—I did not go into the counting-house before taking away the goods, but Edwards gave me a note to go to French Horn Yard, Crutched Friars—I did not sign for the goods—I took them to the French Horn Yard, and saw Dunster there, on the first floor—I told him I had got three bales of wool for him—he said "All right, they will unload you"—I gave him the note—I do not know whether they were wool or cotton—they were unloaded and taken into the warehouse—the next time I went to Cinnamon Street was about two months afterwards, I should think—I saw Sharp, and received three bales, which I took to 8 1/2, Hermitage Street—I went into a little side place, where I saw a lad and a boy—I did not sign; I gave it to the lad—I think that was on the 4th December—it the last time of all—William Lewis was not with me on that occasion</p>

I live at Belsize Park Gardens, Hamp<lb></lb>stead, and am a wharfinger, in partnership with two others, at 8, Bride's Wharf, part of the wharf is in Cinnamon Street—Burton was head-foreman of our establishment, and Edwards was the cotton foreman—Baker was an occasional foreman, and he was frequently employed to make deliveries—Sharpe was an occasional labourer, employed at Burton's discretion—a car<lb></lb>man who applies for goods presents the order at the counting-house, and the clerk appointed for the purpose enters the order in a book—Mr. Chap<lb></lb>man, or any clerk, would enter it into an order-book, to register it and give it a number, the order would then go from him to the clerk keeping the stock-book, ho would refer to the stock-book to see that the order was pro<lb></lb>perly signed by the person authorised to take the goods, and if he found the order to be correct, he would sign it, stating the time it was presented, and giving full particulars for the identification of the goods, in order that the foreman in the warehouse would know where to find them, or they would go to the chief foreman, Burton—after the delivery took place, the foremen, Burton or Ellis, or a foreman appointed by either of them, would endorse on the back of the order the full particulars of the bales so de<lb></lb>livered,</p>

C," in a diamond—they have not the name of the ship, but there are letters on the heads and sides of the bales—one bale here has had the end cut out, and another piece sewn in its place—on this second bale the marks have also been cut out, and these pieces of gunny have been sewn in the places, this was originally marked the same as the others—the mark on the side has been cut out as well, and parts of old gunny bag have been sewn in.</p>

               <p>from"—I then went up on the next floor, Mr. Dunster and one of his women went up with me, and pointed out four bales which they said were the bales—one of those has been produced to-day, they all had the mark cut out of the head and sides—I also found five other bales in the next room in the same condition—I afterwards saw Sharpe, and told him I should take him in custody for being concerned in stealing four bales of cotton yesterday from Mr. Middleton's wharf; he said that he knew nothing of it—I said "I have a witness who saw you assisting to load, about 2 o'clock yesterday"—he said "I know nothing of it; I cannot help what my fore<lb></lb>man did—Mr. Lewis afterwards identified him at the station—on the next Saturday I took Baker, and told him I should take him for being concerned in stealing four bales of cotton from Middleton's wharf on the 4th—he said "All right"—I took him to the station, where Edwards was in custody; I showed them both the four bales of cotton, and Baker said "I know them, I assisted Sharpe to load them; but I only <hi rend="italic">done</hi> as I was ordered by my foremen, Edwards and Burton—I asked him if he knew anything about the marks being cut out—he said "Yes, I assisted by the same direction"—Edwards said "I am only under-foreman, I only <hi rend="italic">done</hi> as I was ordered by Burton, who was over me."</p>

I have taken means to find Barber, but unsuccessfully—he was a clerk in the city and lived in the Kent Road—I saw a great many other papers on Dunster's premises—I suppose they are there now—I do not know who has possession of the premises—I had charge of the whole—I did not hand them over to anyone, but somebody has taken forcible possession of the premises—I produce all the papers that were considered necessary—they can produce the others themselves, they have got possession of the premises—the other papers are considered of no use, they have been examined.</p>

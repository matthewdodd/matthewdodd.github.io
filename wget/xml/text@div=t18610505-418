I carry on business as an instrument maker, in the Rue Chalot, at Paris, with my brother—we make opera-glasses, and things of that description—in January I engaged the prisoner to travel for us in England—he was to have 2 1/2 francs a day, besides his travelling expenses—the 12 1/2 francs was to go for his support, and his carriage was paid extra—when he left Paris we gave him three boxes of samples—among them were opera-glasses, of different patterns, fourteen microscopes, eighteen eye-glasses, eighteen eye-glass frames, twelve eases of mathematical instruments, some compasses, and achromatic glasses, besides many other things—he was to show them, and to get orders upon them—he had no authority to sell or part with the samples—116<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was the value of them—I gave him 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at starting, and sent him 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. afterwards—after he went we, for some time, received letters, and a few orders; rather regularly at first—that regularity ceased from 24th March—he ought to have written twice a week—he continued to write twice a week, nearly, until 24th March, with the exception of once, when it was a fortnight—when I found he was getting irregular I wrote to him—I wrote this letter of 24th March (<hi rend="italic">This was addressed to the prisoner in London, requesting to hear from him, and directing him to send back the samples</hi>)—I received this letter in answer (<hi rend="italic">This was dated Black Bull, London</hi>, 30<hi rend="italic">th March</hi>, 1861, <hi rend="italic">acknowledging the receipt of the prosecutor's letter, and excusing himself for not having written; stating that he was about representing a house at Stet tin, and requesting to be allowed to continue to act as an agent for the prosecutor.

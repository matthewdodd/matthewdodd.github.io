Parker (knowing them) told them, they did not do well to spoil Peoples Pastures and Fences, &amp;c. Whereupon they swore they would beat out his Brains, and assaulted the Ditchers, who defended themselves as well as they could a while; and then coming to a Parley, the Prisoner and his Brother went away above threescore yards, and then on a suddain returned, swearing they would kill the old Rogue (meaning the said Will. Parker) and then the Prisoner, with the Club or Stake he had in his hand, gave the said Parker a mortal bruise on the right side of the Head, so that he lay at present for dead, but with Spirits was brought to life again; but next Morning about four a Clock died. Whilst the Evidence was getting Strong waters to revive his Friend and call for help, the Criminals fled, nor could be heard of for above this year and an half upon the Hue and Cry, till lately the Prisoner was <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="16761011005"></xptr> taken near Croyden in Surrey. Though on the Evidence it seemed to be a Murther, yet on consideration of the whole matter, the Jury brought it in only <rs id="t16761011-4-verdict15" type="verdictDescription">

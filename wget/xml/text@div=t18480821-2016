                  </hi>. I am thirteen years old, and live with my father and mother at Black-horse-place, Lower-road, Deptford—last Saturday week, I took half a pint of ale to Mr. Temple's, and he gave me half a sovereign to get changed—I got half-a-crown, 6 shillings, 2 sixpences, 5 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper, and a halfpenny-worth of plums—the prisoner met me—I go of errands for her—she asked me if her husband was in our place—I said I did not think he was—she said, "Come along with me"—I went with her down Effingham-place—she knocked me down with her hand, knelt on me, put her hand over my mouth, forced my hand open, and took the money out, and said, "Don't you think I have robbed you," and then put the halfpence into my hand and run away—another boy was with me—it was about eight o'clock at night—I watched her home and told a policeman—he took her next day.</p>

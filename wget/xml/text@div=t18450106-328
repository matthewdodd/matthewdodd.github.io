                  </hi>. I live in Cattle-street, Bethnal-green. On the 27th of Dec. I had a male donkey, which I lent to the prisoner to take a few sacks of saw-dust out—I do not know what business he is—I bad never seen him before—he was to pay me 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the hire of it, for two hours—he wanted it for himself—he took it from my place about half-past eleven o'clock—I saw it again about seven o'clock at night—he brought it home, but I was not there at the time—I had gone in the mean time to his house to see for it—(I had sent my daughter to see where he lived when he bor<lb></lb>rowed it)—on my return I found the donkey at home, lying down in the yard—I got him up, took him into the stable, and examined him—he was all over blood where he had been poked and pricked about, all up the back of the thigh—the skin was broken all up from the knee right up to his tail—it was torn all up, pricked about, and in several placet there were deep cuts—I did not observe what sort of cuts they were, they were bleeding at the time—I went after the prisoner directly—I found him in Norton-falgate—I asked if he was not ashamed of himself for ill treating the donkey ai he had—he made some answer, I do not know exactly what—he came back with me directly, and I gave him into custody—the donkey was quite well and perfect in the morning When I let it to the prisoner—none of the wounds were there then—it is a great deal better now—Mr. May saw it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a painter, of 17, Ponsonby-place, Milbank—on 31st August, about 7 at night, I was in Smith-street, Westminster, and saw the prosecutor—a youth went up to him at the corner of Orchard-street and struck him somewhere about the head, and went down Orchard-street, which leads to St. Ann's-street—the prosecutor followed him, and when he bad got about half way down, the prisoner made his appearance, went up to the prosecutor, and persuaded him to follow the youth who struck him, and give him in charge—they continued to go down Orchard-street—the youth got on first and hid himself in the gateway, at Ludford's, the rubbish wharf, and the prisoner led the prosecutor down St. Ann-street—when they had got about half way up, the youth who had struck the prosecutor rushed from the gateway and tried to garotte him—the prosecutor made a struggle, and succeeded in throwing him off, and he ran away again and got on ahead, and they followed him, and when they got to the corner of Old Pie-Street, while the prisoner was directing his attention to the way he had taken, he matched at his chain—I saw that distinctly—the prosecutor put his hand up and stopped his watch, and the prisoner bolted off the prosecutor running after him—I am quite sure the prisoner is the man—I was within a foot of him all the time—I saw him next morning in Strutton-ground—I told a policeman, and he was taken in custody.</p>

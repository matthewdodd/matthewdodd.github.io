                  </hi>. I am assistant to Messrs. Stow and Company, outfitters, of the Minories. On Saturday afternoon, 9th Feb., between three and four o'clock, the prisoner and another man came to the shop, and the prisoner asked me to show him a coat—I showed him one—he asked the price—I told him 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he objected to give so much, and he said he would give 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I saw him with a paper—he did not exactly show it me; I could not quite see what it was—he returned it to his pocket before he concluded the purchase—he said his friend recommended him to us, he was a dealer, and knew all about these sort of things—they went out of the shop, and appeared to talk together, and then came back, and the prisoner asked whether I could take the money he had offered—I said, "No," and then he said he would give the 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he took a pocket-book from his pocket, took this paper out, and handed it to me (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I told him I did not know much about country bank-notes, and I did not like changing it—he said it was perfectly good, as good as gold; it was an Irish note, and he knew several houses where he could get it changed—I noticed the date "1848" was in fresh ink, as if it had been recently altered—I examined it again, and he again said it was as good as gold—I had some suspicion, and said I had no change, and must go out for it—the other man offered to accompany me, and I said he had better stop—I said I knew a gentleman over the way who would no doubt change it, Mr. Montague, and the prisoner said, "Ah, old Montague will give it you"—I went out, and found there was no such bank as Castlecary in the directory—I returned in about twenty minutes, and as I came, I met Roots, and he came back with me—both the persons were still in the shop, and the prisoner asked if I had got the note changed—I said, "No"—he said, "Do</p>

               <p>you mean to say it is a bad note?"—I said, "Yes, you must have known that before you came here"—he said, "Do you mean to say there is no such bank in existence?"—I said, "Yes"—Roots and Lovell were both there then, and I gave the note to Roots to look at—the prisoner then said, "Just allow me to look at it, I <hi rend="italic">wont</hi> keep it a moment"—he took hold of one end of it, saying it was as good as gold, and as he was taking it it tore, and he rolled up the pieces in his hand—at this moment the other man slipped out—Roots said, "Give it to me"—he said, "Don't think I am a child, I am only having a <hi rend="italic">lark</hi> with you," and he put the pieces into his mouth—Roots instantly seized him by the throat, and he spat out two pieces of paper.</p>

Stow's shop, and the last witness gave me this paper—it was then perfect—while I was looking at it, the prisoner said, "Let me look at it, it is my note, and it is as good as gold"—I said, "Where did you get it?"—he said, "I sold a man 4lbs. of cigars, and took this note in pay<lb></lb>ment"—he said again, "Let me look at it," caught hold of this part, (the date), and it tore, and he put the pieces into his mouth—I seized him by the throat, made him turn it out, and it was these two pieces (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he said, "Do you think I am a child, it is <hi rend="italic">done</hi> now, the note is good"—I had noticed the date, it was 1848, and appeared to be in fresh ink—I noticed the name of Pryce on it—I afterwards took him into custody.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>,585). I went with Roots to Messrs. Stow's shop—I saw Wentworth hand Roots the note, and while he was look<lb></lb>ing at it, the prisoner said, "Let me look at it, it is my property," and in taking the note from Roots, a struggle ensued, and he tore a piece off the note and put it into his mouth—Roots seized him by the throat, and made him put it out—the prisoner then said, "Do you think I am a child, I am only having a <hi rend="italic">lark"</hi>—he was taken into custody, searched, and nothing found on him but a pocket-book—he then said he took the note of a man who kept the Gun, in Spitalfields, who told him it was as good as the bank—I made inquiries at the Provincial Bank of Ireland, in Broad-street—I went to Alfred-place, Bedford-square, which address is on the note—no such persons as Pryce and Company, bankers, of Castlecary, lived there; I could not hear of any such persons—I made inquiry elsewhere in the neighbourhood, and could not hear of any such firm.</p>

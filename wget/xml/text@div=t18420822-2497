                  </hi>. I am a beadle of Covent Garden-market.

                  </hi>. I am a salesman in Covent Garden-market. The prisoner has been in my employ, as a porter, at times—on the 23rd of August, he was employed to fetch forty sieves of potatoes, and to bring them to my stand opposite the church—about two o'clock, Moore brought him to me, and these potatoes were brought to me from Bow-street—they are mine, and a part of those which I had directed him to bring to me—the prisoner offered me 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them when he was brought to me—I had</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. She said if I would go and have something to drink I was very welcome; I went along with her, and she treated us with three or four glasses; I don't know whether she pulled any thing out of her pocket, but I was coming up Whitcomb-street, and I picked up the purse almost by the wine-vaults door; as for the half-crown, she changed that to treat us.</p>

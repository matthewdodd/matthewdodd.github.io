                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MRS. STRONG</hi>. I live at 14, Bull and Mouth-street—on 5th July I saw the prisoner, between 9 and 10 in the morning, washing—I saw her several times in the course of the day—she spoke to my baby about 4 o'clock, that was the last time I saw her—I saw her only once on 16th, and that was about 12 o'clock, she was cleaning the stairs—I remember her telling me she had a sore throat—I have never seen her in a bonnet; she always wears a hat—as far as I have seen—I have seen her in different dresses.</p>

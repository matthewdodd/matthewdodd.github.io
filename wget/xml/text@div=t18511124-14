                  </hi>. I am waiter at the Queen's Hotel, St. Martin's-le-Grand. The prisoner came there on 14th Nov., near 8 o'clock in the evening, and asked for a glass of gin-and-water—he was sitting on one of the tables of the coffee-room—there were some coats on the coat-rack—I do not know how many—when I came back with the gin-and-water, he had got a light-coloured coat on, and two or three others—I told Roberts, my fellow-servant—he handed me three coats—I kept them while he went to the bar, and gave them to him again in two or three minutes—he gave them to a policeman, in my presence, about five minutes afterwards—there were three or four gentlemen in the coffee-room, but they did not notice it.</p>

                  </hi>. On 14th Nov. I was porter at the Queen's Hotel. I was standing in the hall, looking through the coffee-room window, and saw the prisoner close to the coat-rack, looking at a coat—he had five coats on previously—Green came out and spoke to me, and I went in to the prisoner—he was in the act of pulling off the top coat of the lot he had on—I asked him if that coat was his—he said, "Yes"—I said, "How can that be? this coat has been hanging on that coat-rack all day long, and you have only just come into the house; how can it be yours?"—I had not seen it there, but I said so to <hi rend="italic">confute</hi> him—he said, in a faint voice, "It is not mine"—I said, "It seems to me that you have several more on, and I do not think they belong to you; here is a coat here don't fit you, I can almost swear it don't belong to you, and the best thing you can do is to take them off"—he said they were his and dared me to touch them, and then he took two more off—they were great coats—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I gave three of them to Green while I went to ask the housekeeper's advice—I then called the police and gave the prisoner into custody—Edward Sherman is the proprietor of the hotel—the gentleman this coat belongs to was staying at the hotel.</p>

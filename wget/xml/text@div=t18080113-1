               <p>Q. Had you occasion to go to Islington on the 16th of October. - A. Yes. I cannot say what day it was; it was about the beginning of October; between eleven and twelve o'clock I came down Goswell street, I turned down Fann street into <placeName id="t18080113-1-crimeloc4">Bridgwater Gardens</placeName>

               <p>Q. Did you retire with them to any private apartment. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take any liberty or any familiarity with them when they were there. - A. No; we did not stop there two or three minutes; when we came out in the street I had a conversation with them about three or four minutes. I stopped about three or four minutes, and one of them left me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe their persons at that time, so as to distinguish one from the other. - A. I cannot say I did, I was a little in liquor; after the other woman left me I stopped about three minutes with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she leave you or you her. - A. She left me. I went home.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take any liberties with her. - A. No, I did not touch her; I have no recollection of either of their persons, I never saw them before. When I was going to bed I missed my watch. I went to bed about half an hour after I went home; it was a silver watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that you had your watch before you saw the prisoner. - A. I had my watch when I was in the gin shop.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the watch again. - A. I saw it again at Worship street. I knew it to be mine.</p>
               <p>MR. ALGER. I am a pawnbroker, No. 9, Chiswell street, I have known the prisoner some years. On the 16th of October last she pledged the watch with me for twenty four shillings, in the name of

               <p>Did she make any acknowledgment about the things? - She said she did not know how she came by those things.</p>
               <p>Jury. My Lord, some of the gentlemen of the Jury with the lady may be unveiled.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. It is very convenient to be sure in a Court of Justice.</p>
               <p>(The lady put up the veil of her bonnet, which was a considerable depth.)</p>
               <p>Miss Osliffe. There are two aprons, an O is still remaining in one.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Madam, before I put any question to you, I wish you should understand, that I do not mean to put any one, from any impertinent motive; but I know no distinction of persons here; I observe this is an indictment for stealing these articles so long ago as December in the last year? - Yes,</p>
               <p>I believe the prisoner had lived a servant in your family six years? - Five years and a half.</p>
               <p>In whose service did she live the last nine months? - With Mr. Bowes, a neighbour of mine; to whom I gave her a character.</p>
               <p>When was it that her boxes and drawers were searched? - About a month ago.</p>
               <p>At her master's house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I believe, madam, she was indicted before you made any complaint to a Magistrate; perhaps you do not know the mode of doing business that common people follow? - I indicted her at a justice's first.</p>
               <p>I believe you are mistaken; who was the justice? - Colonel Hubbard of Southgate.</p>
               <p>She was surrendered in discharge of her bail? - She was</p>
               <p>None of these articles of your wearing apparel were new? - None.</p>
               <p>I should think it not impossible, that in the course of six years, you might have given her these things? - It is possible that I gave her a few.</p>
               <p>Now I should think it extremely possible that you might have given her some few of which you did not keep a memorandum; I dare say, you are one of those who do not let their right hand know what their left hand does, in a way of charity; can you now, at this distance of time, run over with me, a catalogue of all the things you have given her? - I cannot, but I had not given these certainly, any one of the things I have charged her with taking from me.</p>
               <p>Can you venture to say, you never gave them away to any other servant? - I had no other servant.</p>
               <p>When did you miss them first? - I missed them at different times; I missed different things, while she was with me.</p>
               <p>For nine months; she might have burnt or destroyed them; or taken out the marks? - She might; I have valued them very low; to shew that there was no malice in this prosecution.</p>
               <p>Had not this young woman given you some cause for discontent and displeasure after she left your service? - I had very great reason.</p>
               <p>Had she not in the neighbourhood, said some things respecting your - I never heard that she said a word against me.</p>
               <p>Have you never heard that she had said, (I do not say with truth,) that some libel or paragraphs about neighbours, had come from your pen? - I never heard that she did.</p>
               <p>What then led to searching the room of this young girl, who had left you with a good character; and was recommended by you to a good service? - She had first lost my good opinion, from her change of dress and behaviour.</p>
               <p>Had not she mentioned your having<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090100"></xptr>written something? - I never had written any thing; why should you ask me that.</p>
               <p>Because I am instructed so to do; that is my only apology. Had not there been some little misunderstanding between you and some neighbours, about some supposed libels, which were conjectured to have come from you; and which this woman said had come from you? - Certainly there was.</p>
               <p>Did not those bickerings relate to some libels, or supposed libels, or some jeers; I dare to say, extremely elegant, if they came from your pen? - I do not come here to answer impertinent questions.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I have no difficulty to state to the Court my reason for putting the questions this lady has stated that the servant lived with her six years; she has stated that there were some little bickerings about something, supposed to be the production of this lady's pen; I mean to ingraft on that examination, to prove, that this suspicion never would have fallen on the prisoner; that her box never would have been searched; and that this prosecution never would have been carried on, if the prisoner had not been suspected to have known too much of these epistolary productions of the lady; and which, she, with great imprudence, has revealed.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutrix. Wait for the question from the gentleman; and if he puts a question that is not proper, we must stop him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. There were some bickerings about some writings, or some publications, in the neighbourhood? - There were.</p>
               <p>There were some persons who suspected you had written them? - There were.</p>
               <p>They were supposed to have been written while the prisoner was in your service? - They were.</p>
               <p>Was not the prisoner supposed to have known that you had written them? - No.</p>
               <p>Did not that suspicion come to your ears? - No.</p>
               <p>Was there ever a charge in any shape, made against the prisoner, till after these bickerings respecting the letter? - No.</p>
               <p>How long is it since that misunderstanding respecting this letter, or this writing, broke out? - Last June was a twelvemonth; the bickerings have been long forgotten by me.</p>
               <p>Have you never heard that this young woman had said, that those publications really came from your pen? - No; I never did hear it.</p>
               <p>I am very sorry, but I must ask, was there no other subject of dissatisfaction, that you had towards this young woman, relating to money matters? - There was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I should think it would be better for every body, if this went no further.</p>
               <p>Jury. We really think so, for the sake of the lady.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I have only to say, that it was not owing to any bickerings, that I prosecuted her for taking these things; but that I was very well convinced they were my own; but as she is now-sufficiently punished, I hope the gentlemen of the jury will consider her with mercy.</p>

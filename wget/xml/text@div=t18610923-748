                  </hi>. I am superintendent of the Strangers' Home in the West India-road—Robert Marsh Hughes and others are the managers of the institution—Mr. Hughes is the honorary secretary, and a member of the board—he is the representative of the institution, and in his absence I am his substitute, as the superintendent—the monies which were stolen were the monies of inmates in the Strangers' Home that had been deposited, and money given to pay for their board, which I held in charge until it was time to pay it in to Colonel Hughes, the honorary secretary—there are other persons associated with him—when there is a considerable sum, it is paid into the bank—it is very seldom that we have so much on hand—it is paid into the bank in the name of Colonel Marsh Hughes, on behalf of the com<lb></lb>mittee or board of directors—he is a member of the committee, which consists of a considerable number of persons beside himself—I am a servant of the committee, and receive the deposits and monies for board, which I pay in periodically to Colonel Hughes—I receive it on account of the committee—it is all done on account of the committee, or board of directors—on Thursday night, 22d July, I went round and saw the premises safe—I was in the office after 10 o'clock; all was safe then, and all the doors were locked—the Home is not closed till about 11, and I went round the last thing and all was safe then—the windows have no shutters—I entered the office-door at 7 o'clock the next morning, where the box and money were kept—my attention was called first of all by seeing papers strewed about the floor—I then looked round and saw that the large wooden box, in which the cash-box and papers were placed, was gone—the wooden box was used for keeping the men's clothes in—it was possibly three-quarters of a yard in length, and the same in depth, square; it was such a size as a man might carry away—the money was in a tin cash-box, which was kept in the wooden box—the wooden box was locked the night before, and the tin cash-box also—it contained 32<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., two 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, and the rest in gold and silver—I cannot state exactly the proportion of gold and silver—there was not a pound's worth of silver, I think, the rest was in gold—I made a search to see bow anybody could have entered—the box was standing under the window—the ventilator, which was closed on the overnight, was partly opened—it is a square of glass which turns on a pivot in the middle; the top cord pulls it open, and the bottom cord will pall it to again—it was not as it had been left on the overnight—it was not open sufficient to admit the person of anybody—when it is fully opened a person could get in—our men have occasionally crept through a similar ventilator in the dormitories—there is a verandah near the window, which leads out into the back-yard—I saw some finger marks at the top and also at the bottom of the ventilator, and on the iron frame round—I could see it had been taken hold of—on the sill of the window there was a mark as though a man had put his knee or foot on it—it had been whitened with hearth-stone—I did not see a stick found, I saw it in the back yard near the wall—I know the prisoner—I knew him above two years ago, when he was an Inmate of the Home—he left on 9th April, 1859, with the crew, and returned with the crew on 10th June last—he had been an inmate before the robbery as late as 26th July, when he was sent to the Dreadnought Hospital-ship, sick—he afterwards returned but he never slept in the Home—he used to climb over the wall</p>

                  </hi>. I am a seaman—the prisoner and I were shipmates in the Royal Arthur—I came to London the day before this occurrence, and was at the Cock in Upton-court—that is not a public-house—there was a man named Dalton there—the prisoner came in when I was coming down the court, but never spoke—I followed Dalton, who ran into a house; and when I was coming out again, the prisoner came behind me, and stabbed me in the right side—I had had no quarrel with him, and never exchanged words with him till an hour before that—I was taken to the London Hospital.</p>

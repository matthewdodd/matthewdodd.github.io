                  </hi>. I am a corn porter, and live in New Gravel-lane. On Sunday, the 28th of April, I was intoxicated—I had been to different houses—the last I recollect being in was the Blue Anchor—when I came to myself next morning, I was at the London Hospital, and had a wound in my back—I was discharged from the hospital last Saturday week—I do not think the wound was deep or serious.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Carr, and live in Twine-court. I heard a quarrel at Mrs. Griffith's lodging-house nearly opposite my house, about three o'clock on Monday morning, the 29th of April, before daylight—I saw the prisoner run out of Mrs. Grif<lb></lb>fith's, and he said as he came out, by the H—G—he would stick the b—knife in the b—soldier's guts—I saw a soldier come out of the same house just after he said those words, and Bryan came out after the soldier—the soldier turned back-again into the house, and Bryan stood talking to the prisoner—they were swearing at each other, but I can't say what it was—the prisoner drew the knife from his side, and pointed it at Bryan, who ran away, and the prisoner after him eight or nine yards—I saw them together, but I could not see whether he stabbed him, I was not close enough—as Bryan came back he said he was either stabbed or cut, I cannot say which—that was as the policeman was lead<lb></lb>ing him back to Mrs. Griffith's house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Michael Griffith, and live in Gray's Buildings. On Sunday night, the 28th of April, Bryan came to my house about one o'clock—he was in liquor—I first met him in Ratcliffe Highway, when I went out for a pot of beer—a soldier came in about a quarter of an hour afterwards—I was not there at the commencement of the quarrel—the boy came and told me there was a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> at home—I went home, and found the window broken—I thought it might have been Allen's fault—he said the soldier should not be there, and I said he should be there</p>

               <p>—Allen and I got to words together—I told him he was not my husband, and he should go about his business, and take all belonging to him—he took his knife out of the drawer, and said there was nothing belonging to him but his knife—he put it into the sheath—he uses it when he works in the docks—he is a rigger, and always carries it with him—he then went away—he returned again, and said he wanted his handkerchief, which I gave him—he and I got to words again—he called me a very bad name, and I called him the same—Bryan then interfered, and asked what brought him back there again, and he struck the prisoner over the eye and cut him, on seeing him contradict me—they then got fighting together, and got out into she court—the prosecutor said to him, "I don't care for you nor your b—knife"—the soldier then came out, and I told him to hold the prisoner down, as he had got a knife, till I took it from him—the soldier and Bryan held him down, and I took the knife from the sheath and gave it to Margaret Downey—in the mean time Bryan struck the prisoner while he was down—they then got up, and the soldier, Bryan, and the prisoner were fighting together—the policeman came and found Allen holding his hand in the pro<lb></lb>secutor's neck handkerchief at his throat, and I left them together—(the soldier remained there all night)—Bryan had gone out directly Allen re<lb></lb>turned to ask for his handkerchief, and he did not return till the policeman came—Bryan must have received the stab before, the policeman came up, if he was stabbed—the fighting was out of doors—they got fighting, and the soldier came out—I did not hear the prisoner say he would stick the soldier—I was not out of doors at that time—when the prisoner came back for his handkerchief, he and I got to words, and he attempted to strike at me with his fist—that was before Bryan had struck him, and then Bryan struck him in the eye with his fist, and cut his eye—the prisoner was just getting outside the door at the time—he was just outside the step of the door when Bryan struck him—I saw him run after Bryan—that was immediately after Bryan had struck him—I told Bryan he had a knife about him, and to keep away from him—Bryan did not complain of his back till he came in-doors afterwards—I and the police-man turned up his coat, and observed blood—the cut went through his coat and shirt—I sent my little boy for a constable, but a policeman came directly, I believe he met him—Bryan must have been cut before I took the knife from the prisoner, but I did not know it—I was sober—the men were all three in liquor.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at the London Hospital. Bryan was brought there about four o'clock in the morning of the 29th of April—I examined him, and found a wound in his back between the two shoul<lb></lb>ders, such as the knife produced would have made—it was about half an inch deep, and three-quarters of an inch wide—it appeared to have been bleeding, but was not then—he remained there till the following Saturday—the wound was then considered sufficiently well to discharge him—it was not dangerous at any time—it was about an inch from the spine.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that Bryan and a soldier had quarrelled in his room; that he tried to separate them, upon which they both struck him, and he left the house to fetch Mrs. Griffith, who desired him to leave the house, which he did, taking his knife; and on returning for his handkerchief, Griffith struck him; he was forced out of the house, when they all attacked him, but he could not tell how the prosecutor got wounded.</hi>)</p>

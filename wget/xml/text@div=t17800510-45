My house was broke<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178005100060"></xptr>open on the 6th of May at night; we went to bed about twelve o'clock, the windows and doors were all fast. I got up between five and six in the morning and found the window-shutter and casement both open; when the rest of my family got up we missed the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them) they were afterwards found in the prisoner's lodging; he lodges in Cock-lane, the back of the house joins to mine; the prisoner was taken up, and before Justice Wilmot he confessed that he got in at the window and took the things, that the window was open.</p>
               <p>Were any thing said to him to induce him to confess? - Not that I know of. I said it might be better for him.</p>
               <p>Was there any marks of violence on the window? - The curtains were broke down and the pin that fastened the window has never been found since.</p>

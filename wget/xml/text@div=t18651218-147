                  </hi>. I am butler to Mr. Francis Martin, of Tudor-lodge, Wim<lb></lb>bledon-common—on 9th October, I saw the place secured, and went to bed at half past ten—I was the last up—when I came down next morning, I found my pantry in confusion—I missed two tea-pots, a coffee-pot, and a large quantity of plate that had been safe the night before in a cupboard in the pantry—some of the plated articles were on a cloth, but not part of those which I missed—the plated articles were placed on a cloth; they were not taken—I missed that cloth—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the window of the pantry was wide open, and all over treacle; and there was a quantity of treacle under the window, and some broken paper also inside—the glass of the window was broken—it opens like a door inwards towards the French case<lb></lb>ment window—there were four iron bars outside the window, not very large; they were painted a kind of brown colour—one was pulled right out, and three others bent very much—I should think it would allow one man to get through—I should think I could get through—the glass appeared to me as if it had been cut by a diamond, and removed by the treacle and brown paper—it was cut below the fastening—there was a very large piece of glass taken out—anybody could put their hands through, and open it quite well—I found this painter's putty-knife on the floor of the pantry close to the sink—I also found this file on the sink, and outside the window a piece of strong rope—I also found a piece of white cloth spread on the ground in front of the pantry window, and a green baize cloth was placed on the top of it—there was also a cloth in front of the hall window—I found a <hi rend="italic">jimmy</hi> in the boot-house—on the knife-board I also found some bits of candle and some matches—I also missed two white cloths from the pantry besides the other one—I had known the prisoner before—he used to visit the housekeeper at Mr. Martin's—he was there on the 9th—he left about nine o'clock, just before we had prayers—I noticed a kind of slouched cap on a small table in the servants' hall that evening—the prisoner wore a kind of slouch-looking cap, rather dark, a kind of loose coat, and a fancy shirt, a Jersey—I did not notice whether he had any kind of blouse on.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Have you got three pieces of candle there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, only two; the larger piece, and a piece of sperm candle, which I will swear to—the smaller piece is wax, and the other piece is composite—I swear to the towel by there being a hole in the middle, and it being torn at the corner—I missed it on the morning of the robbery—it had been in my possession some weeks before—no one told me there were two holes in the cloth—I saw it when I put it in the cupboard—I saw it safe on the night of the robbery—it was shown to me on Saturday evening, the 14th, by a constable—he told me he had found it at your residence, and asked me if I knew anything about it—I told the constable, Micklejohn, at the time, that there were two holes in it, and that it was the one I had placed in the cupboard—it is a stable towel—I picked it up outside the pantry door—I wanted it to put the plated articles on, to keep the dust off—it was put underneath them, and also thrown over the top—I had no business with it—the housekeeper did not know I had got it—the painters had been at work at the house—one of the painters employed did not tell me that he knew who that knife belonged to—there was no painting going on in the pantry; I will</p>

               <p>swear that—it has been painted—I will swear that the cupboard door has been painted lately—there were six or seven painters, I think, employed—at the time I lost the towel, I did not tell the constable of it—I missed it before Micklejohn called my attention to it—I did not give information about it—I told Micklejohn I had lost it—on the Thursday morning he told me that there were two foot-marks in front of the pantry window—you have been visiting at the house some considerable time—in August last, I went to the Isle of Wight—my bed-room door is always locked; I never leave it unlocked—we had no footman then—we have one now—he has not the key of my room, nor have I—I have not the key here—my bed-room was locked when I went to the Isle of Wight—I took the key with me—the housemaid could not get into the room, that I know of—on Thursday, 12th October, the officer, King, showed me a brooch with a likeness in it—he said he had never seen the likeness in the brooch before, or the person it represented—I saw foot-marks at Tudor lodge before I saw Micklejohn with the boot—Tuesday, the 17th, was the first time I saw marks—I did not see them until the police called my attention to them—they were in front of the pantry window, about seven yards away—there is no mould there—it is a kind of gravel; ashes and gravel together—it is a path, not a bed—there were no foot-marks found on that path—on the Thursday night, two days after the robbery, you came to Tudor lodge, with your mother—about half-past 9, when you were going to leave, I heard a policeman say, that by Mr. Martin's orders, you could not leave—I did not hear you ask him the reason why you were detained—I did not hear him say that he did not know—I did not see you give the police the keys of your residence—I believe you did—I have got a brother a painter—I did not tell the police so—I always leave the plate down stairs—Mr. Martin's orders were, that I should take the silver up every night to my bed-room; but I thought it quite secure to place it in the plate-cupboard, and lock it up, except when they have been out of town, when I have taken it up into my bed-room.</p>

On Tuesday, 10th October, I went to Tudor-lodge, and found a small piece of candle in the shrubbery, in front of the house; I found another piece of composite candle—I afterwards saw the prisoner at Tudor-lodge, and he told me he lived in Gillaghan-street, Pimlico; that is correct—I went to his lodgings and searched the room and found these pieces of candle—he was not there—he was at Tudor<lb></lb>lodge, and I detained him there while I went to Gillaghan-street—I made inquiries as to where he was on the night of the robbery—I think these pieces of candle correspond with the piece found in the boot room, they are the same sort—I also found this towel at his lodgings, and these two painter's knives; the prisoner's name was on the blade—I believe these knives together make a set of painter's tools—I found a pair of boots at the prisoner's lodgings—I took this one (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) to Tudor-lodge, and then made an impression on the ground by the side of the footprint which I had preserved on the Tuesday morning after the robbery, and put a flower-pot over it—the clay was damp—I got a pair of compasses, measured the two footprints, and they corresponded exactly—the heel of the boot is worn down here and the mark in the clay was raised—I also found a cap at the pri<lb></lb>soner's lodgings—I afterwards took him in custody—he said he knew nothing about it, he was at home that night at eleven o'clock at his lodgings, and he went out by the front gate.</p>

                  </hi>. I was housemaid to Mr. Martin—on Wednesday, before the robbery, I was waiting at table, assisting the butler—I had occasion to go into the butler's pantry, and saw the prisoner in there alone—he was looking at the window—the curtain was thrown half across the window, and the bottom rod was thrown over the roller at the top—I said, "How you startled me"—he said, "You are very soon startled"—the dinner was going in, and I left to attend to it.</p>

I am housekeeper at Mr. Martin's—this towel which is produced, marked "Stable", I lent to the prisoner some weeks before the robbery, to wrap some shirts in; and I told Micklejohn about that—this is marked the same as I lent him, and there was no other one out—this is the towel I lent him—the butler Clay has told me a good many falsehoods, but I don't know that he would tell everybody lies—I never took any notice what he did say, he told so many untruths—I don't mean about this matter particularly—I have caught him in a great many falsehoods.</p>

I made no resistance, he took me out into the highway, he laid me on my back: they took me to the watch-house and searched me, they all know it. My watch was taken from me and 5 s. 6 d. in money; the watch was advertised, and the watch and money was restored to me; I keep a house in Lambeth Marsh: I have witnesses.</p>

I was accosted in Lincolns-inn-fields coming home, by a well-dressed woman, she asked me to give her a glass of wine, I refused to go into any house, she said she knew of an uninhabited house which she could introduce me to. She went up to the door as if with intent to open it, she bid me enter; in a few seconds there was a loud rap at the door, I turned round, thinking it was the woman; I was immediately attacked by a number of persons, one gave me a violent cut in my face, I seized hold of his hand, and wrenched a knife or some weapon out of his hand, which was taken out of my hand, I remained insensible.</p>

             Wynne's head, in Exeter-street. I live in Gray's-inn-lane, coming home there was a crowd, I enquired the reason, and they said there was thieves in the house; being in liquor, I said I would go in, my friend advised me not; I went in with the crowd, going into the kitchen, they laid hold of me, and said I was one of the persons. I said I was an innocent man, but I would make no resistance; my father has a place of 500 l. a year under the King; I am a hosier, but keep no shop, I have orders from the nobility.</p>

                  </hi>. My brother-in-law keeps the Greengate Tavern, City-road—I was assisting there on the night of 1st November—I saw the prisoner in front of the bar about 10 o'clock, with some women—one of the women called for some rum and hot water—I served her, it came to sixpence—there was also a man with the prisoner, and they disputed between them who should pay for the rum—the prisoner took a half-crown and eight pennyworth of coppers out of his pocket—the half-crown looked very like a bad one; it was black—he said he would not pay for the rum, and put the money back in his pocket—he then took a half-crown out of another pocket, and gave it to me to pay for the rum—I looked at it, found it was bad, and broke it in the detector—my brother-in-law looked at it, and asked the prisoner if he had got any more bad money—he said, "No; and that is not bad"—I said, "Yes, it is, and that is not the only bad money you have"—one of the girls then said, "You had better turn your pockets out," and the one that he first took out was produced, the black one—my attention was then called to another part of the bar, and when I looked back I saw the barmaid with a piece of bad money in her hand, which she broke in the detector—the prisoner was afterwards given in charge, and the bad coin given to the policeman—I should know it again—I broke a small piece out.</p>

                  </hi>. I was barmaid at the Greengate Tavern, on this night, and was present when the prisoner and the women were there—I saw him pull out the black half-crown and the coppers, and put them back into his pocket—he had rum and water to drink I heard Miss Layton</p>

               <p>tell him he had more bad money about him—several of the girls told him to empty his pockets and clear his character—after some time he pulled out some silver and coppers from his pocket, with this bad half-crown—the bad half-crown was thrown on the counter, and I picked it up—one of the girls said, "There, you can see that is not a bad one"—I said, "Yes; it is bad enough," and I put it in the detector, and brake it in two places—the landlord and landlady were there, and Mr. Anderson said he would send for a policeman—when he said that they all ran away—the girls went out at one door, and the prisoner by a different door—when Mr. Anderson came back the prisoner was gone—the policeman had the two half-crowns—the prisoner came in and joined the girls in the house.</p>

I then pulled out another, and she said that was a bad one. The policeman then took me into custody. I took it for good money. I never robbed anybody in my life.</p>

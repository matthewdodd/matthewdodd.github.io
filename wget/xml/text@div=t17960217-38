             sworn.</p>

               <p>Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am a jeweller and silversmith, in Dame-street, Dublin.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner at the bar at any time, and when? - A. I saw him either the 16th or 17th of December last, he called at my house with two men, one of the name of Willet, a jeweller, who lives in my neighbourhood, and an auctioneer's clerk, whom I also know.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his name? - A. I don't know, I never heard his name.</p>
               <p>Q. What was his business? - A. They introduced this man to me, telling me he had a number of diamonds to dispose of; that I was a fit man to purchase them; the appearance of the man made me suspect he had not come by these diamonds property; I desired him to leave the diamond pin, which he had with him, and I would consult some person better acquainted with the value of it, which, upon consulting with those men, he consented to do.</p>
               <p>Q. At this time did any conversation pass between you and him? - A. Nothing more than the price that he asked for the pin, which was 150l.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him again? - A. The party went away then, and I went to consult a friend of mine, Mr. Osborne; the prisoner returned in half an hour, to have my valuation; I begged him to walk into the parlour; and I told him, I hoped he would excuse my suspecting that he did not come by these things property; and that if it turned out otherwise, I should apologize to him, or something to that effect; I told him, it was my duty to investigate the business, and that he should explain in what manner he came by the article; at this, he seemed a good deal hurt; and said, if I did not chuse to purchase the pin, to give it back to him; which I refused to do; he then said, his wife had lived servant to the Princess Mary, Elizabeth and Sophia; I am not positive as to the three names; but I am to Mary and Elizabeth; he said, they were given to her for her services, that diamond pin, and others, which, he said, he had; I thought the story an extraordinary one; and, he said, there could be no doubt of it; and that he had a quantity of diamonds coming over from the other side; by which, I understood, he meant England; which he had recovered by an action of trover, since his wife's death; I told him, this story would not satisfy me, and requested him to point out some one in this country to give him a character, otherwise I could not part with it; upon which, he mentioned the name of a Mr. Lee, that keeps a music shop in Dame-street; I went to Mr. Lee, to enquire his character, and he said, after some time recollecting himself, that he had known a man of that name, that had lived a waiter at Deally's club-house.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. What did the prisoner say his name was? - A. Lee; I mentioned the circumstance of bringing the pin to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any further conversation? - A. I told him, that the man he had reserved me to, had given me rather an indifferent opinion of him; that it was my duty to send for an Alderman, which I did; and gave him in custody to Alderman Twiddey.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know that pin again if you were to see it? - A. Yes; the Alderman desired I should lodge examinations against him, which I did; he lives within a few doors of where I live.</p>
               <p>Q.Was the prisoner committed in consequence of those examinations? - A. Yes; he was taken to prison, under the custody of Richard Warren. (The pin was produced). This is the pin I received of the prisoner; I am positive of it; I put my mark upon it, and it has it upon it now.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dingwall. It is a tripple star brilliant pin, estimated in the indictment at 192l. which it cost us.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mr. Moore). Where was this lodged? - A. I deposited it with Alderman Twiddey.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he here? - A. No; Alderman Twiddey sealed up the diamond, in my presence, and lodged it in the national bank.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You received it from the Alderman again, and are sure it is the same you received from the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You told my Lord, and the Gentlemen of the Jury, that you are a jeweller in Dublin? - A. Yes; and a silversmith.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe Dame-street is as public a street as any in Dublin? - A. I have a great many customers.</p>
               <p>Q. It is an open shop? - A. Yes; sitted up exactly as they are here in London; I am not so much in the diamond way, as the silver line.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner produced the pin to you; he did not come by himself? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. He came with two persons whom you knew? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. One was Mr. Willet? - A. Yes; he is a jeweller; his wife keeps a milliner's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he a man of respectability? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The other person is, what? - A. An auctioneer's clerk.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170071"></xptr>Q. Your suspicions were awakened, and therefore you desired to have reference to some person that he knew, in your country? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Was that person that he referred you to, the only person he referred you to? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he refer you to a person of the name of Swarn? - A. He did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did he refer you to? - A. A Mr. Lee, who keeps a music-shop in Dame-street.</p>
               <p>Q. You know Mr. Lee very well? - A. Yes, intimately, and could have relied upon any thing he said.</p>
               <p>Q. You left the prisoner in your house? - A. Yes; under the care of my young man.</p>
               <p>Q. And when you came back again, you found him there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your young man here? - A. He is not.</p>
               <p>Q. The person did give you some account that he knew him some time ago, as a waiter at a club-house? - A. Yes; four years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. And the man gave you a true information that he did know him? - A. Yes; Mr. Lee described the man, and it was certainly the same.</p>
               <p>Q. So that it was not a false account that he gave of himself? - A. It was not.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. He told you he had other diamonds? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That was not after the time that your suspicions had been awoke? - A. No, it was before; for my reason was, to endeavour to get the whole of the diamonds.</p>

I told him 40l. a year; says he, Mr. Warren, I will make you a present of 6 or 700l. worth of value in diamonds, if you will let me escape; he pulled a prayer-book out of his pocket, and he kissed the book; he swore he would tell no one on the face of the earth how he made his escape; and as I was a newly-appointed jailer, no notice would be taken of me; the next day he called me over to the window.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you hear him say that to Thompson? - A. I did; he said something to Thompson to aggravate him, and Thompson was going to fight with him; called him a rogue; I told him, Mr. Lee, I will let you go in the morning, never mind Mr. Thompson, says I, you have vexed him; I forced him into his bed-room; and when I was forcing him into his room, Mr. Warren, says he, have you deceived me? no, says I; says he, for God's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170072"></xptr>sake run me through the body; the next morning, about nine o'clock, I went home; says I, Mr. Lee, what sort of a watch was that you gave me last night, that you said I could so easily get repaired? he put his hand in his pocket, and gave me another gold watch, and two guineas more.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that broke too? - A. No; he owned that himself; he told me it was worth 40 guineas; that he would send me 40 guineas on Saturday, and some plate; I told him I was very sorry for him; that it was my duty to fetch him and the property before the Magistrate.</p>

               <p>Q. But did you understand, from your conversation with him, that it was his child? - A. Yes; he and I brought it down from this Mrs. White's, she had the care of the child at that time; I gave the child to this Mrs. Brown, I carried it to her; and that is all that I can tell about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did he say was the mother? - A. This woman that went by the name of his wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the woman after she was at Mr. Dingwall's? - A. I never saw her in Mr. Ding<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170073"></xptr>wall's house; I heard her name was Sarah Chandler; I don't know.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did the woman go by the name of Sarah Chandler? - A. I never heard her name till I heard it since this passed.</p>
               <p>Q.Where did you see her afterwards? - A. At Mr. Dingwall's door once, but I did not know who lived there.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see her at Mr. Dingwall's? - A. I cannot say when it was; I was going to the palace.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us what time of the year was it? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Winter or summer? - A. The latter end of the fine weather; she was washing Mr. Dingwall's door upon her knees, wiping and washing the door; but I never had any acquaintance with the woman in my life.</p>

               <p>Q.As if she was a servant of the house? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever hear him speak of her as his wife? - A. I never heard that he was married to her; but she used to go in the street by the name.</p>
               <p>Q. But he told you that was his child, and this woman the mother of it? - A. I suppose, by their having the child between them, that it must be so; he never told me any particular thing about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they appear to be persons living together as man and wife? - A. I believe all the neighbours thought so as well as me; I cannot say whether they were or not.</p>

I offered them for sale very openly, which I would not have done, if I had known they had been stolen. Mr. Moore knows I did; he said he wished to have some more conversation with me before he bought them; a person came in and said he had known me 12 years, and knew nothing but honour and honesty of me; there are men in Court know I was four months at Lord Malden's; I appeal to your Lordship to make an enquiry into my character. Before I would be out of employ, I would go into the lowest capacity in life. I was stopped, on the 17th of December, by Mr. Moore, he took pains to enquire my character; I recommended him to Mr. Swaine; he came in to Mr. Moore's parlour, and declared he knew me; Mr. Moore went to Mr. Lee, and, when he came back, he said I had been only a waiter, and could not come honestly by the things. I was sent to Mr. Warren's, on the 17th of December, in the afternoon, and was there till that day eight days; when I had been there five days, I sent to employ Counsellor Manley; he said it was a bailable offence; he came again in the morning, and produced three newspapers, which he said were just arrived from England, and that the things had been stolen, and it was a dangerous thing; Mr. Warren said, if I would give him the things he would liberate me; I sent for a pocket handkerchief with the things, and gave them to him. This woman is perjured; she says my brother came in; he is a chairman to a lady, No. 66, Dorset-street, Dublin. I don't know a woman of the name of Chandler.</p>

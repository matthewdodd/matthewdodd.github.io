                  </hi>. I am cashier to Messrs. Peto, Brassey, and Betts; they are contractors, and are constructing the London, Tilbury, and Southend Railway. The prisoner was a clerk in their office at Barking—the course of business, as regards the payment of the men on Saturday, is this: there are two lots of men, and two sheets are made out; one is given to the time keeper with the money, and he goes up the line to pay one portion of the men; the prisoner and I go down the line with the other sheet and pay the other portion—it was part of the prisoner's duty to enter the men's time with their names, and their money due to them, in the pay book—he would get the materials for that from the time keeper; without that information he would be unable to discharge that duty—it was further his duty to make up from the pay book the pay list, previous to our going down the line to pay—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the original pay list made by him on 12th Aug.—it is in his writing—it was the time keeper's duty to supply him with the names of the men, the time they worked, and the amount due to them, not by word of mouth, but from the book; he holds the book in his hand, and reads from it while the prisoner makes his entries—the pay list ought to correspond with his own entries—I find in this pay list the names of</p>

               <p>"R. Young, 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.," and "R Jones, 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—on 12th Aug. the prisoner accom<lb></lb>panied me down the line, for the purpose of discharging the account due to the different men; we paid them all, with the exception of the items due to Young and Jones—the prisoner took the original pay list in his hand, and I took the money—I saw the list—I carry the money in a bag; he takes the list, and as the men come up he calls out "17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.," or whatever the amount is, with the name; I then hand over the money, and he ticks them off—I do not remem<lb></lb>ber the names of R. Young or R. Jones being mentioned at all, and am not aware of paying them 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each—the men do not come up in rotation, unless a man presents himself, his name is not called out—I have no recollection of these names being called out—one man might take another man's wages, if he gave a reason for it—the prisoner afterwards said, "There will be some men calling at my house, I will take the money for them;" and I handed over to him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I cannot recollect the exact amount, but to the best of my belief, I paid him sufficient to pay the rest of the workmen on the list—I knew what to give him, because he had the paper in his hand, and if he said 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I should hand him over the money directly—I do not examine the list myself—on the Monday the prisoner generally brings the list back to the office; he did so on this Monday—I do not make any memorandum of the amount I actually pay, or of what I leave in his hands—before we set out in the morning the prisoner calls out the amounts; he says, "17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.," and I put 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. into the bag; "18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.," and I put 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. into the bag, so that we have the exact cash—I make no memorandum of the sum I take out, but it is in the book which contains the time keeper's list—I cannot tell you what the whole amount was that the prisoner called out, or the specific sums—the aggregate amount contained these names, of R. Young and R. Jones, and I paid that aggregate amount on account of my employers—the prisoner has been in the office much longer than I have, and he knew more about it—I can charge my memory with giving the pri<lb></lb>soner 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., at least, on this Saturday, in respect of wages of men who had not appeared; and out of that he returned me on Monday morning 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., in respect of a man named Smith, by giving me a sick ticket, which is worth 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in money—when men are ill we pay them 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—on the Monday the prisoner returned the list, and said they were "all right," or "all paid," with the exception of Smith—I glanced at the list, and saw that all the numbers were ticked—I am able to state that it was in the same state then as it is now, but this heavy writing in pencil on the right hand side was not on it—it is my duty to look at the list when he produces it, to show me that it is all correct, and that they are all paid—these ticks are his, they were there then—I am sure that these ticks were against the names of Young and Jones that morning—this cross is Mr. White's, that has been made since—on the following Saturday, 19th Aug., I went down the line with the prisoner, and went through the same course of business—there was a list, but it is not forthcoming, as the prisoner never returned it; but he returned one in the place of it—these entries in the pay book on 19th Aug. are in the prisoner's writing—I find the names of R. Young and R. Jones in it—as the same entry does for the whole page, the names are only writ<lb></lb>ten once; but 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is entered for Jones, and 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for Young, for the week ending 18th Aug.—the wages are calculated down to Friday evening, but we pay on Saturday—Jones and Young did not appear on the line, to my knowledge; and I paid closer attention than usual to the names—I made no memorandum—I did not take the list in my hand, the prisoner had it—I handed over to the prisoner that night on parting with him, 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

White said that it was no such thing, and handed it round to several people who were there, and to Mr. Lockey, a gentleman engaged on the line, in the prisoners presence, and asked his opinion; he said he should say, that it had not been written five minutes—he then gave it to me, and asked me if it was the paper he had taken away on Saturday evening; I said it was not, in the prisoner's hearing—MR. White then accused him of dishonesty, sent for a policeman, and gave him in charge; we then went over to Ilford to a Magistrate—I should not have parted with those sums of money, unless I had believed that those sums were owing by my employers, to Young and Jones—there were no such persons working in their employ<lb></lb>ment at that time.</p>

Brassey's employment about twelve months—I left him some money on 12th Aug., but do not know at all who he was to pay with it—on the second occasion, I left the money in respect of Young and Jones and some sawyers—there is a company of the sawyers, Cobb I think the name is; I left 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for them—I did not make any memorandum of what I left in the bag, nor of the entire amount</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185409180122"></xptr>
               <p>I handed over to the prisoner on the 19th, but I know that it corresponded with these items.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> That is supposing that the money in the bag originally corresponded? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I distinctly counted out 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and handed them to the prisoner—some money remained in the bag, we generally put in a few pounds; because sometimes men call on a Saturday, and receive money who are not in the list at all; there is a man named Foster whose wages are 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month—we have never been short—the prisoner has been out on bail.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Tell me exactly what passed when you got to Barking that evening? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I asked him if there were any men who had not been paid—he said, "Yes," there were these two men, pointing to the paper, Jones and Young—he mentioned the names—he had the list in his hand, and I saw them on it—he said, "These men, Jones and Young are not paid; they will most likely call at my house to night for it, and there is also the balance for the sawyers which I will take as well, and they will call for it"—we then made the calculation, to know what the balance would be for the sawyers—we made it from a small book which is kept by the store keeper, and found that the amount was 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; I then handed all three amounts to the prisoner in separate sums, 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I counted them out separately, and they were placed before him in three separate lots—there were no others unpaid.</p>

                  </hi>. I am time keeper to Messrs. Peto, Brassey, and Betts. It is a portion of my duty to keep a time-book, in which I enter the names of the men, and the length of time that they work—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—on the week ending 12th Aug. I do not find the name of R. Jones or R. Young, nor in the week ending 19th Aug.—no such persons were employed there during that month—if such persons had been in the employment I must have known the fact—at the end of each week I read the time-book out to the prisoner, and he enters the names and items which I read out, into a book which is called the pay book—I did not give him the names of R. Jones or R Young in Aug.—there was a J. Jones the whole of the month—I took his time, but he was not on my list, as I did not pay him—I returned his name to the prisoner—I took one pay list, and Mr. Penny the other—J. Jones would be on Mr. Penny's list, not on this list—it is in a different portion of the line to where Mr. Penny pays the money—J. Jones is one of the gaugers of the plate layers—the money does not come into either of these lists—it would be put on a small scrap of paper.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi>. I am managing agent to Messrs. Peto and Co. for this railway. At the beginning of they month Strong, the time keeper, gives the names of the whole of the men employed to the junior clerk, the prisoner, with their numbers—that is done on a printed form, but in this case the printed form has been omitted, as they lived in the same village, and their business called them together—the numbers affixed to each workman's name remain for the month, and the next month also, if they remain—it is the daily duty to return the men's time, but it is never omitted on Friday, as that is the last day of our week—anything that is not entered ought to be entered on Friday, to make up the accounts for payment—the names are written only once for the month, but the time is put down daily, and the four weeks are made into a total at the end of the month—on Friday or Saturday the prisoners should assist Mr. Penny in making out the list—his first duty is to make up the pay book—I call Mr. Penny the chief clerk and cashier—strictly speaking it is the duty of the cashier, with the assistance of the prisoner, to make up the pay book, and then to take the sums out of the pay book, and make a pay list on the Friday or Saturday—whether Mr. Penny does it, or gets his helper to do it, is a matter between themselves s—two lists are made out—Strong takes the time for the whole of the district, but he can only find time to pay about half of it—the plate layers are not included in either of these lists; they are four or five men working in a gang—I do not know, of my own knowledge, that there was a man of the name of John Jones, a plate layer, but it appears so by the book—it is Penny's duty to see that the plate layers are paid—I know nothing, of my own knowledge, of Saturday evening, 19th Aug., but on the return of the list, on Monday morning, 21st Aug., I was in the counting house when the prisoner came in with the list, without being sent for—I was comparing the lists with a young man named Lockey, and as soon as the prisoner entered I caused the door to be shut, and said, "Are all these men paid, Mr. Penny?"—having got this memorandum in my hand, which I had just been making, he said, "I expect they are"—I said, "How do you know? did you pay them yourself?"—he said he had not paid the whole of them himself—I asked him how many he had paid, and how many he had not—he said there were two whom he had not paid on Saturday, besides some sawyers, and pointed out the numbers of the two men whom he had</p>

Jones or R. Young, in Messrs. Peto's employment, on that line of railway; but I do not know all the men—all the men in Strong's district should appear in the book.</p>

Q.</hi> How long had the prisoner been in the service of Messrs Peto? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think he had been employed under me eighteen or nineteen months—I do not know where he was employed before—he did not bring a four years' character to me, he brought a note to me from a clerk in the London office, to know if I could give him a job—I gave him one at store keeping at first, and then he got into the office.</p>

            . I was at the prosecutor's house on the 1st of October, when the prisoner came and asked for a dark green great coat for Mr. Wiggins, which I gave him; he did not say where it was, but I knew, and gave it him.</p>

            . This coat was brought to me for sale on the 30th of September, by a young man resembling the prisoner - I never saw him before: I believe it to be him - I bought it for 18s.; he told me it was not his own, but a gentleman's, who had sent him, and if he did not approve of the price he should return before four o'clock.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. It is useless for me to make any defence - I am guilty. I had been out of employ five weeks, and was led into this by the prosecutor's own brother; I sold it to Mr. Giles, and the reason I made that agreement was to know if his brother would be satisfied.</p>

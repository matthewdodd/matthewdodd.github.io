I am a olothesman, at 54, Cable Street—on March 11th, about 10.30 the prisoner came to my shop with another woman, and brought this sailor's jacket—I did not notice exactly which carried it—they put it on the counter—one asked 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and the other 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the prisoner then said "Give us the coat back, we forgot to search the pockets"—she took it up, put her hand in the outside pocket and took out a black silk handkerchief, and from the breast pocket she took out a Purse—I could not say exactly what it was, they were standing close together, but I heard a chinking of money, and said "What have you got here?"—they directly put it in their pockets—I said "Can't I see it"—the other girl said "Show I him"—she took the hand out of her pocket to show me she had nothing but what she had in her hand—I said "You have got about fifty sovereigns"—she said "Oh, no, not so much"—I could see some gold—I am not certain whether it was two or three sovereigns, and the rest was in half sovereigns, altogether there was 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—she placed the money back in her pocket—I refused buying the coat, and they walked out, taking it with them.</p>

On Thursday night, March 11th, about 10.45, I saw the prosecutor outside the Standard public-house, covered with blood—I took him to the Home—being a foreigner, I could not understand what he said—I went down Well Street, and saw the prisoner and two other females corning in the direction the prosecutor had Dome from; they were walking then, but when they got to the corner of Well Street they quickened their pace and ran—I followed them through several streets and courts into Blue Anchor Yard, and there I saw the prisoner and another one trying to throw the coat over a hoarding—I took them into custody, but in trying to get the coat I slipped down and they escaped—I saw no more of the prisoner until the 27th, when I took her into custody again, in Dock Street—she said she knew nothing about the coat—I took her to the station, with great trouble—she said the reason why she ran was because she saw three sack girls running, and she ran with them, but she knew nothing of the coat.</p>

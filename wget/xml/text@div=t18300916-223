            . I am the wife of Charles Trenholm. I have known the prisoner twenty-one years. On the 16th of August, he came into my shop, which is a toy-shop; I was packing up a trunk, and I put the articles stated into it - he asked if I had my former husband's snuff-box; I said, Yes - he said, "Let me look at it;" he looked at it, gave it me back again, and I put it into the trunk - a person then came in, and I went away on business; I returned in about ten minutes - the prisoner still stood there; he said,"Your trunk is too full," and he pressed his hands upon it - it was then locked and taken to the Commercial-road, where I was then moving; on the 18th I missed this property from my trunk - I went to the prisoner; he said he had not taken it nor seen it - I sent for Mr. Bird, and for the Policeman; he still denied it, but in going out he said he had robbed me and pawned the things.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Where is your husband? A. I do not know - I have not seen him for seven months; I never lived in the house with the prisoner in my life - we were not very good friends; he has said some very disrespectful things of me - I was going to Mr. Shelley's, in the Commercial-road; I did not make any arrangement for the prisoner to come there to see me- I went there on the 16th, and had the prisoner taken on the 19th; he had never pawned any thing of mine by my permission - no one was present when he said he had robbed me; he called me into the parlour, and told me he had robbed me - he then told me again in the presence of Mr. Bird and the Policeman; I did not tell him to say he had taken these things as it would save my character, and I would not hurt him - my husband has not parted with me from jealousy of this man; his affairs were embarrassed - the families were unhappy, and we parted; there was no jealousy - we never thought of such a thing.</p>

I was sent for to remove the goods, on the evening of the 16th, and on the 19th she sent for me - she said she had been with Henry Baker some time, and she felt suspicions that he had taken these things; I asked him if he had - he said No, he had not; I stated the situation in which he stood, and I believe the prosecutrix said, "If you will but make up the property, I will forget and forgive it" - I said I would fetch the Policeman; he then called her into the parlour - they were not there half a minute, when she came out, and said, "He acknowledges he has taken the things, and he will at some future time get them back;" I said,"Where have you pawned them?" he said, "I don't know;" I said, "Where are the duplicates?" he said,"I don't know" - I said it was a very bad job, and told the Policeman to search him; he found a sovereign, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183009160101"></xptr>the prisoner said, "That is the sovereign I pawned the snuff-box for."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a coal-merchant, and live at Battle Bridge. In September, 1838, I engaged the prisoner as my clerk, at 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, to collect money, and receive orders—his duty was on the same evening, or next morning at the latest, to pay the whole over to me—Harriett Draper is a customer of mine—he accounted to me for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from her on the 15th of April, last year—he never said he had received 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
               <p>

               <p>20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. is entered by him as having been received on Mr. Draper's account—the last entry of 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. is on the 9th of May—on the 9th of May 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was owing from Mrs. Draper, according to the prisoner's account—20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was paid him on the 9th of May, which made 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. remaining due to me, according to that collecting book—I looked through all my different books to ascertain the amount of the prisoner's deficiency if I could, with respect to one book, the Chelsea round, but that would not throw any light on this—it was agreed that I was to stop 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week out of his wages to make up the deficiencies discovered on the 15th of January, but none else, and I did stop 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—I think I continued to stop that till May—8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was the amount, but I was also to stop 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. which he owed me for coals—he continued in my service till the 30th of July—one deficiency turned up after another till we got to one hundred and ninety-seven of them—at the time I stopped the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week for the deficiencies discovered in January, I knew nothing about the receipt of Mrs. Draper's 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mrs. Draper's account is not in the Chelsea book—I did not discover the receipt of this sum till August this year—I told him I had looked through this book—every day he came to my wharf I had some conversation with him on the subject of further errors in his account—I cannot tell whether or not I had a conversation with him on the 17th of July—it is very likely I had—shortly before he left I insisted on having a statement drawn up of the amount of deficiencies in all the books, that I might balance my stock—I proposed at the latter end of June or beginning of July this year that he should remain in my service, provided he would give me security for his honesty in future—I did not wish to go to these extremes, but he treated it as a matter of indifference—he was to give me security that should any future deficiencies arise I might be indemnified by some money—I under<lb></lb>stood he had some property and thought his security in his handwriting might be sufficient—I did not at that time know of this deficiency of Mrs. Draper's—the terms I proposed were not acceded to—he has not had his wages for the last four days, because he did not come to the counting-house for them—up to that time I paid him—I left off deducting the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week some time in May—the amount of Mrs. Draper's account is 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I think—here is an entry of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. but that is a new bill—5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. is the amount she owed me after the 28th of February. On the 15th of April there ought to have been credit given for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. instead of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this entry of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. is in his handwriting, showing the sum actually due from her, but more coals had then been had—I told him the draft of the agreement did not meet my views, and in consequence of the many defalcations I had found since it would not suit me—he said it did not agree with his habits to come so much to the counting-house, and he wanted something where he was more at liberty—I said on one occasion I should require him to continue in my service on certain conditions, and if it was not so I should prose<lb></lb>cute him—I do not think I told him that unless he entered into this agree<lb></lb>ment I would prosecute him—I should be afraid to swear I did not, but it is the impression on my mind—I entered the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week which I stopped out of his wages in my driblet book, which is here—I have not stopped more than 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—here is an entry of 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the 25th of July—I had forgotten that, but still the amount is the same.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">JONES</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the prisoner object to your making this deduction as more than you were entitled to make? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He did not—he never said that he had made a mistake with regard to Mrs. Draper's 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—up to the</p>

               <p>time I mention she owed me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—if he had accounted for the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. it would be 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but there is an additional pound in her bill which I could not bring home to him, she having lost the bill—I told him the agreement did not meet my views, and I abandoned it—he did not give me notice that he was going to leave—he usually dined and drank tea with us on Saturday.</p>

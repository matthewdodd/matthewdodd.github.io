                  </hi>. I am the wife of Jacob Stevens, who is a porter in the Paragon, at Blackheath. On the 20th of May I was in Greenwich fair, about one o'clock in the day, looking at a show—I felt a hand in my pocket, turned round, and saw the prisoner standing close by the side of me—I said he had picked ray pocket—he said if I said that I should swear his life away—I said, "They are my halfpence and penny-pieces you have in your hand, and I will hold you till I feel"—I did so, and then he passed it to another as soon as I said it was mine—he got away from me, but I caught him again, and a policeman, in plain clothes, came and took him—I am quite sure he is the person who had my money—I did not see his hand come out of my pocket, but he was the closest to me—there was another standing behind, to whom I saw him pass the money—I distinctly saw the money in his hand.</p>

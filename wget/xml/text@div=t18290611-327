On the morning of the 25th of May I was watching some buildings; I fell asleep, and at ten minutes after three o'clock the watchman came and awoke me - I saw a hat by my side; I got up, found my own new hat was gone, and an old one left in its place - I had only had mine one week, and gave 5s. for it; this is it.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM FINCH. I am a watchman. I saw the witness asleep on the morning of the 25th of May, at a quarter before three o'clock; he had a good hat on his head - I went down the lane, came up again, and saw him asleep, with an old hat lying by his side; I told him of it - I took the prisoner the next day; he offered me 5s. not to take him, and said he had a wife and two children.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM SMITH. On the 25th of May my brother-in-law came to me, and said he had lost his bat; I said,"This old hat belongs to Bill Bucker," which is a name the prisoner goes by - I have seen him with it frequently.</p>
               <p>ROBERT LOCK. The prisoner was given to me the next day, at the office door; he said the hat he had on was his own, but we sent for the prosecutor, who claimed it.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. That hat does not belong to him.</p>

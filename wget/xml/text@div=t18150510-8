The prisoner came into our shop on the 18th of April, about ten o'clock in the forenoon, she asked to look at some cotton shawls; she said, she lived over the way, at a bakers shop. I took her to the counter in that part of the shop where the shawls were; I shewed her several; she fixed on one, and before she purchased it, she said, she should like her mistress to see it; I then let her have it, and she went out, and I saw her go into the shop of Mr. Johnson; she staid there about five or ten minutes, she then came over, she returned to the shop with the shawl, saying, her mistress thought it was not good enough. She said, she thought, she would like one in the window; there were several in the window; she pointed one out in the window; after seeing it, she said, she wanted some scaffs; which I shewed her; she then fixed on one; she then said, that she wished her mistress (who lived over the way) might see it, before she purchased it, that she might not think her too extravagant; she then said, how can I get my mistress over; have you a housekeeper? I will say you want to pay your bread bill; she said, she might not cross directly over, for fear of her mistress seeing her; she went out, and instead of crossing over, she went up the next street; I then followed her; I overtook her two doors up, and said, she must return back to the shop with me; she hesitated a little at first, and afterwards went with me; when she was in the shop, I told her we wanted to know about the shawl; on which, she began to take a shawl out of her pocket; she said, she would pay me for it, but said, let her go; I told her she must not go before I fetched a constable; I fetched the constable; I gave her in charge to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known the prisoner before - A. No, I had not; she was not servant to Mr. Johnson, as she said, I am sure of that; she never had been her servant.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you bread of Johnson - A. Yes, Mr. Taylor's house-keeper had. The constable has the shawl; I had seen that shawl a few minutes before I found it on her; I had shewn it to her among other shawls, the value of it is eleven shillings.</p>

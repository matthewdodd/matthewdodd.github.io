            . I am a Thames Police-surveyor. On the 11th of May, at 2 o'clock in the morning, I saw a light on board the Brigg barge, and saw a can handed down from the deck; I went on board and found Saffery on the deck; I said "What have you there?" He said,"Porter and a general cargo;" I went into the hold and found a spile in the porter cask - I said, "You have been spiling a cask, and I saw a can handed down;" Austin, who was below, said it was necessary to spile casks - I searched for the can, and said it was very odd I could not find it; I went down a second time with Dean, the master, and found the can under a sack, with a quantity of porter in it - I found a gimblet on Austin, and a piece of a different spile; the gimblet was wet, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182805290107"></xptr>fitted the hole in the cask; Austin said, "We were very dry, and thought no harm of taking a little porter."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Does not the beer work at times? A. Yes; they then make a hole in the top of the cask, but this was in the head; their work is hard.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were they at work there? A. No.</p>

               <p>(Looks at his minutes.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Morgan, Prisoner's Counsel. Did you make these minutes at the time? - Yes; there were twenty pieces of long lawns, twenty pieces of muslins, and nineteen of handkerchiefs, which we could not ascertain; the chief of the robbery was lawns and muslins, and some Irish, which people have been convicted of; the suspicion fell first on some carpenters; I sent after Rogers; some time after he came to my house; I then sent for a constable, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250232"></xptr> took him into custody; there were found upon Rogers, ninety guineas and a half and some silver; he was committed to Tothill-fields for a week; from thence he was brought before my Lord Mayor, he committed him a close prisoner; on Wednesday I went to Mr. Clarke, and told him the transaction, and he put me in a way; Mr. Clarke sent me to a Jew in Houndsditch; his name is Lee; I was sent to a man whose name is Farmer; who lives in Petticoat-lane; Farmer would not confess without he was excused; I attended the taking of the goods; the prisoner said, he had had the goods of Mrs. Haslam, who has been tried here, and Mrs. Haslam, in the presence of the prisoner, said, she did not know him.</p>
               <p>What did the prisoner say? - God bless me, Mrs. Haslam, you do not know me! No, I never saw you in my life; that was the answer; he was then committed on that evidence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Morgan. You mentioned that you advertised these things? - No, not the things, but I advertised the person, with a hundred pounds reward.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. This is the advertisement that brought us acquainted with your client, Mr. Morgan; you offered a hundred pounds reward? - Yes, on the apprehending and conviction of the man as described, and I conceived the description to answer to the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>How many times have you been in the prison to see Rogers? - A number of times.</p>

               <p>Did you see them frequently afterwards together? - I cannot say how often; it might be half a dozen times; I believe they might spend a couple of evenings together.</p>

               <p>I am one of the headboroughs of Shoreditch parish; I apprehended the prisoner; I had information on the 27th of February, about four in the afternoon I apprehended him; I stood at the end of Gravel-lane; I asked him what property that was under his arm; and he said, it was nothing to me; I took him to Mr. Wilmott's office; he made some resistance; he told me the property he had from Mrs. Haslam; these are things; then I took him and Mrs. Haslam to the compter; Mrs. Haslam denied knowing any thing of him.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The marks are taken off these things, but we were robbed of muslins of the same quality; and I have every reason to believe this to be one of the pieces; we lost six.</p>
               <p>Mr. Morgan. Then that you cannot swear to? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. It is the very same sort of muslin you lost? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Does there appear marks to be taken off? - It does; and ours were marked in the same place; a little of the ink came through.</p>
               <p>Is not that the usual place for marking all muslins? - It is.</p>
               <p>From the view of that muslin, in the state in which you now see it, can you form any belief that it is yours? - We had lost muslins of this quality, and I believe this to be ours.</p>
               <p>From all the circumstances which you have heard when this muslin was found, I have not the least doubt but you believe it to be yours; but suppose you had found a piece of muslin in the state in which you have now seen this, in the shop of any reputable<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250233"></xptr> tradesman, should you have known it to be yours? - It is impossible; there is a hundred pieces in the bale; at the same time I have not the least doubt but it is mine; had it been found without circumstances of suspicion, I should not have thought of such a thing, and I could not have formed such an opinion.</p>
               <p>Mr. Morgan. You have given a very fair answer to the last question, which does you honour, therefore it will save me a deal of trouble; I only ask, whether you have not, in the course of a short time last past, disposed of a great many pieces of muslin of the same sort? - Undoubtedly I have. (The muslin shewn to the Court.) This is the place where the mark usually is, and the ink being damp has made a little mark.</p>
               <p>Court. Is it usual to take off the marks of the goods unless they are cut? - Not at all; I dare say there is not a piece of muslin out of that bale that has the mark off.</p>
               <p>Mr. Morgan. But there is a possibility that the mark might be rubbed off by carriage? - I dare say it might be rubbed off; you see it has been rubbed off; it is gummed paper; it is not easy to rub off; there is something at the corner which appears to be India characters.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I lived with the prosecutor nine weeks; I knew the defendant many years ago.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. While you lived with Messrs. Acton and Eyre, did you take any muslin from them? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>What did you do with it? - Haslam had a good deal of it, and different people; on the Monday morning after I came from my master's, I went to Haslam's, and after I had been there a few minutes Evans came up stairs; I asked him if he was not the person who had lived with my father; and he said, he was; I told him to go to the Bell in Noble-street; I would come to him; the Bell was then kept by Mr. Freeman.</p>
               <p>What passed between you? - Talking of one thing or another; he said, he had some goods of Mrs. Haslam, and she had told him they were one Rogers's goods, but that he did not think it was me; he said, he had bought a good many things of her; and most of the things Mrs. Haslam had of me; and he asked me if I had any thing, and he would give me ready money for it; I said, there were some at Mrs. Haslam's, and I would fetch them over directly; I went over and fetched one whole piece of lawn, and another of which about two yards had been cut off.</p>
               <p>Was that part of Mr. Eyre's muslin? - It was; when I brought them to the Bell, Evans and me went into the parlour to look at them; and agreed for them; I think he was to give me two guineas and a half for each of them; I received from him I think, four pounds fifteen shillings in the whole; we stopped there, and a man came in and went out with him; the next day I saw him again at the Bell, and there was a whole piece of plain muslin, and half a piece of striped; he gave me four guineas and a half for the whole piece; but I cannot say what the other was.</p>
               <p>How came you to meet him again that day? - He promised to come that day to have some more; he said, he would come if I had any thing else, and he would give me ready money for them if it was ever so much.</p>
               <p>How often did you meet him afterwards? - I do not know whether it was the next day, or the Thursday, at the Cooper's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250234"></xptr> Arms; we were first at the Bell by appointment, and then we went down to the Cooper's Arms; he had a patch or two of callico then to make a gown.</p>
               <p>These things that you sold to him were all the property of Messrs. Eyre and Acton? - They were.</p>
               <p>Do you know the real value of them, did you sell them at the highest possible price? - I do not know what they were worth.</p>
               <p>Were the marks on when you delivered them? - I am not sure of that; I never took the marks off.</p>
               <p>Mr. Morgan. Did you tell him how you came by the goods? - I told him I left my place, and I thought they knew nothing about them.</p>
               <p>What did you tell him? - He mentioned different porters; and said, he had some of them; he said, he could not deal with Kent, he was too dear.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Repeat what you said just now? - I said I left my place, and I thought there was no suspicion of me; then he asked me where I lived; and I told him I had left my place.</p>
               <p>Did he ask you where you got these goods you were selling to him? - I cannot say whether he asked me or not, but he asked whether the marks were in.</p>
               <p>What answer did you make him? - I told him I did know, I thought Mrs. Haslam took them out generally.</p>
               <p>Did he look to see whether the marks were in? - Yes, he did look when he was opening them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Morgan. Did not you tell him they were smuggled goods? - No, Sir, I did not.</p>
               <p>You say that upon your oath, nor even hint it to him? - No, I did not; he knew very well where they came from; I never told the prisoner that Mr. Eyre did deal in smuggled goods.</p>
               <p>Did not you tell him that you had lived at a tavern? - I did.</p>
               <p>Did you tell him that you lived at a tavern at that time? - I cannot remember that he asked me any thing about it; I told him what place I lived at in town.</p>
               <p>You have been both in custody togegether? - He was in custody when I was.</p>
               <p>Was not you in the same prison? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not you sleep together some nights? - We did one or two nights; I told him nothing any farther, than that I should speak the truth, and that I must speak the truth I never told him that; Mr. Eyre had been several times.</p>
               <p>Did not you tell the prisoner, during the time you slept with him, that Mr. Eyre threatened you, if you did not convict him, he would lock you up? do you remember any particular conversation that you had with Hyam Moses? - I do not know Hyam Moses as I know of.</p>
               <p>Do you remember having any conversation with any one of the prisoners, or any one in the prison respecting this prosecution? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Did not you say that another witness was wanting to make your evidence be confirmed? - I never heard any thing at all about it.</p>
               <p>Did you ever tell Moses, or any body so? - No, Sir, nor never heard any thing of it till now.</p>
               <p>When were the last goods you sold this man? - It was on a Thursday, I do not know the day of the month, it was the same week.</p>

               <p>Court. I think you said that before that Monday when you met him at Haslam's, you had not seen him for a dozen years? - I never saw him while I lived with my master, nor at the meeting with the taylor. (The piece shewn to Rogers.) It was one just like that, a heavy piece, I cannot be sure; it was a whole piece.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. They all run the same length; this piece is worth three pounds ten shillings, or four pounds.</p>
               <p>Court. Then this man made a very hard bargain if it was worth then four pounds.</p>
               <p>Court to Rogers. What did he give you for the piece of plain muslin? - To the best of my knowledge, four guineas and a half.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses to his character.</p>

               <p>Court. Let this prisoner receive sentence with the others concerned in the same transaction.</p>

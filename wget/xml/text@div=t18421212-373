                  </hi>. I am assistant to George Smellie, a pawnbroker, in Shadwell. On the 12th of Dec. the prisoner came about a quadrant and a ring—he put the ring on his finger, and talked of buying it—I made him put it back, and said I did not think he wanted to buy—he went away without baying either quadrant or ring—when he was gone I missed a cameo-ring—I went after, and overtook trial about 130 yards off—I desired him to return, and charged him with stealing a ring—he said he had not got it—I said I should give him in charge—he said, "Don't—come home with me, and I will make it all right"—I sent for an officer—he then began to feel about his pockets, and pulled out a piece of rag, and this ring fell from it—I said that belonged to me, and I should give him in charge—he said, "Don't give me in charge, come with me, and I will give you a couple of pounds"—this is my master's ring—it in a box cameo-ring, and the one I lost.</p>

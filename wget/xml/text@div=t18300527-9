On the 16th of May, about half-past nine o'clock at night, the prisoner, who was a stranger, came to lodge at our house for the night - I put him into a room on the second floor; we sleep on the first floor - I observed that he brought a bundle, which he carried up to his room, at half-past eleven o'clock, when he went to bed; I got up before eight - I had not locked my bed-room door; I left a child there till about nine - the prisoner came down about ten; he had paid for his bed the night before - I thought his bundle larger than it was at night; he walked into the parlour - I sent the servant up to see that all was right, and as he was going out I wished to see the contents of his bundle - he wished me to go up stairs first to see if I missed any thing; I said I might not miss many things, and wished to see his bundle; first he objected; I sent for an officer, but before came the bundle was opened, and in it was a tippet, a gown-piece, two shifts, two shawls, and a silk handkerchief - I went up stairs, and missed a shawl, which he gave me out of his coat pocket, and a brooch from his trousers pocket - the property is worth much more than 6l.; forty-six keys were found on him.</p>

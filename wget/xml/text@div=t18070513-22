               <p>Q. What countryman is he. - A. He says that he was born in London, but that he has spent most of his time in Ireland. On the 4th of May last he was at work at my shop; about three o'clock a friend called upon me, he agreed to stop to dine with me; in the interim before dinner I was shewing him several watches, and among the rest was the gold repeater; that was the last I shewed him.</p>
               <p>Q. You replaced it I suppose. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a valuable watch. - A. Yes, it stands me in upwards of twenty pounds. A short time after I had gone in to dinner with my friend in a back room. I had left the prisoner in the shop; in about twenty minutes or half an hour after that, my servant called me and told me that the prisoner at the bar had run away; I could not believe it at first till they told me he had taken his hat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go out to your shop immediately. - A. Yes, and I immediately missed this gold repeater, and a common silver watch.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the silver watch before. - A. In the course of an hour before.</p>
               <p>Q. You are quite sure of that. - A. Perfectly so. After consulting a little with my friend we agreed to go to Bow-street. We got there at a time when there was no business done; there we determined to go to several pawnbrokers, and leave the names and the numbers of the watches; one of the pawnbrokers that I went to was Mr. Lee at the corner of Dean-street in Holborn; when I enquired of him whether any of these watches had been offered to him, yes, he said, the silver watch.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker at the corner of Dean-street in Holborn. On the 4th of May, about four or five o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came and pledged a silver watch with me (I am quite certain of his person) for one pound fifteen. A short time after I had taken it in Mr. Duncan called, I shewed him the watch, he said it was his immediately. On the 8th of May, a person of the name of Southgate came to redeem the watch; I asked him how he came in possession of the ticket, as Mr. Duncan had ordered me to stop any person; he told me the person that gave him the ticket was at his house in Tabernacle-square; I took Southgate to Hatton Garden office, from there I went with Southgate and Stanton the officer, and we took the prisoner.</p>

By sight, I never saw him in my life before last Friday, between twelve and one o'clock on the 8th of May, he came into my house, he said he was very aukward, not having a watch in his pocket, he said he had one in Holborn, and if he could get any body to go for it, he would satisfy them for it.</p>
               <p>Q. He asked you to go for it did he. - A. Yes, he was then at my house; he gave me the ticket, a one pound note, half a guinea, and a seven shilling piece to redeem it; I went to the gentleman, I laid the ticket on the desk, I asked for the watch</p>
               <p>Q. You told Mr. Lee the man from whom you had the watch of. - A. Yes, and according to what I said they found it true.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, I live in Tabernacle row, City Road. On Thursday evening the 7th of May, about eight o'clock in the evening, a woman<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180705130013"></xptr> of the name of Southgate brought a watch to my shop.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a watch. - A. A gold repeater.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you happen to know whether that is the wife of the last witness. - A. I never saw the man before this business; the woman was in the habit of coming to my shop. I interrogated her concerning the property; she told me it belonged to a captain of a ship, that he was a respectable inhabitant of this parish, meaning the parish in which I live; that he was a friend and regular visitor of one of the ladies in her house. I put the question more than once, whether he was a stranger, or a person she had seen more than once; to which she answered that she knew him well; she added that if she was not sure that all was perfectly right she would not have brought the watch. In consequence of that I gave her eight pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course you gave her a ticket. - A. Yes. On the following afternoon about four o'clock, Stanton the officer, and Mr. Duncan entered the shop; they produced the ticket; and on my shewing the watch, he claimed it as his property. Before I shewed the watch to Mr. Duncan he told me the name and the number; I looked and found it was so.</p>

I am single, and am servant to Miss Bernard, of Black<lb></lb>heath—on Monday, March 19th, I and my fellow servant went to bed at about a quarter to eleven, after we had locked the house up—we fastened the windows and the doors—at about half-past seven next morning we came down and found the house in great confusion—the window in the the room leading to the drawing room was partly open—that window looks into the back garden—the shutter was partly down—I am sure it had been fastened the night before, but I am not sure as to the window—the door leading from that room into the garden was wide open—some missionary boxes had been broken open and the money taken away—I missed some silver tea<lb></lb>spoons of my mistress's property, and marked, "R. G. S."—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I had seen them safe on the shelf the night before—several of the young ladies boxes were broken open—I know the spoons, I have cleaned them.</p>

I am a widow, and live at Wilcox-place, Deptford—the prisoner is my son—he lived with me on account of ill-health—on Satur<lb></lb>day morning, 24th March, I left him taking breakfast at about twenty minutes to eight—I live in apartments—no one occupies the room but my-self—I returned home about twenty minutes to nine that night—the police<lb></lb>man Membery followed me in—directly before I got a light I heard from him that my son was in custody—the constable searched the room in my presence—I saw the things found—I missed a screwdriver like this before this night, but I cannot swear to this—it is something like this—I had mine shortly before the night the policeman came.</p>

On Friday, 23d March, from some information I received I went to Mr. Martin's—he is not here—I had information that the prisoner had offered him part of a silver spoon for sale—the prisoner was not there—the prisoner brought a part the following day—I spoke to him—the other constable took him in custody and searched him—he refused his address—I then found his mother's address—I made inquiries and went to her—she was not at home; I waited till she came</p>

               <p>home—I then followed her up stairs, and on the mantelpiece of the back room I found the bowls of four silver spoons—on further search I found under the fender the handles of three silver spoons (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they are marked "R. G. S."—I found in the table this sling used as a life preserver, loaded inside—in a little drawer in the table I found these tins—metal has been melted in them, as is supposed—there is a little metal in them.</p>

I am a watchmaker—on 23d March, between six and seven in the evening, the prisoner brought me this part of a silver spoon (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he asked me whether it was silver—it was between lights and I said I doubted it—I tried it and found it was silver—he asked me if I would purchase it—I asked him whether it was his own, and where he got it from—he said he had found it among the dust—I gave him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it—the constable came on the next morning and I gave it up.</p>

                  </hi>. I am cashier to George Myers, of Belvi<lb></lb>dere-road, Lambeth; Brown has been employed by him, but I do not know whether Moynihan has—on 2nd Dec. Moynihan presented this paper to me—Brown was with him—(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Please pay Coin, bricklayer, two days, five hours, 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. Zincraft.")—Zincraft is the time keeper at our place in Friday-street—I asked Brown if it was for work done at our place in Friday-street—he said, "Yes"—I then asked Moynihan, and he said the same—I immediately saw that they were forgeries (there was another paper also)—I put the money down on the table, and when Brown was in the act of taking it, I had sent some clerks round to detain them, and they were taken.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">policeman, L</hi> 157) I took the prisoners—they said that they were employed by Mr. Myers—when they arrived at the station, they said that they met some men in the Waterloo-road, who were drunk, and gave them the orders, and asked them to go and get them cashed for them, and they would wait at the corner of the street till they came out—I searched the prisoners, and on Moynihan I found this piece of blank paper, concealed in the lining of his jacket, at the back; it corresponds in quality with this on which the order is written.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is it a very ordinary sort of paper? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—there were holes in his pockets, but they were very small; I felt the paper, but was some time before I could find the way to it—I did not take them to see if two men were waiting for them, they did not say so till after they arrived at the station—I believe the Magistrate asked me on the second occasion why I did not do so.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The prisoners' statements before the Magistrate were here read as follows: Moynihan says:</hi> "It is a mistake, it was on Westminster-bridge that we met the men; they asked us if we knew which was Myers' yard, and we said, 'Yes,' and they gave us the tickets, and asked us to draw their money; they seemed to be intoxicated; they were to wait till we came out; one of the men said that if they asked how long I had worked, I was to say two days five hours; the other man gave Brown his ticket, and we went down the yard together; Brown handed in his ticket first, and I after, and the moment the tickets were out of our hands we were seised by a lot of men; I saw no money and received no money." Brown says: "I have nothing more to say than the other—has said.")</p>

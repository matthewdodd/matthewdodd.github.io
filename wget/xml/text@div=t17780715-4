               <p>You did not see any fire arms upon either of them? - No, only this great stick; he said that would not do; I drew my pocket up with my hand; the other man put his hand to my pocket to feel if I had left any money in my pocket, but the pocket being drawn up he did not feel it; I went on to a public house that adjoins the Palatine houses.</p>
               <p>What is the sign of the house? - I believe it is the sign of the Hare and Hounds, I am not positive as to the sign; they refused to lend me any assistance. I thought they would see my watch, I concealed it; the next morning I gave information at Mr. Wilmot's office that I had been robbed; they sent me word in the evening to attend; that a number of people were apprehended, I was so much hurried there that I could not at first say any thing to them; when they came to be arraigned at the bar the prisoner struck me instantly, then I knew him directly; but I rather chose to see him a second time before I swore positively to him; he was committed the first time for further examination, because the man whom I suspected was along with him was not then taken; on the Tuesday following the justice told me to attend again, which I did, then they had apprehended<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177807150007"></xptr> the other man, there were many circumstances that would have induced me to believe the other to be the man, but they were not sufficiently satisfactory to myself.</p>

               <p>Were you certain on that day to the prisoner? - Yes; though the prisoner had taken some pains to deceive me in his dress, yet I was satisfied from a particular circumstance.</p>
               <p>What created a doubt the first time? - The difference of his dress; I had rather a little doubt, but I was then pretty certain he was the man.</p>
               <p>Can you take upon you to swear now that is the man? - I can positively.</p>

               <p>Mr. Bishop gave an information at Mr. Wilmot's office that he had been robbed on the third of June, and according to the intelligence he left, we suspected the prisoner and the other man; I apprehended them, and when Mr. Bishop saw them he swore positively to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>When I was taken up at Robinson's, this and another man desired me to go with him, I went directly to Mr. Wilmot's office; I sat in the public house there with some more men; this gentleman came in, he said he believed me to be the man that robbed him; I was ordered to go down to prison; they let me go to and fro as I pleased; I went away and went home; knowing myself to be innocent, I directly went down to New Prison for fear any thing might come of it; I asked there if any thing was alledged against me; they said no there was not; I staid at Mr. Bond's for some of Mr. Wilmot's men for two hours; I left word with Mr. Bond where I was going to; and if I should not be there, I should be at home, and if there was any thing against me, I would come up the next morning on Tuesday; accordingly this Yardly came to my house next morning, and knocked at my door; I let him in; he asked me how I came to go away, and if I would come after him to the justice's; I said I would, I went and washed myself while he waited an hour for me in a public house; when I went there was no prosecutor to be seen; I was ordered down to New Prison; I came up on Tuesday, the prosecutor came up; then he ordered me to put the coat of the man on I stood at the bar with, which I did; all my other clothes which I had were produced; when I put it on, he directly swore to me; he said he saw me ten minutes after ten with a handkerchief over my nose; and that he knew me well by my eyes.</p>
               <p>Jury to the prosecutor. I think you said there was a particular circumstance that induced you to believe that he was the man; what was that circumstance? - I thought it would not be favourable to the prisoner to mention it; and I thought it not altogether evidence; the person that was taken with him that they called his partner had the great coat on before the justice that the prisoner had on when he robbed me; I said to the justice I was sure that was the coat the prisoner had on when he robbed me, the prisoner swore many oaths that he would not put it on; the justice insisted on his putting it on; he said they should cut his arms off before he would put that great coat on; I afterwards told the justice I was very well satisfied as to his person without it; then the prisoner said, to satisfy me he would put it on; he put it on; though I was sufficiently satisfied before, yet that made me exceedingly more satisfied afterwards.</p>
               <p>For the prisoner.</p>
               <p>RICHARD BOND sworn.</p>
               <p>What I am subpoenated for, is to prove that he came on the 5th of June to New Prison and knocked at the gate; he wanted the key, I said you cannot get in Stewart, it is after the time of the bell ringing; why said he I should get in as a prisoner; there was a jew young fellow that I never saw before with him; he came in a coach; the prisoner told me he had been taken up for a footpad robbery, and had been examined before Mr. Wilmot; I asked him where the commitment was, he said he had none; I looked upon it that he was only in joke, so did the turnkey at the gate; I asked him where it was that he ran away from the constable; he said he got over the wall, and went from there to Whitechapel and got in a coach, and came down; I kept him in talk a good while; by and by one of our men who attends at Mr. Wilmot's office, and two men came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177807150008"></xptr> in search of him; I said he has been with me above an hour and half; I could hardly credit what he said, he told me that if the men that attend justice Wilmot's office came, they would find him at home; they went afterwards and found him at home.</p>

               <p>How came you to remember the day? - Because the next day was the king's birth day, which made me take the more particular notice of it; he staid there from between seven and eight till half past twelve; I lit him out of bed then, I mean out of the street door then.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he use to come to the house? - Very often, just to have a pint of beer, or such a thing.</p>
               <p>How often in a week might he come there, four or five times? - Sometimes more, sometimes less, I never made any particular remark of that.</p>
               <p>What can make you fix upon the 3d of June as the particular day more than any other? - Because the next day was his majesty's birth day.</p>
               <p>Was he there the next day? - Yes, in the morning he was.</p>
               <p>Did he use to sup at your house? - Not very commonly.</p>
               <p>How came you to say it was seven o'clock? - Between seven and eight I cast my eye to the dial in the house to see when they would be boiled enough; that was a few minutes after he came into the house.</p>
               <p>Was any body with him? - Nobody but his spouse.</p>
               <p>They came together? - No, he came in first, she afterwards.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Evergreen-lodge, Lewisham, with my father, George Heath Parkinson. On Sunday, the 28th of May, I went to bed about half-past eleven o'clock, leaving an enamelled watch, a gold chain, and a gold pin, on my drawers—I got out of bed at two o'olock in the morning, to see what time it was, and missed the watch and chain—I did not miss the pin till I dressed myself in the morning—I was not disturbed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the witness's brother, and live with my father. I was at home on the night of the 29th of May—I am not aware that any<lb></lb>thing disturbed me, but I awoke about a quarter to two o'clock, got out of bed, and looked at my watch, which was safe then—about half an hour after<lb></lb>wards I was in bed, and had not gone to sleep again—I fancied I heard a noise of somebody walking up the back staircase—I listened about two minutes, and was then almost satisfied that I heard somebody go into the billiard-room—I got out of bed, and went into the billiard-room with a light—not finding anybody, I went down stairs, searched the house—I found nobody, and returned to my room—I got up, about half-past three, as I was going out—it was quite light then—I looked out of my window, and saw the prisoner in our meadow, adjoining our garden—I watched him—he was standing under a tree—I saw him pass over a stile in the rick-yard, and walk towards the gate of our stable yard—I went down, and met him at the gate—he had a bundle—I asked what business he had there at that time in the morning—he said he had lost his way across the fields coming from Bexley—I said he ought to be ashamed of himself for walking across people's grass in that way, and ordered him off the premises—he took the bundle with him—about four o'clock I was going to Farningham, and missed a great coat which had hung in the hall—I then suspected he had stolen it—I immediately went round and gave information to all the policemen I could find, and described him—I then went to Farningham—I returned in the evening, and found him in custody at New-cross, and the same bundle was in the custody of the</p>

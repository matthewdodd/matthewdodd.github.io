I am a porter, of 117, Louisa Road, Stratford—on 28th May, about 6.30 p.m., I was with, two men in the Two Brewers, Brick Lane, Spitalfields—the prisoner, who I had known before, came in and wanted to join us—we told him we did not want his company, and I offered him a penny to get half a pint of beer for himself—he did not take it; he said "One of you will get it before you go out of here to-night"—one of my mates said something, and I turned my back and felt him seize me by the throat two or three times, and I knocked a knife off my throat—one of my mates cried out "Look out, Jos., one of us will get it before we go out</p>

I went to the Two Brewers and asked than for a drop of beer, and they chucked some water over me. I went there afterwards to get half a pint of ale, but did not interfere with them, but he said "You tried to get the bread out of my mouth, did not you, and if you were not an old man I would knock your head off." I took a knife out of my pocket to get some tobacco, and he struck me when the knife was in my hand, but I did not do it intentionally. The knife was shut; there was no blood on it.</p>

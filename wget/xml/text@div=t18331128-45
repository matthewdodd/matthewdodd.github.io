            . I am assistant to Mr. Hammond, a surgeon, at Whetstone. On the 9th of July, I saw Edward Thompson at Mr. Harrison's - I was at the post mortem examination; there was an external bruise on the head of the deceased: I found extravasation of blood internally on the dura mater, and a small quantity of blood in the lower ventricle - the face was bruised slightly, and there was a bruise on the arm, and one on the groin - there was a bruise on the back of the head, a little above the ear; that bruise must have been done by a weapon - I should say he died from extravasation of blood - the wound on the back of the head would cause that.</p>

I attended the deceased Thompson during his life-time after the fight, and found him in a state of total insensibility; he continued in that state up to the time of his death; he never recovered his senses at all - he died on Thursday morning, the 11th of July, about one o'clock; I examined him after his death - on the skull being separated, the dura mater was thoroughly healthy - I next saw some extravasated blood coagulated; and found four vessels on the brain had burst, three on one hemisphere, and one on the other; they were superficial small vessels - there was a bruises on one eye, and much swollen, and it had the appearance of having been lanced; there were a few slight bruises on the left parietal bone, and a slight scratch; I saw no<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183311280039"></xptr>bruise on the back of the head - I took great pains to examine, and the head was shaved previously to that; I conceive that I must have seen it if there was one - there was a bruise on the arm - in my opinion the bursting of the blood vessels was the cause of his death: and I should imagine a fall caused the bursting of the blood vessels - I think a fall, or a scuffle, or a fight, would occasion the rupture of the blood vessels.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. This is not the first time you have been examined on the subject? A. No, once before; on that occasion I stated that as there was no appearance of sufficient violence externally; I imagined it must be a fall; and that is my opinion now; there was no external violence; I took great pains to examine; there was a slight bruise on the left parietal bone, but that was of no importance; I heard Mr. Cox examined on the former occasion; he stated there was a bump raised up on the back of the head from a blow - and said he could not see it before, through the hair being on the head, but he distinctly felt it with his fingers; I swear there was no appearance of that sort - Mr. Cox did not see the deceased before I did; he had been in my presence perhaps four hours before; I did not do anything to make a bump on the head - I applied a blister to the nape of the neck, which many of the Coroner's jury, I think, mistook for a wound; I saw no bump; in my opinion, there was none; I am not a member of the college of surgeons; I have practised for sixteen years or more, in London and Whetstone, as a general practitioner; I have not been in the habit of practising upon animals; my father was a veterinary surgeon, and that has caused the impression that I attended cattle; I bled him with a lancet and with leeches, and opened the temporal artery previous to Mr. Cox seeing him; it is impossible to say how much blood I took, because the blood was extravasated; I did not take more than three or four ounces from the arteries, but it was not caught, measured, or weighed, it ran about; I did not take more than ten - I can guess an ounce; I bled from the temporal artery, till the blood no longer discharged itself; I did not take a pint from the artery - I never weighed blood; I should think there are sixteen or eighteen ounces in a pint; we measure blood twelve ounces by the pound, fluid measure - not ale and beer measure, but apothecaries weight; I bled him in the right arm, in the brachial vein - I recollect that from the position the man laid in the surgery - he laid on his back; I took about three pints of blood from the arm, as near as I can guess - two pints at first, and more afterwards; I then staid an hour or two, and took about ten ounces more.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How many ounces altogether? A. Not so much as sixty; I took from the arm about three pints, and about four ounces from the artery.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. And you average eighteen or twenty ounces of blood to a pound; was all that taken in one day? A. All in one afternoon, within four hours; and I think he had five leeches besides, they might take about two ounces; I believe the leeches were applied after the lancet - they were good leeches; the man bled as freely with the last blood I took, as the first; I cannot account for the leeches taking only two ounces; he was bled and leeched again afterwards - not by my orders; it was the next morning; twice the quantity of blood would not cause death in a man of his constitution.</p>
               <p>Q. Why, that would be one hundred and thirty-two ounces? A. I did not say that; it was not taken at once; he lived from the Tuesday evening, until Thursday morning at one o'clock; I attribute his death to the extravasated blood, and nothing else; I should think a man who had been fighting for a long time, would be in a state of considerable exhaustaion; and he was in a state of exhaustion when I applied my remedies.</p>

               <p>Q. Can you undertake to say he did not die from your remedy, instead of from disease? A. I can; not from my remedy; Mr. Evans operated on him; Hammond saw him - I don't know whether he operated; and Mr. Cox saw him - that was all after me; I saw leeches being applied to him afterwards, by Hammond's orders.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you undertake to state on your oath, on the best of your judgment, that from all the appearances on the man, he might not have met his death from a weapon? A. Certainly I will; Mr. Cox knows nothing at all about it - certainly, Mr. Cox at the last examination, alledged that I killed the man; I have said nothing further here, than I did before - I did not say I took sixty six ounces of blood from him; Mr. Hammond is a surgeon of Whetsone - he is a man of considerable experience - he is not here, nor was he here before; he gave evidence on the inquest.</p>
               <p>MR. CRESSWELL. Q. Was the extravasation of blood on the brain produced by the bleeding? A. No; it could not be.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON to MR. COX. Q. Did you bleed the deceased at all? A. No; nor anybody in my presence besides the last witness - I don't know of his having been bled; I don't know the quantity of blood which he took from him; the individual would have died whether he had been bled to that extent or not - I saw the bump, and Mr. Evans did, or rather felt it - a person examining the man accurately, could not have missed observing it - I should think nobody could have mistaken the bump for the remains of a blister on the nape of the neck.</p>
               <p>COURT to MR. HARRISON. Q. In your judgment, was the operation of bleeding proper to prevent any flow of blood to the brain? A. It was; I was aware of the bursting of a vessel, and did it to prevent that - I told Mr. Cox so when he came into my shop - I did it to try to remove the pressure of blood on the brain.</p>

            ; the prisoner was there; I cannot say what he had to do with the fight, except that he acted as the brother of Michael Murphy - in several things he acted as he ought not to have done in it - from the first to the third, or it might be the fourth round - it was a fair stand-up fight, man for man; but from that Thompson appeared to be the best man - Ready was one of Michael Murphy's seconds, and the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183311280040"></xptr>other man was unknown to me; there was a great many people at the fight - after the third round, there was not fair play to Thompson by any means - I don't mean to say that there was any foul play on the part of the seconds; it was merely the multitude that stood round of the Irish - nothing took place to interrupt the fight, no further than pushing in, and shoving them up to the further part of the ring which I considered the highest ground - the ring was not particularly broken, it was shoved from one part to the other; the ring was kept good enough, except that Michael Murphy wished to give in - he gave in; I considered him to give in twice for at the time Ready was wiping him down the face; (with his hand over his left shoulder, wiping the blood from his face,) he looked over his shoulder to his brother, and said in a faint voice, "I shall fight no more;" I stood close to him; he said so to the prisoner, and the prisoner stepped across his knee, clapped his hands together two or three times, and said, "Halloo, you b-r, you can beat two such as him; you shall fight him" I then said to the seconds of Thompson, "Now the fight is yours;" and at that time I was knocked down and kicked in a scandalous manner, and was senseless; I lost several rounds which I did not see; when I came to myself they were fighting the last round but one; both men appeared then as fresh as they were at the first round, and at the last round they both fought manfully; they were both exhausted, but I don't consider it was by fighting; it was more by the pressure of the crowd - Murphy hit Thompson on the front of his head and caused a fall, but I don't think it was such a blow as would cause a fall, it was more by exhaustion; the fight ended there, for he fell back at that time on a turf of grass which was rather rising - Thompson was senseless after falling on that turf; but I examined the turf afterwards, and there was no stone in it; but it was on a rising a little more than the rest of the grass - he gave a sort of wrench of his neck, and was then senseless - I moved him out of the ring with the seconds, who placed him on their knees, and Thomas Ready came forwards to render every assistance immediately.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. What are you, a carman? A. Yes; I have changed my business since I was here last; I did not tell you then I was a costermonger; I drive my own cart - I went to the fight, and took fourteen persons with me - I went to carry people there who employed me to take them to see the fight - I was there casually; I did not go there to see the fight; I was hired to go there; I went for my living - I cannot say that I feel no pleasure in such things; I went there to earn my living - I cannot say how many prize-fights I have attended in the last two years; I will swear I have not attended three.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell me what you call prize-fights? A. I have not been to three prize-fights; I have not been to any fights at all in particular - I might have seen two fights, but I have not seen three - I swear I have not been to more than three fights of any kind for the last two years.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how many rounds were fought in the battle altogether? A. I don't know; I did not take particular notice - I don't know how long the fight lasted; I do not know whether it lasted one or two hours - I have never been charged with the commission of any offence; I was never in my life charged with stealing dead bodies, nor ever accused of it, nor anything else - I saw the last two rounds fought; he appeared as fresh then as before - there was a good deal of crowding towards the persons fighting; I saw a number of people break into the ring with sticks in their hands - I saw no sticks used; I saw no blows struck, no further than I received myself, and I did not see who it was - I received the blow with a stick, and was dreadfully kicked; that is what I call foul play - I saw nothing on the part of the seconds except trying to keep the ring clear; endeavouring to keep them from interrupting the fight - the men who broke in the ring, were all huddled together; that is, in as close a compass as we are here; and there was a good deal of confusion during the last round - blows might have been struck at the last round with the sticks without my seeing it - both of them appeared quite fresh, but he was exhausted by the pressure of the crowd about him.</p>
               <p>Q. Being fresh in the last round, did it not appear to you that his insensibility was caused by something which happened to him suddenly in the last round? A. It might not have happened in the last round, but he never spoke afterwards - his antagonist struck him a faint blow - it was not sufficient to knock him down - I consider that something had struck him before he received that blow - the blow was not sufficient to knock him down, nor was there any stone in the grass - I consider he must have received a blow from a stick before the faint blow which knocked him down.</p>

            . I am a farrier, and live at No. 62, Market-street, Paddington. I was present at the fight at Whetstone - the prisoner was there - Thompson and Murphy were fighting - I did not interfere in the fight - I saw the prisoner Murphy acting as second to his brother Michael - the fight was not a fair one - the mob broke the ring - Thompson seemed the strongest man - a great many of the mob had sticks - I was near enough to the ring to see what was going forwards - I do not know how many rounds were fought - at the last round but one the men appeared in fighting condition - they did so in the last round - the deceased was kicked in the last round by Mulany, in the groin - I saw a blow struck in the back of his head; in the second round there was a bit of a scrummage up at the right hand corner - the ring was not broken in then but there was a bit of a scrummage - it was the second round after the fight began that Mulany struck him with a blackthorn stick - Mulany was taken and tried for this and acquitted; I saw the deceased fall at the last round - I believe, it was the kick that was the cause of that fall, as far as I can describe.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. He fell from the kick did he? A. No; he fell from the throw and was kicked afterwards - it was not very much of a throw - I did not hear Tomkin's evidence - he fell through the throw - Murphy threw him - it was not from a blow -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183311280041"></xptr>I am quite sure he did not fall from a blow - it was a throw, for they were both down together - nobody could have mistaken that for a blow - I was one of the casual spectators - I went down there - the seconds, as far as I saw, conducted the fight fairly - the mob outside broke in - I did not go among the seconds - a good many of the mob had sticks, and broke in at the last round and created confusion - they used the sticks in the last round; the seconds and men fighting had no means of resisting the mob - some of the people were taller than me - I could not see over people's heads - I was about the middle, in the thick of the mob - I had no stick - the greater part of them had blackthorn sticks - in the last round they broke into the ring and used the sticks - I did not see the deceased hit - I was close against him when he fell, as they were all wrestling about - I saw him kicked after he was down, by Mulany - that was after he was down the last time; Mulany had a stick in his hand when he kicked him, and was near enough to strike him with the stick - it was not possible to resist this influx of persons without; who rushed in with sticks; if it had not been for that, the fight was conducted fairly; except what Mulany did.</p>

            . I am constable of North-end, Finchley. I was present at the fight at Whetstone, on the 9th of July - the first six or seven rounds which I saw, I thought to be as fair a fight as I ever saw; after that I saw the rounds all fought in the right hand corner; and I saw parties with their sticks flourishing; but (I being a lone officer there) I dare not interfere and did not go on that side of the way, as I saw there was danger, and I had nobody to take my part; but I saw no blows struck myself, because I dare not go nearer to see it - I had heard a fight was to take place and went.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Your attention was directed to the first six or seven rounds? A. After I got there; I was fetched there, and had my staff and handcuffs in my pocket - I looked at the fight the same as the spectators - I saw nobody strike one of the men in the second round - I was looking on - I considered the first six or seven rounds fair - I did not see anybody strike one of the men on the back of the head; there were so many sticks and the ring was broken in - the men with sticks were all round them; but I kept as near the outside the ring as I could; for I saw things unpleasant to myself; and pickpockets about; but I dare not go nearer, when I saw the sticks in the air I could not see the fighting men.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord and gentlemen of the jury, I knew my brother was going to fight; I immediately went to him, and told him not to fight but mind his work; he said Thompson had repeatedly insulted him, and challenged him, and he was determined to see who was the best man; I then left him and never saw him till the day of the fight at Whetstone; and when I got there the ring was formed; and I endeavoured to persuade him again, but he answered me as before; about the middle of the fight, Thompson's second, crossed the ring and tried to throw the man down; I accused him of it and he abused me; I went away, and at the latter and of the fight, I saw them both fall down, and Thompson's head fell against the ground; I went and endeavoured to recover Thompson by throwing water in his face; I got brandy, and asked the seconds if they would give him that, and they said they had some; I left him and went to Finchley where my brother was gone; I looked in at the doctor's shop at Whetstone; the shop was full of people; I asked the doctor how he was, he said he was a good deal better, but he must have air; I requested the people to leave the shop and come out with me, and saw no more of him.</p>

             were the principals - I was one of Murphy's seconds; the prisoner did not second him - he never had any active part at all in it - I was tried for this offence, and convicted of manslaughter, and sentenced to two months imprisonment - Ray and Berwick were the seconds to Thompson; I do not know the name of Murphy's other second - I attended on Murphy as my principal through the fight; the prisoner never troubled himself at all - the prisoner never made use of the expression, "You shall fight, you b - r; you can fight two such fellows," or language of that sort.</p>
               <p>A. Do you happen to know whether the prisoner endeavoured to dissuade his brother from fighting? A. He never troubled himself, but he was in the ring, and hustled about with the others - I do not know whether he endeavoured to dissuade his brother from fighting; he took no part whatever in the fight, except being in the ring while it was going on - it was a fair fight as far as the combatants and seconds were concerned; but the ring was broken in nineteen times out of twenty by the mob, and some of the persons used sticks to keep the people back; they kept the ring; they beat them back with the sticks to keep the ring clear - some of the mob outside had sticks; they used them to break the ring - it was not possible to keep off the mob.</p>
               <p>MR. CRESSWELL. Q. Do you know Tomkins? A. I have seen him; I did not see Tomkins knocked down; if he had been knocked down I might not have seen it; it was impossible; the ring was so confused with Thompson's party, and likewise Murphy's - the spectators broke in at all parts; the ring not being a ropering, it was impossible for me to see if he was knocked down, because I was attending on my man - the mob broke in about the seventh round, to my best recollection - Murphy was the best man up to that time; Murphy did not express any willingness to cease from fighting; I swear that, being his second, I must know if Murphy said he wanted to give in; I consider I must have known it as his second - Murphy never wished to give in.</p>

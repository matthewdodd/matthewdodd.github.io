               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Was he not wearing them openly? A. He was - the watch was returned to him; the prosecutrix thought that she recognized it, but would not swear to it - the prisoner's brother was there, and said it was his watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prosecutrix sworn to the seals at the first examination? A. No; she partly swore to them at the second - the question was not put to her at the first examination, and she did not understand it; she saw them on the bench, and said to me, that to the best of her knowledge they were her seals - I do not think she was sworn at the first examination; the seals are cast.</p>

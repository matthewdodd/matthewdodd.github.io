I went to a house, No. 6, Winchester-terrace, Agar Town, about 10 o'clock in the forenoon—I knocked at the street door—it was opened by a female—I went in and opened the parlour door on the ground floor—I there found the prisoner in bed with a female, whom I believe to be his wife—I said, "Mr. Cole, I suppose you know me; I belong to the police; I want you on suspicion of a burglary"—he said, "I forget you, Sir; you know I don't do anything now"—I went to the mantel piece, and took possession of this scent, bottle and pepper castor (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I placed them on a table, and pulled the</p>

               <p>drawer of that table out—I found in it a parcel containing eight keys, one a double key, some skeleton keys, and some with composition adhering to them—I found a file, a chisel, and a screwdriver—I showed them to the prisoner, and he said he picked them up—I found a second parcel, containing four half crowns, wrapped in papers separately—I showed them to the prisoner, and said, "Are you alluding to these?"—that was in answer to his saying he picked them up, and he said, "Yes"—I told him to dress himself—he was in the act of doing so, and I searched his trowsers pocket, and found in it one counterfeit shilling—I showed it him, and he said, "I can account for that; I got it at a shop in Tottenham-court-road"—I said, "If you will tell me the shop I will inquire"—he made no answer—I took him into custody.</p>

               <p>Q. When were you robbed? - A. On Friday, the 28th of September.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you the whole of the house to yourself? - A. No; I let the middle room on the first floor to a lodger; I rent the whole of the house myself, I only let one room to a lodger.</p>
               <p>Q. What does your family consist of? - A. I have six children, but only five at home; myself, wife, and five children.</p>
               <p>Q. On Friday night at what time did you go to bed? - A. About ten; it might be rather before.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the house do you sleep in? - A.In the upper room of all.</p>
               <p>Q. Who went to bed first? - A. My wife slept down in the lower apartment with two of the youngest children, they being ill.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was up last? - A. My wife was up after me.</p>
               <p>Q. Is she here? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot tell how your house was fastened when you went to bed? - A. No; my wife fastened it all but the front door, which she did not, because there is a young man belonging to Sadler's Wells, and he used to fasten it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he here? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to bed about ten o'clock? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you put your cloaths? - A. I had been at work without my coat; I am a tailor by trade, and a labourer in the East-India Company's warehouses; I had been at work without my coat; my waistcoat I threw on a chest, which I sat to work upon, at the foot of the bed; my breeches and stockings I threw on the floor, as I sat at the foot of the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any disturbance in the course of the night? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had your room-door any lock or bolt? - A. It had a lock, but the key was on the outside, and was a spring lock.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that door was shut? - A. Yes, it catches very easy.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you shut the door yourself? - A. Yes; I was the last that went up stairs; the three children were in bed before I went into the same room.</p>
               <p>Q. What time in the morning did you get up? - A. About five; I have a Dutch clock, and I set the alarum at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find the cloaths you had pulled off? - A. I had left my coat below; I found my breeches and stockings on the floor, where I had left them; my waistcoat was moved off the chest on to the chair.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you had not laid it on the chair? - A. Yes, I am quite certain; when I took it up to put it on, I perceived it to be light; I remembered I had put eight-pence in copper in it over night.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that gone? - A. Yes; I had three farthings, a bad halfpenny and a farthing, and it was all gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Had it tumbled out of your pocket? - A. No, or else it would have been found in the room; I then went down stairs, and found the door wide open.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear that your room door was shut when you went to bed? - A. Yes, I can swear that I shut it; there is a catch to pull back, and outside there was a key.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any hook to keep the catch back? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it caught? - A. Yes, I am quite sure of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you come to leave the key on the outside? - A. I was not afraid of any thing; I always shut the door on account of the children, because<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180410240026"></xptr>it would give them cold, it being at their feet.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went down stairs, did you perceive any thing? - A. The yard door was wide open.</p>
               <p>Q. How that was left you cannot tell? - A. My wife fastened it.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you were the first up in the house? - A. I am certain I was.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you see any thing about the yard door? - A. I could hardly see; it was getting light, it was about five o'clock; I mostly set my clock fast, because I wish to keep my time.</p>

               <p>Q. Did your clock strike five? - A. No, the alarum went off.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you set it for five o'clock? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It was rather before five than after? - A. It might be rather before than after.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you perceive any thing near the yard door? - A. The bar was laying along-side, at the bottom of the door, on the inside of the house; it was only barred with a wooden bar that goes into a staple, and drops into another.</p>
               <p>Q. That must have been opened on the inside? - A. Yes, they came in at the kitchen window.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there a shutter which goes up on the door? - A. No; there are two small panes of glass at the top, of about eight or nine inches; one of them had been broke ever since I had been in the house; there was a hole in part of it before, but about three parts of the piece was then taken out.</p>
               <p>Q. Could a hand reach from that to the bar? - A. No, I don't suppose it could.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any lock to that door? - A. No, but there were two bolts.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you find them? - A. The door was open in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing else in the passage? - A. I went into the parlour, and I found a scarlet cloth waistcoat lying on the floor, nearly opposite the parlour door in the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the waistcoat over night? - A. In the drawer in the room where I slept; it was a waistcoat I had made for sale, when I was out of employment; I went into the parlour, where my wife and children slept, and awoke her; I then went up stairs again, thinking my best cloaths were gone; I found them safe in one of the drawers in the room I slept in; I looked about, and observed the two small drawers belonging to an old chest of drawers, one on the ground, and the other at the foot of the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not observe them when you got up? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether those were locked? - A. The one which had the money in was, and the key was thrown into the other small drawer.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen it locked? - A. I cannot say to a day.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately had you been at the drawer that was locked? - A. I cannot say; nobody had any business there but myself; it might be a few days, or a week.</p>
               <p>Q. Had your wife any business with the drawer? - A. She brought money down to me at times, but she has nothing to do with money affairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see where the key was then? - A. No, we could not find the key for some time.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it found? - A.My wife found it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any thing out of that drawer? - A. I did not miss any thing immediately but the money.</p>
               <p>Q. What money was it? - A. There were twenty-five guineas in a wooden screw box, and a piece of a letter put inside to make it fix better.</p>
               <p>Q. What money had you in that screw-box? - A. Twenty-five guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the box in the drawer? - A. It was at the far end; I used to shove it to the end.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the box when you found the drawer? - A. It was taken away, containing twenty-five guineas all in guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing else gone? - A. I missed several trifling things - a blue silk handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that in the same drawer? - A. No; I wore it the day before, and threw it down, and the pad which was inside was shook out, and the handkerchief gone; a knife was in the right hand pocket with the halfpence, which was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Something of a ring was mentioned before the Magistrate? - A. Yes, we did not miss it till afterwards; it used to be put in the drawer where the money was, and many other trifling little things we had no use for.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it in the possession of any body? - A. Yes, in the possession of Mason, the officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that was your ring? - A. Yes; it was an old jeweller's gold ring, with hair in the middle of the stones, not worth above two shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see your handkerchief or knife again? - A. No, nor box or money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before? - A. Yes, he lived next door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he occupy a house there? - A. His father did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any conversation that morning between your wife and the prisoner? - A. No; he was not at home that night.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Watson. Q. You went to bed a little after ten? - A. It might be before ten.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been drinking at all? - A. No, I had been to work up stairs as long as I could see, and after dark I went down stairs to work.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went up stairs to bed, you left your wife below? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to your bed-room, it was your custom to shut your bed-room door, which had a catch-lock, and the key outside? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180410240027"></xptr>Q. Sometimes it might or might not catch? - A. It would not slam to; I am obliged to pull the knob back inside to shut it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you never left it ajar? - A. Never, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. If you left it ajar, it might blow open again, if you cannot swear you shut it? - A. Yes, I can, I never left it open.</p>
               <p>Q. You will not charge your recollection that you had positively bolted that door? - A. To the best of my recollection it was fast.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came down in the morning, you saw the wooden bar of the yard-door on the floor? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Above the yard-door are two panes of glass? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. One of those was broke before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went up stairs, you found a drawer on your bed? - A. Yes, upon the foot of the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. You must have seen that when you got up? - A. I slept in the bed by myself, and it was dark when I got up.</p>
               <p>Q. It might have been put on the bed after you got up? - A. Yes, it might.</p>

               <p>Q. What time did you go to bed? - A. As soon as I put two or three little things away, and got things ready; it might be a quarter of an hour after him.</p>
               <p>Q. You slept in the parlour? - A. Yes, with two of the youngest children.</p>
               <p>Q. This night did you do any thing towards securing the house? - A. Yes, I always do; I put up the bar at the back-door.</p>
               <p>Q.How long before you went to bed? - A.Almost directly, as soon as my husband went up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q.His that door any bolts to it? - A. Yes; they are not very good bolts, but the bar is very good.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you bolt the bolts? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How were the windows secured? - A. The from kitchen window was done by a wooden bar across on the inside, which was found down in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there a shutter? - A. There are two shutters; it is a large window and two shutters, and a wooden bar across it; the back window was only nailed down.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that near the door? - A. No, they are opposite one another down stairs; there are two windows.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they both barred? - A. No, the back window was only nailed; one window is to the front, and the other to the back; the back window was never opened; the front had a large wooden bar across the two shutters.</p>
               <p>Q. Who fastened the front door? - A. My lodger fastened it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he at home that night when you went to bed? - A. Yes, but he fastened the front door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any disturbance in the course of the night? - A. No; in the morning my husband alarmed me.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the state of the front kitchen window? - A. The bar was lifted down, and the shutter near the fire-place; I discovered that; I found the bar laid down on the inside.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it a sash-window? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it up or down? - A. Up.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was down when you put the shutters to? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any fastening or catch to the sash? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.How had this bar been lifted up? - A. It was laying down, I cannot say how it was done; one half of the shutter was lifted up, it lifts up in two parts; one part was down, and one was lifted out of the way of the window, I suppose, for the purpose of their coming in.</p>

             said it was her's; I then searched her, and the first thing I found was a new silver seal; I asked her how she came by it; she said the prisoner gave it her; I found a ring in her pocket, and asked her how she came by it, in the prisoner's hearing; she said it was an old ring of her mother's; I did not think it of any consequence, and I put it down with the rest of the other things.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the whole account she gave of it? - A. At that time I laid it down; with the money and things she had, and left it; Mr. Armstrong came, and we took Swan and the prisoner, leaving the other woman in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did she say any thing else? - A. After we locked them up, at the lock-up rooms behind the office, the same afternoon, they were put in separate rooms; Swan cried and took on very much, he called to her, and told her not to fret, for he knew what to say that would clear her; and begged her not to swear against him.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you? - A. In the privy.</p>
               <p>Q. How far off? - A. About three yards; they were obliged to speak loud, it being a thick plank partition lined with iron, to prevent it being cut through; they had a good deal of talk; he asked her what money it was the tall man said, (because both the prosecutor and Loader came up to Swan's room); he said, what money did he say it was I took from him; he said, the tall man would swear to the ring.</p>
               <p>Q. What were his words? - A.</p>
               <p>"Which I took" were his words; she said, twenty-seven guineas; he made answer directly, and said that was wrong, it was but twenty-five; he said, the tall man would swear to the ring; she made answer, that as soon as Nance came, which was the other woman, I will tell her to make away with it; we took her out of the lock-up room, and she, Armstrong, and I, went back to the room, and took the ring, in her presence; I missed it out of the window, it had fell down, I pick it up, and brought her back to the public-house next the office; Blair was fetched out of the lock-up room into the same parlour with her; Mr. Armstrong asked her, in the presence of the prisoner, where she got this ring; she said from the prisoner, he did not deny it; Mr. Armstrong then asked him where he got it, he did not answer directly; he was asked several times before he gave an answer; he said, it was given him by somebody, but he would not tell who; Mr. Armstrong asked him how long ago; he said, not long. They were then locked up again separate; he asked her how we came by the ring; she answered, we went with her to her room, and took it; he said, if one of us had thrown that ring away, when it was put down in the window, we should have done right; she answered, I could have done that if I had known it, but I did not know how you came by it; he said, mind Sal, I depend upon it that you will not swear against me, who was with me nobody shall ever know, I will die myself first; we took them to prison, they were brought up the next day, examined, and committed.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you the paper? - A. Yes. (The paper handed to his Lordship).</p>
               <p>Q. You have written something down about ten guineas? - A. He told her to say ten guineas; she said she could not, because she had said it was twenty; Swan told me, that he had told her somebody had given him twenty guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he dressed? - A. Nearly as he is now; but he was described to me in a blue jacket, and dirty trowsers.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any inquiry made about the new clothes? He would not tell me, he told me where he bought the watches; I asked him how he came by the money; he said, honestly.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you examine the house? - A. The Sunday morning I was called up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the house on the Saturday morning? - A. Yes.</p>

             I know as a bit of an acquaintance, by drinking in company where he was, at a public-house, where I used to go after I had done my work; I had not seen him for the space of two months till the Sunday morning when he came up to my room.</p>
               <p>Q. What Sunday morning? - A. The Sunday morning Mr. Mason came and took me.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you lodge? - A. I had a room in Webb-square, Shoreditch; he asked me if I would have any thing to drink; I thanked him -</p>
               <p>Q. What time was that? - A.About 20 minutes before twelve; the other young woman, I, and Blair, drank what we had to drink in my room; he went away afterwards, and said he would come back again; in about twenty minutes he came back and gave me the seal of a watch.</p>
               <p>Q. What makes you so positive to the twenty minutes? - A. Because he looked at his watch.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he give you? - A. He took a seal from off his watch and gave it to me; I asked what it was for; he told me to remember him; then he gave me a ring.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a ring? - A. A fore finger ring with a stone out of it; he said if I had a stone put in, it would be a handsome ring, but that the stone had dropped out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say when the stone had dropped out? - A. No; the other young woman was present at the time; while we were talking, Mr. Mason came up and asked for Sarah Green; I told him no such person lived there; he asked me my name, I told him,

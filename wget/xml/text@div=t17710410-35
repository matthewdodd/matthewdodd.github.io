               <p>Mr. Wathen. I am a surgeon, and live in Bartholomew lane; I was desired on the twenty-sixth of February to attend the coroner's jury to examine the body of an infant which was said to be murdered. I went to Mr. Lang's in Great Westminster-street; the child was in a copper, from whence it was taken out; the copper had water in it, which was covered with ice; from under which the child was taken out; it was a male child. I found a very large wound upon the fore part of its neck; in which was divided the windpipe, the gullet, or throat, the large arteries, which we call carotas, on both sides the jugular veins, and the lateral muscles of the neck on both sides also; the wound was so deep as also partly to separate the spine of the neck.</p>
               <p>Q. By that you mean from the upper part of the back bone?</p>
               <p>Wathen. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the head, according to your description, was almost cut off?</p>
               <p>Wathen. Yes; it hung only by the back muscles of the neck, and part of the spine of the neck which was not divided. I gave it then as my evidence, as I do now, that the wound was mortal.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you form any judgment by your observation how long the wound might have been given; was it a fresh wound?</p>
               <p>Wathen. A fresh wound; it was under the ice in water; it was impossible to say the period.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a fresh wound?</p>
               <p>Wathen. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had it bled?</p>
               <p>Wathen. It had no appearance of blood.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to have bled?</p>
               <p>Wathen. It must certainly have bled if it had been alive.</p>
               <p>Q. According to the best of your judgment was there any appearance that looked to you as if it had bled?</p>
               <p>Wathen. I think it had bled.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us the reasons of your judgment that it had bled?</p>
               <p>Wathen. Only the vessels being divided, and the child being full grown; therefore I suppose it to have been alive.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177104100043"></xptr>Q. I will ask you, in fact, was the child at its full growth?</p>
               <p>Wathen. It appeared so to be; it was as large as most children I have seen at full growth.</p>
               <p>Q. By the other appearance of the child was it at its full growth?</p>
               <p>Wathen. It appeared to be so in every respect.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any observations of any kind by which you could say the child had been once alive?</p>
               <p>Wathen. Certainly it had been so.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it so after it was born?</p>
               <p>Wathen. I cannot say. I did make an experiment on the lungs, which was formerly thought decisive; but now that opinion is exploded, that a child that had been still born had not the lungs inflated with air.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Wathen. She was in the work house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine her?</p>
               <p>Wathen. No; she said she was the person that was delivered of the child.</p>
               <p>Q. What day did you see her?</p>
               <p>Wathen. The twenty-sixth; after I had seen the child; she had not confessed this affair in full before I asked her, How could you do such a thing as this; I suppose it was unpremeditated? she did not confess positively, she replied it was unpremeditated; she said she did not know how she did it; or which way she did it; she said she had provided child bed linen and a lodging, and was going away, I think, from her mistress's; that she did not know what she did.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose the wound was made with some sharp instrument?</p>
               <p>Wathen. I asked her with what; she said she could not tell with what she did it.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot form any judgment how long the wound had been given?</p>
               <p>Wathen. I was informed it was done the day before; and I saw no reason to dispute the truth of that from the appearance of the wound.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether it might be impossible in the separation of the child, supposing a person to be delivered in the dark, for such an accident to happen in the separation?</p>
               <p>Wathen. I do not think it probable; it appeared too much like a wound made by a sharp instrument; such a wound as that would be a very irregular laceration.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know whether the navel string might be entangled round about the neck?</p>
               <p>Wathen. I do not; the navel string was not tied or cut; it was broke off; it appeared as if the placenta had been torn off; it was five or six inches long.</p>
               <p>Q. Sometimes I believe it happens to be intangled round the neck; there are instances of it?</p>
               <p>Wathen. There are instances of it; and strangulation very possibly may arise there-from.</p>
               <p>

            . I live next door to Mr. Lang. I found the child on the twenty-fifth of February between twelve and one at noon, the day before Mr. Wathen saw it, in a copper of water at Mr. Lang's; the copper was in a shed in the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there ice upon the water at that time?</p>
               <p>Jornagan. Yes; loose ice; the ice was broke; it was a thaw; then the child had its throat cut in the manner Mr. Wathen has given an account; the prisoner was by me at the time I found it.</p>
               <p>Q. He came you to look into this copper?</p>
               <p>Jornagan. Mrs. Lang came and told me she suspected her maid servant had been delivered of a child; I went directly; she let us in at the first door; we asked her if she had not been delivered of child; she said, No; then Mr. Ingam looked about the house for the child in places.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner with you all the time?</p>
               <p>Jornagan. Yes; we went into the yard; the prisoner went with us there; we looked first down the necessary; we looked into the copper hole, and then into the copper.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see the child through the water?</p>
               <p>Jornagan. No; the water was very bloody; the child was to the bottom; the water was all over bloody; I put a stick in the water and, and the child came up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say any thing while you was looking into the copper?</p>
               <p>Jornagan. She said it was not there.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say when you had poled the child up?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177104100044"></xptr>Jornagan. I believe she made no answer at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear her say any thing about this child?</p>
               <p>Jornagan. No; we questioned her no more after we had found the child; I only asked if she had provided any thing for it; she said, Yes, she had some little things for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see any thing she had provided for it?</p>
               <p>Jornagan. No; I went away; the officers were sent for to take her away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any instrument of any kind?</p>
               <p>Jornagan. I found a knife, before I found the child, in a porridge pot that stood in the sink, very near the copper.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a knife?</p>
               <p>Jornagan. A common case knife; it was bloody; the blood was towards the handle.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any blood in the shed, besides on the knife and in the water?</p>
               <p>Jornagan. No; I saw none no where else; I taxed her with cutting the child's throat after I found the knife, before I found the child. She denied it, and said, She was surprised how I could accuse her.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you saw no blood any where but on the knife?</p>
               <p>Jornagan. No, not in the shed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was no drops of blood on the floor?</p>
               <p>Jornagan. None in the yard; there was in a closet in the kitchen, on the floor, several drops of blood; while I was out, taxing her of having the child in the kitchen, I saw several drops of blood fall from her.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean that they came from under her petticoat?</p>
               <p>Jornagan. To be sure.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell whether the child was born alive or no?</p>
               <p>Jornagan. I cannot say; it was at its full growth.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear how long it had been cut?</p>
               <p>Jornagan. It could have been cut but a little while, because the blood on the knife was fresh.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean that morning?</p>
               <p>Jornagan. It must have been in a few hours.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you saw some drops of blood in the kitchen in a closet?</p>
               <p>Jornagan. Yes; and on the kitchen floor.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a dark or a light closet?</p>
               <p>Jornagan. A dark one.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she to go away that morning?</p>
               <p>Jornagan. Mrs. Lang was to discharge her that morning; the girl said she had the rheumatism; she had desired to be discharged.</p>

            . I live at Mr. Snell's, in Austin Friars, Mr. Lang is in partnership with my master. Mrs. Lang came to my master's counting house on 25th of February, between twelve and one o'clock. My master came to me, and desired I would go to the counting-house, and see Mrs. Lang: however I did not. She desired me to go to her house, for nobody was with her children but Mrs. Jornagan: I went directly, and left Mr. Lang in the counting house. I went into the kitchen; the prisoner was setting up against the wainscoat upon a chair. Mrs. Jornagan seemed to be in a fright. I said I hoped things were not so had as was expected. She said it was; and if I would go to the copper I should see. A little while after, Mrs. Jornagan said, let us take it out of the copper. She took a stick to raise it up with. I asked the prisoner how she was; and whether she would have any thing hot; she made me no answer. Mrs. Jornagan reached the child up; I saw its throat cut, but did not examine it.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the water?</p>
               <p>Davis. I cannot say; it looked very red; it looked something discoloured. Mrs. Jornagan shew'd me the knife; I said, it is not bloody. She said, it has been wash'd then. I went into the kitchen; she was sitting in the same posture as when I went out. I said, O Lord, what have you done! she made me no answer, and did not even look towards me: soon after the parish officers came in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never hear the prisoner say any thing about it?</p>
               <p>Davis. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any blood on the floor?</p>
               <p>Davis. No; I did not see any.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to the copper you left the woman sitting in the kitchen, and found her there when you came back again?</p>
               <p>Davis. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might you have been at the copper?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177104100045"></xptr>Davis. Not long.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the water was not much discoloured with blood?</p>
               <p>Davis. It had a brownish colour. I did not take any up out of the copper.</p>
               <p>Q. Not red; not like bloody water?</p>
               <p>Davis. It was not red.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you said before the coroner you thought that the girl was out of her senses?</p>
               <p>Davis. I was with her about ten minutes; she and I and the children, when Mrs. Jornagan was gone to finish her dinner. She sat in the same posture; I don't know that she stirr'd hand or foot: she seemed in a stupefy'd way, as if she had just come out of a fit.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know whether there were any things found in her box?</p>
               <p>Davis. Last Saturday I saw Mrs. Lang take some small things out of the servant's box; they were given me, and I carried them back, as the trial did not come on.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you them now?</p>
               <p>Davis. They are here.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not Mrs. Lang here?</p>
               <p>Davis. No; she is near her time; past her reckoning; and it is not safe for her to come out.</p>

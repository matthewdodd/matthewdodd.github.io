             sworn. - Morris, the last witness, lodged at my house, he was quartered with me, and on the 30th of March, the prisoner, Stott, came to our house in the evening, very much in liquor; he went up into Morris's room; I had often heard Stott say, that he had five guineas at a time, by taking sugar, and I, out of curiosity, went up stairs after them to the room door, and I heard Stott say, Skinner, and Foster, and I, went last night to our old warehouse, upon Dice-quay, and we had as fine a parcel of hams, says he, as ever you saw in your life; I suppose says he, some will weigh fifty pounds a piece, I never saw such in my life; says he, we were offered twelve pounds for them last night, but we would not sell them for that; we took a little sugar, says he, and it was but little, for we made but three pounds of that; it is a dark place, and a nice place, where we cannot be catched, we mean to go again, next Tuesday; Morris, you are a d-d fool, if you do not go with us; Morris's wife answered, that she hoped he would not, and said, she hoped he never would come there any more; he told him it was the nicest place for their work upon all the quays; he said, the gate was never locked all night: on Saturday, the 1st of April, Morris went to the burying of a soldier, and when Morris came back, Stott, and Skinner, and Foster, came up, and Stott wanted Morris to go and have some beer with him, says he, here, and held up a bit of paper, that I thought was a Bank-note, but I am not quit sure.</p>

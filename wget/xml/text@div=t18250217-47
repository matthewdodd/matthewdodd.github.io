               <p>JAMES COXHEAD. I live in Castle-street, Oxford-street. On the 15th of January, about twenty minutes before seven o'clock in the evening, I was at the pit-door of <placeName id="t18250217-47-crimeloc292">Covent-garden theatre</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18250217-47-crimeloc292" type="placeName" value="Covent-garden theatre"></interp>

I had a pen-knife, a key, eight shillings, and a half-a-crown, in my trowsers. There was a great crowd; and Mr. Hart, who was with me, desired me to be cautions of my pockets. I put my hand to my pocket to pay, and found it turned inside out. I told Mr. Hart of it, who seized the prisoner, and said he was the man. He was close to me - he was taken to the watch-house. I turned round - I found the 10 s. 6 d. and the knife and key lying at my feet - I do not know how they came there.</p>

            . I am a teacher of music, and live in Old Bond-street. I went to the theatre with Mr. Coxhead. I found a hand moving all about me. I looked round, and saw the prisoner next to me on the left hand, and Mr. Coxhead directly before him. I said, "James, take care of your pocket - I do not like the appearance of this little man - he has put his knuckles into my side." Mr. Coxhead soon after went to pay, and said he had lost his money. I immediately collared the prisoner, and seized his right hand; but the mob still pressing on, I let go his hand, but still held him till the officer came - in the mean time, the money fell at my feet. There was no other person between the wall and myself, on the left hand, but the prisoner. On my right hand was an elderly gentleman, and before him two ladies. When I seized him, he said, "I am a perfect gentleman - you are mistaken in the person - I will give you my card - I am known to the officers."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. LAW. Q. Were there not many persons about you? A. Yes; there were. He did not conduct himself with any impropriety.</p>

            . I am an officer of Covent-Garden theatre. I was standing about four yards from the place where the money is taken. I heard Mr. Hart call for an<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182502170033"></xptr>officer. I advanced, and got to his assistance. He said, "This is the man who has picked Mr. Coxhead's pocket." I took hold of his hand, and felt a knife and some silver in it. I then took him to the Grapes public-house, and searched him. He told me he had got one sovereign and eight shillings in silver, which I found to be the truth - he had no cards about him.</p>

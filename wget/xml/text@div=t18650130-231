                  </hi>. I am landlord of the Woodman, White-street, Bethnal-green—on 12th January, about half-past 10 at night, the prisoner Ritchie came in—she placed this coin on the counter, head upwards, and said, "If you please, can you give me change"—I went to the till to get it, but found it was rather light—I said, "What is this?"—she said, "A sovereign"—I put my glasses on to look at it, and said, "It is not a sovereign; it is not worth twopence"—I asked her where she got it—she said, "A young man outside gave it to me to get change"—I said, "You had better fetch him in and let us see who he is"—she said, "Oh, you must give it me back, and let me show it to him"—I said, "No, I shall not give it you back at all"—she went out, and returned in about two minutes with Lingwood—she said, "I have come for my sovereign; you are not going to keep it;" and Lingwood said, "You had better give it up, or I will soon fetch some one who will knock it out of you"—I said, "You shall not go till I know who you are, and where you come from"—Ritchie said, "Come on"—Lingwood said, "I am not going.; I should like to go without my sovereign, "meaning that she should not like—I sent for a policeman; and as I followed the prisouers, I met my potman with a policeman, and gave them in charge with the medal—we went back, and just as we got to my door, Lingwood moved her hands, and I heard something jink on the pavement—I saw the potman stoop and pick up another piece and hand it to the policeman.</p>

On 12th January, Mr. Burn gave the prisoners into my custody, with this medal—I saw Lingwood moving—I put my hand to her pocket—she had some fish and bread there, and I could not get my hand in—I saw her move her hand, and heard something drop—I afterwards saw this medal on the pavement—the potman picked it up and gave it to me—they said that they received it of a woman named Ford, in part payment of wages—I asked where Mrs. Ford lived—she said, "I do not know, she has moved away; I met her on Tuesday"—Ritchie said that they received a sovereign each—I searched them, and found a purse, a sixpence, and threepence in copper on Lingwood; and this sugar-crusher and a small bottle on Ritchie.</p>

                  </hi>. These are two brass medals; they represent on one side the head of the Queen—they are not the same colour as a sovereign, but quite near enough to deceive—they are the same size as a sovereign.</p>

Queen Victoria"—the date is in the ordinary place, but on the reverse side; on all the Queen's current sovereigns, it is on the obverse—the reverse does Dot resemble a sovereign, because the composition is different altogether; the King is riding with a crown on his head, which is quite different from St. George—this is neither St. George or a dragon—the only thing like a sovereign is the Queen's bead and a knerled edge but there is a considerable likeness in colour—on the coins of George IV., 1821, the date is on the re<lb></lb>verse side, and in George III. you will find it under the head again.</p>

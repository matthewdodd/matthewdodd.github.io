               <p>Q. Did you see so much of the face of the person who was buckling his shoe, as to be able to know him again? - A. I am almost certain that the prisoner, Hainson, was the man; Coleman had left me about two months; he had never slept in the house, but has worked in the house, and knew more of the f stenings and method of the house than any of the forty I employ.</p>
               <p>Q.Were you the last person that was up the night before this happened? - A. I am not able to recollect it, being six months since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Did you fasten up the house yourself? - A. I cannot at this time take upon myself to say.</p>
               <p>Q. Coleman is admitted an evidence? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went out, you saw a person at the door? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you nearer to that person at any time than fifteen feet? - A. Yes, I was within ten feet, and then I saw his face distinctly.</p>
               <p>PHILIP COLEMAN sworn. - Q. Are you the witness that was in the box yesterday? - A. Yes; I was originally a seafaring man: In the morning, about half past five o'clock, I cannot say what day of the month it was, nor the day of the week, it was in December, I met Green and Hainson at a public-house in Drury-lane, from thence we went to Mr. Ramiden's, in Piccadilly.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Burge). Is your house Mr. Ramlden? - A. It was Mr. Ramlden's, it is now mine, he is dead.</p>
               <p>Coleman. I worked for Mr. Ramsden two months; Burge carried on the business then; we did not get there till after six o'clock; the street door was always upon the latch for the workmen to go in; Green and I proceeded from thence through the passage into the kitchen, and left Hainson at the door; we broke open the kitchen door; there were two drawers in the dresser that we broke open.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light then? - A. No, it was dark; we took the sheeting and what linen and wearing apparel there was, some candlesticks, and three mahogany barometer frames; we put the things into a bag, and came to Hainson at the door, then we took them to Green's lodgings, and left them; from thence we went to refresh ourselves at a public-house in the Strand, near Southampton-street; I stopped at the door to make water, and Green and Hainson went in; while I was there, Green came out with a copper can in his hand, which might hold two gallons or more, and told me to come along; we left Hainson in a public-house; when I got a few yards from there, Mr. Pearce and Mr. Hill were close behind me, two gentlemen belonging to Mr. Burge's shop; Mr. Purce came up to me in Exeter-street, and spoke to me; Green went on, and left me; then Mr. Pearce went with me to my mother's; I told him I had slept there all night; he left me, and went home again; I went to my lodgings in Drury-lane, and Green and Hainson came to me, and told me they had sold the property to Mrs. Hayes, in Long-lane; they gave me thirteen or fourteen shillings, or some where thereabouts; some of the things are here.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go to this house together? - A. We had been there several times before, but there was always somebody in the way till then.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you told them where to go? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. I understand you were the first planner of this business? - A. No, I was not, because they wanted to know of me where I had worked.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not tell them any thing about your master's house? - A. Yes, I told them how to get in.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever been a voyage to Botany Bay? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Not as a convict, was it? - A. No, I went two voyages to Botany Bay as a sailor.</p>
               <p>Q. You never were convicted? - A. No, I never was a convict.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. But you gave them information how to rob your master's house, and you shared the plunder? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Should you know that man again? - A. I think I should.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoners? - A. That is the man, Green; when they had got some little distance up the court, Coleman looked back, and then I went on; we followed them into Exeter-street, at a convenient distance behind them; then Coleman left Green, and returned back towards Denmark-court; consequently he met me, and the other man went on; I asked him where he was going, and then I left him, to find Mr. Hill, that we might go together to find out the person we were first sent to look for; then we returned home again.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know Mrs. Hayes? - A. I had been there before with Hainson; Hainson and Green both told me they had sold these things to Mrs. Hayes, in Long-lane; she talked at that time of removing to a public-house; when I was at Hayes's I was there with Green's wife and Hainson to procure money to pay Green's fees here at the Old-Bailey.</p>

I am housemaid to Marmaduke Matthews, of Cambridge Lodge, Cambridge-heath—on the evening of 20th September I was alarmed by a noise up-stairs—I went up and found one of the bedroom doors open—I looked in, and saw the dressing-table upset, and lying under the window, also a large looking-glass and several other things, which were all broken but the looking-glass—I then heard a second crash, went down stairs and called the young ladies—I heard a man groaning, looked through the glass of the door, and saw a man lying on the stones—the iron pipe belonging to the verandah over the hall door was also lying there—the first bedroom window is only a short distance above—the man was given in custody—it was the prisoner—this screen driver (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) does not belong to the house.</p>

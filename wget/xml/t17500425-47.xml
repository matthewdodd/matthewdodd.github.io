            's, and about a mile beyond Highgate, going down the hill, the prisoner at the bar came full gallop by me; when he got to the bridge at the bottom of the hill, he walked his horse to the flower-deluce, and went up as if he was going into the yard; I went on up a Finchley-common, and when I was got opposite to the gibbet, there is a little side road goes out may-be half a mile, and comes into the road again. I was about thirty yards in that road, and was going to shew a little boy in the Chaise the man upon the gibbet. The prisoner came betwixt me and the gibbet, and presented a pistol to me, and said, Damn you, your money. I saw the pistol, and stood up in the Chaise to see if I could see any body coming; said I, what is that you would be at; d - n you, your money, said he again, it signifies nothing your looking about, for if there were fifty people I must have it, and said, I dont want your watch. I saw two waggons just before. He said to the waggoner, as for you, stand; he stood directly. My little boy was frighted, and cried out, Papa, pray give him your money. I said, Take away your pistol, and don't fright the child, and I'll give you my money; then I gave him two crowns, one half crown, two shillings and six-pence, and a little pocket-piece. I said there is all my money, and I am going farther, will you be so good as to return me a shilling to pay the turnpikes, which he did, saying, there is a shilling for luck. He was taken the next morning.</p>

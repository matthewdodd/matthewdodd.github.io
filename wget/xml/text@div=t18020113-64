             sworn. - When the robbery was committed, I saw the prisoner and one Ryley go up stairs together; sometime after, Ryley came down, and then I heard a knocking with a hammer, but it did not continue above half a minute; then I heard a kind of rummaging, and I saw Byrne come down about twenty minutes after; I heard no knocking when Ryley was up stairs.</p>
               <p>- RYLEY sworn. - The property was in my box; Trounce asked me for my key to put it in, as he was afraid Byrne would rob him, as he had attempted to do coming up from Canterbury; my box was broke open, and two seven-shilling pieces and half-a-crown of my money taken.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I live at Liverpool; Trounce and I came together from Demarara; the captain whom I went out with paid me thirteen joes, and told me to call on his agent for the remainder; when we got to Ramsgate, I sold the joes to a Jew for fourteen pounds eight shillings, and he gave me a small red pocket-book; that very day the captain I came home with, paid me seven pounds ten shillings for my passage; the Jew gave me two five-pound Ramsgate notes, and the captain gave me a one and a two-pound Bank of England note, and some silver; I forced them all into the pocket-book, and burst it; the prosecutor had paid some money for me on the road, and I gave him a one-pound note to take it out of; we had been drinking freely that day, and I went and lay down on the bed; while he was gone for change, I fell asleep, but don't know for how long; when I awoke, there was a man sitting on the bed with a candle; I got up, put on my shoes, and went down, when Mrs. Taff began to abuse me, and bid me begone; I went out, and intended to go to Liverpool, I did not know my road, but got to Islington, and had some supper, where Taff came in, and said, Trounce had lost seventeen pounds, and I had it; I said, I had not, but he called the watch, and that gentleman took my own notes out of my pocket.</p>

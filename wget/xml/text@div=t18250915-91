On the 2d of September, about eleven o'clock in the morning, I saw this cloth safe in the shop - I went out soon afterwards, and on returning, about two, the officer came and produced the end of it - two shopmen were in care of the shop - I found the prisoner at the watch-house - I have no recollection of seeing him near the shop - I know the cloth to be my father's - there are thirteen yards and a half of it - the lowest value is 24 s. a yard.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. There was time, after you saw it safe, for another person to steal it and give it to him? A. Yes; I have since seen his friends - I believe he has a very respectable sister, and an aged mother, who says he is her principal support - the shop is part of the dwelling-house.</p>

            . I am ward-beadle of Walbrook, and know Mr. Simpson's house. On the 2d of September, a little before two o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner and another man running along George-street - the prisoner was carrying this piece of cloth, which hung loosely under his arm - this arose my suspicion - I followed, and overtook him with it at the back of the Mansion-house - the other escaped - I asked the prisoner how he came by it - he said a man gave it to him in the street; and said, "Don't hurt a poor fellow" - that is all he said then - I took it from him - he gave it up readily - I took him to the watch-house, and after locking him up opened the cloth, and found the end with the ticket in it, with the name of Marsham on it - I inquired and found a wholesale dealer of that name in Ironmonger-lane - they directed me to Mr. Simpson, who claimed it at the watch-house - when Mr. Simpson came to the watch-house, nothing was said to induce the prisoner to say any thing - he said a person had requested him to take it from Lombard-street towards Temple-bar, and would pay him for it, and I think he said a shilling - he mentioned no house that he was to take it to, but described the person as a man rather tall.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did he not say this before Mr. Simpson? A. Yes; he had as good an opportunity of hearing it as me - he said instantly, that another person gave it to him - he must have come through a public street from Mr. Simpson's to get to George-street - he carried it openly - his carrying it that way and running made me suspect him - he said instantly that another man gave it to him.</p>
               <p>EDWARD SIMPSON. He said at the watch-house that some man employed him to carry it to Temple-bar - he gave the account the constable has mentioned.</p>

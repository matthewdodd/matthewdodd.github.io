I am servant to Mr. Widdows, of London-road, Enfield—on the night of 29th October, about 9 o'clock, I closed the shutters and put the bar up—I remained in the kitchen till half-past 10 and then went to bed—I cannot swear that the window was fastened; it was closed—I got up about 7 in the morning—I found the kitchen-window open at the top—a hole had been made in the shutters large enough to admit a hand, and they were open—the Venetian blind had been cut down—a person could undo the bar, and then get in—there had been some plate in a basket on the dresser the night before—I went upstairs to my mistress, came down again, and found a coat had been taken from the hall, and a pair of my master's boots from the kitchen-fireplace, where I had put them to dry the night before—I also missed a pair of dress-boots out of the nursery-cup<lb></lb>board—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are them—they belong to my mistress, and these are my master's—the plate has not been found.</p>

About 7 in the morning of 30th October, in consequence of what I heard from Upston, I went down stairs—I found the plate-basket empty—the hall-pegs had been divested of three coats, but one, not being of sufficient value, had been left—this overcoat (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is mine, and was hanging on the pegs the previous night—this pair of Welling<lb></lb>ton boots are also mine—I had taken them off on the previous night—I believe this pair of kid boots to be my wife's—a quantity of plate was taken.</p>

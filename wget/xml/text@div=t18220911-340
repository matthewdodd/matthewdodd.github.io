On the 22d of March, my father took a lodger at our house, and on the 7th of July, the prisoner took a lodging of me; he is my uncle, he had a bed there of his own. I lent him the furniture; I charged him unfurnished rent, he paid 3 s. per week, and owes me for five weeks. When he left the house last Monday, he said he would lock the room up. I told him to do as he thought proper; he went up stairs; I saw him bring my bed down, and put it in a truck; I said it was mine, but he would take it away; I do not think he knew what he was about, he was very obstinate, we had a dispute about it, I had bought it of my father.</p>

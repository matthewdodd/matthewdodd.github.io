             sworn. - I am a man's mercer; I was at Mr. Anderson's, on the 15th of September. I went down to Monument yard, by his direction, I waited there till I saw Coxhead come and give the parcel to the prisoner at the bar, he gave him some halfpence; immediately as he had got the parcel, I endeavoured to secure him with Mr. Stephen Anderson, and their porter; after that we took him to Mr. Anderson's house, a constable was sent for, and the parcel delivered to him.</p>
               <p>Q.(To George Anderson). Has your father any customer at Deptford, of the name of Creasy? - A. Yes. (The constable produced the property, which was deposed to by Mr. Anderson).</p>
               <p>Coxhead. This is the parcel that I had from Mr. Anderson, and gave to Mr. Burridge.</p>
               <p>GEORGE BARBER sworn. - I am shopman to John Creasy, at Deptford: I do not know the prisoner, I never saw him at Mr. Creasy's house.</p>
               <p>Q.Look at that order, do you know the handwriting of Mr. Creasy? - A.Perfectly well, I never saw Mr. Creasy write any thing like this; I know that no such thing was wanted at our house at that time.</p>
               <p>JOHN CREASY sworn. - This is not my handwriting; it is not spelled as I spell my name; there is an too much in it.</p>
               <p>Q. You live at Deptford? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was out of employ, and received that order from a person, to receive these goods; the gentleman said his name was Creasy; and I knew my brother had lived with Mr. Anderson, and therefore I got this boy to go for it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

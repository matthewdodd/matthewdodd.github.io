             (policeman). I was on duty on the 29th of September, in Brydges-street, Covent-garden, between six and seven o'clock. I saw the prisoner go across the street with a bundle on his back, towards Russell-court; I went over, stopped him, and asked what he had in his bundle - he said some wearing apparel belonging to his woman - I asked him where he brought it from; he said from Phoenix-alley - I asked him why he did so - he said he owed his landlord some rent, and he was afraid he would detain the articles for it - I took him to the station-house, and he there stated that he brought the bundle from Short's-gardens, and then from Queen-street, Seven-dials, and then from Henry-street, Waterloo-road - I detained him, examined the bundle, and asked him what marks there were on the articles; he said he would not tell me - I then searched him, and found two keys on him, one of which exactly fits the prosecutrix's parlour door - I afterwards shewed Mrs.

             the property, which she identified - I went to the premises and examined them, and found the thief must have got in at the area; he must have got down into the area, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183310170007"></xptr>pushed back the kitchen door, and got up to the staircase door, out of which a pannel was cut, and a bar was broken off the parlour door.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you conclude that he entered in below? A. He got in at the window; I cannot say whether the window was fastened or not - from the window he could go to the kitchen door and open that easily - he then cut out the pannel of the stair-case door; I found the shop in confusion, and some clocks packed up in a blanket - the property seemed to be removed, and ready to be taken away; I have the property here which I found on his person - I took him between six and seven o'clock; I have a coat which was afterwards found on the premises, and the prisoner had not coat on when I took him - there is a handkerchief in the pocket of the coat.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. What time did you take me? A. It was half-past six o'clock when I took you to the station-house; it was not exactly dark - you made no scruple at going with me; you carried the bundle to the station-house.</p>

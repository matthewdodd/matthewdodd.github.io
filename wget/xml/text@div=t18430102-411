                  </hi>. I am warehouseman, in the employ of John Is<lb></lb>may Nicholson, who has one partner. They have a wharf, called Nicholson's wharf, China and East India warehouse, near London-bridge—the prisoner had been in the prosecutor's service, and left about a fortnight before the day in question—on Saturday, the 10th of Dec. I saw him several times in the day, hanging about the premises—he was not employed there then—I thought it right to watch him, and about a quarter past three o'clock in the afternoon I was in a warehouse on the lower floor, and he was standing at the corner, in a recess in the gateway—I could command a view of his person—there is a loop-hole to every floor—I saw a bag come down from tht loop<lb></lb>hole on to the ground under it—the prisoner immediately picked it up, and ran away with it up the gateway, towards Thames-street—I left the wave-house, and ran, and was in pursuit of him before he got out of the yard—he saw me, and then dropped it about twenty yards from where he picked it up on the wharf—I ran across Thames-street—I saw him in Love-lane—I was unable to stop him, and having left the warehouse open, and a desk contain<lb></lb>ing money, I returned to the warehouse—I picked up the bag—the constable examined it in my presence—it contained black tea—there was tea in the warehouse above—I went the <hi rend="italic">same evening</hi>, about six, to where the prisoner lives, with the constable, inquired for him, but could not find him—I waited for half an hour, and he came to the door—I advanced towards him—he saw me, and ran away—I went in pursuit of him, with the constable, and took him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable, employed by Nicholson and Co., to watch their wharf. On the 10th of Dec., about half-past three o'clock in the afternoon, Lock gave me a bag containing 8lbs. of black tea—between six and seven o'clock the same evening, I accompanied him to No. 29, Lower Ber<lb></lb>ners-street, St. George's-in-the-East, and inquired for the prisoner—he was not at home—we waited about for about half-an-hour—I then saw the pri<lb></lb>soner coming up to his door—I walked from the end of the street towards him—Lock crossed over to go to him—he saw Lock, and ran away directly—I went into the road to take hold of him—he turned, and ran up a street—I followed, crying, "Stop thief,"and afterwards secured him—he asked what I wanted him for—I told him, for stealing a bag of tea that afternoon from Nicholson's wharf—he made no reply.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Q. Where was Lock when the man ran away in the evening? A. Within three or four yards of him—I left him standing nearly opposite the prisoner's door—I went to the end of the street—I never had any quarrel with the prisoner—I knew he was employed in the Docks—I have endeavoured to find Nevill—I got into the house where he was one night, but he escaped behind.</p>

                  </hi>. I am warehouseman to Nicholson and Co. On the 10th of Dec., about a quarter before three o'clock in the afternoon, I was on the fourth floor of the prosecutor's warehouse, and saw a bag there containing tea, lying about two yards and a half from the loop-hole—there had been a chest of black tea broken, and the tea that came out was put into the bag—one Nevill was at work near the loop-hole—he has never been seen since—the bag belongs to the prosecutors—the tea had been put into it properly—I have compared it with that in the chest—it is the same, in my judgment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>, Q. Was Nevill in the employment of the prosecutors? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—he worked on the wharf as a lumper, and occasionally in-doors-he had been in their employment four or five years, backwards and forwards—I saw the bag about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes before three—it was removed from where I had placed it—I took it up and put it on the chest it belonged to—Nevill was then sweeping the floor—I have endeavoured to find him.</p>

            . I am a watchman. The prosecutor and prisoner came to my box after twelve o'clock; the prosecutor said, in the prisoner's presence, that he had been robbed of his seals and key, and a part of his chain, and he gave her in charge for it - these seals, key and chain were in her hand; the prosecutor did not appear in liquor - when the prisoner came to my box she asked me for change for a sovereign; I said I had not got it - she said afterwards that these things had been given her as a present.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you ask her whether it was her own sovereign or this man's? A. No; but she told me she wanted chauge, that he might pay her the 5s. for which she held these things - she said that he had intercourse with her.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. But at first did she say so? A. No; she said in about five minutes that she had had it given her as a pledge for 5s. - that was when we were at the watch-house; when he was charged with having intercourse with her he denied it - she did not enter into any particulars.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS called</p>
               <p>- BROWN. I am watch-house-keeper. Vince came to the watch-house with the prisoner; I came in about five minutes after, and said to Vince, "How came she to take them from you" - he said, "They were in a private place near Arbour-terrace;" I said, "If you were standing up, she could get them" - "No (says he) I put her down, but we were walking afterwards;" upon my oath he confessed that he had intercourse with her - so help me God.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. If he confessed that to you, how came you to let the charge go to a Magistrate? A. I had no question asked me; I did not state what he told me - I have no business to speak if I am not spoken to; I was before Mr. Burnell, the Magistrate.</p>

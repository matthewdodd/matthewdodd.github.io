            . I am an officer. I found these articles in the prisoner's lodging; she opened the door herself with a key - she said she knew nothing about them; she had been washing at the house the day before - they were in a closet, which was not locked, concealed in a Dutchoven.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I certainly did not take them; I went to the prosecutrix on Monday, and worked all day - I was there on Tuesday, and that lad, who is seventeen years of age, came and said, "Mother, give me 1d.;" I said, "I have not one" - I asked Whiffin to give him one; she said she had not one - the cook gave him one; he said he was going to buy bread with it - he said he was not going home, but to his place; I staid at the house till two o'clock in the morning.</p>

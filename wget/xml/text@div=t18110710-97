            . I keep the Pea-hen public house, in Bishopsgate-street. On the 19th of June, in the morning, the prisoner holding a note in his hand, asked me if I could give him change for that note; I said it is a twenty pound note, he said yes; I asked him if it was his master's, Mr. White, he said yes. I gave him two five pound notes and the remainder in one's and two's, to the amount of twenty pounds. I wrote Mr. White's name on it, and Swan-yard. This is the note that I received of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>THOMAS SAPWELL. I am an officer, I apprehended the prisoner on the 22d of June. I asked the prisoner if he he had changed a twenty pound note with Mr. Sawyer; he said he had, he said his master Mr. Humphryes had sent him; I asked him if he was sure his master sent him, he said no, he found it on the dunghill. I searched him, on his person I found six one pound bank notes, in his box I found two five pound notes, and a one pound note. He said it all belonged to Mr. Saywer.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 8, Bennett-street, Black friars-road. On Tuesday, 25th Jan., about 2 o'clock in the morning, I was near Temple-bar, coming towards Bridge-street, with Mr. Graham, a friend, who keeps the Old Bell Tavern—the two prisoners accosted me near Temple-bar, and requested me to treat them to something to drink—I went with them to a public-house; my friend did not <hi rend="italic">go</hi> in with me—I had 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold in my right hand waistcoat pocket, and some silver in my right hand trowsers pocket, a silver watch in my left hand waistcoat pocket, a gold chain, and a ring—we had something to drink in the public-house; after which, I was going home, and called a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, to go to the Black friars-road; the prisoners said they lived that way, and asked me to let them ride with me; they got in with my</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185301310013"></xptr>
               <p>consent—I thought we were going over Black friars-bridge, bat, instead of that, we drove about the Strand, and went to two or three public-houses, and had something to drink—I am not certain whether I got out at the public-houses or not; I had some drink brought to the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I was sober when I got to the first public-house—after driving about, I became quite unconscious in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, after I had had the last drink—we arrived ultimately in the Black friars-road—(I was not excessively drunk; it was from something else, which I expect they put in)—the last thing I recollect before I got out was, expressing a wish to pay the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man; Healey said it was all settled for, I need not trouble about it; that the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man was paid—I was so bad that I did not think anything of that—I got out just below Stamford-street, and left them in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I walked home in six or seven minutes, and then missed my money; I had only 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and my watch and chain left—(I think I paid for the first drink, and the second, and the last the prisoners paid for)—I gave information to the police next day; I did not trouble about it that night, because I felt so ill—I cannot say whether I was drunk when I left the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>; I have been drunk in my life; but from what I had bad to drink, I do not think it possible I could be drunk—I had porter, and I might have had some cold brandy and water—the prisoners were taken next morning; I am sure they are the women I have been speaking of.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Old Bell public house, 98, Fleet-street. On 24th Jan., I went to the Coal Hole with the prosecutor—we left there about 2 o'clock, and I went with him towards Temple-bar, where I saw two women address him—I should not know them again—I crossed the road, and watched them till they got opposite Crown-court, where they went into a public house, and I saw no more of them—I told a policeman, and went home—I saw the prosecutor pull his money out at the Coal Hole Tavern, and should say he had 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you advise your friend not to have his gold in his waistcoat pocket? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I consider that that is a safe place for gold—we were at the Coal Hole an hour and a half, or two hours—my friend had dined with me at my house at 2 o'clock—he sat an hour or two after dinner, then left, and returned in the evening—I left the table immediately after dinner, and do not know whether he took wine or spirits—it is very possible that he</p>

               <p>drank something more before we went to the Coal Hole—he paid 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver at the bar of the Coal Hole—he pulled out the gold first—he had the gold in one pocket, and the silver in the other, and I imagine he returned the gold into his pocket, and then paid with silver—we went there on purpose to see the trial, and saw it—it was not something very indecent—we only got in in time to hear the imaginary judge summing up—people sit there drinking; they do not listen to a dry trial as they do here, but have something to comfort them, and "the chief baron" had something to drink, and a cigar.</p>

I know the prisoners by sight—they came into my house with the prosecutor at past midnight on Monday, 24th Jan.—it might have been 1 or 2 o'clock, or about 1 o'clock; I cannot state the time—the ladies had a glass of brandy and water, and the gentleman a glass of half and half—he did not appear tipsy, but I did not take particular notice—they did not stay many minutes—the gentleman gave me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I gave him 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—I did not see them go out—this was on Tuesday morning, and on Wednesday morning the prisoner Jackson came—I did not recollect her then—she asked me if I had seen a gentleman with spectacles on—I said, "Yes"—she said, "Have you seen the female that was with him?"—I said that the female was locked up—she said, "She has got his gold"—I asked her to come into my back parlour—she followed me in—I went out, called an officer, and gave her in charge—I had seen the gentleman—he had been with Mr. Graham to inquire whether I knew the women—what Jackson asked me was, whether I had seen the female who was with her and the gentleman in my house the night before—she said "the night before"—when she said "She has got his gold, "I said, "You are unfortunate for having been with her"—I had never seen her before.</p>

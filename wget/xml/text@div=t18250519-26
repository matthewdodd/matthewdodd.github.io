            . I keep the house, and let it out in lodgings. The prisoner came there on the Thursday before, and generally went out about six o'clock every morning, with a bundle. On Monday, the 9th of May, she came about four o'clock in the morning, and asked us to open the door that she might go out; she had a bundle with her, and a cloak over it - she said she was going washing; we let her out, and locked the door. When the prosecutor came down he said the things were lost.</p>

            . My husband works at the docks. The prisoner came to lodge in the house where I lodge on the Thursday before the robbery; my husband went out to work on the Monday morning - I heard of the robbery: I met the prisoner about eleven o'clock, and said to her, "You are the most cruel woman in the world, to rob a poor woman, and leave her naked in bed;" I took hold of her, and she tried to get away - she had this shawl and apron on, and this towel in her hand.</p>

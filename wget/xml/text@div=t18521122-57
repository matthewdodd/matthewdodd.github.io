                  </hi>. I am a grocer, and live at No. 72, Bishopsgate-street-within. The prisoner was my travelling clerk and collector—he was paid a salary, and some commission—he was authorized to receive money on my account, and he was to pay it in the same day—here are some of my way bills—he took out one of them every morning—it contains the names of the customers, the goods delivered to each, and he had to fill up the vacant column with the amount received from each customer—when he came back at night he was to make a total, and hand it to me, or to a clerk—it was entered in the cash book in the usual way, and credit given to the customer.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Lees. It was my duty to make out the way bills and invoices, and receive money—it would be the prisoner's duty to place the three sums received from Mrs. Wright in the way bills, and hand them to me if it was in my time—I went there on 1st Oct.—I have looked through the way bills, and these sums are not entered in them.</p>

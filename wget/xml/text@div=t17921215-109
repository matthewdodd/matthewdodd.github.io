               <p>On Sunday morning about a quarter past five, on the 11th of November, I found my gate open, and I missed my fowls, three cocks and five hens, they were alive before they killed them; they were game fowls no gamer going; I saw them on Saturday the 10th of November, at dinner time, I did not go home after that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. When is your dinner time? - At twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Then from twelve o'clock to five the next morning, you did not see the fowls? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shoen. Where did you see them next? - I saw them at the magistrates.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150154"></xptr>Q How did you know them? - They were marked, one was marked in the foot, the red cock cut in the web of the foot; I see him cut, the man that cut him is not here, and just above his eye, a piece was cut out with a pair of scissars.</p>
               <p>Q. What was that for? - Because I should know him again; the other cocks were not marked, I had had them two or three years, I will take my oath as long as I live, that they fowls were mine; one of the other cocks had a core taken out under his throat; I know the hens by having them so long, knowing they were my property by seeing them in the day, I had them three or four years, four of the hens were black, and one was a brown or red whatever you call it.</p>
               <p>Q Did you define when you was at the magistrates, precisely the number you had lost? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. These fowls where all your's? - They were.</p>

               <p>Mr. Schoen to Mrs. Tibbott. Where did you turn them in? - Into a shed adjoining to the dwelling house, I cannot say I saw them after that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Does the shed lock up? - No, it is fastened by a string twisting about the nail.</p>

               <p>I am a constable of Clerkenwell; on Sunday morning the 11th of November, about six o'clock I met Phancutt, Platt was with him, I met him at the top of Albemarle-street, St. John'-street, they asked me for the Nag's head, I told them it was very near there, and I asked them what they had got under their arms? each one having a bundle in a blue apron, I asked them what they had got there? Phancutt said, does it trouble you, what we have got, I said it did, and I would insist on seeing, says he, you have no occasion to make such a bother about it, he said, he was going down to Bath, I said, I would see what was in there, and I called my superintendant, Mr. Inglefield, to take charge of Platt; I directly took hold of another man, who was discharged before the justice, I carried them down to the watch-house, I took the bundles and opened them at the watch house; Inglefield carried one each; Inglefield carried Phancutt's bundle, and I carried Platt's, I opened their bundles, and they contained dead fowls quite hot, just killed, they said, they were their own fowls, they said, they were cocks, hens, and pullets, he said, be they hens or cocks, be they what they will, there are eight in number. Phancutt had four, one cock and three hens; the other had two cocks and two hens; I says to them directly, now tell me where you have come from, they said directly they came from Kensington. Phancutt told me, that I got their names, now my lads, says I, you shall go along with me to gaol, I took them before the justice, and there Tibbott saw them, and the fowls, going to gaol, they begged to have a little beer, I let them have two pots of beer among them all.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. In all this Phancutt was the great spokesman, do you think Platt had recovered from his evening's dose? - He was not drunk, but he had but very little to say.</p>

               <p>I am superintendant of the watch, I was in company with Brown, at the time he stopped these men, I went to shut up the by man's box that morning, and Mr. Burr was along with me; just as I had shut up the box, these three men came up, the two men at the bar and another; Burr called to me, and we took them to the watch-house; there Burr asked what property they had there? they said, what property they had there was their own, the fowls were not produced before them, till they came before the magistrate in the morning; we took the fowls from them at the corner of Albemarle-street.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I take it for granted you do not mean to tell a different story from Burr? - I will tell nothing but the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. Did either of the men say any thing to you? - They did not till they got up to the Harp, where they went in to drink, when Platt said, he thought it made no odds to which prison he went, says he, I had rather go to New Prison, because I have been out only there last Thursday, from thence we went to prison with them; the next morning they were before the justice, and the prosecutor came and owned the property.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I believe Phancutt was the only person that spoke about the fowls, except that particular, which you mention, was Platt quite sober that morning? - He was not.</p>
               <p>Court. How did you get at the owner? - The prosecutor met me while we were going up to the office on Clerkenwell green.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Phancutt. That gentleman tells false things, he carried them down to the watch-house himself, and he opened the apron, and told them as they lay on the table, and I told him I came from Kingsland.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Platt. I told that gentleman in Clerkenwell, I never was there for any robbery.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Platt called five witnesses, who gave him a good character; and the prisoner Phancutt called one.</p>

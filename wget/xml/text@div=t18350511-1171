                  </hi>. I keep a public-house in High-street, Shadwell. The prisoner was there on the 9th of May, drinking with some company at the bar, before the house was shut up—he was out and in several times—the tap-room was cleared, and the house shut up after twelve o'clock—I looked sharp after him, as I had missed several glasses—I missed one that night, and said, it could not have been gone far, and the company must be searched—I looked out and saw an officer passing; he came in, searched the prisoner, and found it below his arm, under his shirt—I missed three that night—he said, "You will say that is yours, I suppose?"—I said, "It is, I believe it to be mine—I have one exactly like it, "I missed one of that sort—this is it—he has used the house three or four weeks—I never employed him—I was rather surprised when the glass was found on him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a smith and engineer, and live in Fox-lane, Shadwell. I never saw the prisoner till last Monday morning—I got out of bed when the clock struck two, to go down in the country to see a friend—I got to Fairweather's at half-past two o'clock—there sat the prisoner and two more sailors in front of the bar, and one woman—I went to Fairweather and asked him to give me a quartern of gin, which he did—I stood a few minutes for my change, but he was so intoxicated he did not know what change he gave me, nor what money I had given him—I saw the officer show the prosecutor a glass, which the prisoner had in his hat—he matched it with another glass, and then ssid he did not think it was his glass—that it was two small gin-glasses he had lost—the policeman searched all under the tap-room table to find the gin-glasses, but could not find them.</p>

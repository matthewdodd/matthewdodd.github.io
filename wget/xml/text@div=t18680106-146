                  </hi>. I keep the Royal Edward public-house, Triangle, Hackney—I have known the prisoner some years—three or weeks ago he came in, had a glass of ale, produced two pawn tickets, and asked me to lend him a sovereign on them—I did so, and he went away, after asking me to advance him another half-crown, which I did, making 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he said that he would return it next day, but did not—the ticket purports to be for a watch, pledged for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by Robert Burls, of King's Road, Wal<lb></lb>worth—my son-in-law made inquiries, in consequence of which I gave information to the police—the prisoner said that it was his wife's watch.</p>

I am manager to Edward William Burls, a pawn<lb></lb>broker, of King's Road, Walworth—this ticket for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is forged—it is not in the writing of any one in our establishment—it could not have come from our establishment in the way of business, for if a watch was pawned for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or for any sum exceeding 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., there would be a coloured ticket, not a white one, as this is—that is the invariable rule—I do not know the prisoner, I never took in a watch of him for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant P</hi> 5). On the evening of 19th December I went to the prisoner's lodging and found him in bed; I said, "Kendrick, I hold a warrant for your apprehension for fraudently obtaining 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from Mr. Ireland at Hackney, by means of a false pawn ticket"—he said, "Oh! dear, you do not mean that"—I said, "Yes I do, and you must go with mo at once;" I showed him the ticket—he said, "Yes, that is right, and I am very sorry for it; I certainly did tell him a falsehood respecting the watch, for I was in great distress and I wanted the money; I purchased the ticket, and I went last night to try to find the man who I purchased it of, but was unable to find him; I told Mr. Ireland that it was my wife's watch, because I was in great distress"—I told him I did not wish to search his place, but what duplicates he had would he give up to me; he went to a box and produced these thirty-eight tickets, about a dozen of which are from Mr. Burl's; they are all white, and are for watches and rings, but none of them are over 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—some are pledged before the date of the ticket in question, and some since.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi>). These are genuine tickets from our establishment, and are for transactions in the ordinary course of business—I do not know who pawned the things; one is fourteen months ago, one ten months, one three months, and one at the beginning of December by a female—we do not give out our blank tickets or let people take them, but one might have been left on the counter in the hurry of business—one ticket has been taken and torn in two; we never issue the bottom of the ticket, it is left for the number, but they have used both.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I bought the tickets of a man, and I have been three times to see if I could find him, but could not. If Mr. Ireland had given me a little time I should have paid him; I told him I would pay him in a week, or as soon as I had got something to do. I had no intention of robbing him.</p>

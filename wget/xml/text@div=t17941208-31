               <p>Q. Will you be so good as to tell us what you enclosed in that letter? - I am looking at the copy of the bills that I made at the time I enclosed the within amount at the time of sealing this letter; the first bill was a bill drawn at three days fight.

The next is No. 4,780, bank note for thirty pounds, dated 7th June 1794, Padman; and the other was a bill of exchange, and two shares of tickets in the Irish lottery.</p>

               <p>Mr. Raine. You did not put this letter in the post yourself? - I did not. It was near to the time of the post going out, and I told the boy to run as fast as he could.</p>

               <p>Q. What does that mark import? - The postage of a treble letter to London, one shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing a letter to be put in at Ipswich, addressed to Bradford, in Wiltshire; do you forward it to London, or have you any cross post by which you can send it? - I forward it to London.</p>

               <p>Mr. Raine. Is it quite a treble letter, Mr. Goodchild? - It is.</p>
               <p>Q. We have understood that this letter, when it was given to a boy contained a very large packet; supposing in this packet there had been a bank note, and it any how had been taken out of the letter, would it have made any difference in the charge? - No, it would not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Supposing it had contained twenty bank notes, and short of an ounce, do you charge it more then a treble letter? - Nothing under an ounce is more than a treble letter; half an ounce is supposed to be more than a double letter, we charge for that treble. A single letter is four-pence, a double letter is eight-pence, and a treble letter one shilling; and it is no matter how many enclosures that is while it does it does not weigh an ounce.</p>

               <p>Q. Have persons who attend for letters an opportunity of getting in and stealing any letter? - No, not unobserved.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. There are several persons by the sorters, for instance, now who was it took these letters from you? - A messenger.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was it? - I cannot recollect who it was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine to Goodchild. What does your family consist of? - My two daughters are at home with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do they assist you? - No, I do all the business myself till the arrival of the mails, my letter carrier then comes up and assists me in tying up the mails.</p>

               <p>Q. How is your box secured? - It is a kind of a cupboard, it has a door to shut.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. (looking at that letter) Is that your charge of postage? - It is; that went through my hands.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080132"></xptr>Q. Has Mr. Ralph travelled for your house long? - Three and twenty years.</p>
               <p>Q. You know the manner of his making up his letters and sending them to you? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Will you be so good as to observe the appearance of that letter, and tell me how it was when it was brought to you? - This letter appeared much more dirty than any letter we had ever received from him before; when I found the deficiency of forty pounds it led me to look at the letter with some nicety, I observed that the letter appeared much more dirty than we are accustomed to receive from him, and it appeared to be almost worn out at the edges, as if it had been carried in some person's pocket; the seal appeared to have been broke just at the bottom of it and lifted up.</p>
               <p>Q. Had it been a wax impression? - Yes, a wax impression of the initials of Mr. Ralph's name, and it appeared to be opened by one part of the seal.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Was it replaced? - It appeared to be done clumsily, yet not so on the whole.</p>
               <p>Q. On examining it carefully afterwards you had no doubt it had been opened after the first seal had been put on it? - I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you attend to the stamp? There appears to be two stamps, a London stamp, and another? - The London stamp contains in a circle certain figures and letters denoting the day and month of its arrival in London, the circle remained, but the letters denoting the day and the month, appears to be obliterated.</p>
               <p>Q. These observations apply to only the London stamp? - The other is very legible, 29th of July 1794, this led me to discover in what manner they were obliterated, in looking through the paper, I saw the paper was very thin, so that it was very evident that it was obliterated by being scraped with a knife, or some such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, Mr. Bush, this letter being put in Ipswich, on the 25th, you ought to have received it on the 27th with the London post mark of the 26th? - Certainly on Sunday.</p>
               <p>Q. Instead of which you did not receive it till the 30th with the London post mark of the 29th; supposing it to come to London by the post of the 26th, it could not by any possibility have remained in the post office till the 29th? - They generally come on the 27th.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. Here appears something to be scratched, but whether it is the Post office stamp you cannot say? - It might, or might not be a stamp, it always appeared to me to be a stamp.</p>
               <p>Jury. There are part of the letters left on? - It is just as clear as the sum.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. With respect to the contents of the letter there are forty pounds missing, but what description of notes these were that were missing you do not know? - I did not at that time, but since I have heard.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Supposing a ten pound note, and a thirty pound note of the Bank of England, were to have been put in, would that satisfy the omission that you discovered? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. I do not think a forty pound draft would, because if in the letter it was said the enclosed are bank notes and drafts to such an amount.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Ralph. Did you enclose in this letter bank notes to the amount of 
forty pounds? - I did.</p>


               <p>Q. Was it made up of a thirty pound bank note and a ten pound one? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. The other notes were not negotiable without endorsing? - Not without acceptance; they were drawn at the same dates as dated, but not accepted.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the prisoner, Farmer, employed as a stamper there on the morning of the 26th of July? - He was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he employed in stamping letters and packets at the General Post Office, on their arrival from the country mails? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing a letter to have been put in the Post Office at Ipswich, intended for Bradford at Wilts, would that in the course of that morning have come under his hands? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I will trouble you to cast your eye on this paper to tell me whether you find this stamp of the 29th of July 94, as a stamp of the Post Office, intended to denote its arrival at that morning, at the Post Office? (The letter shewn him) - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Provided it came by the mail to the Post Office, then it would denote its arrival, but if it is put in London, it denotes a receipt of the day it is put in? - It is so.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at another part of that letter and see if you see the remains of a Post Office stamp look? - One looks like the remains of a Post office stamp, I have got the stamp in my pocket of the 26th of July, and 29th, and an impression.(Produces them.)</p>
               <p>Q. Does it appear to you from inspection, that this, that at present is so obliterated, appears to be a stamp of this date? - It appears to me so.</p>
               <p>Q. I observe the figures, 94, is still apparent on it? - They are.</p>

               <p>Q. You have no doubt of this to be a Post office stamp? - I have not the least doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing this to have been put in at Ipswich on the 25th, and to have arrived on the 26th, to go to Bradford in Wilts, in due course of post, without being taken out of the Post office, could it have had any other stamp on it than that of London the 26th, it would have been stamped on the morning of its arrival, and and forwarded by the evening mail? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Without having been taken out of the post and brought back, by no possibility it could have got the date of the 29th on it? - No, it could not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. You are very well acquainted with the mode in which this stamping is conducted? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe it sometimes happens that those who are employed to be stampers in turns are sometimes called away to assist one another? - They have no orders so to do, they are not to do it, they have positive orders not to do it.</p>
               <p>Q. Sometimes there are country letters that gets among the town letters? - They are from between three to five hundred of the country letters get among the town letters, but that is owing to the confusion of the towns on the roads.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he give you any thing in lieu of it? - He gave me two Huntingdon bank notes; I cannot say I looked at them, it is rather unnecessary to shew them you, for I never made any memorandum of them.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. The way I came by the thirty pounds note, was, I took it in trade, in the shop; a person came in the shop and bought some articles, to the amount of one pound six shillings; a dozen pair of gloves, half a dozen for two shillings a pair, and half a dozen at four shillings a pair; which I gave change for; he was dressed in a black waistcoat, black coat and doe-skin breeches, with boots on; after he had got these articles, he asked me if I could give him change for a thirty pounds note? I told him I would do my endeavours; I went up stairs and brought down the cash, and gave him the cash, and he gave me the note; I at the same time put it in my pocket in the hurry of business; on some time after I happened to take it out on some business in my shop, and I put it in my private book, on the other side, I forgot to put it on one side as I usually do. On Monday morning, on my journey to Huntingdon, as I had promised two or three days before, I went in the stage, and staid there longer then I meant, and that caused me to change the note; I wanted to return on Wednesday morning; I asked several of my friends who were there, some who knew me and some who did not, if they could give me cash for this thirty pounds note; accordingly giving it to one Mr. Pepperdy, (Mr. Pepperdy's brother is a gentleman that keeps the Dolphin inn) after they had it they returned it to me, said, they could not change it; I returned into the town, and said, to my friend Pepperdy, what shall I do for money to carry me to town? says he, I am short myself; I said I must get change if possible; so I asked the servant to go with it; she rakes it to the banking house, asking me what she should bring me? I told her to bring me ten or twenty pounds in notes; I asked him what I should give her? he said a shilling, you cannot give her less; she gave me the notes and cash on the same evening; I came to town in the mail. I should have gone myself, only I detained myself too much on the grounds with the races, and I was packing up my clothes to come off, as the mail could not be detained for me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am lady's maid to Mrs. Howard, of Silverdale House, Lewisham—on Thursday afternoon, 23rd November, about 3.30, I was at the window, and saw Homan and Baker, standing opposite the build<lb></lb>ings,</p>

               <p>and they went down the Dale—they were sufficiently near the house to see it—I went upstairs about 5.30 and the house was quite safe—I came down, went into the dining-room and drew the blinds up—my mistres and Miss Haggart were in the room—I remained in the room until I heard a crash of glass or silver, and a very heavy fall—there was no man in the house—when I saw Baker and Homan, Baker had a darker coat on than he has now; Homan is dressed pretty much the same, and he had a little hair on his face then—a gentleman then came to the house and went up to the bed-room and found the door locked—he said "Go for a policeman, and the cook went down the Dale—I went into the high road and a man came up and said "What is the matter?"—I said "Do come, some one has broken into my master's house and I want some one to come and help us"—I cannot recognise Marson's face, but his voice is the same as that man's, and to the best of my belief he is the man—I was still calling out and he said "Hush, don't make such a noise"—he accompanied me back to the house, one of the ladies gave him a stick and he went partly upstairs.</p>

The men were walking about outside the house about 3 o'clock, for about a quarter of an hour—I was sitting at needlework in the bed-room, over the dining-room, the room which was broken into while my lady was dressing—I did not point out the men to her—I then went down to tea—Baker wore a darker coat, it was an overcoat; I did notice whether it came down to his knees—it was buttoned across over his chest; I cannot tell you whether it had tails—he had dark trowsers and a soft round hat—I next saw the man I believe was Baker, at the police-station, a week and two days afterwards; his head was then bandaged—I had not heard that the man who tried to break in had broken his arm, but I knew that he was injured because I saw blood in the area.</p>

I am the wife of Edwin Howard, a solicitor, of Silver<lb></lb>dale House—on the afternoon of 23rd November I was sitting in the dining-room with Miss Haggart, and my maid was in the room—I heard a noise like glass breaking, and asked my maid to go and see what it was, and then I heard a groan—I went downstairs, and a few minutes afterwards the front door bell rang, and then the groaning ceased—the cook opened the door, and a gentleman staying with us came in—he is not here—I gave him a light and directly the door was open I saw my seal skin jacket on the door-step, and my travelling bag on the lawn—there was a white-bandied table knife in the area, and a quantity of blood—the bed-room window was opened as high as it could be from the bottom—there is a portico by the side of it, and anybody standing on the portico could get in at the window—I went up to that room and found both the doors locked from the inside—one door was forced, and on going in we found the carpet taken up, the three divisions of the wardrobe were disarranged, and I missed my watch, and earrings and chain; and my travelling bag, which was found on the lawn, stuffed with silver—that was what I heard fall—the silver is all recovered—the value of the property was 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I saw what the</p>

                  </hi>. I was spending the day with Mrs. Howard—I heard a fall, went downstairs and heard some one groaning in the area—a few minutes afterwards the front gate bell was rung by a gentleman who was coming home—two gentlemen who were not staying in the house also came in, and the prisoner Marson, who was very agitated, came in with them, and told me not to make a noise, it was not the thing to do, as the thieves would only run away all the faster, but that he would go for the police—my attention was directed to his voice—I have heard Marson speak since' at the police-court, and it was the same voice; it is a peculiar voice, and it struck me very much on 23rd November—I saw him on the Saturday, at the station, he was with twelve or fourteen other people, and I picked him out almost immediately.</p>

I will not swear to him—I was not cross-examined at the police-court,. there was no one to cross-examine me—Marson asked me if I would swear to him, and I said "No," but that to the best of my belief he was the man—I was talking to the man I gay is Marson quite three minutes on the night of the robbery—I was not very frightened then because the robbers had gone——the cook wanted to go into the area, but I begged her not—when I was sure the men had gone I went to the area.</p>

On the morning of 29th November, I accompanied Holder to Baker's house, 16, Margaret Place, Bethnal Green—I was present when Baker got up and dressed himself—Holder left him in my charge and that of another constable, Thick—I took him down into the shop parlour where his mother-in-law, his wife, and his Sister-in-law lived—his mother-in-law asked me to allow him to have a cup of tea—I said "Yes; as he is injured, I do not wish to be harsh with him"—he turned round to Thick, and said "Why, I saw you at 4 o'clock in Shoreditch, when I was larking with some young <hi rend="italic">chaps</hi> against the hoard<lb></lb>ings, and I saw you again at 6 o'clock on the Mount"—that is close to the prisoner's home—I said "Along with another one, and you looked after us, you were not injured then"—his mother-in-law said "He was brought to me about 8.15 by a short, stout young man, he said that he had been larking with some young men, and they threw him under a cart—he first said that it was done at London Bridge, and then at Cheapside, and then at the Triangle, he tells such lies that we do not know when he tells the truth"—I said "If the man was to blame he ought to be punished"—Baker said "The man is a poor man, and has a family of seven children, and I. do not wish to hurt him"—he did not say who the man was, or where he lived, nor did he give me any information by which I could find him out—we took him to the Sydenham station, where the charge was entered; the inspector read it over to him—he then said "That is the inspector's charge, not the gentleman's charge; the gentleman does not charge me with breaking into his house"—I said "Perhaps you would like to see the gentleman again";. I fetched him back, and he made the charge in Baker's presence of breaking and entering into his house on the night of the 23rd—Baker said "How could it be breaking and entering, when the window was open, and it was not night?"—on the 9th December, about 4.30 p.m., I took Marson—he was at Commercial Street station, detained on another charge—I said "You will be charged with being concerned with James Baker and others in breaking into Silverdale House, Sydenham, on</p>

Would you turn Queen's evidence, if you were me?"—I said "That you must do as you like about"—he said "No, I would sooner stand to it, whatever punishment I get"—he also said "You do not know who was standing along with <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> Middleton?"—I said "I do not," and he mentioned a name—after he got into the carriage he said "You do not know what is in store for you. You do not know as much as I do. Mother Bostock has got 3,600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and she is going to indict you for perjury in putting the boy up to swear that Baker was in the house"—a beer-house, I understood—I laughed and said "Why, I have not spoken to the boy yet I did not ask him at the police-court; he has made a mistake"—he said "They say there is 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of stuff stolen, do not they?"—I said "Yes"—he said "They say there is a watch and chain"—Mackenzie said "And a pair of earrings"—Homan said "No, there were no earrings, there was a ring and some studs, I see by the paper, and some buttons; they are not so good as they look; Bostock is a b——liar, she says that I took a sovereign out of <hi rend="italic">Jimmy's</hi> pocket when he was insensible, and <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> Middle<lb></lb>ton pawned his watch and chain before we started, and gave Baker some money, and I lent him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. myself, and he owes me 65 now, if I see him in the cell on Monday, I'll punch him on the nose"—I said "You won't, he is out on bail"—he said "I'll lay anything you do not see him; he</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He was not injured at that time—I did not say any<lb></lb>thing before the Magistrate about his head and arm being injured—he was married on Saturday, 5th August, and I took apartments for him at Mr. Booth's, the undertaker's, in the Hackney Road—he had been married seven or eight weeks before he came to live with me, that was about the beginning of October—I remember Foster, the policeman, coming on the morning of 29th November, when Baker was arrested—I did not say to him "He first told me it was done at London Bridge, and afterwards at Cheapside, and after that at the Triangle," not till Foster made the state<lb></lb>ment to me first—I did say "It is no use minding what he says, be has been out of his mind all night, first he tells me here, and then he tells me there"—I did mention London Bridge, Cheapside, and the Triangle, as places at which the accident occurred, but I did not go on to say "He tells such a pack of lies that there is no knowing when he speaks the truth"—I merely said "How can you say that"—he came home between 8 o'clock and 8.30 with his injuries; I was then washing up my tea things.</p>

I am the daughter of the last witness, and live with her—I remember this accident happening to my brother, on 23rd November; it was on a Thursday—I saw him when he came home to his tea at 5 o'clock, and was with him while he had his tea, he went out about 6 o'clock—my mother was not in the room all the time.</p>

               <p>Thursday, 23rd November, I saw him at the Turk's Head, Parson Street, Bethnal Green, at 6 p.m., when I went into the tap-room to see if one of my men was at work who had been out drinking—I remained there from 6 till 10 o'clock, because I was trying to get the men to come to work as I had a shipping order—Marson remained there all the time I was there, he was sitting at the opposite table to me, drinking beer—he was not in company with me, but I spoke to him and he drank out of my pint, and I drank out of <hi rend="italic">hisun</hi>—I spoke to him—a man who works for me was in the room, and also my father who works for me—I left Marson there at 10 o'clock.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have not give a evidence before to-day—I was sub<lb></lb>poenaed on Monday last, I knew nothing of the case till then—it was first by this subpoena (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) that ray attention was attracted to 23rd October—I did not see either of the other prisoners there—I only know Marson.</p>

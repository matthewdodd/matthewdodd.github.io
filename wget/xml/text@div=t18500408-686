                  </hi>. I am a clerk to Currie and Co., of Corn<lb></lb>hill. In July and Aug., 1849, there was no credit in favour of R. Willis, from Bower and Co., of Beverley—I have not known any checks drawn in the name of Bower, Dewsbury, and Hall, since I have been in the house, which is eight years—Mr. Dewsbury has been dead many years—we are the agents of that bank—the name is now Bower, Hall, and Co., and has been so more than twelve months.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do not you know that Mr. Willis has by letters of credit received money at your place? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have never known of anything</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185004080007"></xptr>
               <p>of the kind—I do not swear that he has not, but it has not come to my knowledge—I am cashier—I was in the country department at the time the check was presented—if we had received a letter of credit from Beverley we should have paid the check, although it has the name of Dewsbury on it; we might have required a draft to make it more legal—I never knew Mr. Dewsbury in the firm—if a single letter of credit was sent it would appear in the advice-book, or the payment-book—I do not remember this check being presented.</p>

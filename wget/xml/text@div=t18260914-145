On the 8th of July, about half-past nine o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner outside my window; I saw her put her hand over the wire, take a piece of bacon, and look at it - my young man was nearer to her than I was, but his head was turned away; I kept my eye up on her - I just turned round, she was gone, and the bacon - I pursued, and took hold of her just by the watch-box - I said, "What have you got here"- she said Nothing, extended her arms, and the bacon fell down.</p>

Yes; five in the shop, and one out - there were several persons outside the shop - I do not remember seeing a little girl, nor a woman - there were several persons outside - I did not ask any body if they had seen her drop any thing.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

            . I am the watchman. Mr. Morris gave the prisoner in my charge, and the bacon - as we were going along she said she would honestly beg Mr. Morris' pardon and mine, if I would not lock her up - I delivered her to the officer - a little girl came up as we were going there, who said it was not her mother that thieved the bacon.</p>

               <p>COURT to SAMUEL MASON. Q. Did she speak to you in going along? A. She said she was not the person who stole the bacon, and Mr. Morris had given me the wrong person.</p>

            . I live with my mother, in Greenwell-street, Somer's-town. I know Mr. Morris' shop. On the night Mrs. Smith was taken I was in Skinner-street, at a grocer's, opposite Mr. Morris'. I saw a woman, like a dustman's wife, stand at Mr. Morris', and take the bacon - it was not this lady who took it; there was a person passed me at the moment, and I did not see what the woman did with it; in two or three minutes I saw Mrs. Smith in the hands of the watchman; I took hold of his coat, and said, "Sir, that is not the person who took the bacon," but he went on to the watch-house- I could not get in, or I should have said the same there. When the woman took the bacon Mrs. Smith was at the green-grocer's, next door but one, taking some sallad up to price it; the person who took it went up West-street, in a line with Mr. Morris' - there was no one serving Mrs. Smith.</p>

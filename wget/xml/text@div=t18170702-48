            . I am a corn-dealer, and live in Kingsland-road. On the 13th of June, about a quarter before six o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoners, Coleman and Savell, in the Kingsland-road - I never saw them before; they were driving four oxen, they were Highland Scots; they drove them out of the road into a bye lane-they drove them into Mr. Clement's fields, and over some very high banks into Mr. Smith's field; there was no road, only a footpath. I went into Smith's field and told him-they went away directly.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What is the distance from Childerditch to this place - A. Twenty-two miles.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it possible, between nine o'clock at night, and half-past six in the morning, to drive cattle that distance - A. It is possible.</p>
               <p>JOHN SMITH. I live at Haggerston, in the county of Middlesex, and in the parish of Shoreditch. Cook informed me that four bullocks had been put into my field. I went there, and saw the prisoners, Coleman and Savell, and asked them who gave them authority to put them in my field - I am sure they are the men. They both said they brought them by Rogers's order - I knew Rogers very well. I afterwards saw Rogers (in about an hour and a quarter), and asked him how he came to put the beasts into my field; he said they should not be there above half an hour. I told him what the prisoners had said to me. He said if I liked to take them on my own account at 40l. I might have them. I told him I thought they had not come honestly by them, and I would have nothing to do with them, nor should they be in my field. I called Rogers out-all the four prisoners were together. I met Brace before I had seen Rogers; he asked me if I had seen Rogers, before I suspected him-this was after I had seen Coleman and Savell; he said Rogers ought to have been there at half-past four o'clock in the morning, to take the bullocks away, for they ought to have been killed before that time. He said they had brought the beasts twenty-one miles. I gave information at the Public Office.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect (on Tuesday night, the 10th), any conversation between Rogers, Brace and Savell about a dog - A. Yes; they came to me, and asked me to lend them a dog to go into the country. They said there were four deer lying in a gentleman's paddock, and they wanted to get them. I told them I had not got one.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. They were all three together. I will swear that I never had any disagreement with Brace - I never saw him before that day. I saw Rogers at his own house. The cattle were quite broken down and overcome-their tongues hung out of their mouths.</p>

            . I am a constable of Shoreditch. From information that I received on the 13th of June, I went to Smith's field. In going there, I met the prisoner, Brace, coming from the field-it was about seven o'clock in the morning-the cattle were laying down. He went across Haggerston to the Kingsland-road, and there I saw him join Coleman and Savell; I was some distance off. I and Armstrong went to the Hackney-road, and took Brace and Rogers. I told Brace I apprehended him on suspicion of stealing beasts - He said he knew nothing of any beasts; he had just come from the Eagle and Child,(which is on Epping Forest), and had slept there that night. We found Coleman and Savell at a public-house in the Kingsland-road. I told Savell I took him on suspicion of stealing four beasts - He said he knew nothing of any, but found four on the road near the turnpike.</p>

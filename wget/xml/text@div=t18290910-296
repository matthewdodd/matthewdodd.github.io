             called and told me where the property was; when I saw Mr. Scate, I told him I was come to pay the rent and the expences, but there was no rent due - the things were not on the premises when the rent became due. I was before Sir George Farrant - Mr. Scate was sent for several times, but he did not come, and Sir

             advised me to prefer a bill against him - I did not owe any rent at the time the things were removed; he removed them by my direction in the first instance, and then he got Mrs. Sanders, who was my landlady, to allow him to seize - I have not got my property again.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Should you know Mrs. Sanders' hand-writing? A. Yes; I believe the name of "Dinah Sanders" to this paper, is her writing - I am not aware that I have gone by a dozen names; I am come into Court quite unprepared to meet the trial, and my most essential witness is out of town - I have not gone by any names, known to Scate but Harwood, and that name he has seized in; I have gone by three names, but not by any other name than Harwood in this affair - I did go by the name of Richardson, from family circumstances; I have a brother by the same father but not by my mother; he has a brass plate on his door in the name of Edgar, and I have been addressed as Miss Edgar in the way of business - I lived at Brompton when I went by the name of Richardson: I knew a gentleman of that name, but in consequence of my own family, I must beg leave to decline answering these questions.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. When did you remove? A. On the 8th of August, and the rent was due on the 10th - the things were left under Scate's care, in Leicester-street, where he took them from Well-street, till a debt was paid; he was to remove them merely as a broker, not to keep them - I had a landlady named Mrs. Sanders; my quarter with her expired on the 10th of August - before I removed I paid her all; I believe she is here to prove it - I had entrusted this property to be taken care of by Scate; he removed it from Leicester-street to Bear-street, under a distress for rent due to Mrs. Sanders, as he said, but I owed her none - the things were taken out of the drawers and pawned; there was a purse with a sovereign in it, and some duplicates - Scate redeemed some of the things.</p>
               <p>Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. You have sworn to your landlady's writing? A. I have sworn to my belief of it; I never saw her write but once - she told me she had signed a warrant; this paper is not my hand-writing - I will swear it is not.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you ever sign any receipt? A. Never, but in the presence of witnesses; I only signed two receipts - one for 2l. 5s. 9d., and one other; the value of my property was about 60l.; Mr. Seale's bill is 7l. 1s.; I have not seen all my property - a purse, a sovereign, and some duplicates are missing; no one has given me any account of that money - the property I have seen is worth about 40l.; that is now detained for the 7l. - (paper read.)</p>

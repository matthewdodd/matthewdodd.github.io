                  </hi>. I live at 56, College-street West, Camden-town. On 15th Dec., 1854, I was the driver of one of Messrs. Pickford's carts—the firm is Joseph Baxendale and others, and they trade under the same of Pickford and Co.—on that day I received some packages in my cart, at the North Western Railway, one of which was addressed to Messrs. Brockle<lb></lb>hurst of Milk-street—that package was safe when I was at the end of Milk-street—I had to deliver two boxes at Mr. Evans's, Cheapside, and when I came back to the cart the box was gone—it could not hare fallen off, it must have been stolen by somebody—I had had to wait at the station for the train from Macclesfield, and these packages came up by it—I had other goods to deliver at Messrs. Brocklehurst's, but I lost this truss—it was 10 minutes to 8 o'clock when I got out of the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Messrs. Home, bullion carriers, of Moorgate-street. We have an agent at Boulogne—in March last we received this bill of lading (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is in the writing of the clerk at Boulogne, and refers to a case of goods for Mr. Beaumont, directed to be left at the Custom-house till called for—on 16th or 17th March we received the bill of lading, saying that the box had arrived at the Custom-house, and that Mr. Beaumont's name was on the direction—upon seeing that, our manager wrote to Mr. Beaumont, and a few days afterwards an elderly gentle<lb></lb>man, calling himself Beaumont, came, but did not clear the box—some few days after that, the prisoner, I believe, came—that was in March, to the best of my belief—he said that he came about a case of silk which had been addressed to Mr. Beaumont—I told him that there had been a mistake in the matter, as they were English goods—he said that he was aware of that, but now that the duty had been paid, what was to be done—he gave no name—I only call him Singe from having heard it since—I told him that I would do my best, and left the office, and went with him to Messrs. Lightly and Simon, our agents—I inquired of the manager, in his presence, what was to be done in the matter, as duty had been paid on English goods—he said, "I very much doubt whether you can get the duty back, but if you wish to do so, you have to get several certificates; one from the Custom-house agent who received it in France, and another from the one who shipped it again to England"—we then left together, and while we were yet in Lime-street, he asked me again what instructions the manager had given—I took a pencil and piece of paper, and wrote down the names of the certificates which the manager had said would be required, and gave it to him—he said that he would see that everything was done, so as to recover the duty—I believe he said that the goods when first they went from England had been booked in Regent-circus; as there are several booking offices at Regent-circus, Piccadilly, I told him if it had happened to go to our own office, No. 33, Regent-circus, it would be much more easy to go into the matter—he said that they had been in bond in France, and that Mr. Beaumont had ordered them to come back to England—I never saw him in the office again, but met him two or three times over the water—we had no further conversation about the matter.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Lightly and Simon, Custom-house agents, of Fenchurch street. In March last I paid the duty on a case of goods directed to Mr. Beaumont, to be left at the Custom-house till called for—I received a bill of lading from the office, and ultimately in Oct. I was paid the amount of the duty, 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., by Mr. Houdins—I then gave him up the box which was at our premises, and gave him an account receipted—he paid our charges.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 57, High-street, Bloomsbury, and am a bronze manufacturer. Early in Sept. the prisoner came to me about some white silk for sale—I told him I would speak to a friend of mine, as it was not in my line—he said that it was in Messrs. Lightly and Simon's hands, and that they would pay duty for it—he wanted about 28<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., duty included—he said that they came from France and were French goods—I afterwards spoke to Mr. Badaighe, who gave me an order to buy it, sod about 11th Oct. I ultimately bought it of the prisoner upon his representation, without seeing it—he came again afterwards, and I told him he might bring the papers, and I would pay him—he brought me three papers, here are two of them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I think he went away and fetched them; he brought them the same day (<hi rend="italic">these were Messrs. Lightly's account, and the receipt, which was in French</hi>)—he gave them to me to show that it was bought of Beaumont—I took the third paper to Messrs. Lightly and Simon's, and left it in their hands—I paid them 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and they gave me the box of silk, and this paper—I paid the prisoner 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., that made it just 28<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—when I got the box it contained six pieces of silk; I gave them to Mr. Badaighe—I am quite sure the prisoner is the person to whom I paid the money—I had known him for six months, he used to come and see me sometimes, and I have done business with him—I had a good reference—I saw him two or three times about the silk.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>). I act as a detective. On Friday, 26th Oct., in consequence of information I received, I went with a clerk of Messrs. Pickford's to Mr. Badaighe's, and received from him the silk produced—I then went with him to Mr. Houdins—I gave the receipted account to Messrs. Lightly, and also the bill of parcels—on the following day I went with Mr. Houdins to find the prisoner—I saw him at a public house in the New Kent-road—he came there in consequence of a mes<lb></lb>sage left at his house by Mr. Houdins—he lives in a small row of houses, at the back of County-terrace—when he came in Mr. Houdins said, "This is Mr. Sange, the gentleman I had the silk of"—the prisoner said nothing—I told him that I was a police officer, and said, "I have some silk in my pos<lb></lb>session, which has been stolen, and which Mr. Houdins says that he has bought of you, and paid you 28<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it"—I then showed him Lightly and Simon's account, and the receipt, but not the bill of lading—I did not have that—he said, "I have never sold any silk to Mr. Houdins, and never received any money from him; if you look at that paper you will see that it is not my name, it is Mr. Beaumont that you want, "showing me Mr. Beaumont's name on the paper which I held in my hand—I said, "Then did you sell the silk for Mr. Beaumont?

Lightly, and begged me to find Mr. Beaumont, and take him—I said that I could not part with him till the case was cleared up—I allowed him to go to his house, as he had not had any breakfast, but I went with him—it was then about 11 o'clock—at one time he said that he should not go with me—I told him that if he did not, I should send for two men in uniform immediately—he then said that I had no business to take him unless I had a warrant—I showed him my warrant card, this is it (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>)—we always carry it to show our authority—I think it was after that that he said that he would not go—I think I showed it to him in the public house.</p>

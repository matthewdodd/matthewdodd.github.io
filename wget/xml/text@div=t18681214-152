                  </hi>. I am a seaman belonging to Her Majesty's ship <hi rend="italic">Vivid</hi>—on Monday, 23rd November, I went to the Canterbury public-house, at Woolwich, with Hawkins—I called for sixpennyworth of gin, and gave a half-sovereign to the prisoner, who was the waiter—he brought me the gin; he had a pewter pot in the other hand then—he did not give me the change for the half-sovereign—he put the gin on the table, and went to serve some one with the beer—I saw him ten minutes after, but said nothing; to him—ten minutes after I asked him for some beer—when he brought it, I asked him for my change out of the half-sovereign—he said, "I did not have any half-sovereign of you"—I said he had, and if he did not give it me, I should give him in charge—he denied having the money, and I said if he only confessed that he had had the half-sovereign, I would spend it with him in the house—he still said he had not got it—we had a few words—I went on shore with 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in my possession, 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, and a half-sovereign—that was all in one purse—when I gave him the half-sovereign, I had two florins, two shillings, and some coppers in it, rather more than 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had the half-sovereign as well; I gave that to him—I lent one of the witnesses a florin to spend on shore—I had been to two houses before that</p>

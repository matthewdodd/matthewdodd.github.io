That hearing that Hawks and Bethel were seen about the Door that night, she suspected they were the Persons that robbed her, and accordingly got them apprehended, the Prisoner assisting her in their apprehension, and pretending he was robb'd of some Wigs also (she at that time not suspecting the Prisoner) but hearing some things relating to him, and seeing him live at a more expensive rate than before, and finding Money more plenty, and he about buying Goods to a Considerable value, she began to suspect him to have been concerned in robbing her, and talked pretty home to him about the matter; he answered her, she would certainly hear of her Money and Plate again in 8 days time; and to satisfie for how he came by so much Money he told her he had lately received 70 l. upon a Attorney , and to confirm it, Shew'd her a Attorney , which she took notice was without Seal and this made her the more suspicious of and she being very uneasy, he told her she would certainly have her Plate and Money return'd in 8 days time. And that on the 13th of May a brought her a Letter (which was produced in Court) signifying that there was a Box directed to her at the Crown near the Ditch-side, upon which she stopped the Porter, and he went with her there, found the Box and Plate in it, and the Bag in which the Money had been, but no Money; and that there was likewise in the Box a scrap of Callicoe, the same with the Lining of

The Prisoner in his defence deny'd his being the Person that sent the Letter, and brought some Persons who deposed, that having talked with John Morrice the Portor, he told them, he was in great trouble in Mind in swearing the Prisoner was the Man that sent him with the Letter, either knowing or suspecting he had sworn falsely, wishing he had been sick in his bed when he had done it, and saying he was compell'd to it by some other persons. To which John Morrice reply'd that he did say he was sorry he should be concerned in so troublesome an Affair, but was not sorry he had detected a Rogue; he brought also several who gave him the Character of an honest, tender-spirited Man, and one that would not be guilty of so great Villany. The Prisoner likewise produced Persons that had paid him Money much about that time, and brought some Persons to speak to his Reputation.

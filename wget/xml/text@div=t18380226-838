                  </hi>. I live on Mr. William Thomas Ball's premises, No, 126, Brick-lane—he resides at No. 8, Charlotte-street, Bloomsbury-square—the prisoner has lived with him as his watchman since the fire, which was on the 1st of February—I saw the prisoner on the floor of my master's premises, about half-past seven o'clock on the morning of the 8th of February—as the prisoner was rising, I saw a spoon fall from his breeches pocket—he had sat up there all night—my master kept his silver spoons on the first floor, and the prisoner was on the second floor—I did not see him come from the first to the second floor—he was sitting by the fire when this happened—he talked about going to breakfast, and on standing up to stretch himself, the spoon fell from his breeches pocket—he said, "That is my key," and he put his foot over it to hide it—he then pulled a key from his pocket, and said, "That is my key"—I said, "What is under your foot?"—and when I pulled his foot away, there was</p>

               <p>a dessert spoon—he said, "It is an old metal spoon"—he took it from me, and put it on the shelf—I took it, and said, "It is Mr. Ball's spoon"—the prisoner went to his breakfast directly—I kept the spoon till I gave it to my master—the policeman has it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 8, Charlotte-street, Bloom<lb></lb>bury—I had a fire at No. 126, Brick-lane, where I did live—this hap<lb></lb>pened there—I had the prisoner there to watch the property after the fire—he has been there since the 1st of February—I had a previous know<lb></lb>ledge of him—this is my spoon—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—the spoons were kept it a cupboard on the first floor—there were none on the second floor.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I was employed as watchman at night, and on this Wednesday, about half-past five o'clock in the morning, I went up stairs, where the boy lay, and called him up—he asked me to leave the candle—I did, and came down into the second floor, and sat there with my brother-in-law—we then went to give the horses some water and victuals—in the meantime, this boy washed up the tea-things—we came back, knocked at the door, and this boy let us in—I sat down in the chair—I had got a wood-frock, a pair of trowsers, and an apron on—I lighted my pipe at a quarter to seven o'clock—at a quarter past seven o'clock I got up to go to ray break<lb></lb>fast; and when I got up, I caught hold of the cloak, and then something fell—I thought it was my key—I felt in my pocket, and said, "No, here is my key"—I then picked up the spoon, and laid it on a bag of halfpence—the boy took it down, held it to the light, and said, "It is one of Mr. Ball's best silver spoons; I will put it into my pocket and deliver it to his when he comes"—I said, "That is the best way"—I went to breakfast, and when I came back, Mr. Ball charged me with wanting to take some of his property, and said he could not think of employing me, I might go home—I asked him to pay me for what I had done—he said he could not think of that—I said I should get a summons—he said I might if I could—I went and got a summons; and on the 19th Mr. Ball attended, and made his statement—the Magistrate said he must not cheat me out of my money, and told him to pay me—when I got down, he wanted to shuffle me out of 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—there was 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. Coming to me—he wanted to pay me off with 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but he paid me 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he then said, "I shall give you into custody for felony"—I said, "Very well"—I came into the passage, and gave my wife the 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—there was one of the G division there—the prosecutor said to him, "Are you on duty?"—he said, "No"—he said, "I want to give charge of this man;" and he took me—they stood waiting about, but did not go to appear against me that day—I suppose on account of not going before the same Magistrate as they had seen that day—I was locked up all night, and on Saturday I had my hearing, and was remanded for a week—then they made up a story against me—the boy has stated three times as much now as he did then—he never said a word about moving my feet at all—I had three hearings, and then the Magistrate did not know what to do about discharging me.</p>

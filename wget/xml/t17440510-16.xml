               <p>Edward Wall. I lost the lead from over the door. It was there at eight o'clock on Sunday night, and gone before six on Monday morning; there was about thirty two pounds ripped off; the Constable told me his watchmen had taken a man with some lead; we carried it to the place, and it fitted exactly. I believe I can, with a great deal of safety, sweat that this is my lead.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. As I was coming along, I found it against some iron rails, and I thought I had as good a right to take it as another person.</p>

            . I am a watchman, belonging to Queenhith. About half an hour after four the Prisoner comes by, and says, Good morrow watchman; and I said, Good morrow to you. After he was gone by, I said to my brother watchman, that man is a lead stealer. I had him in custody once before upon that account; so I stopped him, and found the lead upon him, hid under his coat. He said, he was going over the water, and I had no business with him. The lead was carried to Mr. Wall's house, and sitted exactly, and there was the same coloured paint upon the lead, as was upon a gutter, that joins to the door.</p>

               <p>THOMAS COOPER. I lost 6s. 6d. and a watch on the 9th of February - I missed the money in about half an hour, but I did not miss the watch for near twelve hours; I was in bed, asleep, and the prisoner was sleeping in another bed in the same room; I have seen my watch at the pawnbroker's - this is it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q. I believe the prisoner was taken in by you from charity? A. Yes - he came from Leamington; his money was gone, and I took him in: I did not then know where his relations lived, but I have ascertained since, and have seen them - they gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>JOHN BENZY. I am a baker. The prisoner came to me on Monday week, in the evening, and asked me to buy a watch; he said he came from Leamington, and wanted to part with the watch to get a lodging - I said I had not money to buy it, but I would let him have a shilling or two on it - I kept it till the next day, and then pawned it for 3s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you know him before? A. No; I told him I should pawn it, because it was too late for him to pawn it that night.</p>
               <p>CHARLES HOUGHTON. I am a pawnbroker, and took the watch in pawn.</p>

             re-examined. I went to the prisoner's friends, and said if he would discover where the watch was I would not do any thing against him, and they sent me word about it; it was on Sunday evening I missed it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a good character.</p>

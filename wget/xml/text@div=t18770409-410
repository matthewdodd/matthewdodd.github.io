                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, I acted for Mrs. Moses, at the Surrey Sessions, and was present when the witnesses were sworn—all except Vandervoort were Jewesses, except the servants—I do not know that Vandervoort is a Roman Catholic, but I know she is not a Jewess—she was sworn on the New Testament—Ramsden said that she applied for admission to the Home, for a friend of hers, and gave a reference to Dr. Asher, and subsequently went to him and stated that the admission was for herself, and that she was admitted the following day, that she took to the Home a box in which was a purse, in which was a bank-note for 1,000 francs; that while in the house she showed that bank-note to Mrs. Moses, and that it was stolen from her there, and that some days afterwards on opening her purse she discovered in the place of her note, two notes of the Bank of France for 100 francs each—she also said that after she left the Home she called at the police-station, on 4th December, and then went to the Home and saw Mrs. Moses, and on 19th December, went with a policeman to Mrs. Moses at the Home—she was cross examined at considerable length—Flatow swore that her husband kept a hairdresser's shop in Goldsmith Street, Whitechapel, that on 20th November, 1876, about 9.15 a.m., I think I am correct as to the time, a young girl came into the shop to purchase a wig and some false hair; that Mrs. Vandervoort and Moses Aaron were in the shop at the time, and that she offered in payment a 1,000 franc note, but was unable to change it, and said that it did not matter she would call again, and she identified Rose Essinger as the girl—Vandervoort swore that she was in Flatow's shop, but would not be certain of the date; that a young lady who was there when she arrived, wanted to buy some hair and offered a 1,000 franc note in payment; that she, coming from Belgium, and speaking French knew a 1,000 franc note and examined it, and that it had on it "<hi rend="italic">mille francs";</hi> that she followed the young lady out, who offered her outside the shop 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. if she would get the note changed for her into English money, and that the young lady was Rose Essinger, who was in the dock-Caroline Frinberg swore that she was a dealer in ladies' clothing in Leman Street, Whitechapel; that in November, a young lady called between 9 and 10 o'clock at her shop and wanted to buy some satin skirts, and offered in payment what she said was French money equal to 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

               <p>in the neighbourhood of Whitechapel—she goes there every morning and returns to sleep in the evening—early in November the prisoner Ramsden called on me to ask about the home—she said she had heard a great deal about it and the comforts that there were there, and she knew a lady who was very ill, and if she could only get her admitted to the home she thought it would be a very good thing for her—I gave her a book of the rules, she sat down and we had a conversation—I told her that she should see Dr. Asher—she returned on 6th November, and brought an admission from Dr. Asher—I had received a letter from Dr. Asher in the morning, and when she came I said "I see your friend has got admission;" she took out the paper and said "What shall I tell you, it is for myself"—she said "Can I remain now I am here?"—I said "No, there is but one routine; we take patients on Tuesdays about 11 o'clock, or half-past"—she said "You must allow me to bring a small box"—I said "We do not allow boxes to be brought in as a rule"—she said "It is about this size"—she came on the Tuesday evening after which I saw a large box in the play-room—she asked me to allow her to keep it there—I said I would think over it and decide in the morning—I ultimately gave her leave to keep it there—she never showed me any money of any kind while she was at the home—she talked to me a great deal; she told me she had been offered 2,000 francs to get a husband for Madame Bishopstein's daughter, and that she was arranging the marriage—she told me about her life, and going about the world and a great many curious stories—on the Wednesday evening before she left I heard Miss Sealey call out—I went upstairs and Miss Sealey and Mrs. Ramsden came to me—Mrs. Ramsden made a charge against Miss Sealey which I declined to believe, and Mrs. Ramsden became very angry indeed—she said that it was a very bad wicked house—she was very violent and called Miss Sealey very bad names—I said that I had known her a long time and could not believe anything against her and I said "How long are you going to keep on with the same story?"—she said "For years until I have completed your ruin"—I said "My ruin?"—she said "Yes for your pride and arrogance; you shall not be matron here long if I can help it"—she went to pack up her box and wanted to go at 11 o'clock at night, but I would not permit it—I said to her next morning "After all is it not folly to put yourself out of a comfortable home. If you are ill, why do you go in such weather"—she said "I will not remain while that prostitute Miss Sealey is here"—I said "Do not polute my ears with such words," and left the room—that was on 23rd November—she left that day, she had made no charge or allegation up to that time that she had lost 1,000 francs—she took her box away and I heard no more of her till the 24th of December when she came for some clothes which she had left behind to be washed—I saw her in the kitchen and said "What, are you here Mrs. Ramsden"—she said "Yes, I came for my washing, can I have a few minutes' private conversation with you with Mrs. Moses"—I thought she had come to apologise for her bad behaviour—I said "No, whatever you have to say, say here"—the housemaids Anne Blackpool and Mary Ann James were in the kitchen—her bundle had then been handed to her, she took it up and walked into the dining-room—I followed her, she asked me what she had to pay for her washing—I said "Nothing, you know it is charity"—she asked what she had to pay for the time she had been in the home—I said "I told you that it was a charity home"—she said "I thank you for the 200 francs you put in my purse"—I looked at her and she said "It was a very motherly act on your part"—I said "Well, you know I am</p>

               <p>a mother to you all, when you are in the home"—thinking she was a little crazy I said "Did you find 200 francs in your purse when you got home"—she said "Yes"—I said "That must have been a very bulky parcel in a purse"—she said "Well, well, will you tell me the name of the lady who put in in my purse?"—I said "You have just now said that I did it," and with that she took her bundle into the kitchen; I followed her—she placed it on the kitchen table—I rather think the servants were there—she said "Tell me the name of the lady that I may thank her"—"I said "Depend upon it whoever put it there does not require thanks'"—she said "Well whoever wants to injure me will be themselves injured"—I said "You have not been injured, by your own showing you are 200 francs richer than when you came"—she said "Well, well, you wont smile very long"—I wanted to get rid of her, and opened the side door for her to go out—she said "Will you allow the nurse to take the parcel for me to the railway"—I said "I will not allow my servants to go on your errands; you remind me of the old adage' If you do ninety-nine good things out of 100, you do not do the 100th?"—she came back and said "If you will let me have a few lines to-morrow by the post, saying you would like the money returned, I shall be very happy to do so; my address is Forest Hill Villa"—I shut the door and heard no more—she did not mention the loss of a 1,000 franc note, or any loss, only a gain—on 11th or 12th December I received this telegram from Mr. Beard, the solicitor—that was the first intimation I had that Mrs. Ramsden had lost a 1,000 franc note; I immediately handed it to the honorary secretary—I remember on 19th December Mrs. Ramsden coming with a constable Cowell, who said "Mrs. Moses, I have come about a very unpleasant affair; Mrs. Ramsden has been to the Croydon Magistrates, and said that she lost 1,000 franc note at the Home, and that you admitted before the servants that you had taken it"—Ramsden then said "Call the good Christian servants who take the Sacrament every Sunday, they will tell the truth"—I looked round, but did not see the servants—I said that I had not seen a 1,000 franc note in Ramsden's possession, and never saw one in all my life"—Ramsden said "The night you would not let me have the box to pack you were taking it out," and she said that it was a good home, and that we had cooking done in the middle of the night, and then she began to ramble, and I said "Sergeant, take her away, I am sick of her," and he did so—on 20th December I was served with this summons to attend at the Guildhall on the 30th; it charges me with the larceny of 1,000 franc bank-note—I appeared on the 30th November and was charged with larceny—' my daughter was not then included—Flatow, Vandervoort, and Frinberg were not there—my daughter was called as a witness for me and I was discharged, I afterwards received notice that a bill had been found against me at the Surrey Sessions, and I stood my trial there for two days—my daughter was changed with me—I never took a 1,000 franc note out of Ramsden's box—I never saw one, or any money in her possession—I had nothing to do with putting 200 francs into her box—I never saw any French money in my life.</p>

I am the wife of Isaac Levy, a waistcoat maker, of Leman Street, Whitechapel—I gave evidence on oath against Mrs. Moses and Miss Essinger at the Surrey Sessions, through being brought into it—I stated that I was in Mr. Frinberg's shop when Miss Essinger came in and offered a 1,000 franc note in payment for some dresses—Mrs. Ramsden told me to say so, but there was not a word of truth in it—I never saw Miss Essinger in my life—I do not know what came over me to induce me to do so—I was passing by Mrs. Frinberg's and she called "Mrs. Levy"—I said "I cannot stop"—she said "I only want you for a few minutes; there was a young girl came into my shop and picked out some skirts and produced some French money, and I offered to go next door and change it"—between 6 and 7 o'clock the same evening I went to the shop again and saw Mrs. Ramsden and Mrs. Frinberg—Mrs. Ramsden said "Sit down, my dear, I love you; I have taken a particular liking to you, I will make you and your poor husband comfortable"—she then asked me to come up to the Surrey Sessions and state that Miss Essinger came into the place and bought two or three skirts and produced some French money—she said that if I did that she would give me a mint of money, and I went in consequence and committed perjury, and I hope the Lord Mayor and the jury will forgive me for what I have done.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Ramsden</hi>. You asked me if I saw anybody in the shop; I said "<hi rend="italic">No</hi>, I was led into it"—you said you would let me have ten years—I said "You ought to have twenty years like Madame Rachael"—you told Mrs. Frinberg to take me into the shop and tell me all this—I have been in the shop and in the parlour too.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. I said on the trial that I was bound to come and speak the truth; I do not remember saying that it was from a sense of justice—I never saw the solicitor before I was in Court—I had this conversation with Mrs. Ramsden, a week and a few days before the trial—I never saw 1,000 franc note in my life—I was charged at the police-court, I have had to turn Queen's evidence, and when I was discharged I was made a witness—at the time I made that statement on the trial, I believed that the whole of it was untrue, and I wanted to say so, but Mrs. Frinberg said "For God's sake don't say so, you will get us all hung, and don't say any<lb></lb>thing</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">The prisoner</hi>). I am charged with perjury and have admitted my guilt—I lived at 3, Goulston Street, Whitechapel—I was examined at the Surrey Sessions as a witness, and stated that Miss Essinger had been into my shop and asked me to change a 1,000 franc note—there was not a single word of truth in that—Mrs. Ramsden came to my place, and persuaded me to do it—I have known her since she was confined with twins at my brother's place ten or twelve years ago, and then she went away and I did not see her for ten or twelve years—she came to my shop and asked me to take this false oath—she has not given me anything, but I got 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at the Court—she said "Be a witness for me"—I said "I can't because I know nothing at all about it"—she told me to say that the young lady had been in my place and asked for change for the note—she took me to the Infant School, and sent me in and told me to ask for Miss Essinger—I asked Mrs. Palmer which was Miss Essinger, and she pointed her out—I had seen her before and knew her face but not her name, because my brother lived next door to the Infant School—I went deliberately into the witness-box and swore that that young lady offered to pass a 1,000 franc note, with the full knowledge that she might be sent to prison for years for it; Mrs. Ramsden persuaded me—Mrs. Vandervoort was in my shop, she brought a dress in her hand, and said "Mrs. Ramsden has sent you this, "but Miss Essinger was never in my shop, and I never knew Mrs. Vander-voort until she gave evidence at the Surrey Sessions, and said that she was in my shop, I know a man named Reece, he was not present when Mrs. Ramsden and I were talking about the evidence I was to give.</p>

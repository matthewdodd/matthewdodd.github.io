In February last the prisoner came into our shop, about two o'clock, and had 4 ozs. of soap, which came to 2d.; she gave me a sixpence, and I gave her change; I put the sixpence into my pocket, where I had one more, but that was a good one, and there was a mark on it. She came again in the evening, and bought a penny candle; she gave me another sixpence - I gave her change, and put that into my pocket- I had then three sixpences, but nothing more; Ann Hoare came in, bought something, and gave me a shilling- I gave her one of the sixpences out of the three - it was a bad one; I then gave her another, and that was bad also; I looked for the other - that was good, and it was the one I had in my pocket before the prisoner came; I put the two bad ones back into my pocket, and did not mix them with any other sixpences. The prisoner came next day for a penny candle, and gave me a bad sixpence - I said I could not give her change; she said she had got nothing but a halfpenny - I said, "You gave me two bad sixpences on Saturday;" she said she was not in the shop, but I am certain of her person. I sent for an officer, and gave her in charge - he found 31/2d. in her pocket.</p>

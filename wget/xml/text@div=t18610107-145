                  </hi>. I reside at Brinnerton, near Chesterfield—I was in the service of the bankrupts, Poole and Bryan—they carried on business as manufacturers of boots and shoes at Northampton, their warehouse was in Bull Head-lane, Northampton—on 13th August last, the workmen left their service—they were told by Poole not to come till 18th, when they were to come for their money—he told them that on the Saturday night, but it was on the Monday morning, the 13th, when the work people were stopped working—they worked till just before dinner, then they gave over, and did not return after dinner—they did not return till the 18th, when they came for their money—when they went away on the Monday morning, the warehouse was closed for the workmen, excepting Poole, Chapman, myself, Woodford, and Ventris—Ventris was not there on 13th—I and Woodford remained in the ser<lb></lb>vice of the bankrupts—on that day, the 13th, I received orders from Mr. Poole (<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">here desired to take the opinion of the Court upon the question of jurisdiction, which must arise in this case, as most of the facts to be proved in evidence, occurred at Northampton.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICE BLACKBURN</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">considered it would be impossible to entertain that question until the close of the case for the pro<lb></lb>tecution.</hi>) On 13th Poole ordered Woodford and I to go into the shoe-room of the factory at Northampton, and help him to pack a lot of trunks with boots—they were Wellington boots, and spring-sides, and half Wellingtons as well—we packed ten trunks—Poole then ordered us to load them in the van and to take them to Mr. Pearce's house in Castilian-street, Northampton—Woodford and I took them there and left them—afterwards on the same day I had orders from Poole to go to Earls Barton, that is about seven miles from Northampton—he ordered me to fetch away all the work that the agent, Mr. Stone, had got ready—I went with a van, and took a large hamper, packed a large hamper—I received a large hamper of goods from Mr. Stone at Earls Barton, containing Wellington boots, half Wellingtons and Bluchers, I think—Poole ordered me to take the hamper to Thomas Chapman's at Kingsthorpe when I got it from Stone—I took the hamper to Chapman's, and left it there—Kingsthorpe is near Northampton—Chapman was there when I left the hamper, and he had it put in his coach-house—it was about 8 o'clock in the evening when I got there—I saw Poole at Northampton when I returned with the horse and van—I told him I had taken the hamper to Thomas Chapman' s, and he then told me that he wanted me to go to Lon<lb></lb>don the next morning—that would be the 14th August—I went to London—no one went with me—I saw Poole in London; when I got into New Oxford-street I saw him with a gentleman—I returned to Northampton on 15th, between 5 and 6 in the evening—when I got back I went to Mr. Poole's house in George' s-street—I saw Poole, Chapman, and Ventris there—Poole gave me the keys of the factory—Chapman was present, but Ventris was in the parlour—Chapman gave me orders to go to the factory and to pack a lot of trunks, as many as I thought would fill the van—Poole and Chapman were together when I got those directions—Mr. Poole gave me orders to take Woodford with me to assist me—we packed between seven and eight trunks, I can' t say exactly—we packed them at</p>

               <p>the factory with Wellington boots, and Bluchers, and half Wellingtons, and spring sides—Woodford and Poole and Chapman assisted me—after we had packed them, Poole ordered us to load them in the van, and Chapman gave us orders to take them to his house at Kingsthorpe—we took them there—Chapman told us we were not to go on the Kingsthorpe-road, that we were to go on the Kettering-road—Woodford and Poole were present when he told me that—the Kingsthorpe-road is the direct road—I should say it is about three miles to go round by the Kettering-road, and about a mile or a little over by the Kingsthorpe-road.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How do you know the dates at which you took out these articles? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because I have them down in a pocket-book—I have not got it with me, a gentleman has got it—I am sure I don't know his name—I gave it up at Guildhall—I made the first note in that book on the 13th—no one was present when I made any of those entries, except it was my family at home—I have not made any other entry of any other things I ever took out for the prisoner—I made that because I thought it was my duty to do so—I thought it was rather a rum time of night for a servant to shift away things as I was ordered to shift—it was after dinner on the 13th that I shifted them—I am speaking of the other times at night—there was nothing extraordinary on the Monday that made me put it down—I am quite sure I put it down at the time—I put the second down on the 14th—I made the note at night in London—I took my book with me—no one was present when I made it—I made the next on the 15th, at my own house—my wife was present—I did not say anything to her at the time I put it down—she did not ask me what I was doing—I don't think she ever saw me put down things before; she might have done—the next one would be on 16th—I can't exactly tell you how long it is since I saw this book—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I should think it must be getting on for two months since I saw it—I can remember the next day, it was the 17th, and the next day 18th, the next 19th, the next 20th—there was no more—I have never given to Mr. Dawson a dif<lb></lb>ferent account of the day on which I removed these goods—I am certain of that—I went to Mr. Dawson's office—I can't tell on what date—Poole, and his father, and Dawson were there—a man of the name of Jameson was not there—Mr. Dawson asked me some questions about removing away the goods—I replied to some of them—I signed my name to something—this (<hi rend="italic">looking at a paper</hi>) is not my signature—it is my name, but it is not my writing—I am certain of that—I have not sworn before that it was my writing—I mean positively to swear it is not my writing, and that I stick to—I am quite sure about it—the signature at the bottom is my writing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you never give the following statement to Mr. Dawson in language, "I have been in the employ of Messrs.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You did not feel very well disposed towards Mr. Cooke in consequence of that, I suppose 1 <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not feel anything about Mr. Cooke—I did not stay because I had no things or furniture—I went to Birmingham and I staid there that night—I had an aunt at Birmingham—it is no more than eight or nine miles to Birmingham—I walked there—I got back to Northampton on Thursday, 4th October, I think—I did not see Poole after that at all to my knowledge—I think I next saw him in the Court—I never saw him to have anything at all to say to him—I was offended with him as far as this, that I thought it was a rascally thing to throw me and my family adrift and break up my home, to send me away to a situation, and then when I got to Walsall to have no home or anything—I have never said I would make Poole pay for it, I am certain of that—I know Burnell he is a chimney sweeper at Northampton—he began to fight with me—I never said to him, if I did not get 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of Poole it would be the worse for him, or any one else, I am quite sure of that—I never said to Burnell I would make Poole pay for this, nor anything of the sort"—I never made any threat of that sort to any one.</p>

               <p>—Poole's father is the person they call "Captain Pools"—whatever state<lb></lb>ment I made, Poole and his father were present when I made it—there were about six or seven trunks, and five bags of loose leather, taken to Pearce's on the 18th—I should think it was between 10 and 11, or from that to 12, when we took the two loads—we took a load at night to Pearce's place, but we did not deliver it there—we delivered it at Poole's house, in the stable belonging to his house—it was after these goods had been delivered at Pearce's, that the wages were paid—there were thirteen bales of leather taken in the morning and delivered to him at his warehouse—I should think it was between 10 and 11, from that to 12, when we had done taking the load: and after dinner Ventris went to the office, and when he returned he began to pay the men their wages—there were no other goods taken to Pearce's after that—some goods were to be taken, but they were not delivered—that was on the same day, after the wages had been paid—it was the work that they took in—I know how it happened that they were not left at Pearce's—Mr. Ventris came to me and Woodford, as I had hold of my horse's head and Woodford was with the van, and told us we were watched, and that we must give the watchers a good chase—that was between 10 and 11 on Saturday night—in consequence of those directions of Ventris, I took the goods back to Mr. Poole's house, 17, George's-street, and Poole had them put into his stable belonging to the house—Poole and Ventris were both there—they were put into the stable.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been living at Leicester lately; but I formerly lived at Northampton—I was in the employ of Messrs. Poole and Bryan, as carpenter—I believe I left on 20th August last—I recollect 13th August last—Mr. Poole gave me some orders on that day—he discharged all the men except me and Beard; and he ordered us to go into the shoe-room to pack a quantity of trunks with boots and shoes—we packed them—we had orders to take them to Mr. Pearce's house, in Castilian-street, Northampton—we took them and left them there—I recollect 15th August—I had orders to go up to Mr. Poole's house on that day—as I was going up I met Beard, and he said he had orders to tell me to go and assist him in packing more trunks with boots and shoes—we packed them—as we were packing them Poole and Chapman came down, and Chapman ordered us to take them to his house at Kingsthorpe—Poole was present when Chapman said that—we took them to Kingsthorpe, but we went a round about way there; not on the regular road—we went up the Wellingborough-road—that is not the Kettering-road—there are two roads, the Wellingborough-road and the Ketter<lb></lb>ing-road—we took the goods to Chapman's and left them there; he received them of us—we returned to Northampton that night, and, on our return, we saw Mr. Poole, and told him where we had taken the goods, and he ordered us to be at the factory the next morning—we went there the next morning—I saw Ventris, Poole, and Chapman there, all three together in the office—we received orders from Ventris to burn some papers in the furnace—after we had burnt the papers Poole gave us orders to go in the shoe-room, where we were to assist in packing some more trunks with boots and shoes—we packed a great quantity of trunks—we were all the day about it—in the evening we went to the factory, after we had packed</p>

I should be to blame—I suppose Young had heard the particular circumstances of the case—I do not know now what I said to that—I might have made a remark upon that, but I cannot recollect it—I did not say, "Come, Mr. Poole, I will peach upon you," or anything of that sort, "if you do not come to terms"—10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would have been very acceptable, but I did not have it—there are several Pearces at Northampton—I know Mr. Pearce, the auctioneer, to whom I took the goods—I never talked to him about the goods that I know of—we went there, because we were abused in the public streets by Poole and Chapman—we told him that as he was a friend of Mr. Poole's, would he be so good as to ask him why we were abased in the public streets, and we did not know what for—I am quite sure we did not say anything else to him.</p>

I live at Kingsthorpe, Northampton, and am a shoe<lb></lb>maker—I know Chapman: his premises adjoin mine—I remember his making an application to me on the subject of a barn—that was on a Sunday afternoon, the 18th or 19th August, I believe, or somewhere there, abouts—I allowed him to have the barn—he told me he wanted it to put a horse in for a few days—I recollect some goods being put in the barn the same evening—instead of a horse he put some boxes and a hamper—I went into my garden, which is usual with me before I go to bed, and I saw two or three men in the garden—I said, "Halloa!" and Mr. Chapman said, "Hush, hush!"—we had a little conversation about it, and he said that he had taken a quantity of goods of Mr. Poole for a large debt that was owing to him—I made little or no reply to that—the goods remained there for several days; not until the messenger of the Court of Bankruptcy seized them, they were afterwards removed—the barn was in a very dilapidated state, and it rained in in forty places—it was not fit for anything to be in, alive or dead—the goods were taken into a room in my house, which I call a lumber room, with a better roof to it, and they remained there, in the same condition, till they were seized—there was no removal that I know of.</p>

METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When was this conversation? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On Wednesday evening, 15th August—I had been to London, I went on Tuesday and back on Wednesday—I was in Northampton on the 13th, and left on the 14th, and took no further part in the matter at all—I was in Oxford-street when some goods were removed—I did not send them away or help to pack them up, or see them packed—I meant that I took no further part in the matter at Northampton—I was at Northampton on the 13th, at the warehouse—I went to my house in Green-street, Northampton—that is perhaps half a mile from the warehouse—I do not remember exactly to whom I first told this conversation about Ventris—that question was never put to me by Mr. Van Sandau, or at the police-court—I think I remember men<lb></lb>tioning it some two or three weeks after in town—I think I mentioned it in the course of a conversation in the presence of the messenger, Mr. Shepcutt, and yet I never mentioned it to Mr. Van Sandau—I do not remember that I have mentioned it publicly to anybody before to-day—he advised my partner to take 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and to give me 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he would take a 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for his employers, Quilter and Ball—I do not know whether that was to go into the pocket of Messrs. Quilter and Ball: I am only telling you what took place—I do not know that anybody else was present; I think not—I did not mention it for three or four weeks—I have not mentioned it before any court of justice—I cannot say what gave rise to the conversation—I do not recollect any conversation before that—it took place in Mr. Poole's room, in his house—there was nothing particular before it that I noticed—I was not given into custody on this charge, or threatened—not the slightest charge has been made against me for removing these goods from Oxford-street, at the time when I was present and giving directions—I do not remember any complaint of any kind—I did not think to mention this to anybody, though I knew it was an improper suggestion—I understood Mr. Ventris had got possession and had got the keys in his possession, and that it was to be locked up until they sent down their man to take the stock—I did not think the suggestion would be acted upon by my partner—I thought it an im<lb></lb>proper suggestion—I did not mention it to Mr. Newton, because I did not think it would be acted upon, and I did not see Quilter and Ball—I went up to London on the 13th—I knew the goods were removed for a legitimate purpose, to be sold at the latter end of the week for wages—I did not go up to London because the money was procured in another way—I did not go up to get a bill of sale—I went up with my partner to London on the 13th to go to Gray, and to Byas and Co.—he stayed in London till the 15th—the money was raised in Northampton; I had nothing to do with the trans<lb></lb>action—it was raised by my partner in Northampton instead of the goods being sold—my business in going to London was connected with the business of the firm—one object was to go to our merchants to endeavour to get them to make a fresh agreement which they had not agreed to, to endeavour to carry on the business, and if they would not do that, to go to an accountant</p>

               <p>and have the thing brought to a close—I did not go to Quilter and Ball's—my partner did—he took down Ventris from that establishment—among other places in London, I went to Tozer's—he keeps a boot and shoe shop at 40, Gracechurch-street—a large quantity of boots and shoes were sent to tar's from Oxford-street, while I remained in town—I consented to that—there were six or seven baskets of different sizes—I was present when they arrived at Tozer's—I am not aware that they have actually been made part of the present charge against my partner—I was present at the police-court and was examined as to these goods.</p>

SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long have you been in partner<lb></lb>ship? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think it commenced in 1857—I live at Northampton: that is my home—a young man in the shop attended to the Oxford-street branch—I do not know Mr. Cooke, of Walsall—I have heard of him in connexion with the purchase of a portion of my property, but I never saw him in my life—I do not know that there were sold to him on behalf of myself and partner, in July, some 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of goods—I have heard of it before to-day—I heard of it in Northampton—I heard of it from my partner, after I was made bankrupt, not before—I cannot say the day, but it was the day the goods were brought back from Kingsthorpe—I never heard of it till after the bankruptcy—I mean to persist in that answer—I heard of it then from my part<lb></lb>ner—he did not then tell me that Cooke had paid him 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and odd, for boots and shoes, a portion of our stock—he said nothing about what he had paid him—he told me goods that he had sold to Cooke; some hundred pairs of boots and shoes, and calf-skins and wax-ends—the very goods which were brought back from Kingsthorpe, were the goods he told me he had sold to Cooke—as to what became of the money, my partner told me that it was money which he owed his father—the amount was about 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I am "not aware that I have said I do not know the amount—I went up to London with my partner on 13th, and stayed with him till 15th August, and I mean to tell my Lord and the jury that he did not tell me what was the precise state of affairs, or what had become of a portion of the stock—I was in difficulties then, and I knew it—there was a conversation between us as to the position of our firm at that time—I have not the slightest recollection of his telling me then that he had sold these three hundred and odd pounds' worth of goods to Cooke—I will undertake to tell those twelve gentlemen that I do not recollect his telling me that he had sold a portion of the stock, but I will not say either way, because I do not recollect it—the letter was issued on 14th August, I believe, and I was adjudicated bankrupt on 23d, I believe—I have been examined before the Commissioners in bankruptcy—my partner did not tell me, immediately after we stopped, that he had, one mouth previously, sold a portion of the stock to Cooke—he told me that he must sell goods for the money he owed his father, but he did not tell me that he had—that was some two or three weeks before we stopped—what he sold to Cooke was to pay his father—when he told me that he had sold to Cooke, that was not immediately after the letter had been issued to my creditors, and before I had been adjudicated bankrupt—that I swear positively—I know the difference, between stopping and bankruptcy—it was after we had stopped that he told me he had sold the goods to Cooke, and also after we were adjudicated bankrupts, it was when the goods were brought back from kingsthorpe—I am not aware that I said to you just now, "I think not"—I mean to pledge my oath that it was not before we became bankrupts, it was after—I was not told till after the goods came from Kingsthorpe—I do not know when Poole sold them—it was near the warehouse on the morning that the goods were brought</p>

               <p>back from Kingsthorpe, that he told me he had sold goods to the amounts of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Cooke—it was four or five weeks before that that he told me he would sell the goods—he did not tell me he was in negociation to sell—I knew Mr. Chapman—I did not know that he was Mr. Cooke's agent—I do not remember that he told me that he had been negociating with Mr. Cooke, and expected to get an answer from his agent, Mr. Chapman, as to whether he would pay the amount that he required for a portion of the stock—I know that Mr. Cooke has brought an action against the assignees in respect of this very property.</p>

The feeling evinced by Mr. Newton, a creditor for 5,570<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., is so bitter, that bankruptcy most inevitably ensue and that speedily. To-morrow the stock-taking will commence, and a statement of their affairs can be arrived at in a few days: if the profit and loss account be left out, of which please advise me by letter, you or Mr. Poole. From the present appearances of the stock, &amp;c. &amp;c., I should think it would produce from 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., if sold judiciously.

Quilter and Ball's office, and ask Mr. Ventris for some books—I was to tell Ventris that the goods had been seized that were at Kingsthorpe, but they should make it all right, they had got a man coming up from Walsall to claim them—I was to ask for a day-book and a small book—Poole also gave me a piece of paper with something written on it—I went to London—I got into London about a quarter-past 3 in the afternoon—I went direct to Quilter and Ball's, and saw Ventris—I called him outside on to the doorstep, against the street, gave him the piece of paper, and told him I had come for some books—I told him that the goods had been seized at Kingsthorpe, and that a Mr. Chapman was then gone down to Walsall to fetch Mr. Cooke up, as he did not come by the tele<lb></lb>graphic message—Ventris said it was a bad job'—he gave me some books, which I put in to a bag that I bought next door, and then came straight away to Euston-square-station and went to Northampton and to Mr. Dawson's office—I got there about a quarter-past 7, or a quarter to 8 at night—I gave the books to Mr. Poole, who was still there—Mr. Dawson and Mr. Poole's father were present when I gave them to him—no one else—I did not see anything particular done with the books that night—I went to Mr. Dawson's office again the next morning by an appointment of the previous night—when I got there I found Mr. Cooke, Mr. Chapman, and Mr. Dawson there—I do not think there was anybody else there that morning—I did not see the books there then—I never saw them again there—I saw them once when I was in London again—I do not think I saw them afterwards, when any<lb></lb>thing was done.</p>

Poole and Co. as foreman, up to 18th August last—I know Mr. Fisher, traveller for Mr. Cooke, of Walsall—I have seen him very frequently at Poole and Co's ware-house at Northampton, soliciting orders"—I did not say, "I recollect seeing Mr. Cooke himself there on 9th July last, as near as I can remember;" nor, "He was in conversation with Mr. Poole, and I understood, and was afterwards informed, that he had on that day purchased a large quantity of miscellaneous skins;" I did not say this to Mr. Dawson, "on 11th July, I was desired by Mr. Poole to assist in the packing of the stock so purchased.</p>

Parker, of Northampton, for twenty-four years, or near upon that altogether—I left the service through spite of a party—they made some charges against me, but it was through the insinuations of parties in their employ, and through those insinuations I was tried for embezzlement, and convicted—I got six months, and as soon as I was let out, Mr. Parker sent for me, and gave me a rise of wages of 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—that was in June, 1854—I was secretary to a burial society—that must have been in some<lb></lb>thing like 1850—it was at Northampton—I left Northampton in 1851, and went to North America—I did not owe the society anything—I am quite sure of that—the burial society did not say I owed them anything—one society said so, and I paid them—that was the association of "clickers," a term used in our trade—that was not spite—I paid them back, and paid them with interest, after I came back from America.</p>

POLAND</hi> (<hi rend="italic">for same</hi>). <hi rend="italic">I submit first, that a removing, concealing, and embezzling must all three be proved within the jurisdiction, and secondly, that with respect to the trunk sent to London, some act with respect to it on the part of Poole, must be proved after the bankruptcy, and there is no such evidence: even supposing he knew the goods had been concealed before the adjudication, yet if he does no act with regard to them after adjudication, the offence charged is not made out; it may be another offence, viz. that of not discovering his effects, but it is not an embezzling, concealing, or secreting.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi> (<hi rend="italic">for Ventris</hi>). <hi rend="italic">It appears to me the section upon which this indictment is founded, contemplates the property being actually in the possession and under the control of the bankrupt at the time of the adjudication. This property clearly was not so, because it was then in the possession of Ventris; it also implies an active concealment, that is, some act done; and if no such act is proved, it amounts only to a non-discovery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi> (<hi rend="italic">for Chapman</hi>). <hi rend="italic">I submit that as to Chapman there is not a title of evidence. I understand your lordship to rule that whatever acts have been proved, must, to bring home guilt to any of the prisoners, be acts after the adjudication?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICE BLACKBURN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">I think so; unless my present, opinion can be changed by Serjeant Ballantine's argument. The point for you to contend against is this, whether the acts done out of the jurisdiction and before the adjudication, are not evidence of an employment of Ventris to do the act of concealment, which he did after the adjudication and within the jurisdiction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">I would direct the attention of the Court to the words of the statute, from which it is evident that for a person to be guilty of any offence at all, he must himself be clothed with bankruptcy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICE BLACKBURN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">No doubt unless Poole is guilty the others cannot be, but if Poole be a felon, is not Chapman, in aiding and assisting him in that felony, also a felon?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">I think not. I submit that in order to commit any offence here at all, a man must be clothed with bankruptcy. I contend that there is no evidence to go to the Jury of any act done by him after adjudication or within this jurisdiction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICE BLACKBURN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">I think that comes round to the same proposition. Three things must undoubtedly be made out: it must be shewn, in order to fix any of the parties, that the bankrupt is himself guilty of the offence; unless he is guilty, the other two prisoners cannot be assistants to the felony; it must also be shown that he, as well as the other two, is guilty of an offence within this jurisdiction, and then, in order to that, it is necessary to show what I have already stated. But there is evidence, as it strikes me, from which the Jury may conclude that the trunk in question was sent by the three prisoners before</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">the adjudication and out of the Jurisdiction, to London, for the purpose of in there concealed, and if so, and if the Jury think that was done with intent to defraud the creditors, as at present advised, I think that will do; if the acts done before adjudication are intended to be followed up by an act sebsequent to it, and in fad is followed up by it, with a fraudulent intent, that it sufficient to make out the case.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">One important point for the Jury to coun<lb></lb>ter will be, whether the evidence does not show an arrangement between the parties prior to the bankrupty, (followed out by silence and non-disclosure at the time of bankruptcy, that the goods should be disposed of in the manner in which they ultimately were, and a further point would be whether the entries in the bankrupts' books in relation to the alleged sale to Cooke were not fraudulent, the natural consequence of which would be a concealment of the goods from the creditors, and a concealment of a character sufficiently active to meet the objection urged.</hi>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICE BLACKBURN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">I think there is evidence for the Jury. William Collier, shoe manufacturer, James Barwell, furniture dealer, William Sabine, gardener, and William Gardner, builder, all of Northampton, deposed to Chapman's good character; and William Austen, menagerie keeper, 16, Shepherds-walk, deposed to that of Ventris.</hi>

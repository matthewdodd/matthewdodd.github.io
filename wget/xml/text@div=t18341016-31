            . I saw the prisoner searched, and this handkerchief was found on him - it has a particular smell of musk with it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Are you a soap-boiler? A. Yes - we were loading the cart at the time - you first produced an old handkercheif - the gentleman said it was not that - you then showed this, and said it was sold to you by two boys, or thrown to you by two boys.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was passing down Chiswell-street - I saw two boys running along - I suppose they thought they were observed by some one, and they threw down this handkerchief - I put it into my pocket, and turned down Milton-street - the prosecutor came up to me and said, "I am informed you have got my handkerchief" - I took my own out first, and said, "Is this yours?" - he said, "No"- I then took this one out - he said that was his - I said, "If<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183410160030"></xptr>it is, take it, and God bless you with it" - I am a tobacco cutter by trade, but some screws fell from an engine, and I was out of work.(Joseph Walton, a hair-dresser, of Long-alley; and James Porter, a tobacco-cutter, of Great Garden-street, gave the prisoner a good character.)</p>

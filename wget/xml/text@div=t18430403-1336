                  </hi>. I am baker, and live in New-street, Covent-garden; the prisoner has been eleven years in my employ. It was his duty to take out bread, receive money, and to enter the sums he received in this cash-book every evening, and deliver it up to me—here is his cash-book—there is no entry of these sums as received from Gosling and Sharp—he has not ac<lb></lb>counted to me for either of these sums.</p>

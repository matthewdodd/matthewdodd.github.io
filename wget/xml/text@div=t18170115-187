            . I am a watchman, about half past five o'clock in the morning, of the 8th of January; I saw the prisoner go by my box with something on his back; I asked him what it was, he said, it was a bed that he had brought from his lodging, in Brick-lane, and that I might go back with him, if I liked, and that he could tell me what was in it, as a proof that he had not stolen it; he said, he was going to take it to the water-side. as he was going to sea, and must be there by six o'clock; I took him to the watch-house; when he got there, he said, that he was going on board a ship and wanted to go; he said, that his lodgings were in Brick-lane; the officer went to look for them, but could not find them; the prisoner said, he could find them by day-light; we took him to look for them; he would not go up Church-street; nor would he go up Red Lion-street; when we got to the place, he saw his wife and landlady, and went in; his wife was alarmed at his being in custody. When we came to Corbet's-court; he knew it very well; we went into the prosecutor's house, the landlady said, she hoped he had not robbed her; she went up, and missed the things; she came to the watch-house, and claimed them.</p>

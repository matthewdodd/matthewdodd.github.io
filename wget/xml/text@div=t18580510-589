                  </hi>. I am a labouring man, and live in Northumberland Place, Brixton. I had known the deceased from fifteen to seventeen months—Iwas in his company, at the Oxford Arms, on a late day in April—he, and Meaking, and Drummond were there—the deceased was sober—I continued in his company some time—the prisoner then joined, and we remained drink<lb></lb>ing for some time—after Meaking and Drammond were gone, a quarrel arose between the prisoner and the deceased; they began <hi rend="italic">sparring</hi>—I went in, to try to stop it; we then had some more beer—after that came turning out time—the deceased was then the worse for beer; we were all three the worse for it—when we went out, the deceased and the prisoner left my arm, and began <hi rend="italic">sparring</hi>, and the prisoner took and tapped him slightly on the face, with his open hand; it seemed to be a tap, and with his open hand—the deceased fell; he got up again, and rushed in towards the prisoner—he threw off his smock, as if to fight or <hi rend="italic">spar</hi>—I went to pick it up, and I heard a blow struck, and I saw the deceased fall—there was no one near enough to have struck him but the prisoner—he fell heavily on the back of his head, and it bounded twice—he was knocked off the kerb into the road—the prisoner said, "That is the way to lay him out"—I went to the deceased, and saw the blood running out of his nose and mouth—Mr. M'Donald attended him, and he was taken home—up to this time they were quite friendly—I did not see anything in the prisoner's hand.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a brewer's labourer, and live in Park Crescent. On that night, I was passing the Oxford Arms; I saw Mr. Freeman putting some persons out of the house; the prisoner was one, and the deceased was another—they were tipsy, but were friendly—the prisoner appeared to wish to see the deceased man home, and he took him about twenty-five yards—the deceased made an attempt to turn back, and they both fell to the ground; the deceased was uppermost—they got up, and were returning back towards the Oxford Arms, and I saw the prisoner strike the deceased a most violent blow, as they were walking back towards the Oxford Arms—after the blow, the deceased fell, and the prisoner said, "That is the way to lay the b—out"—thedeceased had been trying to get away from him; the prisoner wanted him to go home, and the deceased wanted to go back.</p>

I was in company with Mr. Harding that night, passing by the Oxford Arms; I saw the deceased and the prisoner <hi rend="italic">sparring</hi>—the deceased fell, but whether by a blow or not, I did not notice—he got up again, and got <hi rend="italic">sparring</hi> a little—atlast the prisoner gave him a blow, which caused him to fall on the road very heavily—there was no blow from the deceased man, that I saw—he was picked up, and seemed to have lost the use of his body altogether.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. I was called to see the deceased—he had an extensive wound behind the left ear, and a superficial wound beside—Iexamined him after his death, and found a fracture at the base of the skull—what I saw was likely to be the effect of the fall, not the blow—the bruise behind the ear might have been a blow with the fist—there was considerable effusion of blood in the brain; the brain was congested—the being drunk and having the blow might cause the congestion—the bruise at the back of the ear was the cause of death.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was what he brought wrapped up in paper? A. Yes - I had confidence in him; I opened the paper on the 17th of January - I did not try it by any test; he is a <rs id="t18290219-183-deflabel1047" type="occupation">working silversmith</rs>

               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Had you ever had those other pieces that he redeemed examined by an assayer? A. No.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long have you been a pawnbroker? A. Twenty years - it is part of my business to know silver from metal; I opened the papers - there was no stamp on the metal to indicate that it was silver; I could have discovered it in the first instance - I was deceived in it; he stated it was silver.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Is it not the practice of your trade to keep aquafortis? A. Yes, and I have tried some pieces, but pewter will have the appearance of silver when tried with it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 15, Great Eastern Street, Shore<lb></lb>ditch, and am clerk to the National Penny Bank, at No. 12—I issued this bank book to a boy named Arthur Turner, not the prisoner, on 13th Nov., 1879—the account was opened with 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—the page on which that was entered is now torn out, but it remains on the blotting paper—on the next page there are three entries: of 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on July 13, 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on August 13, and 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on September 3rd—those dates are before the book was in existence—I find from our books that no deposits were made after the 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the name of Turner—the 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. has not been withdrawn.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> If the depositor is an adult we take his signature, if a boy, we take his name and address—I have got his signature; he gave his age as 17—a man of 65 would not be likely to impose upon me by saying that he was 17—anybody not connected with the bank would be deceived by these entries—Arthur Turner never made any application for the money, if he had we should not have honoured it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Brown, of 6, Haydon Square hotel-keeper—the prisoner lived there four months, and left on 9th May—on one occasion he showed me his bank-book and asked me to lend him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. till next day, when he would get game money from the bank—I refused.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not look inside the book, but the book had the same writing outside—you said that you were going to get a good sum of money to-morrow—I never knew you guilty of any dishonest action while you were in the house.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>). My barman is Henry Munn—this is a paper which I saw the prisoner write: "London, Jan. 25, 1879. Penny National Bank, Shoreditch.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I found the book six months ago in a taproom in Shoreditch, and thought it might be a bogus or a decoy, or that the owner might advertise it I never made use of it, and never told any one that I had 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the bank. I did not show it to Mrs. Brown to induce her to lend me money, but I may have had it in my hand at the time. I said "Lend me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>." She said "How will you pay it? I said "When I come from the bank to-morrow." The bank has lost nothing, but I have lost my time and reputation, and have suffered two months' imprisonment The barman entered into a conspiracy to sell me a worthless watch, and I gave him a worthless paper.</p>

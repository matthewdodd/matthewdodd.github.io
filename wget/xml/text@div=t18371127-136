I am a servant, and live in Market-street, Haymarket On the 13th of November, between nine and ten o'clock in the morning, the male prisoner came to me, and said he and his wife had been attend<lb></lb>ing a person who had been ill for some time, and on that day he was much worse, and from the kindness he had received from him and his wife dur<lb></lb>ing his illness, he had made over 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to each of them, and he would be very much obliged to me if I would come up to his lodging and indorse the notes, as the deceased was too ill to do it, and he could not do it him<lb></lb>self—I promised to come, and he went away—about an hour after that I went to his lodging, No. 7, Carpenter-street—I went to the kitchen, and saw both the prisoners there—I afterwards went up stairs with them, at their request, and saw a man in bed—I cannot say whether he appeared in a bad state—John Gould placed a chair by a table, some distance from the bed—Mrs. Gould brought some Bank-notes rolled up—John Gould asked me to indorse on the back of one of them, "John Williams, 24, Welbeck-street, Cavendish-square"—I did so, and gave them back to Mr. Gould, and left the room—soon after that I got into a coach with the two prisoners, and ultimately went to the Bank of England—the male prisoner gave me a £100 note and two £50 notes, and at his request I ac<lb></lb>companied Mrs. Gould into the Bank to get them cashed, leaving him in the coach—I got 200 sovereigns for them, and we all drove back again to the corner of Mount-street—the male prisoner then left me to go to his master's, and I accompanied the wife to Carpenter-street—she had not the key of the door of her room, and she ran to the prisoner's master for it, and the male prisoner came back with it—I counted over the 200 sovereigns to him, and saw him put them into a bag by him—this is the bag, to the best of my belief—(<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>)—after coming from the Bank, he told me he had three £10 notes, but he could cash them at any time.</p>

               <p>I lost a pair of leather shoes, I suppose they might be taken from my cutting-board, but I did not see them taken, a young man came into the shop first for a pair of shoes, and in a few minutes afterward the prisoner came in and asked for a pair of false straps, said he was in a hurry, so I left off serving the other young man, and cut his straps, and went backwards to give them to my wife to sew, and then I went to look for some more shoes to fit the other young man, as soon as he had the straps he went out, I had no shoes to fit the other young man, so I measured him for a pair and he promised to come for them on Saturday night. This was Wednesday. As soon as this young man with the straps had gone out of my shop, which was four or five minutes before the other. There was the constable and patrole in the street. As soon as I had measured the young man for the shoes, he gave me his address and went out directly. The constable took up this young man, and the patrole the other, and they took them into a public-house, and they came over to me to know if I could swear to these shoes, I said I could. I found the prisoner and the other in the public-house; immediately in less than three minutes they were both of them in hold. The shoes were marked with the name of Evans, by my Clicker,

               <p>I am a constable, on Wednesday the 28th of last month, between the hours of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150041"></xptr>six and seven in the evening I was going up Fenchurch-street, I observed the prisoner at the bar in company with another young man looking into a milliner's shop window, I had a suspicion of them, and I watched them, and I saw them look into several shops, and I followed them, as there was two of them I thought it best to fetch the patrole. The patrole was on duty in Lombard-street, I went to the patrole, and told him there were two suspicious chaps about, and I will watch them: If they cannot give a good account of themselves, I will take them before the Lord Mayor. I followed them till they came to Mr. Jupp's shop, and the prisoner at the bar, and the other crossed over the way and stood at the corner of a passage by Mr. Hatches, the pork-shop, when a coach was going past I lost sight of him that was outside, I crossed over the way, and I saw the other with the prisoner in the shop as I supposed but I could not swear it was the same; therefore he was discharged. When the prisoner came out I seized him, and took him into the City Arms, and there I searched him, and found in each of his coat pockets one of these shoes, I was going to take him off from the seat where he sat, he dropped these picklock keys.</p>
               <p>(The shoes produced and deposed to.)</p>

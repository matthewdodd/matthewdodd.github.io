The prisoner came on the 6th of July, and took our lodgings - she ordered a loin of lamb, peas and potatoes, a pint of wine and some strawberries, for her dinner; she afterwards told me to get her some tea and sugar - she said her husband was a solicitor, and her brother a young officer, and they were coming from Marlborough the next morning, when her husband would pay me. The tea and sugar were laid on the table after dinner, and while she was taking her fruit and wine she wrote a note to me to borrow a sovereign, to discharge her bill at the hotel where she had been staying a few days, and, as it did not rain much, she set off to walk there - but as she was going Mr. Williams followed her and brought her back. She had asked me to lend her a napkin, about ten minutes before she left - I was to find her in linen, but not of that description - it was lent for her private use.</p>

The prisoner came to my house about nine o'clock one night, and asked me to lend her 10 d., to pay for a letter - I rather hesitated to do so, as she was a stranger; she said she had all the way to go to Surry-street, and the letter lay in Oxford-street, and if I doubted her paying me she would leave me this napkin as security, and call any time I would appoint - I lent her 1 s. and appointed five o'clock the next day, but she came no more.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cheese monger, at No. 45, Fetter-lane. On 5th Jan. the prisoner came to me and said, "Are you in want of paper?" I said, "What have you?"—he said common office paper, drafts, briefs, reports, and books; he had got a devil of a lot, and would I buy it all—in the course of two or three hours he brought me 20 lbs. of paper, for which I paid him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; he then brought 32 lbs. more of rather a rougher sort, and I paid him 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for that—I gave it to Davey the policeman.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pork butcher, in Fetter-lane. On 4th Jan., the prisoner came and asked my wife if she was in want of paper—I came out and asked him what quantity it was; he said about 28 lbs.—I asked what he wanted a pound; he said he was in the habit of having 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., a pound, but would take 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; it was pretty clean—I asked what it consisted of he said old briefs and letters—the next morning, about 9 o'clock, he brought the paper in a bag, I weighed it and gave him 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it—I gave it to Davey.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cheesmonger, at Hammersmith.

I said I did not know whether he would or not, I had orders to apprehend him—he then said to me, "What a <hi rend="italic">blasted</hi> fool I was to take the papers, but Mr. Smith told me that if I returned his papers he would not prosecute me"—I said, "But you have not done that, you have not been nigh the chambers since"—he then asked me whether I was going to take him to the police station, and whether I had any objection to go to Mr. Smith's chambers first; I said I had none, and I took him to Mr. Smith's, and then to the Guildhall police station, and afterwards to Newgate—I got this office seal with "The Brighton and Dover Railway" on it, from the prisoner's person.</p>

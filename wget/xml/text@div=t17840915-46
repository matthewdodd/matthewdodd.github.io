             sworn.</p>
               <p>I was binding hay on Mr. Harrison's premises; I saw the prisoner Jones go to Mr. Meecham's garden hedge, and look over it, between twelve and one at noon; I never saw him before; then I saw him come out of the garden, and go back to prisoner King, who was in one part of the field, and bring a table cloth in his hand; King got up immediately, and they both went over the fence together into the next field.</p>
               <p>Court. How near was King to the garden when Jones went in or came out of it? - He was about one hundred and fifty yards off, he was within sight of him: I followed the prisoners, and about ten yards before I got up to them Jones dropped the table cloth, which I picked up; I took notice then of the marks, I know it again now: King dropped down in a ditch, pretending to case himself, and Jones ran away.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Jones. I know nothing of King, I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>The prisoner King called four witnesses who gave him a very good character.</p>
               <p>Court to King. What was you doing in the fields? - I was going to Hampstead, a man owed me twenty pence for some tatoes, and I saw this boy running, and I turned back, I thought the man was going to lick him for being in the fields.</p>
               <p>Court to Jones. What age are you? - I am fifteen, my friends cannot come.</p>

I keep the Constitution public-house, in Drury-lane—a little after 7, on the evening of 26th May, I left my house and went into Tottenham-court-road—I had a pair of gold spectacles round my neck with a guard, and in my pocket—as I was going along Great Earl-street, I was suddenly tripped up, and fell down on my face, and hurt myself considerably—I was so stunned and insensible from loss of blood that I did not recover myself for some time; when I came to myself, the spectacles and guard were gone—they had pulled it over my head.</p>

I am a widow, living at 23, Great Earl-street—on the evening of 26th May, I was standing at my door, and saw the prosecutor bleeding very much from the nose—I advised him to be taken to the doctor's—when I got my hand on his shoulder, a young man, whose face I did not see, came up and said, "This is the way to the doctor's"—several came up then together, pushed him across the road, and tripped him up—I went across and said, "You ought to be ashamed of yourselves treating a gentleman in that manner; you are robbing of him"—I saw them lean over him, and take, as I thought, his watch from him; but it was his gold spectacles—Hoare is the one that received the spectacles and ran away; the other two men were leaning over him when I said they were robbing him and they all and I mentioned what I had seen.</p>

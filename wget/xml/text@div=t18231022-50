On Tuesday, the 5th of October, I went out after nine o'clock, and left my watch hanging up on the wall; it had two cases, and a ribbon attached to it.

            . My mother keeps the house. I went up, about eleven o'clock in the morning, to make Riley's bed - he had given me the key. I unlocked the door, but did not go in, as I was called down, and left it open; I went up again about half-past three o'clock in the afternoon. I went into Brown's room, which is next to the prosecutor's, and saw the prisoner go into Riley's room - he came out immediately, and said he had been for a knife, which he had left behind him; I went in afterwards to make the bed, and missed the watch from the wall.</p>

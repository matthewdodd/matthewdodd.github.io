               <p>Cross-examined by mr. Alley. Q. Pray where is the lady that kept the house? - A.She is at home, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q.it was the little girl's business to go into your chamber to make your bed? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Persons who keep loding houses, I believe, generally keep two keys, one for the proprietor of the house, where one servant is kept, and one generally for the lodgers, therefore that would not have been an extraodinary thing? - A. It would have been extraordinary if they had done it before I had given up my key, which was always my custom; it is known in the house that I am extremely tenacious of any body entering the chamber without my consent; it was understood in the house, that there was no other key but my own.</p>
               <p>Q.When had you seen the money last? - A. At twelve o'clock the night before; I confess, I did not suspect the girl.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Had you any suspicion of the mistress? - A. Yes, I had. From the general good conduct of the girl, I did not suspect her; though, from what turned out afterwards, I was convinced the mistress knew nothing of it, and therefore I did not apprehend her.</p>
               <p>JOHN TMOLINS sworn. - I am a messenger: I was called in on the 10th, by Mr. Jedder, to take notice of the marks on the money; I saw him mark four seven-shilling pieces. a half-crown, ten shillings, and two sixpences; I was present again the next morning, when the prisoner delivered up two shillings and a seven-shilling piece; she was fitting in a chair; I knew it to be the same money that I had seen the day before.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. This is the same money that I delivered to the constable, and part of the same money that I marked the day before.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Was the mistress in your room at the time the girl was? - A. No; I saw the mistress, very distinctly, pass up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that a skeleton key? - A. No, it is not; I think she told me, it was a key of one of the apartments below stairs.</p>
               <p>Tomlins. This is the same money that Mr. Jedder marked in my presence.</p>
               <p>the prisoner did not say any thing in her defence.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I think her an object of mercy for her industry, I never had reason to suspect her before, she is a very industrious girl.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q.Why did not you bring the mistress here? - A.Because I had not a good opinion of her, and I thought her evidence upon such a subject might be a bad one.</p>

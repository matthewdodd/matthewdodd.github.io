I missed some toilenette on Monday, which I had seen safe on Saturday the 10th of March; the prisoner was afterwards apprehended; I told her she was the last person who should have robbed me; she said she did take it - McGrath shewed me a pawnbroker's shop kept by Howse, where I found it.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

            . I live in Size-yard, Whitechapel. The prisoner called for me to go to the other end of the town; I was not ready - she told me to come on to Aldgate-church - she came there to me and then left me, and went down the Minories, and came with a bundle, which she said was a black silk gown - she went on to a pawnbroker's and told me to wait; I looked in at the window and saw the toilenet there - she then came out and said she could not get enough for it - she pawned it at the corner of a coach yard in St. Giles' - she came out and said, thank God she was rid of her black silk gown.</p>

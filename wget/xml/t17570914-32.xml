            . On the 9th of August I came by the Cambridge waggon to the Bell at Edmonton, it was about eight at night when I got there. I was going to Southgate, and proposed to walk on foot from thence. The waggoner directed me which way<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175709140037"></xptr> to go. The prisoner at the bar came to me as I was getting out of the waggon, and hearing me say where I was to walk, ask'd me if he should carry my bundle for me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him ?</p>
               <p>A. Griffiths. I never saw him in my life before. I told him no. I did not want him nor any body she to carry it. I was very able to carry it myself the little way I had to go. He said no more but went his way; and met me <placeName id="t17570914-32-crimeloc220">a little beyond Wyre Hall</placeName>

               <p>Q. How far is that from Edmonton ?</p>
               <p>A. Griffiths. It is about a mile; there he insisted upon carrying my bundle, I said he should not; he said he would, and took it away by violence. I was much affrighted. He swore he would lie with me, I said he should not. Then he said d - n you, you eternal bitch, what was man and woman made for, but to make use of one another, and I'll make use of you, or I'll lip you from shoulder to flank. He wanted me to go over a field out of the path, and I would not; he threw me over a gate twice, then he drag'd me about, and threw me into a ditch. I was bruised all over my stomach. legs and thighs, he tore my handkerchief and things, and said d - n you I'll have my ends of you, and if you don't let me the next time I meet you, I'll murder you by G - d, and made many attempts to lie with me.</p>
               <p>Q. What was in the bundle?</p>
               <p>A. Griffiths. It was a stuff gown, not made up, for my next door neighbour. When I came up to the bridge at the New river. I call'd out murder as loud as I could; he said d - n you, you bitch, if you speak a word I'll throw you into the river. Then I durst not speak for my life, but sob'd much. Then he said if you sob or offer to cry, you shall go into the river. Then I durst not look one way nor another. I got an opportunity and ran from him. There was a butcher came out hearing me call murder. I said for God Almighty's sake come here, for I am rob'd, and expect to be murdered. He ran away up a lane, the people took me into a house, where I staid all night, and in the morning I sent word to my mistress what had befallen me.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is your mistress?</p>
               <p>A. Griffiths. I am <rs id="t17570914-32-viclabel221" type="occupation">servant</rs>

               <p>Q. Did you meet nobody on the road?</p>
               <p>A. Griffiths. I met a man and a woman as the prisoner was coming after me. I ask'd what that man was that followed me. The woman said to the man, do you think this young woman can trust herself with that man; the man said yes, he is a very honest man; they were turning to go towards Winchmore Hill. My mistress sent a person to Winchmore Hill to inquire for these people, by which means we found out the prisoner, as I perceived they knew him. I described him so plain, that the constable

            , who is not here. He delivered him into my custody. I examined the woman what she had to say against him, and to the best of my knowledge she said the same as now. I asked the prisoner how he came to do so. He said he had got the stuff, and it was at his house; that as they were going over the fields, after he had taken the handkerchief from her to carry, he lost it out of the handkerchief, and he went that way as he came back and found it. I took him before Mr. Colebrook, who examined him, and the young woman charged him in the same manner there as now. The prisoner was very insolent, and said he had as lief go to gaol as to go home, for he had done nothing that he was ashamed of. He was ask'd if he had any body to speak in his behalf, and he said he wanted nobody. He was committed to New Prison.</p>
               <p>William Green. I saw the prisoner along with the prosecutrix, at a place call'd Tanner's-End, going to Wyre-Hall. She ask'd me if I knew that man before he came up to her. I told her I did, and he had work'd with me many a day.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was with you?</p>
               <p>Green. My wife was. I told her I thought she might go home very safe with him, and I wish'd her a good night.</p>

               <p>Q. to prosecutrix. Is this the man you mention'd that met you?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. This is the man, and his wife was with him; he told me he knew the prisoner, and he thought I might go home with him very safe.</p>

               <p>S. Man. There were bruised places on her arms and thighs as broad as my hand; she told me of it the day she came home, but did not then say what the man's name was.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did she say she had been used thus ?</p>
               <p>S. Man. Between the Bell at Edmonton and Southgate.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I was at the Bell corner, when the woman got out of the waggon; she came up to me, and asked me if that was the way to Southgate. I said I would shew her the way, and she said she should be obliged to me. She gave me the bundle to carry. I overtook that man and his wife. We walked together as contented as any two in England, till we came to Wyre Hall, where I open'd a place for her to go through. She said she would not go that way, and after she had gone three parts up the field she came back again. Then we went on to Mr. Bellows's, just beyond which we met a man driving a calf along. When we came to the New-River there was a butcher. She took hold of my arm, and said she would not have me go any farther. I kissed her and parted, and she immediately said I had rob'd her. I said to her stay, if I have lost any thing I'll go and see for it, and ran back. She came hollowing after me. This bundle was drop'd where I open'd the gate twice for her. I took it to my house, and about one o'clock the next day she and two men came. I went with them to the sign of the Bell, where they open'd the door and said, do you know that young woman. I said I don't know, but if it is she that I walk'd with, I have a bundle of her's that I lost last night. They would not let me fetch it, but took me into custody. This past on till the Sunday se'n night, and then they took me up with a fresh warrant.</p>
               <p>Q. to Constable. How long after this charge of the robbery was it that the man was taken up ?</p>
               <p>Constable. We took him up the next day after the robbery, and carried him before justice Tashmaker. He examined the woman, and heard a little of what she had to say, but he made slight of it, and bid the prisoner give the woman her stuff again; and go home about his business. About nine or ten days after came a warrant from Mr. Colebrook to take the prisoner up.</p>
               <p>Q. How came this about?</p>
               <p>Constable. I gave the prosecutrix her stuff upon Mr. Tashmaker's order. She returned me the stuff again to keep till it was try'd, and said she would have a warrant from justice Colebrook.</p>

               <p>Q. How long was this after you had been to justice Tashmaker ?</p>
               <p>Constable. About two or three days after; she said justice Colebrook was in London, and when he came home she would go to him.</p>
               <p>Q. to Green. How long have you known the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Green. I have known him about twenty years.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his general character?</p>
               <p>Green. I never knew any harm of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he reckon'd an industrious man?</p>
               <p>Green. He was not reckon'd an idle fellow.</p>
               <p>Q. What then?</p>
               <p>Green. A drunken fellow.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he the character of an honest or a loose man?</p>
               <p>Green. He had not a good character; but I never knew any harm of him.</p>

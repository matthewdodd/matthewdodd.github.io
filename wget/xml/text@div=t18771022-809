                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's daughter—my father's name is Christopher Columbell—we live at Bursidge Grove, Plumstead—on Saturday, 6th Oct., I went out in the morning with my little brother Tommy, leaving my brother and the baby in the house—before I went out I fetched a quartern of gin for my mother, it came to sixpence—it was about nine o'clock—I afterwards fetched three half-pints of beer for her—there was no one else in the house—I did not see her drink it—I went out to play with my brother—we came back about twelve—I found my mother sitting there with the baby in her arms—the baby was a month old—mother cooked some fish for dinner—she sent me out for a pint of beer—I did not see her drink it—father was not at home—after dinner I went out again to play, leaving my mother and the baby in the room—I returned about four or half-past—mother was then lying on the bed, and the baby beside her, and father was there sitting on a chair—he went out soon after—some time after I noticed that the baby's legs and feet looked very white—I felt them and they were cold—my mother was asleep—I tried to waken her and could not—I called Mrs. Welsh, the landlady—she came and looked at the baby and I went and fetched father.</p>

                  </hi>. The prisoner and her husband lodged in my house—on the afternoon in question the little-girl called me—I went with her up to the prisoner's room, and found her lying on the bed asleep—I con<lb></lb>sidered her very much intoxicated—she had her hand on the child's head and chest as if cuddling it—I felt the child and found that it was dead—I did not wake the prisoner till her husband came—I had seen her about mine in the morning—she was then about half drunk—she was a very good woman when sober, but very violent when in drink—she had been drinking the night before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon at Woolwich—on 6th Oct., about twenty minutes to sis, I met the prisoner's husband and went with him to his lodging—I found the prisoner lying on the bed—the baby was in the centre of the bed, and the prisoner was lying completely over it, except the two feet and one leg—I pulled her off the bed and took up the child and examined it—it was dead—I afterwards made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—it was a fine, well-nourished child—the death was caused entirely by suffocation—the prisoner was helplessly intoxicated.</p>

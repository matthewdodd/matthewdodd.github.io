I live at 125, Drury Lane, with my parents—my mother keeps a coffee-house there—the prisoner stopped there about four days—on 13th February he gave me this cheque, and told me to receive some cash at Sir John Kirtland's—I took it there, and they detained it—I went back and saw the prisoner, and he called me a little fool for leaving his cheque—he then gave me a letter to take there—I took it, and the detective Palmer came back with me to my mother's—I saw the prisoner write both the cheque and the letter.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a detective sergeant—on 15th February I had these papers put into my hands by Sir John Kirtland—I went to 125, Drury Lane, about four o'clock in the afternoon, with the witness Grant—I there saw the prisoner, lying on a couch, very much under the influence of drink—I told him the charge—he said if I went to Dr. Jordan's, in Maddox Street, Hanover Square, he would put it all right—I said I should not go there, as I knew who Dr. Jordan was—next morning I took him to Bow Street, where he was detained all night—he said he did not understand the charge against him—I told him the charge again—he then said, "I don't know Sir John Kirtland, neither is my name Carlton or Bligh"—he had said on the previous day that he did know Sir John Kirtland, having been in the Turkish contingent—he said, "I sent the cheque, but I thought it would be returned, 'No account,' I did not expect any money to come back"—he said he was not aware that he was doing wrong when he wrote it—I believe his words were, "I was not aware it was such a serious charge (<hi rend="italic">The cheque was for</hi> 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">dated 12th February, and signed Charlton S. C. Bligh, M.B.C</hi>)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. In writing that cheque it was not my intention to defraud Sir John Kirtland: I had an idea that it would be returned. It was done with the object of deceiving the people who had emptied my pockets very freely, in a very short time. In the course of three days I spent about 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with them. I thought if a person's name was put correctly it was not a forgery.</p>

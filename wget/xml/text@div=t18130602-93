            , one of my journeymen, to go up stairs and see that there was a parcel of silk concealed in a very curious situation. I went up stairs, and he took a parcel of silk out of a hopper of a mill. I saw him. That was while the men were at breakfast. I took the silk out of the handkerchief, and challenged ever one of the men with it when they returned, and asked who were the owners of the handkerchief. Every one denied it. I then sent for an officer. I was determined to find out the thief. Before the officer came, I suppose an hour, the prisoner acknowledged he was the thief that had taken the silk, and when the officer came I delivered it over to him, and he then again before the officer, in my presence, confessed that he had taken the silk.</p>
               <p>Q. What induced him to confess - A. I said there was a thief on the premises; I was determined to find it out. After he knew I sent for an officer he came to me and trembled, and said, sir, I am the thief. He had been with me ten years, and till the time he confessed I had no reason to suppose he was a thief.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Saturday the 29th of May, I and Bishop were sent for to go to Mr. Meadows. When I arrived there this silk was on the table. I desired the prisoner might be sent for. He came. I said, young man, I have heard what your master has said, do not say any thing to me, I shall be obliged to report it. He said, sir, I am the thief; I took three pounds on the Saturday, and sold it to a Jew for three pounds. I have looked for the Jew; I have not been able to find him out. I believe he has been trepanned by the Jew to do it. I never saw a more artless thief than he is.</p>

                  </hi>. I am warehouseman to John Falshaw Pawson and ano<lb></lb>ther, warehousemen, in St. Paul's-churchyard. At one o'clock in the after<lb></lb>noon of the 21st of July I had information, and went to a ledge in the back cellar—I gave information to my employer—I saw the prisoner go down two or three times during a half hour—I followed him into the street when he went out to the railroad with a parcel—I went to the Eastern Counties Rail<lb></lb>way station, and appeared as though I had made a mistake about the direction of the parcel—the prisoner and I went on the way home, till we got to Fins<lb></lb>bury-pavement, and there I asked what he had got in his pocket—he said some pieces of rope and one or two other things—I asked him to take out what he had got in his pocket—he took out his handkerchief and some lunch, and said that was all—I put my hand into his left-hand pocket, and took out a dozen socks—I gave them to Mr. Stanley—I then told the prisoner to go on to St. Paul's-churchyard, and there I gave him to the policeman—he first said he had bought the socks, and then that he had found them in the sweepings of the dust.</p>

On the 21st of July I was in the packing-room, which is on the same floor as the washing-room, but there is a partition between the two—the prisoner was in the pack<lb></lb>ing-room—I desired him to take a box to the Eastern Counties Railway—he said he wanted to go into the washing-room—he went, came back, then he took the box, and went out—I was directed to go with Borras after the pri<lb></lb>soner—I spoke to him, and walked away home with him—I asked, on the way, what he had in his coat pocket, which bulged out so much—I said, "You must have a deal of rope there more than you want"—he then pulled out his handkerchief and his lunch—he went on to the Pavement—he was asked again, and pulled out the same things—Borras pulled out the socks—I went to his lodgings, in Memel-street—we found there two wrappers and a bag—they belonged to the prosecutor—the porters are not allowed to take away bags or wrappers under any pretence—on a wet night they might put one round them.</p>

            . I am in the employ of John Tilbury, Son, and Clark. On the 13th of February I put a gig out to wash, which had this cushion in it; and as we were going to put the horses in one of the cushions was gone - my fellow servant and I had a few words about it. Mr. Clark said there must he some thieves about; I went afterwards and looked about, and saw the prisoner coming up the mews - I asked him if he had seen a cushion - he said"No Harry, do you think I should do such a thing?" I said 'Let me look into your bag for satisfaction;" he untied the bag, and said "You see it is not here;" I said"Let me feel in the bag;" I did so, and there I found it all cut to pieces.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I went down and had the sweepings of the shop, which I do every Monday - I saw this cushion torn to pieces in the corner, and took it up.</p>

               <p>JURY to HENRY GATES. Q. Were you in the habit of allowing this man to take rubbish away? A. Yes; he came every Monday morning, and had the bits of iron and leather, and what was lying about.</p>

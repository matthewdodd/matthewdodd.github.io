I had a truck which I lost on or about the 1st of January, from my door, where my boy had just left it. On the 9th of July I saw it in the hands of a butcher, named George Barnett. I went and asked him where he had got it - he said of a person in the City-road.</p>

            . I am a broker. I sold this truck to Mr. Barnett - I bought it of the prisoner near the beginning of the year - he brought it to my door while I was out - he then offered it to a number of persons, and they brought him to me; thinking he had not got it fairly, we took him to the Magistrate, who committed him - but they could not find an owner; after he had been in custody for a fortnight, he came to me again, and I bought it of him - it was not long after the beginning of the year; I bought it for 11 s. and sold it for 30 s.</p>

            . I am a broker. About five or six months ago, the prisoner offered to sell me two or three trucks; I knew Barnett had bought some trucks of him, and I said to Mr. Gold "We may get into trouble, for I don't think he gets them honestly." I did not buy the first he brought, but he brought one a week or two ago - I then went to my next door neighbour, and we followed him, and when he got to Mitchell-street, I saw him offering<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150035"></xptr>it to another broker; I took hold of it and said "You are in a great hurry to sell this - whose is it?" he said it was his own; I then said "Did you not sell a truck to Mr. Gold?" I then took him to Mr. Gold, and said "Is this the man?" he said "He is;" I then asked the prisoner where he lived; he said in Great or Little Cutler's-street; - we went there and found it was so. Gold fetched an officer.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, stating, that he had bought the truck in Smithfield.</p>

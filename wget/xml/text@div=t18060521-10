             sworn. I repaired the slaughterhouse last August, there was a long gutter, the end was cut of, we were obliged to put a piece of lead about two foot long, to convey the water to the gutter, we put it under and beat it down.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it would not have come away without any body had moved it. - A. No, I fitted the lead to the place, it fitted exactly; I believe it is the same piece of lead that I put on.</p>

             sworn. On Sunday, the 20th of April, as I was crying the hour of twelve o'clock, I saw the prisoner sitting down, I asked him what he was about, he said he was easing himself; I put up my lanthorn, and missed the spout, and I saw a lamp lighter's ladder up against the slaughter house, I desired him to get up, I saw the spout under him, he had no shoes on; there was no other person near, I took him to the watchhouse without his shoes, I returned for the ladder, and found the shoes under the steps of the ladder.</p>
               <p>Q.(to prosecutor) You have no doubt of that lead being yours. - A. I have not the least doubt in the world.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was along with a few relations, it was late before I came home, I went up stairs and pulled my shoes off; I was taken so bad with a pain in my bowels, I came down to ease myself, I saw a man run away; before I could get my breeches unbuttoned the watchman came and took me to the watchhouse.</p>

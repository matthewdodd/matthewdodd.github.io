When I came back again, the two prisoners came round me, they asked me to go with them into a public-house. I went with them both, one had hold of one of my arms; the other prisoner the other arm. I was in the public-house with them half an hour, and when we came out it was dark, about half past six, and when I had walked a little way I missed my pocket-book and my watch. I know I had my pocket-book in my pocket at the public-house; my watch was in a handkerchief. I laid it on the table at the public-house. When I missed my property. I sang out, I was robbed, and then they ran away. I am sure they are the women, one was of one side of me, and the other on the other side. I lost my pocket-book in the street; my watch, I cannot say, I might have left that in the public house; the pocket-book I never had out of my pocket. I was not quite sober.</p>

I went and found the mother; searched her, and found nothing upon her, and I went and apprehended Kirk. I told her I had come for the man's watch. She said, she could say nothing about it until she saw her mother. I told her I must have the notes, pocket-book, and watch. She went and took the pocket-book, notes, and watch; they were wrapped up altogether. I found fourteen 1 l. notes, and a 2 l. note. She said, she found it under the table, in the public-house, wrapped up as it was.</p>

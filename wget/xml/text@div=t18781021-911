My husband died in 1876—I was staying in West Ham Union, and met the prisoner there—he asked me to go and live with him about four months before my husband died, and after my husband died he asked me to marry him—he said that he was single, but had lived with a woman ten years, but she was dead—I was married to him in 1876, and he was described as a bachelor—he lived with me till 20th June last, and I have had a child by him—he never ill-used me—I earned my own living—he gave me nothing—I was confined on 13th May this year—he gave me no money, and when I came home he said, "Why did not you stop another week I"—on 2nd August, in consequence of what I heard, I went to 94, Tilbury Bead, Piaistow, and saw Agnes Warden, who showed me her marriage <hi rend="italic">lines</hi>, and while I was at the house the prisoner came there; Agnes Wagden went down and opened the door to him, and he very nearly sunk to the ground, and asked us to have mercy on him, and offered his wife 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a week not to lockhim up, and me 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I said that I would not give the 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he did not say who Agnes Wagden was—I gave him in custody.</p>

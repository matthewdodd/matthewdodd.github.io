               <p>I live in Cartwright-street, on the other side of Tower hill: the prisoner Powell came to me on Friday the eleventh of this month, at about four in the afternoon, and asked me if my wife would iron a few things for him; I said, no, because I was busy, and wanted her to help me; I am a taylor; he persuaded me to let her do them; he said she would get more at it than at my work; I thought it might come to six-pence or eight-pence more, and consented; he said they were at his house; I bid him fetch them, and she should do them; at dark I went down to get a candle, and saw a bundle of things lying, and asked my wife if they were the things, I saw they were things of great value, and being wet, I suspected they were not his; I told my wife she should not touch them; he came about nine o'clock; I was then going out to look in the paper to see if they were advertised; I told him he could not have them the next night, but if he would call in the morning, he might hear about them; he came, and I told him he should not have them till I had seen the papers that day, for that I suspected they were stolen; he said, he did not care, for they were none of his: I went to the public house, in about an hour the paper came in, and I saw the things advertised at full length; I desired the landlord when Powell came to stop him; for I had the things in my possession.</p>

               <p>Court. What sort of bags were they? - Paper bags.</p>
               <p>What do you know them by? - Some of them were a particular sort, cut for the purpose; I am sure as to the paper.</p>
               <p>Court. These sugar bags were made of the same paper with yours? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. The prisoner I believe has been in your service a long time? - Eleven years and upwards.</p>
               <p>During which time I believe he behaved himself well in your service? - Yes.</p>
               <p>So well I believe that you gave him something additional for his assiduity and good behaviour? - I did.</p>
               <p>You cannot speak of his character before he lived with you? - I had a very high character of him, from Mr. Mables, in Smithfield, I thought him a very honest man till now, I always thought him such, I was too partial.</p>
               <p>The tea you cannot identify, that is impossible, the sugar bags are common sugar bags, such as other grocers have, it is not peculiar paper that nobody could have but you? - I do not know that; the person that made these bags has made them a number of years, the paper the bags were made of, is not usually made into sugar bags.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was it a kind of paper that nobody else could have but you? - I bought the whole that was made by the maker at that time, I am positive to the paper.</p>
               <p>Court. What was there particular in this paper, you do rot mean to say that this was made by any particular direction of yours, therefore the same man that made this paper, made other paper of the same kind, this paper was not made on purpose for you? - No, but I happened to apply it for a different purpose to which it was usually applied.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I went to Mr. Carr's to search this man's room and boxes, I waited some little time before the man came in, and I said, William, your master informs me that there is a suspicion that you have behaved dishonestly, he said, he was very sorry, he did not know that he did any such thing; now says I, you have an opportunity of convincing your master, if you will do what I desire you to do; there is a suspicion that some things are secreted in your boxes, will you immediately deliver up the keys, the man took out the keys with some little reluctance, and gave them to his master, we went into the room; we were obliged to cross the kitchen, and Mr. Carr went with a candle before us, in order to go up stairs; the prisoner turned short about, and seemed disposed to make down stairs, and out of a back door, I put my hand on his breast, and said follow your master, he did so; then his master opened one or two boxes, and found nothing but a little quantity of sugar candy, and in the last box there did appear a considerable quantity of tea and sugar, done up in pounds, and a pair of scales, and some weights, the man seemed much agitated, I ordered a constable and a couple of watchmen to attend below, when he came down and found a constable had been in the parlour; he said, he hoped his master would not be cruel to him, his master, who appeared at that time<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178306040049"></xptr> exceedingly affected himself; returned into the parlour, I told him as the matter appeared so very clear, to leave him to me, and I took him to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Court. What did he say, respecting these things that were found in his box? - I think he said, he had bought them of somebody, I remember now he said, of an acquaintance, I believe I did ask him his name, but he did not tell me, he fell down on his knees twice, and begged that his master would not be cruel to him.</p>
               <p>(The things produced, and Mr. Carr ordered by the Court, to look out such things as he could swear to.)</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Carr. About this time did you miss any quantity of tea? - I could not miss such a quantity as that.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. This prisoner was frequently sent by you to the bank, and you always found him very exact? - I have frequently trusted him with a great deal of money at a time, and never found him a penny wrong.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>All that I have to say in my defence is, that Mr. Carr is an honest man, and I leave it all to my council.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses who gave him a very good character.</p>

            . I am a dismounted patrol. On the 2nd of December I fell in with the prisoner in Chelseafields, at half-past one o'clock in the morning; he had these boards on his shoulder - I asked what he was going to do with them; he said to make a pig sty, and his father-in-law gave them to him - I took him to his father-in-law, who denied it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I believe he gave his proper address? A. I believe he did - he was not intoxicated.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been out late, drinking, and picked them up.</p>

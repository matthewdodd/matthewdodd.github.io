                  </hi>. I live at No. 3, Churton Street, Pimlico, and am a teacher. In the year 1842 I knew the prisoner—he was paying his addresses to my sister for three or four months; I was in the habit of seeing him constantly. On 30th October, 1842, I was present at the pariah church of Upper Chelsea, Middlesex, when he was married to my sister, Mary Ann Sadler—after the marriage, my sister and he lived together. I was fre<lb></lb>quently in the habit of seeing them—he removed from our place for about a week, and took apartments, and then he removed back to my mother's house and lived with us. I was in the habit of seeing him for about four years after the marriage—I have no doubt whatever about the prisoner being the man that was married to my sister; he ceased to live with her about 1846.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Mills, and reside at Cathron, in Surrey—I was at the church in 1842, when my sister Mary Ann was married—the prisoner is the person to whom she was married—I had seen him three or four months previously to the marriage, and I saw him for about four years after the marriage—I have not the least doubt he is the person.</p>

I cannot say exactly what age you appeared to be at that time; I should imagine 19 or 20, or perhaps more.</p>

                  </hi>. I am now living at my father's house at Sheffield—I became acquainted with the prisoner in 1847 at Preston, where I was on a visit to some friends. In November that year I accompanied him to Gretna Green—he had previously made a proposal of marriage to me. I had not the least idea that he was a married man—we were married at Gretna hall by the Rev. Mr. Linton, by special licence—the marriage ceremony was read by the Rev. Mr. Linton, as it is in a church,—the prisoner declared himself a single man—I don't remember distinctly what was said on the occasion, but we were legally married—we declared ourselves single persons, and Mr. Linton declared us to be husband and wife.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was any question asked of either of you, as to whether you wished to be married? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, he asked if we were willing to be married.</p>

SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he ask each of you if you were willing to be married? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and we answered, yes—we agreed to be husband and wife, and the ceremony was then gone through; and after the ceremony was gone through, Mr. Linton declared us to be man and wife. We were legally</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185808160003"></xptr>
               <p>married according to the laws of Scotland, which laws are recognised by the laws of England. When Mr. Linton asked us if we were willing to be married, we consented—I said, "I take you to be my husband," and the prisoner consented to take me to be his wife—he said so distinctly—we afterwards lived together as man and wife, and continued to do so till 1851. I had one little girl by that marriage; she is about 9 years of age. In 1851, the prisoner deserted me in Liverpool—I never saw him since, until he was in custody. At the time he married me, he passed by the name of Marco Emile de St. Hiliare. I have my marriage certificate here (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this is the prisoner's signature, "Marco Emile de St. Hiliare,"—I saw him sign this—this, "Anna Maria Froggatt," is my writing—this was signed by him at Gretna hall. The Rev. Mr. Linton gave me this certificate—(<hi rend="italic"> Read:</hi> "Kingdom of Scotland, county of Dumfries, parish of Gretna. These are to certify, to all to whom these presents may come, that Marco Emile de St. Hiliare, of the parish of Montmorenci, in the county or department of the Seine, France, and Anna Maria Froggatt, of the parish of St. Philip, Sheffield, Yorkshire, being now here present, and having declared themselves single persons, were this day married, agreeable to the law of Scotland; as witness our hands at Gretna hall, this 15th day of November, 1847, Marco Emile de St. Hiliare, Anna Maria Froggatt; wit<lb></lb>nessed by John Young, John Linton, and Jane Linton.")

I knew you about six weeks before our marriage—the last time I saw you was on 18th November, 1851. I made enquiries as to the legality of the marriage—I enquired of several parties; I cannot tell of whom, a long time has expired—I have letters that I received from Mr. Linton, assuring me that it was a legal marriage. Mr. Linton and his sister were present at the marriage—I did not know Mr. Linton before.</p>

               <p>hesitation in saying that that would constitute a valid marriage in Scotland.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Does it not depend upon whether the intention of the parties went with the words that were spoken and the acts that were done? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; the intention of the parties is material certainly; they must intend that what is said and done should issue in a marriage, and that they should be man and wife in consequence of it; they must really deliberately intend and consent to take each other as man and wife. I should mention that this constitutes what is called an irregular marriage—a regular marriage is, as it is here, by the publication of banns—but this is a perfectly good marriage with regard to all the rights of the parties—the substance of a contract in marriage, as in everything else, is the intention of the parties; it does not depend upon the intention of the man—if the prisoner and Miss Froggatt went through a form of marriage, the meaning of which was that they took each other as man and wife, and if there was good faith on the part of Miss Froggatt, and she intended to take him for her husband, and he went through a form supporting her in that intention and belief, and the facts were such as she has spoken to, that would be, although an irregular, a perfectly valid marriage. I do not think his in<lb></lb>tention is so material, under the circumstances of the case; it has been decided in Scotland that where there is what is called a <hi rend="italic">mid impediment</hi>—that is, where the man has refrained from acknowledging the woman, and, in the meantime, married another person in the regular way, and then the second wife died, and he afterwards married the person with whom he con<lb></lb>tracted the irregular connexion, her good faith alone had the effect of legitimizing the offspring.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The prisoner, in a very long defence, entered into the circumstances of a previous prosecution for an offence of which he was convicted, and asserted that that, case, as well as the present, was the result of a conspiracy against him on the part of Mr. Baxter Langley, and other members of an Italian confede<lb></lb>ration, whose enmity he had, aroused by denouncing their schemes of assassination. He denied that he was the party that married Miss Sadler, and stated that he was in Paris at the time, which he could have proved if time had been allowed him—he also denied that he had ever seen Miss Froggatt before he saw her at Bow Street.</hi>)</p>

                  </hi>. I am a fisherman, and live at Wandsworth, in Surrey. On the 1st of July, at night, I had my boat moored against the white Horse at Wandsworth, by the water-side—I had three barkets and a great quanitity of flounders—they were alive in the well of the boot when I left them—I thought they would fetch next morning I was called up, and found some barbel and nearly all the flounders gone—they were worth about 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a waterman and bargeman, and live at Ham<lb></lb>mer smith. On the 2nd of July, at about quarter past three o'clock in the morning, I was in my barge, and saw the three prisoners alongside Peters's boat, taking the fish out of it—the boat was afloat at anchor, at wands<lb></lb>worth—Honeyman held the boat's stern—Watts was taking the fish out, and Barker was keeping the boat steady with a scull—I saw Watts take flounders out and put them into the boat, and I saw Honeyman jobbing them down at the bottom of the boat, to kill them—I saw him put some barbel into a light-coloured handkerchief—I asked if they were not ashamed of themselves, for hurting a poor man—they made no answer, but one said to the other, "Pull away"—I afterwards saw the fish at the station-house—they were bruised.</p>

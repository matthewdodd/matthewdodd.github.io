                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-sergeant, K</hi> 17). On Tuesday evening, 3d May, about half-past 8, from information I received I went to the prisoner's premises—he is a blacksmith and locksmith in Whiter-row, Baker's-row, Whitechapel-road—they adjoin some chemical works—there is a large rag-warehouse on the opposite side of the prisoner's premises, and there are some inhabited cottages bounding his premises near White's-row—at the bottom of the yard there is an oil and colour manufactory—I went into Miss Hatton's chemical works for the purpose of observation—I have seen this plan (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>); it is correct—there is a wooden partition, eleven feet high, which separates Miss Hatton's chemical works from the side of the prisoner's shop—I put a ladder against that partition to look over into the prisoner's premises—you can look over the partition—there is a space of ten feet above the partition to the roof of the building; an opening—there was no one in his shop at that time—against the partition, on the side where I rested the ladder, there was a great number of carboy baskets; large open baskets—they were placed one within the other—next to the partition, on the left-hand side, the shop-door opens from the entry, and next to that there were stages erected—the door is about four feet wide—there are two doors standing together, one appears to be a fixture; they are made of wood—there were two stages running along against the wall, just beyond the doorway—there is a wooden partition running along, and the two stages were fixed against the partition—one stage was a sort of wooden shelf supported by upright pieces of wood underneath it, and underneath that shelf were some baskets; I can't exactly state the number—there were some shavings in them—there were a great number of baskets—in some places they were one within the other, and in some places they were single—there were two shelves one above the other—there were three baskets on the first shelf—there was straw and shavings in all three—there were several baskets</p>

               <p>on the upper shelf—that upper shelf was apparently made of a cooper's old truck, open in the middle—it is a kind of carriage; the same as brewers use—the baskets on that were upside down, and there were some Venetian blinds in them, they came through the bottoms of the basket, and rested on the truck—the baskets had no bottoms to them—there were several other baskets upon a grindstone—I saw no fire about the place at this time—I went to his place between 7 and 8 next morning—I did not see the prisoner at that time—I did not go into the shop—I apprehended him two days afterwards—I told him that I came to apprehend him on suspicion of setting his place on fire—he said he came early that morning; that he blew a piece of candle out, and threw it on a board that rested over a carboy basket, and it fell in among some shavings, and set the place on fire—I said nothing else to him—he told me that he was not insured—that was in reply to a question that I put to him—I asked him whether he was insured or not—he gave me as a reason for going to his shop early that morning, that he had to repair a blind for Mr. Hall—I looked over the property that was there—it consisted mostly of iron tools and bellows, very old, an anvil, and several other tools, and a desk, containing memorandums.</p>

               <p>chemist, carrying on business next to the prisoner's workshop—from some information that I received from an assistant I watched the prisoner's work<lb></lb>shop on Tuesday night, 3d May—that was the same night that the police<lb></lb>man was there—I watched from Mr. Brandon's gates—we had to go from our gate to get to the prisoner's gate—we watched during the night from Mr. Brandon's gate, from somewhere about 10 o'clock until the prisoner came, about half-past 3 o'clock in the morning—I saw him come in at the front gate about that time—he came to our front gate—there are two gates, an outer and an inner—the prisoner went into his shop—we waited for some minutes at Brandon's gates—I then rushed forward to the prisoner's gates, and took hold of him either by the collar or sleeve—I saw into his shop before I took hold of him—I could not see into his shop from where I stood at Brandon's gates; I had to go up to his gate before I could see into his shop—I had not seen the state of his shop that morning—his gates were closed—I had seen from over the partition the night before—I then saw some carboy baskets placed; in some of them were shavings—there were also bundles of shavings made up by bagging, loosely held or stitched together with twine round in some parts—some of the hampers were stand<lb></lb>ing upon a temporary stage erected across one part of the gate; it was a stage that I had never observed before—I frequently had occasion to go there on business; the prisoner was our smith, and did work for us as a black<lb></lb>smith—some of these baskets were also inverted upon these stages with shavings in them—they were on the two stages; one I call a temporary one, the other, I expect, was a permanent one, as I had seen it before; that was the upper one—I should call this truck the permanent stage—I am certain that some of the inverted baskets were upon that stage; I could not venture to say as to the other, but my impression is that there were some there—in connexion with these baskets were also pieces of stave and parts of an old Venetian blind or blinds, and the bottoms of the baskets were some of them out, or nearly out, and the blinds came right through—they were placed in the shavings, in the baskets, and lodging against the wooden door or gate—a number of rags were hanging from various parts of these stages—I saw some of the rags afterwards, bat did not examine them—at the time I was watching I had two assistants with me, after the policeman left—Gas<lb></lb>coigne was one and Neave was the other; he is in Mr. Brandon's employ<lb></lb>ment—Gascoigne is my assistant—in the morning I saw the prisoner come down the place towards his shop, and saw him enter—he seemed to come in a very stealthy manner, on tiptoe, treading very lightly, so as to pro<lb></lb>duce no noise, or as little as possible—I saw him enter his shop—I waited at Brandon's gate until I saw the flames issuing through—it was partly flames and partly reflection, sufficient to inform me that there was a fire—it came through some crevices or openings in the gate—between the time of the prisoner's going in and my seeing the flames coming out, was not, I should say, more than six minutes, any way under ten minutes—when I saw the flames I said something to my assistant and went forward into the pri<lb></lb>soner's shop, and took hold of him—the door was partially open—I do not think I was the first to enter—Gascoigne and I were close together—he was following close upon me—I scarcely know which was the first to enter, I may say we entered pretty well together—I had just to throw the door back to admit myself—the first thing I saw was fire burning in various places, three at least; three distinct fires—there was one close by the entrance on my left—I should imagine they were shavings burning; I will say shavings, in a carboy basket on the ground—I should say that was not an inverted</p>

               <p>basket; I (should say it was in its natural position—the second fire was burning in the corner on the same side, the left-hand side, over a grindstone—that was above the ground—the flames extended from the grindstone upwards—they proceeded from shavings in a basket under the truck—the stages were above—they came across—there were baskets on the stages, and staves of casks—there was a large body of fire—the flames extended up to the stage—over the truck there were pieces of stave in a basket—I could not say in what position that basket was—the third fire was nearly at the further extremity of the shop—that seemed to me to proceed from a gallipot—it seemed to be a body of fire—the gallipot was on the ground inside a basket; the basket was over it—I did not observe any shavings there—when I went into the place the prisoner had his back to the gate—he was appa<lb></lb>rently coming out backwards—the fire was on each side, and he seemed to be drawing from it towards the yard—we rushed upon him at once—he turned round when we came upon him; and we then took him by the collar or some part of his person, and we brought him out—he seemed very much confused and surprised—I think he spoke first; but of course I felt very much excited—when he saw us he seemed surprised, and he said, "Fire! the place is on fire!" in a very low voice, as if he had lost his voice for the mo<lb></lb>ment, as if he was hoarse from sudden emotion—I said, "You scoundrel!" and "You have done it!" or "it is you that have done it"—he hesitated for some time—as we were taking him out we began to shout "Fire!" and "Police!" and he said, "Don't make such a noise; don't make such a noise; let us put it out; let us put it out"—I had not been into his place for perhaps two or three weeks before—I saw the property that was there—I am not well acquainted with the value of these things; but I should not have given more than 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them myself—the fire was speedily put out by water that we had pro<lb></lb>vided for the purpose the night before, which we kept in Mr. Brandon's shop—the prisoner was not taken into custody until the Friday—he was at his place of business several times during that time—he was there from the time of the fire until he was apprehended; at least he was backwards and forwards—I heard him come in frequently—I do not think I saw him; I heard somebody, from which I inferred that he was there.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

               <p>from the front shop into the workshop—when I was watching at the gates, Gascoigne and Neave were with me—we had water ready inside Mr. Brandon's gate—it is about twenty or thirty feet from the gates where we were watching to the entrance to the prisoner's shop—it is at the extremity of the yard or covered way—it may be forty feet; I never measured it—when I saw the flames I said, "Come on, I see the flames"—I don't recollect saying, "it is time"—I certainly was very much excited—I had been watching very intently before that—it did not occur to me to move up further towards his gates when I had seen him go in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Has the prisoner complained of your premises at all? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he has occasionally found fault with the chimney—I was not aware of his com<lb></lb>plaining to the magistrate until I heard it mentioned at the police-court—I was aware that a complaint had been made, because the inspector of nuisances came from the Board of Works—that was some considerable time before this—he came on more than one occasion—I only saw him twice; nor am I aware of his having been more than twice; because he made certain sug<lb></lb>gestions upon his first attendance, and I made such alterations as he advised; and he came a second time with the medical officer, who suggested some further alterations—I did not see him a third time—the last time I saw him was perhaps two months or more before the fire—I am not aware that another complaint was made after that—we have had no wish to increase our premises by taking in the corner occupied by the prisoner—the police came up when we gave the alarm—I then declined to charge the prisoner—I was not asked whether I made any charge—I was asked by the police if I would prosecute him—I believe the words were, "Of course you intend to prose<lb></lb>cute;" and I said, "No"—he was not taken into custody that night—I am an Englishman—my parents were French, but I was born in England—I consider myself an English subject.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ATKINSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have been asked about the prisoner finding fault with the chimney—was that the chimney of your place? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The chimney is in his premises—perhaps he would not use his chimney for four or five days together and it would become full of foul air, and when we made a lire the smoke would sometimes go from our side into his chimney, and come out at the hole near his forge—we have a common right to the shaft—that has nothing to do with my evidence in this matter—when the complaint was made I did all in my power to remedy the grievance, and I think satisfactorily.</p>

I am in the employment of Mr. Brandon, an oilman—our premises are quite at the bottom of the yard in which Scane's workshop is—about half-past 3 o'clock on Wednesday morning, 4th May, I was watch<lb></lb>ing Scane's shop—I did not see him come down—the first thing that I saw was some fire coming from close by the door of his shop—on seeing that, I threw a pail of water on it, and almost extinguished that—I followed Mr. Bourdon and Mr. Gascoigne up with two pails of water, one in each hand, and I assisted in extinguishing the fire—there were four places burning at the same time; one was burning against the door, two over the grindstone, one above the other, and the fourth was eight feet alongside of the wall from the grindstone; the grindstone was in a corner—the fires formed a triangle—the fires were coming out of baskets which contained straw and shavings—I saw some rags there; they were hanging down from the top baskets towards the bottom ones—we did not get the fire out altogether till the firemen came—the policeman thought it would be better to leave a little for the firemen to Bee, but we kept it under—we should have thrown water on it and extinguished the fire, if the policeman had not stopped us—at that time</p>

               <p>the top baskets and this old timber was burning—the firemen were about three quarters of an hour before they came, I can't say exactly how long—there was not much fire when the firemen came, we had kept it under.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, K</hi> 141). I was called to White's-row on this morning—I found the prisoner at the gateway leading from the street to his premises, and went down with him to his shop—I saw Mr. Bourdon there—he said that the prisoner had fired the place—I took him into cus<lb></lb>tody, and took him into the workshop—I saw the state of the shop at that time—there was a grindstone in one corner, and over that there were a number of baskets on fire, and pieces of wood, rag, and shavings in the baskets—the woodwork of the building was burnt—the partition was charred—it was burning when I was there—it was alight, on fire—part of that has been taken out and brought here to-day, this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—it came from the corner over the grindstone—it was a separate piece, not a pact of the building—it was just as it is now—no part of the building that I saw charred has been brought away—I am quite sure that some part of the building was on fire—I saw it alight, burning—it was all burnt black, similar to this—I was there almost as soon as it was discovered—I saw water thrown upon it—I can undertake to say that a part of the woodwork of the building was alight, burning—the prisoner said it was an accident; that he put the candle on a piece of board, and it fell into a basket and set it on fire—he said that he had come there to get his tools, and take a ladder to go and repair a blind for Mr. Hall, a linendraper in the Whitechapel-road—nobody would give him in charge, and he was let go.</p>

I am an oil and colour man in the Whitechapel-road—I have premises adjoining Miss Hatton's, for making vegetable black, and I have oil stores there—the morning before the fire I saw the prisoner—he was standing with his back to his own door surveying his premises, looking at the roof—it is the joint roof of his premises and mine—I stood for a few minutes looking at him, and he turned round, and said, "Oh, you are just the man I wanted to see, Brandon; will you lend me a ladder?"—</p>

            , which charges him with the crime of wilful and corrupt perjury; and it is certainly not necessary for me at this time of day, to make to you any observations on the nature of this offence, we all know and feel it; the observation has been often made, and as often assented to, that unless this crime is suppressed by severe punishment, it is impossible any thing we enjoy can be sacred. Gentlemen, I shall state to you some of the leading circumstances of this case; the defendant is by business a shoe-maker, he was in the situation of journeyman clicker to the prosecutor, who keeps a large shoe warehouse, in Bell yard, Temple-bar; he married a relation of Mr. Yarrel, his sister I think, and he advanced him a sum of money: one cannot help being extremely sorry, that between relations like these, disputes of a civil nature should exist, and it certainly increases one's anxiety, that such a person should be under the necessity of prosecuting such a relation, and exposing him to an infamous judgment; but if people will contrive the ruin of those who have protected them; the consequence must take place, and you and I must do our duty.</p>
               <p>Court. What do you state these to be brothers? - I state them to be brothers in la</p>
               <p>Court. Has this action of trover been tried? - No, it has been non-prossed.</p>
               <p>Court. Is not it possible that in an action of civil right not tried, that this can be accommodated.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. All that has been very properly done out of Court, and I can appeal even to Mr. Silvester, whether I have not gone even half way to effect it.</p>

               <p>Court. I am sure it will be the recommendation of the Court, and I am sure the Jury will join in that recommendation that it should be settled: surely, it will be much more proper to all parties; for if it should end in a conviction, the conviction of one is such a disgrace to the family, that one would think a man would sooner, even if satisfied of the fact, consent to its being settled.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. If the parties will make an intire end of litigation, but if we are only to stop here, it will answer no purpose. My Lord, as this has been, I think, very improperly the subject of agitation before you, it becomes my duty to inform you why I do not consent to the proposal; I would have abstained from saying any thing about attempts and compromises elsewhere; they ought to be always in their nature, and they generally are, sacred and secret; and ought never to be mentioned in the face of a public court of justice: if they can be settled out of court, it is good and well. Gentlemen, it may seem strange that the proposal made by the counsel on the other side, and made with considerable address, and which has at least a pleasurableness about it which might recommend it, should not be acceded to by me. Says Mr. Silvester, on the part of Mr. Yarrell, it is insisted there is a sum of money due: the defendants say there is not; now, says he, go before an arbitrator: why, gentlemen, I should betray my client, Mr. Yarrell, if I was to agree to this; because it would be permitting this man, whom I undertake to prove guilty of perjury, to go discharged from the effects of a conviction, and have no verdict passed against him, but to be at liberty to tell the same false tale again before an arbitrator, to substantiate his demand: for my client I am ready to do this; they are related; it is a pity they should tear one another to pieces in a court of law: it is better to make an end of it. Now see whether my proposal is not quite as fair as that made on the other side: we have protected you: we have given you the means of having any property to claim: we have put you into trade because you have married our sister; therefore, now give and take; execute general releases, or else we must go on: and I tell you now, gentlemen, if you have any doubt about the case; if this gentleman who chuses to go<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179001130116"></xptr>on at the hazard of conviction; for I do not put it upon a balance or a nicety; if you do not feel, and are not convinced that the defendant knew perfectly that there was not a guinea due, and that the whole was a fabrication and falseshood, I am content you should acquit him.</p>
               <p>Jury. The accounts should have been inspected by their friends.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I am told that I shall be able to prove to you that they were so inspected, and nothing was due. Gentlemen, the assignment for perjury is upon this affidavit: he swears that

             of Butcher-row, Temple-bar, Middlesex, shoe-maker, did on the 2d of July last, unlawfully take divers goods and chattles of the property of this deponent, of the value of two hundred pounds, and upwards, and convert them to his own use; and for which he is indebted to this deponent: the assignment is, that in truth and in fact, Yarrell had not taken divers goods and chattles, and for which Yarrell was not indebted to him: the issue therefore is, whether on the 2d of July, Yarrell had unlawfully taken and converted to his own use, the goods of this man, for which he was, and is indebted. Gentlemen, it is a very unusual proceeding in an action of trover, as this is, to hold a man to bail, and make an affidavit of debt in the first instance; it is a very uncommon proceeding: however, in this case he thought it convenient to make such an affidavit. The circumstances on which these goods were taken, were these: Mr. Candeline being, as I observed to you, a journeyman shoe-maker, and having no property of his own, married a sister of Mr. Yarrell; and he set him up in business, and gave him the means of going on: Candeline gave him a bill of sale, that if Candeline should pay him the sum of thirty pounds on the 4th of each and every month, till fully satisfied, then judgment not to be executed; but in default, then the judgment was to be entered up for the whole, or such part as was unpaid. Gentlemen, it was for some considerable time that these parties went on together amicably; and the execution of the bill of sale was suspended; at length, Yarrell having reason to suspect that Candeline was going back, and having clear right to take his own property, did execute this bill of sale, and took possession of these goods; and after he had so taken possession, this man has sworn that they were unlawfully converted by Yarrell to his own use. Gentlemen, I shall be able to prove to you, that at the time of executing this warrant of attorney, Candeline knew that he had a clear and a distinct right to enter up these securities that had been given to him for the purpose of being entered up; and that he had not converted them to his own use; and that the execution was perfectly legal. Even now, after stating this case, I shall have no objection to do what is right: if the jury will take the trouble of settling that account between them, I shall be content.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. It was not through fear I offered this; but seeing they were brothers, I interfered before I read my brief.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Mr. Yarrell. If Mr. Shelton will take the trouble of it, there is not a better man in the king's dominions; if he reports there is nothing due from you to Candeline, in that case, there is to be an end to all matters in difference?</p>
               <p>Mr. Yarrell. I am sure I shall be clear in my accounts.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Mr. Yarrell. Are you ready to do that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Then Mr. Shelton is to examine all the accounts, and every thing he thinks necessary between these parties; and that if he shall find there is any thing due to these parties, of course that is to be paid; and if not, he is to order the parties to execute a general release.</p>
               <p>NOT GUILTY.</p>
               <p>Tried by the London Jury before Mr. RECORDER.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179001130117"></xptr>233. WALTER GAGE was indicted for wilful and corrupt perjury.</p>
               <p>The case opened by Mr. Knowles as follows:</p>
               <p>May it please you Mr. Recorder, and you Gentlemen of the Jury. This likewise is an indictment for wilful and corrupt perjury, made by the defendant, in the Marshalsea Court, to hold the prosecutor to bail; in this case you will have none of those difficulties arising from family connections; but it will be a case in which, if the evidence comes home, to bring the defendant's guilt to him, you will be ready to convict, and make an example of men, who are always eager enough to take advantage of the distress of others. The defendant is a Bailiff of the Marshalsea Court: the prosecutor is a young Gentleman of some fortune; he had been imprudent enough to run up a bill with a Mr. Thornton, who keeps Haddock's Bagnio, Covent Garden, in the sum of twenty pounds, seventeen shillings, and three-pence; he employed his attornies, Messrs. Field and Brown, to take out a process, in the Marshalsea Court, against the prosecutor; Gage, the defendant, was the officer employed to arrest Mr. Fyott, the prosecutor of this indictment; he arrested him as he was going into the Bedford Coffee-house, to dinner; Mr. Fyott had then eighteen guineas in his pocket; the debt and costs amounted only to twenty-three pounds odd; he said, I have eighteen guineas, give me credit for the rest; the officer received the eighteen guineas; he, himself, undertook to be responsible for the residue, which was about three pounds, eighteen shillings; the officer, Gage, the defendant, said, he would call on Mr. Fyott, in a few days afterwards, and receive the balance; Gage did call several times on the prosecutor; the prosecutor did not see him; and therefore he thought the readiest way would be to make this, some how or other, amount to a sum that he could hold him to bail, and arrest him for; he of course made the affidavit upon which he is now indicted; that the defendant was then indebted to him in ten pounds, and upwards; without which he could not have held him to bail: he arrested him at the New Hummums: the sum for which he arrested him, he said, was twelve pounds, odd; but he, out of great generosity (the generosity of a sheriff's officer is very remarkable) said, he would remit all but ten pounds, ten shillings: Mr. Fyott was taken at a nonplus; he was in this lodging, with a lady: if he meant to bail this, of course he must send for friends, and expose his situation; there was no other remedy, but to go to the spunging-house, to send for bail, or pay the money: Gentlemen, if a young man had any modesty at all, he would rather pay an extra sum that was not due, then account to his friends for such a situation: he took the latter remedy, he paid six guineas down, and he and the lady joined in a note for four guineas more: now I certainly have this difficulty to get over; this man has this confirmation of his account, that the prosecutor has, on a certain occasion, paid him part, and acknowledged that the rest is due; that is a standing obstacle to surmount; but I trust it will appear to this Court, that he paid that under fear and oppression, that it never was due, and that the defendant knew it, that the defendant took the advantage of his situation, to make him pay that money, and then he thought he was perfectly secure: gentlemen, I prove it this way; I have a witness I shall first of all produce to you, the attornies who proceeded against him on the original debt; I will prove to you, from a gentleman who saw the transaction, that he paid eighteen guineas to this man: now how is the residue to amount to ten pounds? why, gentlemen, I will prove to you that this man applied at the place where he found the prosecutor, desiring the waiter, and desiring the hair dresser, if he owed them any money, to make it over to him; and under this idea he has made the affidavit of it: I shall prove by another witness, that he has very recently before the arrest, applied to this gentleman for the balance, under four<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179001130118"></xptr>pounds: it will certainly throw this burden on Mr. Gage, to shew by what means this debt, which was originally under four pounds, came to this sum of ten pounds: though this young gentleman having been in imprudent connections, and being forced into the payment of a sum that was more than due, I am sure you will not suffer him to be injured in this way, nor this man to triumph in this case. I shall call my witnesses. If he does not give evidence to you, to satisfy you that he had a rational belief of that sort, you will take the fact of his having got the money from this gentleman, by this means, into your consideration; and consider whether he is not guilty of the charge in the indictment.</p>

               <p>Did she walk or run? - She only walked, I saw her go into a public house, I came in immediately, and missed one of the cottons; the other woman went off without the table cloths, she did not like the price of them; when I went into the shop, she was standing at the door, I was not above a yard from her, when I missed the piece of cotton; it contained ten yards and a half, it was the property of my master,

               <p>Did she touch any of the things, when she examined them? - Yes, the piece I missed was loose when I left it, she doubled it up, and laid it on one side, and said she did not like it.</p>

               <p>Was there any opportunity at this time, for the woman to have taken this? - Not, at that time, I conceive she took it while I was shewing her the cottons, while I turned my back to take the other cottons down; I saw her go into a public house over the way, and I pursued her; it is a thoroughfare, and as I went in at one door, she went out at the other; I lost sight of her, I saw her on the other side of the way.</p>

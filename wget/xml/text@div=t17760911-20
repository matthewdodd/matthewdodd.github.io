I went into the fore-shop again, and returned again, to see if I could see the silk still hanging down under her petticoat, but I could not; I then went and sat down in the compting-house in the back-shop; they looked at many pieces, but bid nothing. The young man was very pressing for them to bid something, and look at some more; I came up and said, perhaps we might have something to suit them another time; they seemed glad at that, and came into the fore shop, then I went backwards and found the piece of silk was missing. As they were going out, I told the young man I thought they had a piece of silk; he bid them come back into the back-shop, the back-shop is long and divided into two parts; as they were going along, I put my hand to Gillam's petticoat and felt the silk under it; I put my hand under her petticoat and took it from her; it is worth five pounds and upwards.</p>

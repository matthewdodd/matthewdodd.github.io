                  </hi>. I am in the employ of William James Stephenson, a linen-draper in Ratcliffe-highway. On the 20th of Septem<lb></lb>ber the prisoner came <hi rend="italic">to</hi> the shop—we had known him before—he pro<lb></lb>duced this order, and wished to look out these goods, which he said were for William Thompson; and when he had looked out all but the cap, he said, "I will leave it to you to look out the other things"—I turned my head, and as he was coming out, I saw a pair of shoes under his jacket—I called to Mr. Stephenson, and said he had got a pair of shoes—I took the shoes from him, and then looked under the counter, and saw three hand<lb></lb>kerchiefs which I had laid on the counter a few minutes before—the pri<lb></lb>soner then threw himself down in the shop.</p>

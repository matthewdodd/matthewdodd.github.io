About 1 o'clock on the morning of 10th August I was with Pickles, another detective, at the corner of Cranbourne Street, St. Martin's Lane—I had known the three prisoners before that—I saw them there with two other men—in consequence of seeing them together we kept them in sight—they went in the direction of New Street</p>

               <p>and we lost sight of them for a time—we waited about there and in about half an hour I saw the prisoners come out of Hop Gardens Court, St. Martin's Lane, preceded by a man without a hat—Murphy was between Anthony and Williams—they were hurrying along very sharp—they went towards St. Martin's Court—Pickles and I separated and I went round so as to meet them—I saw Williams first and then Murphy coming down the court towards me—Murphy had a parcel under his coat and I stopped him—this piece of zinc fell on the ground when I pulled his coat open—I searched him at the station and found on him 450 postage stamps, sixteen receipt stamps, 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., some scraps of metal, and a latch key—having taken him to the station, I rejoined Pickles and we went to a house in St. George's Court, St. Ann's Street, Westminster, where we found Williams and Anthony in bed with two girls—I told them I should take them into custody for breaking into a place in St. Martin's Lane—Anthony said he had been at home since 10 o'clock playing dominoes—I am quite sure I saw him come out of Hop Gardens with the others—they were taken to the Vine Street police-station and Williams was searched by Pickles.</p>

Williams and found 150 postage stamps, and a bill-head with Mr. Buck land's name on it, and other things.</p>

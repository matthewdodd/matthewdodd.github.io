                  </hi>. I am the wife of Asher Isaacs, a wholesale clothes<lb></lb>dealer, and live in White-street, Cutler-street, Houndsditch. The female prisoner came to live with us, as servant of all work, on the 16th of March—I am certain she had no money or clothes, except what she had on—she brought no box with her, and stated that she had nothing at all—on the Thursday evening, the 14th of April, she had asked my daughter leave to go out, and went out—I found her intoxicated next morning, when she was called in to breakfast—she went up-stairs, and I could not find her—I at last sent for a policeman, who searched her in my presence, and found a duplicate of the shawl on her—I found a half-crown and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on her—I made further inquiry, and found property of ours at four pawnbrokers.</p>

On the 14th of April I was sent for to the prosecutor's house, and found the duplicate of a shawl and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the prisoner—I afterwards went to Blackmore's, a tailor, who lives a few doors off Petticoat-lane—I found him at work on his board—I asked if he knew any thing of Welsh—he hesitated at first—I told him I wanted some pawnbroker's tickets belonging to Welsh—he hesitated—I said, "What is that little box on the mantel-piece? Hand it down"—his wife then gave it to me—I looked at it—it contained seven or eight duplicates—I said, "Here are some of the duplicates in the name of Welch"—he then acknowledged knowing Welch—he said, "Part of the tickets belong to me and part to Welch"—I said, "I will read them over," and to state what were his and what were Welch's and to be cautious—he claimed a pair of trowsers and a shawl, which the prosecutor also claims—I went to the different pawnbrokers and found the property.</p>

               <p>a tobacconist, in Gloucester-street. On the afternoon of the 5th of August, I was in the parlour behind my shop, and saw the prisoner come in and take 1lb. weight of tobacco which was lying on the counter, and place it under his frock-coat—I went in to serve him, and he asked for a quarter of an ounce of Irish twist—I took no notice then, as I was serving—my husband came up into the shop—I asked him in the pri<lb></lb>soner's hearing, where he had placed the tobacco that he was going to take out with him—he looked on the counter and found it was gone—I collared the prisoner across the counter, and said, "This is the thief, he has got it"—my husband went to call a policeman—the prisoner offered to pay for it—we would not take it—he struck me on my hand to leave go—I let him go when the shop-door was shut, and the policeman came—this tobacco is my husband's.</p>

I took the prisoner into custody, and took the tobacco—he told me in the shop that he had offered to pay for it, but she would not take it—immediately be got outside the door, he ran away upwards of 100 yards—when I took him, I had my staff in my hand—I was about to push him with it—he said, "Don't strike me, it is no more than you would have done yourself, had you been similarly situated"—I took him to the station, and found on him four skeleton-keys, a common key, some lucifer-matches, and the bottom of a lucifer-match box, in different pockets, 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., some odd halfpence, and I think five duplicates for his own things.</p>

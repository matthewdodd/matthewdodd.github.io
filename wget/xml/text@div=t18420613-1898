                  </hi>. I farm about 160 acres of land, and carry on the business of a cow-keeper and dairyman, in Pancras-street, Totten<lb></lb>ham-court-road. I know the prisoner—he was indebted to me 185<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. last year—that was the balance of a larger sum which he had owed me—he gave me, as a security for that sum, a bill of 185<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., payable six months after date, and dated 8th November, 1841, and a mort<lb></lb>gage-deed—this is the bill, and the draft of the mortgage-deed—(<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>)—my attorney brought it to me, and I examined it—the bill became due on the 11th of May in this year—it was presented in a regular way—I did not receive any money—the prisoner called on me in the afternoon after the bill was presented—he said, "Have you got the leases and mortgage-deed with you?"—I said, "Yes, I have"—he said, "Will you come with me up to my father's house; and I think we shall come to some arrangement"—I said I could not go <hi rend="italic">very</hi> well then, as I was just going out with my milk—he said, "Pooh, pooh, never mind that"—I went up stairs, put them into my pocket, and went with him to his father's house, in Tottenham-court-road—(the prisoner lives in Cheyne-street)—when we got to his father's house, I found his father, Mrs. Chap<lb></lb>man, and her brother—the prisoner's father has the same Christian name as he has—I said, "Do you want to see me, Mr. Chapman?" (addressing my<lb></lb>self to the elder Mr. Chapman)—he said, "Not particularly"—he said to his son, "<hi rend="italic">Tom,</hi> why don't you settle with Mr. Green?"—and turning to me at the same time, he said to me, "Have you got the leases with you?" "I have, sir," said I, and I took the lease and mortgage-deed out of my pocket, and handed them to the elder Mr. Chapman—he took them in his hand, opened them, looked at them about a minute, and laid them down on the table—the prisoner then said, "I want to look at these things"—he took them off the table, and opened them and read them, I should think for about a minute—he then got up, and he and his uncle went out of the room together—the uncle was out of the room for it might be a minute, or a minute and a half—he then came in by himself—I said, "Where is he gone with the leases?"—the mother said, "I don't know; father, you had better go and see"—the father went <hi rend="italic">to</hi> see, and while he was absent, the prisoner came in, sat down in the chair that he went from, and said, "There shall be no more bother about these things; I'm d—d if I have not burned them!"—I have never seen the deed since—I said I would not believe it, and asked him what he called himself, whether he called himself a gentleman, or what he called himself—I do not know what he said, but his mother made answer, "What a shameful rascal you must be to serve Mr. Green in this kind of way!"—his mother then went</p>

               <p>Q. What did his family consist of - A. He had a wife and one child, and me and him. The wife and child and me were all the persons in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you lived with him previous to the 11th of January - A. I lived there eight days.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this model, is the house like this - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose this to be the street door, is this the passage - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. As you go on you come to a small hall - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In that hall there is a stair-case, one that goes up stairs, and one that goes down stairs - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the partition between that front parlour and the small hall - A. A partition of wood, and behind the back parlour there is the pantry.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 11th of January do you remember any thing being said to you about going out - A. At nine o'clock on the 11th of January, in the morning, my mistress said, Mary, your master and me are going out to dinner, and after you have shut up the house you may go out for a few hours.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you applied for leave to go out - A. No, sir.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did Mr. Sturman go out - A. He went out about half past twelve o'clock. The prisoner told me to go and fetch some seed to feed the canary bird. I went and fetched the bird seed. Mr. Sturman fed the bird himself. The bird was in a bird-cage; it hung up by the side of the room, between the window and the fire-place, in the front parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. What sized cage was it - A. It was a large breeding-cage; it might be the size of that model.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had fetched the bird-seed what did your master say to you - A. He gave me a key, and asked me if I knew how to unlock the door; I said, no. I had never seen such a key before. I tried to unlock the door; he shewed me, and then I could do it after he shewed me, not before he shewed me. He told me to leave the house perfectly secure, to be at home at half after eight o'clock, and not later, and to get the fire and lamps ready by nine o'clock. I went out about four o'clock. He told me to be sure to be at home at half after eight o'clock, and before I went out to leave a lamp alight, that nobody might distinguish whether there were any persons in the house or not. I left the lamp burning on the board in the hall, and the tinder-box, for fear it should go out. I went into the front parlour before I went out. I raked the fire almost out; I barred the shutters up, but I did not draw the curtains. I left every thing perfectly safe, to the best of my knowledge, up stairs. I fastened the doors and the windows; I left the windows shut and the shutters open.</p>
               <p>Q. How high was that room - A. Three pair of stairs. All the fastenings were very secure when I went out.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it when you went out - A. About four o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. And what time did you return - A. I returned about twenty minutes before eight. I unlocked the street door.</p>
               <p>Q. How happened you to return before the time your master gave you leave - A. I was at a friend's house; I did not exactly know the hour; I mistook the hour. I let myself in with the key my master gave me. When I came in the passage I saw the house was in flames. The back dining room door post I saw in flames.</p>
               <p>Q. On which side of the door post - A. The inside of the door post.</p>
               <p>Q. What was there against the door post - A. On the inside there were paper, wood, and boards.</p>
               <p>Q. How many boards - A. I believe there were one or two; they were thin boards, usually kept by Mr. Sturman that he had in the wine cellar; the boards laid against the door post.</p>
               <p>Q. Between them and the door post what was there - A. A wooden partition.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing put between the boards and the door post - A. No, sir.</p>
               <p>Q. What was there of the other side - A. Bundles of fire wood with the strings cut, and paper, and on the outside of the front parlour was steps, wood, and hand boxes brought out of Mrs. Sturman's room, filled full of combustlbles, and a bunch of matches also.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the combustibles - A. A band box, wood, and paper, and on the inside of the front parlour there was more wood and paper also on the floor.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these on each side of the partition - A. There were steps on the outside, and wood and paper within. They were as close to the partition as possibly they could be laid to the partition of the front parlour. The clothes-horses used to be kept down stairs in the washhouse. Stocking and rags were scattered about the stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. What stockings - A. Some silk and some cotton.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose stockings were they - A. Mr. Sturman's. The stocking were kept in the front parlour, in the bottom drawer. The pinafores I washed myself; they were in the front parlour; they were usually kept in a drawer in the front parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. How many pinafores - A. I cannot say how many, not less than six or seven. They were in the back parlour hanging on the back of a chair when I went out.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were they when you came home -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181402160023"></xptr>- A. When I found them they were upon the stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any rags about - A. Yes, there were rags which I had dusted the tables with on the stairs; the rags smelled very strong of turpentine indeed, some of them, and some of the stockings I believe smelled very strong of turpentine. There were some matches laying on the clothes-horse, and on the steps, and I had left some on the side-board; when I came home there was a considerable fire in the front parlour, and two pokers red hot.</p>
               <p>Q. What had become of the lamp - A. The lamp was removed from the place I left; it was carried into the back-pantry. The lamp I left in the passage burning was carried into the back-pantry.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the curtains of the front parlour - A. When I went out I left the curtains undrawed; when I returned they were drawed.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the windows of the prisoner's bedroom - A. I left the windows shut, and the shutters open; when I came home the windows were throwed open, and the shutters open.</p>
               <p>Q. That would make a draft down the stair-case - A. Yes. My window was open at the same time; it was shut when I went out.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the snow upon the house at this time - A. Yes, a great deal. My room was at the top of the house, next to Mr. Sturman's room. The snow was upon the the top of the house, very deep indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. On your seeing things in this state what did you do - A. As soon as I went in the house and saw it in flames I immediately called out for assistance; Mr. Levoigne was the first that came to my assistance. Captain 
               <persName id="t18140216-43-person449">Kempster</persName>
            's servant, who lived at the next door of one side, and Dr. Lockley on the other side. The Captain's servant came, and Mrs. Lockley's also came, and we extinguished the flames as soon as possible.</p>
               <p>Q. How where the drawers in the front parlour - A. The book-case and the drawers in the front parlour were all apparently shut when I went out; when I returned I found them all open, and stripped.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect whether the key was in the book-case when you went out - A. No, I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came home was the bird-cage there - A. No, it was not.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time did your master come home - A. At half after nine o'clock; I was in the front parlour when I saw my master first. My mistress spoke to me, said, Mary, what is the matter; I said ma'm, the house is stripped and robbed. He immediately cried out his desk was lost, and that he was a ruined man. Master asked me what time I went out; I said, four o'clock. He asked me how long I had been home; I said, ever since twenty minutes before eight.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the day after, Mr. Denham coming to your master - A. Yes, very well; they had some conversation together. Master told me then to fetch some turpentine bottles; I asked Mr. Sturman where they were, whether they were in the cupboard up stairs or down stairs; the prisoner told me in the cupboard in the back pantry. I knew nothing where they were; I never had seen any turpentine bottles there before hand; I used to go to that cupboard very frequently.</p>
               <p>Q. Must you have seen them if they had been there - A. Yes, I think I must have seen them if they had been there before, but I never had seen them before.</p>
               <p>Q. They were stone bottles I suppose - A. Yes; they hold about half a gallon. (The two stone bottles produced.) One of them is common oil, the other is turpentine. I brought them both up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see how much there were in each - A. No, I did not look particularly; I smelled them, one appeared to have the same smell as the rags, and the stockings also.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your master use more than one sitting-room - A. No, only one when I was with him, that was the front parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any fire in the kitchen, or any where - A. No, none all the time I was in the house. No fire except in the front parlour; I had my meals there; I dined after them in the same room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did people frequently come to ask for payment - A. Very often indeed, for payment of money during the eight days I was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they ever get it - A. No, sir.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You had been there only eight days - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no great opportunity of examining the house - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore the jars might be there for what you know - A. They might; they were not in that cupboard, nor any where else that I saw.</p>
               <p>Q. One of them contained oil that might be used in paint, and the other oil that might be burned in a lamp - A. I do not know that.</p>
               <p>Q. Your master kept a lodging-house - A. Yes, he did.</p>

               <p>Q. You have spoken of some boards brought out of the wine cellar, you do not mean they were brought out that day - A. Yes, they must; I had never seen them before. Mr. Sturman used always to go to the cellar himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the key in the door - A. Not in common, it was not; Mr. Sturman took the key with him; the door was generally kept locked. The first night I was there Mrs. Sturman sent me down to get a bottle of beer; I went and got it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any wine there - A. I did not look.</p>
               <p>JURY. When you returned were you alarmed - A. Yes, I was quite alarmed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your recollection leave you. If you were alarmed it is somewhat astonishing that you should be correct to give a detail in this kind of way, and not under any embarrassment - A. I found myself confused to see the house in that state.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181402160024"></xptr>Q. You were only eight days in the house; how could you be acquainted with the house - A. Because I went into every room in the house, and cleaned every room.</p>
               <p>Q. You were alarmed and confused, and yet can be correct in stating all this - A. Why I saw the things there every day; they remained there several days afterwards.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Where did you get the light - A. Out of the front parlour.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Did you see any woman in the front parlour when you went in for the light - A. I saw no woman there until Mrs. Sturman came home.</p>

            . I am a bookseller in Portman-street. On the night of the 11th of January, I was in Half-moon-street; I heard a cry of fire; the cry proceed from some woman, I think, at No. 9. That young woman, the last witness, was at the door of her master's house. I went to the door directly. Upon entering the house I observed a light in the back parlour, and also on the stairs. I was the first person that went into the house. I immediately went into the back parlour, and extinguished the flame by the assistance of a board. I believe after two or three minutes, two other persons came in, and assisted. In about four or five minutes the fire was extinguished.</p>
               <p>Q. What part did you find to have been on fire - A. Upon examining it afterwards the door post and part of the flooring, sir, and the stairs. Against the back parlour door post there were two pieces of boards piled up; these pieces of boards would serve as conductors to the fire. On the outside I found rags, and up the stairs them rags appeared to have been sleeped in some preparation that smelled like turpentine. The smell principally appeared like it.</p>
               <p>Q. Underneath the stairs, against the other door, did you find the clothes-horse - A. I did, and paper, and other things; they were placed against the door post, only more erect.</p>
               <p>Q. On the inside of that parlour did you find other paper - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Underneath the side board there - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they appear to be placed so as most effectually to burn the house - 
               <persName id="t18140216-43-person453">A. Mary Wright</persName>
             went to the stair-case and saw the wooden steps.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Levoigne, I believe after putting out the fire you went away; you had a friend to conduct home you went away and came back again - A. I did. I came back sooner than half past eight, and then I made more particular examination of the combustibles.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to you that these combustibles were placed at these different places to set the house on fire - A. At first it did not; afterwards they did. I was in the house when the prisoner and his wife returned. I did not see him when he first came in; in about a minute after I did. He was in the passage when I first saw him. Some person told him, after a few minutes, that his writing-desk was broken open.</p>
               <p>Q. Writing-desk or book case was it - A. I am not certain which; he appeared very much distressed. and said he was a ruined man.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went there the first time did you observe whether there was a fire in the front parlour grate - A. I do not recollect. I do not think the door was open.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus. Tell us as near as you can the precise time when you called at this house - A. It might be between twenty and twenty-five minutes to eight.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore past the half hour - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. By your extingishing it so easy, the flames must have been recent - A. Not long.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it you that told Mr. Sturman that his writing-desk was broken open - A. It was not. He gave the child to his wife, and went as far as the door; then he returned into the back parlour, threw himself upon two chairs, exclaiming he was a ruined man.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any doubt that his distress was real - A. I did not attempt to form an opinion.</p>

               <p>Q. On Tuesday the 11th of January, do you remember the alarm being given - A. I do. I went into the house about twenty minutes before eight. When I first went in I saw a great light in the back parlour; it proceeded from the back parlour. I saw the fire burning very fierce. I called out to the maid servant to get me a light, which she did in the front parlour, and got a lighted candle. From thence we proceeded into the back kitchen. I got a pail, and some water; I throwed a pail of water upon the back parlour; and nearly extinguished it. I went down again, got another pail of water, and throwed after that. Mr. Levoigne was treading out the fire on the stairs on the outside of the parlour, that which had been on fire he had not extinguished. I saw the rags laying about. I saw the clothes-horse, the steps, and wood resting against the inside of the partition. I did not go into the front parlour until after the fire was extinguished. I found a very large fire there, and one poker in the fire red hot; the other poker standing up by the fire, I do not recollect whether that was hot or not. A quantity of fire wood untied was laid along from the door to the side-board close to the wainscot in the parlour.</p>

            . I am a police office of Bow-street office.</p>
               <p>Q. On the night of the 11th of January, were you sent for to this house on the alarm of fire - A. I was. I got there about half past eight; I examined all over the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any fastenings of the house broken - A. None at all. I examined every part; I could find no where whatever that any person had got into the house excepting with a key. When the prisoner and his wife returned I was up stairs; I came down; the prisoner was in the back parlour; he threw himself upon two chairs, exclaiming, he was a ruined man. While he was in this apparent distress, I took the candle and looked in his face; there did not appear any real distress; no tears at all. It struck me so forcibly that there was no real distress I told Mr. Reeves that if he would give the charge I would take him into custody. I saw the key in the door of the book-case; I took the candle, and looked at the locks of the doors; I could see no force at all. I cannot say I examined them very strictly, because I saw the keys.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got any part of the combustibles - A. Yes. I picked this up at the first step of the stairs, and partly on the floor; it was then as wet as if it had been dipped in a turpentine tub; it smells now strong of it, nothing like so strong as then. It is now quite dry. There were a vast many more tags on the stairs; that being the wettest I did not trouble myself with the others.</p>
               <p>Q. The fireman were left in possession of the house after that - A. Yes, they were.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Did you take the lock off and examine it - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot say whether it was picked or not - A. They said it was a patent lock. Mr. Bremmer I believe has offered an hundred guineas for any person that will pick any of his locks.</p>
               <p>MR. DENHAM. I am secretary of the Globe Insurance office. About three o'clock, the day after the fire, I went to this house. When I got there the firemen pointed out the different parts of the house that had been on fire. I asked the prisoner if he could account in any way for the accident of the fire being in his house, and whether he thought anybody had been wicked enough to do him a spite. He said, no, not any. I then asked him what time he went out on the preceding day; he said, about one o'clock and when he returned he found fire had taken place in his house; he could not explain that, nor give any other account. The next day I went into further particulars. I asked him whether he knew how the paper and hand-boxes came there. After some difficulty he said they came from his wife's bed room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say where the steps and the clothes-horse came from - A. He said they were usually kept below stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing about the keys of the door - A. He said he supposed the thieves must have entered by false keys. I asked him what keys he had; he said he had originally three; one he had lost in the month of August last by the servant or one of his lodgers, and that he had given his own servant a key to let herself in. I then said I supposed he kept the third himself. He did not give a positive answer. He said he did not know where it was. I then asked him whether there was any turpentine mixture in the house. He said, after some recollection, he believed there was some in the house. I asked him whether there were any remaining; he said he thought there might; I begged to see it; he said he had it to paint the house. He rang the bell;

               <p>Q. Did she know where to go for it - A. No. He had some difficulty in making her understand where she was to go for the stone bottles; he said out of the cupboard. She then asked, what cupboard; the cupboard down stairs? he said, no, in the pantry; and was going to shew her himself. She then appeared to understand, and went and brought a bottle in each hand. Upon her bringing the bottles he took the cork out, smelled it, and gave it me to smell, which smelled the same as the clothes were wetted with. He then examined the nose of the bottle, and said he did not think it had been recently opened, and asked me if I thought it had been recently opened; he thought not. I assented to it. I then asked him about his bank notes; he said he had lost about six hundred pounds, which he always kept in the book case. I said, you keep the key of the book case. He said, yes. I asked him if it was a key separate from the bunch of keys; he said, yes; the bunch of keys were kept by his wife, the key of the book case was kept by him. He shewed me a bundle of clothes that lay in the chair; he said he supposed they were intended to be taken also; they were two or three coats and a waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any children's clothes - A. Not on the chair. He said nothing more that day, I believe. On the Friday I went again and repeated my question with respect to the bank notes in particular. I asked him if he could give any account of the notes. He said, no, none; there was an account of them, but it was kept in the book with them. I asked him what the notes consisted of. He said they were of various amounts, in particular two or three of an hundred pounds each. I then said you can account, and say where you had all these notes. He said he had one or two or three of his lodgers; that he had them by him, some of them for two years. On my saying how extraordinary the robbery was he seemed much agitated.</p>

               <p>Q. Was china and glass in your valuation - A. There is not. I saw no china or glass in the house. I valued the things that I understood to be insured. Covington, the fireman, was in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. to Covington. Did you remain in the house until Mr. Raner valued the furniture - A. Yes. Nothing was removed out; I was there at the fire, and I was there then.</p>

The treaty broke off because there was not a good title to the lease.</p>

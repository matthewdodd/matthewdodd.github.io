                  </hi>. I am warehouseman to Mr. Alexander Ochterloney Greig and others, army clothiers, of 17, Coleman Street—the prisoner was in their employment up to about the end of September last as an occasional porter—he was then discharged because there was no work for him to do—he had a week's notice—there is a portion of our premises called the dock: at the left hand side of White Horse Yard—I believe this plan (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) to be correct—this dock, or dust-bin, is in fact a square room shut out from the body of the warehouse, but under the same roof, and is used for refuse, and to put a truck in—a little door opens from the warehouse into the dust-bin, and it is occasionally opened to throw in the dust from the count<lb></lb>ing-house, and other refuse, and there is an outer door through which the rubbish is taken when the place is full—a plank had been missing from there for some little time, and a truck stood against the door—on the evening of 20th October, about 6.30, my attention was called to the dust<lb></lb>bin, and I found the whole of the paper in it on fire—my son and I got water and <hi rend="italic">doused</hi> it out—we had the rubbish kicked out, and then found a mass of fire, quite at the back, all burning down beneath where I thought it was extinguished—in my opinion the fire had originated behind that door—it could not have arisen by accident; there was no light, or anything, from the premises that could have caused it—the dust-bin was covered over, and was under the warehouse; the missing panel left a space quite large enough for anyone to get through; anyone could put their hand through that, and apply a light—there is a water-closet there, but that is kept locked—there is no other convenience there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I am the managing man—the prisoner came into the service about June—he had a guinea a week—I had every reason to be satisfied with him, but had no further demand for his services from slack<lb></lb>ness of work—I told him so, I believe, about 30th September—I also told him that I would assist him if I could in getting another situation, and if we had more work he might be taken on again—he was recommended to us by Mr. Hollest, who has been his bail—he left on a Saturday—I think I saw him once afterwards at the door—he made no complaint when he left—I did not see him on the day of the fire—broken brown paper and the general dust of the place is swept into the dust-bin—sometimes we employ 200 men, at other times perhaps 70—some of them may smoke—I never heard of lucifers or vesuvians being swept into the dust-bin—it is emptied as soon as it is full—ashes are thrown into it—but it is sometimes four or five days before they are put in—I don't know that rag-pickers are in the habit of coming and poking about there—I never heard of it—the plank has been missing for some time, ever since the bricklayers were at work there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> That would be about two months before—the closet was kept locked and the key kept up stairs in the cutting room—it was locked on this night—I sent for it, seeing smoke issue from the closet—that is 6ft. or 8ft. from the dust-bin—I know the White Swan, there is a urinal there, about two or three minutes' walk from our place.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the son of the last witness—on the evening of 20th October, about 6.30, I saw through the crevices that there was a fire in the dock—I called my father's attention to it, and assisted him in put<lb></lb>ting it out—I had seen the prisoner that day in Coleman Street, and at dinner time, about 1 o'clock, in a public-house—and at different times after that—I was endeavouring to get a place for him—I had written him to that effect about a week before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I told him to come round in passing, to inquire—he left on perfectly good terms with us all—I first saw him on the 20th, at the front loop-hole in Coleman Street—I don't know whether he was inquiring for Lancaster, I did not hear him—between 2 and 3 o'clock I saw him at the Swan—he had a glass of beer with me, at the invitation of myself and another porter—I saw him again in the evening, about 6 o'clock, outside the loop-hole—Lancaster was then down stairs—I did not hear Lancaster say to the prisoner "By-the-bye, George, I owe you the price of a pot, if you wait until I am paid I will pay you"—the firm do pay on a Friday night—when I got into the dust-bin it was all on fire; we put some water in and then shovelled it out.</p>

I am a porter in the prosecutor's employ—I saw the prisoner at the Dolphin, on Friday, 20th October, from 1 to 2 o'clock—I had some beer with him—Boby, another porter, was with me—I left with him, about 2 o'clock, to go back to work, leaving the prisoner there—about 6.20 I saw him again—Roby and I were wheeling an empty truck from the factory to the dock, down Whitehorse Lane—we had to wheel the truck into the door of the dock, and up to the door of the dust-bin—as we came along I saw the prisoner coming from the dock—he was about two or three yards from the entrance into the dock—he came out sharp from the dock—he put his hand on the truck, and said "That is the way I can stop you"—we asked him what he was doing there—he said he was—about—we put the truck against the dust-bin, and went up stairs to our work—he went up the lane out in Coleman Street—he could not have got by us without our seeing him—it is a narrow place—it was nearly dark—there are gas lamps there, which would throw a light on him—about five or six minutes after we had left the truck, as we were clearing out the cutting shop, we saw smoke come up into the room—it is on the first floor—we went down and found the dock on fire, and Mr. Brown and his son were putting water on it—the truck had been moved when we got down—I had seen no one else near the dock but the prisoner—the lane is no thorough-fare—it is the access to Messrs. Burbidges' premises—there, is no urinal at the Dolphin—there is at the Swan—it would not take a minute to walk there—the prisoner was not smoking when we met him coming out of the dock—I did not smell any smoking.</p>

Greig—I told him they were, that I should be closing directly, and I should be outside and meet him—I owed him 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for a pot of beer—I came out the front way, in Coleman Street—there is no other way in or out—the prisoner knew that—I went back, and was shutting up the place, when Mr. Brown came and said there was a fire—I looked, and I could see it through the crevices—I got the key and opened the door, and went in with Mr. Brown—I should think that was about twenty minutes after I had seen the prisoner.</p>

             was nearest the fire, he was upon his legs, he had money in his hand, but whether it was a shilling or a sixpence I will not be positive, he instantly dropped it. Maurice Standford was at the left-hand side of the room, sitting at the door; but at the time I went in he instantly got up and dropped the money he had in his hand; the woman tossed the bason on the floor and broke it. Taylor, Elby, and myself, laid hold of the men in order to secure them (for they followed in a few seconds after I had burst the door open); we endeavoured to secure the men, there was some resistance, but no blows, they pushed us about but did not strike us, they put their hands in our handkerchiefs and endeavoured to get away; we secured them, and got them hand-cuffed; during the time we were struggling with the men, the woman laid hold of a bottle and run to the window, and pushed her hand against the casement window and it opened; she threw the bottle out, and some other things that she had been pretty active in throwing out, they were in parcels; there was a smart fire in the room, and upon the fire there was a gridiron, and upon the gridiron there was charcoal laid over the bars of the gridiron, and either one or the other of the parties threw the gridiron off the fire; near the fire I found some bad money, unfinished money; and the money that was in the bason that was before the woman, as much as was not thrown away, I picked up and put into my pocket; there was another bason in the room which I ordered Taylor to take the money out that was in it, (produces the money and other articles); this is the whole of the money that was in the bason, except the two or three shillings that I found by the fire-side. I also got this paper, containing these different articles, brick-dust, bread, and different things; also a cloth, which is called a scouring-cloth, which Richardson took out of the bed, and out of the cloth I took half-a-crown, three shillings pieces, and a sixpence; in that cloth there is falt, and some other articles; we found a pot in the room, with a bason with some sort of liquor in it, but in the scuffle most of the liquor was spilled, but what remained I ordered Richardson to take care of; we brought the prisoners to the Public-office, Shadwell.</p>

             sworn. - I am a Police-officer: I was employed in consequence of an information to go to the Feathers public-house; we got into the room, Rogers went in first, I followed him instantly; Rogers said, oh, I have catched you at work, have I; Elby followed me directly into the room; I immediately saw a bason stand at the foot of the bed, with liquor in it, and the woman sitting on the side of the bed; I saw the other two prisoners nearly close to the fire, there was a fire, and a gridiron upon it all covered over with charcoal; the men endeavoured to get away from Rogers and Elby; the woman went to the fire-place, took the gridiron off, and threw a bottle out of the window; I immediately called for Richardson to come up stairs, when he came up stairs the men resisted very much; I saw the shillings, the sixpences, and a dollar, lying upon the floor; I did not see either Palmer or Standford have any thing in their hands, I saw a dollar and some sixpences lay upon the floor where they both stood; we got them all secured, and looked about the room, and found a gallipot, it was full of a greenish mixture, and Palmer knocked it out of my hand and broke it into many pieces, the pot we got clear away; these are what I found, here are dollars, half-dollars, shillings, and sixpences, I found them at the foot of the bed; at the time when I found them they were white, the shillings, sixpences, and half-crowns, all entirely white; the woman was rubbing something between her fingers; I found nothing more.</p>

               <p>- ELBY sworn. - If found a counterseit dollar, and four other base pieces of metal, and a file with a piece of cork at the end.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Rogers.) Did you try any of the pieces with the materials that were there? - A. When I was before the Magistrates I tried the liquid in the presence of the prisoners, with a little of the falt, and the other stuff that is in this cloth, and it produced from these red blanks something exactly of the colour of shillings and sixpences; aquaforts is certainly some of the composition.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you saw the woman she had something between her fingers? - A. She had a sixpence between her fingers in this state, fit for circulation at the time; there were some of each kind fit for circulation; when they are dry they are fit for circulation, but there were some not dry.</p>

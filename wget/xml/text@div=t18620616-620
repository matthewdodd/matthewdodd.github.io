                  </hi>. I am the wife of Philip Sharer, of 11, Grange<lb></lb>crescent, Sunderland, and am staying at 60, Thornhill-square, Islington—on Wednesday, 28th May, I was going to Greenwich with my son—he took the tickets and paid for them, and we were waiting for the boat, on the wooden quay at Upper Thames-street, when I felt my pocket touched very slightly—I turned round and saw the prisoner Davi just turning on his heel away from me—he walked away, and my son came up; he had left me a moment and it was while he was away that I felt my pocket touched—when I felt the touch I put my hand in my pocket and found my purse gone—I said to my son, "My pocket has been picked; that person was close to my side, he must have taken it away"—I pointed Davi out to my son, and said, "We must keep him in view; we must not let him escape"—we walked up the pier and when he saw us following him he turned and went on to a boat that was waiting there—I spoke to an elderly gentleman that was near, and told him, and we went on board the boat—I did not see him on board the boat; I just looked on board and saw he was not there—when I came back the gentle<lb></lb>man had told the captain of the steamboat of it—when I came back I saw Davi in the cabin looking out of the window—I saw him turn his back and cast a look under his hat, and I saw that it was him—it was the cabin window of the boat I had seen him go into—I pointed him out immediately to the mate, and the mate said there were two persons on board—he was given into custody—the purse contained three sovereigns, one half-sovereign, two florins, and six shillings in silver—I believe there was a penny and a piece of gold beater's skin besides—Davi was the only person near me at the time I felt my pocket touched.</p>

I am mate of the Black Prince steamboat, which was lying alongside of the pier at London-bridge last Wednesday fortnight—I was in the cabin eating my dinner, about half-past 12—there was a fire near me—the two prisoners came downstairs, almost falling down, they were in such a hurry—they sat down opposite me, with their knees together and their bodies away from one another, and their hands down between their bodies—I saw Davi roll up some paper and throw it in the fire, and the other one I saw scuffle towards the second port and throw something out of the window; it shone with the sun on it like gilt or brass—the pier man then came down, not Mr. Mackay, but the other one—he came before Mrs. Sharer, and then he went up again and said to the lady, "Come down," and she pointed out Davi directly, and he was taken into custody, and Wilson also about two minutes afterwards.</p>

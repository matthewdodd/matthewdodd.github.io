Yes; on the the 27th of last September I made an agreement for a quantity of lignum vitae; on the 2d of December I brought it to my own premises; some little time afterwards I missed some of it; I bought seventeen hundred weight, I gave seventeen shillings a hundred, I had it put in my lost; I purchased it of Mr. Wood.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any of those pieces on the premises of Mr. Cook? - A. Yes, three pieces, they are here; this is one of the pieces, I know it by the shoulder, I had seen it in my lost ten times in a day.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether Wardell knew you purchased any lignum vitae wood of Mr. Wood. - A. Yes, he was my foreman, he had the management of my business when I was out of the way. There is no mark on any of the pieces of wood; I know this piece of wood, it has a limb, it is an uncommon shape, it is prime wood, I can swear to that piece of wood.</p>

             sworn. Examined by Mr. Pooley. I am a block maker, I live at Bermondsey.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at any time sell any lignum vitae wood to Mr. Seaborne. - A. Yes, about a ton and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. After that wood was delivered to Mr. Seaborne, did you see any wood upon Mr. Cook's premises that you had sold. - A. Yes, these three sticks, and I considered them as part of a lot I once had; prior to that I had lost a quantity, I then could not tell whether it was a part that I sold, or whether it was stolen from me, but I am sure these three pieces of wood were in my possession.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been in the trade a great many years,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180602190032"></xptr>can a person in the trade who has it under his eye swear to it. - A. Men who constantly work at this kind of wood can swear to them; if I had a piece of wood I could speak to it the same as I can tell one man's face from another. Wardell took me to Mr. Cook's, he showed me the wood he had bought of Paxman.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that he told you that he had bought the wood of Paxman; did he know that Paxman was charged. - A. Yes; he picked out the wood at Cook's immediately, and said they were the three pieces of wood that he purchased of Paxman; this is one, and that is another. (shewing them.)</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was it you went with Wardell to Cook's. - A. I think it was on the 30th.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you went to Cook's you went to Neal's. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of what passed at Neal's do you remember talking to Cook about your finding some wood that had been stolen from you. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you remember your expression, saying, Neale sells some blocks so cheap, I called on him for some money yesterday, and there I saw some wood that belonged to me. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell 
               <persName id="t18060219-29-person341">Wardell</persName>
             that Neal told you that the wood which he had, which you claimed, was what Neal bought of Paxman. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon this did not Wardell directly say, yes, I have had some wood of Paxman which I have sold to Cook, and Paxman told me that he bought it of a shipwright. - A. It may be so.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not the fact that he had told you before about the three pieces that he had sold to Mr. Cook. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And that Paxman, when he sold them to Wardell, he said, he (Paxman) had bought them of a shipwright. - A. Yes, he pointed out the pieces of wood, when he went with me, which he had sold to Mr. Cook.</p>
               <p>Q. And he went with you to apprehend Paxman. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. All this before Mr. Seaborne knew that the wood was at Mr. Cook's. - A. I told Seaborne that I had found some wood that I had in my possession, that was after this; I saw Wardell and Paxman together.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Paxman taken up. - A. He was not in the the hands of an officer; Wardell was in search of him, apparently so, if I may judge of his actions; he took him at a public house, and wished me to follow him; as such I went to an headborough, when I returned, Paxman and Wardell was gone; we went to another public house where we found Wardell; he said I have lost Paxman; he has gone out at the back door, and was gone down the Commercial road.</p>
               <p>Q. Wardell attended before the magistrate as a witness. - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. He was suffered to go at large. - A. He was; on the first day he found bail.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pooley. Whether at the time that Wardell went with you to Cook's shop, did he know that Paxman was suspected. - A. I believe he did know that Paxman was suspected; that Paxman was suspected of the theft there can be no doubt, because Mr. Neal pointed out to me that Paxman was the person who sold it.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you at any time go to any public house called the Ship on the Ground, along with Paxman. - A. Yes on the 21st of January, he desired me to go there to take a bit of wood, to go up the Highway to cut it.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came there did Paxman bring out any wood. - A. Yes.</p>

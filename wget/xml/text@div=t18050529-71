             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. I believe you are a <rs id="t18050529-71-viclabel400" type="occupation">watch maker</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18050529-71-victim627 t18050529-71-viclabel400"></join>, residing in Jermyn-street, St. James's - A. I am; the prisoner at the bar called at my house prior to the 19th of April, and shewed me a bill drawn on the Duke of Leinster, for a thousand pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he leave the bill with you then? - A. No, he did not; I told him that was not the bill that he shewed me before; he had shewed me one before for a thousand pounds, when I let him out of jail, I had it in my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. When he came on the 19th of April he shewed you another, what was that first bill? - A. It was nearly the same sort of a bill; it was three days over due, when he shewed it me in January, and that he shewed me in April was due in July to come; he told me that the bill he shewed me in January was paid; I told him I would endeavour to get the bill discounted, on condition that he would take some goods; he said he had no objection.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the bill coming due next July? - A. Yes, he told me that he had lent the Duke of Leinster four thousand pounds in cash, and he had four of these bills; he asked me when he should call again; I told him he might call in two or three days; he called at that time and I told him my friend was not in town, he must call again in two or three days more; he called in two or three days more; I told him that I had asked my friend concerning it, and it was such a heavy bill he would not discount it; he then said he had seen a person of the name of West in great distress, and had given him half a guinea, he had formerly told me that that man had nearly ruined him by drawing bills on each other. On the 19th of April he tendered me the bill; prior to that I had sent him word, that if the bill was a just bill, I would try and get it discounted.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any agreement made between you, upon what terms the bill should be discounted? - A. Two hundred pounds worth of goods, and five hundred pounds money; I told him I was afraid I should not be able to procure so much money; he said four hundred pounds money and two hundred pounds goods and the remaining four hundred pounds should be settled by two or three bills, payable at three or four month's date.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you desire to have the bill for any purpose? - A. I said, sir, I am going to take this bill of a thousand pounds; I should like to let a friend of mine have it, to know if the signature was right: I asked him to go with me to a friend of mine, who knew the hand-writing; he said, no, he would go and get a pint of ale, while I went to enquire about the signature of the bill.</p>
               <p>Q. He left the bill with you for that purpose? - A. He did; I went to Mr. Ogleby, and, in consequence of what Mr. Ogleby said, I went to Lord

            , and there I saw the Duke's daughter; I believe she is about eighteen years old; she said that was never her father's writing; after that I went to the Police office and saw Mr. Conant; in about ten minutes I saw the prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180505290050"></xptr>brought into the office; I remained there till he came; I produce the bill, it has been in my keeping ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. In the month of January did you know him to be in confinement? - A. Yes, I was a creditor to a bill of thirty pounds, he paid me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he set at liberty on paying you your whole demand? - A. Partly; I took ten pounds, and the custody was about four pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. You had entered an action upon him? - A. A detainer was lodged, while he was in the Fleet.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Const. Q. Was that a debt of his own, payable by him, or any body else? - A. A bill of his acceptance.</p>
               <p>Q. In January he was let out of the Fleet; this bill was presented to you after that; you knew his situation? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then when the bill was presented, you went into a negociation, after you knew that? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. And it terminated that your friend declined, therefore you gave it up? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you afterwards sent to him, not he to you? - A. I did, I believe it might be two or three weeks afterwards; I sent to him that I thought I had a friend; I had a channel that I could get it discounted; I was going to take part gold and part money of the refiners; I am in the habit of doing it, when people will take goods out of the shop, and sometimes I deal with a Jew broker for the money; there are different channels to persons who do not keep a banker; I had the mode of doing it, and sent for him for that purpose, allowing the bill to be just; I had another reason, as well as the reason assigned; I am parish constable, and I spoke of the transaction to Mr. Conant, the Magistrate; Mr. Conant told me there was something of forged paper belonging to the Duke of Leinster, and he wished me to get it, to send to the relations of the Duke.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether having been informed that particularly from him, whether that was not the reason, and the only reason, that you sent to him to get the bill? - A. No, it was not; my reasons were more than one; and if the bill was just the man should have the money, he should have the bill discounted; if not, as I was a parish constable, the man might be apprehended.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been under any embarrassments yourself? - A. I have been here, as many an innocent honest man before, about thirteen years ago; a poor man came to me one morning, a tailor, who made my clothes, and said he had taken an old gold watch of a foreigner; I was a journeyman then, and he wished to make money of part of it; I told him the best mode would be to sell the case, and have a metal case for himself.</p>
               <p>Q. The man from whom you had the watch was indicted-were you? - A. I went voluntarily.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not you sent to prison? - A. I certainly was sent to prison.</p>
               <p>Q. And certainly indicted, and certainly tried at the bar? -</p>
               <p>- CLEATHEROW sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gleed. Q. You live with the last witness? - A. I do, as a shopman and workman.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the person of the prisoner at the bar? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 19th of April, do you recollect his coming to Mr. Sargeant's house? - A. I do, about ten o'clock, and there was some conversation about a bill; the prisoner brought the bill, for Mr. Sargeant to discount it for him; the prisoner produced the bill; Mr. Sargeant said he would wish to go to Mr. Ogleby, to see whether the bill was right or not; Mr. Sargeant said he would go to a friend and asked the prisoner if he chose to go with him: he refused it, and said he had walked a good way that morning. that he had come from Hampstead or Highgate, and was very dry; Mr. Sargeant told him, if he did not chuse to go with him, he would find a house in the street that sold good ale; Mr. Sargeant went, and the prisoner said he could drink a pint of ale, he would go and have it while Mr. Sargeant was out; he went out. The prisoner returned first, and Mr. Sargeant returned afterwards; Mr. Sargeant said he was not fully satisfied, he would go to another friend; Mr. Sargeant left the house a second time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. How long did the prisoner stay after Mr. Sargeant went out the second time? - A. Till the officer fetched him; about a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. He had an opportunity, if he chose, to have gone away; there was nobody to hold him? - A.Exactly so.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he ever tell you how he came by that bill? - A. He did; I was afraid it came from a money broker; he said it was for goods sold to the Duke of Leinster, that they were delivered to

            ; I produced the letter then, and compared it in Hitchin's presence; the copy of the bill in the letter corresponded with the bill; I have got that letter about me; I asked him about that bill particularly; he having spoken to Mr. Hurd, he rather declined entering into the particulars of the other bills, which were not become due, (the bill read in Court.) I told him, before I could consider it a proper claim, it was necessary that he should give me the particulars of the consideration given for the bill; - he stated that he was entirely ignorant as to the purpose for which the money was borrowed; he said that 2000 l. were paid to the Duke on the day of the date of the bills, at the York coffee-house, in St. James's-street, in the presence of Davenport Sedley, and others, in bank-notes of two thousand pounds; he did not say who the other persons were, and he declined saying any thing about the bills but that over due; this was on February, the others were not due.</p>

               <p>Q.Did you give any hopes of paying the other bills? - A. None; I then gave positive answer at that time, and refused paying that bill till further satisfactory proof was given.</p>

               <p>Mr. Const. Q. I do not know, sir, whether you are interested in the personal estate? - A. Not in the personal estate; in the real estate, by my wife's jointure, to the amount of three thousand a year.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether you are interested contingently? - A. It is precisely so, upon the charge of the land; no other way.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. Q. You married the Dutchess Dowager of Leinster, whose jointure is paid out of this estate; you were of course acquainted with the late Duke of Leinster? - A. Yes, intimately; he was at my house the day before he left London.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you acquainted with his hand-writing? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you be so obliging as to look at that bill (witness looking at the bill) Do you believe the signature, Leinster, to be the signature of the late Duke of Leinster? - A. I really think it is not the Duke's hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const Q. Are you acquainted with the Dukes's hand-writing, so as to say you have no doubt of it? - A. I cannot say that I have; yet, I could not say that it is impossible that the Duke of Leinster wrote that, because a man may not write like himself at all times - In my own opinion it has not been written by him, I have reasons for thinking so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. Look at that, that is the Duke's writing? - A. Certainly (a letter shewn the witness.)</p>
               <p>Q. That is prior to this? - A. If I were to go into the difference, I could point them out, if you desire it; if you press me I will; the Duke of Leinster, whenever he wrote a letter, he never 
               <persName id="t18050529-71-person641">drew</persName>
             a line under that signature; when he wrote a a frank, he did; I have every reason to believe that this is not his hand-writing; the two last letters of his name were generally written in a looser character, and rather sloping, and never finished.</p>

            , and knowing the number of the house, I dismounted and knocked at the door; there came out a woman; I asked if that was Mr. Hitchen's dwelling.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good as to look at that letter, and see whether that is the letter by which you went to the house? - A. This is the letter which instructed me where to go. I thought it was 16, it is 13.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of appearance had the house? - A. The woman opened the door, and I asked her if she belonged to him; she said, I am his wife, will you walk in; I said by all means; she shewed me into a little room at the right hand, there I saw four girls, working at the needle; when I got into the room, I asked the woman for Mr. Hitchin; she said he was not at home; from the general appearance of the house it did not appear to be inhabited by any body of wealth; it was a little house; I have had the pleasure of being intimate with the Duke of Leinster from the year 1774; I was very intimate with him till the time he left Dublin; he was a particular friend of mine indeed; I left Ireland the beginning of last November; I had many conversations with him after he returned to Ireland: he died in October. He told me in Ireland that he rated his living; he confined himself to six thousand a year, and of late years his habits of living were much more moderate than they had been.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you so familiarly acquainted with his hand-writing? - A. I do know as much about his hand-writing as I do about my own; I cannot know my own better than I do his; I was in the habit of corresponding with him; I have seen him write very often.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at Leinster on that bill - Having looked at it carefully, is it your opinion that it is the Dukes's hand-writing; I do verily believe that it is not the hand-writing of the Duke; I cannot swear that it is not, but I verily believe, upon my oath, that it is not the hand-writing of the Duke; the prisoner at the bar shewed me another bill.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. The letter which you looked at referred you to the house at Islington? - A. Yes, it was nearly the centre house of the Crescent.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you write him any note? - A. I was going to relate - I asked her when she thought he would be at home; I said, madam, give me a pen and ink; I wrote a note, and, in consequence of that note, the prisoner called on me the next day; I then said to him, sir, will you let me look at the bill; he took his pocket-book out and shewed me a bill, and when I saw it, I said, sir, this comes in a questionable shape; my thought was about the signature.</p>
               <p>Court Q. Did you say they were forged? - A. No, I said they were in a questionable shape. Upon that General Ross came in, and mixed with the party; this was at St. James's hotel; I believe this was in January last, when General Ross came in, I said, General Ross, this is the gentleman who says he has a demand upon the Duke of Leinster; I had a long conversation with the prisoner before General Ross came in; I said to him, I do think it right to communicate to you the conversation that I have had with this gentleman previous to your coming in; I then repeated the conversation, as my memory served me; then the prisoner began to talk to Sir

            , and in his conversation he appeared to be rather confused; in a little time after the prisoner left the room; before he left the room he said, sir, I will call upon you to-morrow, about this hour; he did call upon me the next morning, and he began charging me with severe language; he charged me with saying it was a fraud; why, said I, Mr. Hitchin, I cannot conceive that I said the word fraud; sir, said he, you did, you told me that it came in a questionable shape, and that it was a fraud; I said, upon my word, Mr. Hitchin, as well as my memory serves me, I do not think that I made use of that word; he said, sir, you did, and you embarrassed me that I did not know what I said; he still urged, and fixed it on me in so peremptory a manner, that I said, if you will have it so, put the cap on your own head, in the name of God; let it remain so. I said, how came you acquainted with the Duke; why, said he, sir, I never saw him but once, until I lent him the money; I was walking in the street, with a gentleman of the name of Sedley, and said he, he spoke to Sedley; I said, who is that; Sedley said, that is the Duke of Leinster whom I want you to lend four thousand pounds; I said, where did you lend him this money; we met at the York coffee-house, in St. James's-street; there Sedley and I went, and there I lent him the money. I said, it is a most extraordinary thing that could be advanced; not a third person mentioned in the bill to pay to the drawer a thousand pounds; if there was a third person, it would be a greater proof of its being a substantial bill; I said, it is a thing that astonishes me; I think he said he had drawn many bills of the same kind for large sums of money, and that it was the best way.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he at any time state what he had given to the Duke, by way of consideration for these bills? - A. I do not know any further than he paid him the money at the coffee-house all at one time.</p>

               <p>Accepted, Leinster.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. In 1797, I commenced the corn and cheese trade, near Namptwich, in Cheshire. I imported a great quantity of corn from America and Holland, and various other places. I was very fortunate for a considerable time, and was at last worth seven thousand pounds, when all of a sudden it happened I had the loss of a vessel from Boston, laden with goods, shipped by Wainwright and Co. by which I lost three thousand pounds; I got account of the loss of the ship Sally, before I got an account of her lading, to get her insured by the underwriters; a short time after I heard of the loss of another vessel from London; she took fire at Ramsgate; by her I lost one thousand pounds; then I had the Friendship, bound to - , which was taken by the French, by her I lost two thousand six hundred pounds. In January, 1801, this made it necessary for me to stop, and I was made a bankrupt; in May, 1801, I delivered up in money and goods, to my assignees, sixteeen shillings in the pound; the assignees and creditors that were then present signed my certificate, and told me, if the remainder of the creditors living abroad did sign my certificate, they assured me then there was no doubt but that the other creditors would all sign, I then should not be molested, or put about by any thing that might come against me; I went down to Liverpool, a distance of thirty-six miles from my assignees, in the July following, immediately after finishing my last examination, and with reliance on their saying they would not hurt me, I commenced the corn and cheese trade again; I then dealt very largely, and shipped goods to Ireland, and reshipped corn to Liverpool; I was then successful and very well respected, and could have had credit to a great amount; at last I had a malicious person, who told my new creditors that I was a bankrupt, and that my former assignees would make me pay twenty shillings in the pound, and that the new creditors would not have a shilling in the pound; in consequence of that my new creditors fell upon me at once; most of my property was in Ireland; some at Waterford and some in Dublin; this was in the year 1802; at that time I owed five thousand one hundred and eighty-six pounds; some of my creditors, who did not know that I had been a bankrupt before, struck a new commission out against me; I was going to Ireland, in order to settle my debts for my new creditors, as I called them. On my returning from Ireland, immediately on finding myself a bankrupt, I came up to London, in the year 1802, and employed Mr. Hurd. When the second commission was superseded I applied to my creditors for a letter of licence, in order to satisfy my new creditors; after some time my creditors granted me a letter of licence for six months, in order that I might get this property; at the expiration of the six months I collected four thousand three hundred and sixty pounds fifteen shillings; during the time I was collecting this property my assignees were doing all in their power to get this property. In March, 1805, I got my certificate signed by a sufficient number of creditors, and during the time I was endeavouring to get my certificate signed, I did not wish to be squandering the four thousand three hundred and fifty pounds. I wished to keep it, in order to satisfy my new creditors when I got my certificate.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180505290054"></xptr>Court. Q. If I understand you right, you wanted to employ this money so as to have something to live on? - A. Yes, if I could do it without the knowledge of the assignees, I living in London; in consequence of that, at the time of the great loss of the West-India fleet, which you all must know was in April 1804, I thought it very possible to get five or six hundred pounds by purchasing a ship for that trade; I went down to Hull in May 1804, and ordered Messrs. Callendart to look out a ship, and let me know the price; they did look out one, which was the Thomas and Sally, the property of one Gledow (I have got the letter in Court,) I ordered him to buy her for four thousand three hundred and fifty pounds, the price that was agreed on. The price of vessels taking a rapid advance, made them run off from the bargain; they were to new sheath her, which they declining to do, made about five hundred pounds difference; the bargain broke off intirely. On my coming up to London in the beginning of June, I met with a gentleman of the name of Sedley, who had been introduced to me about half a year before by a gentleman in a coffee-house, whom I am now sorry to hear is a man of a very dishonest character. This Sedley is a gentleman who forces his conversation upon people, and he is in all appearance a gentleman-like man; he has a great deal to say for himself, and very seducing ways with him; we entered into conversation together, and our conversation led to the subject of the purchasing of the ship that I had been making at Hull; he said that he thought I might make more of the money, if I would be led by him, and more secret for myself; he invited me to his house, which made a respectable appearance indeed; he had two daughters elegantly dressed, and several gentlemen in the room. During the conversation he expressed himself to be acquainted with almost every great person in the kingdom - that he was acquainted with the Duke of Wexford, and the Duke of Leinster; he also shewed me letters from a number of them; he told me that the Duke of Wexford had applied to him for the loan of five thousand pounds; I told him if he was a good personal security, I should have no objection; I went with Sedley, according to appointment, to the hotel, the right hand going up St. James's-street; his Grace was then engaged in business we were informed, by whom he was sure to get supplied. When we came out of the hotel, Sedley and I stood at the door a few minutes, and a gentleman passed by, whom Sedley immediately saluted; he said to me, that is the Duke of Leinster, and if he is now wanting of money, we cannot possibly have a better security under heaven; he said, shall I ask him; I replied I had no objection, and he followed him immediately. The Duke, I, and Sedley, appointed to meet on the Monday following, on the 9th of July, at the York coffee-house in that street; on Monday, the 9th of July, previous to our meeting the Duke at the York coffee-house, Sedley called upon me at my lodgings in Mansell-street, Goodman's-fields; he said he came to know if I had made any inquiry respecting the Duke, and whether I would advance the money to the Duke; I told him I had made my inquiries, and that I would advance the Duke two or three thousand pounds. Soon after we arrived at the York coffee-house, at two o'clock, the Duke made his appearance at the York coffee-house, and after some conversation I agreed to lend the Duke four thousand pounds at six, eight, ten, and twelve months date; I desired Sedley to walk out of the room, in order that I might know what I was to have for the loan of four thousand pounds; the Duke agreed to give me five thousand pounds for the loan of it; I 
               <persName id="t18050529-71-person647">drew</persName>
             the four bills in question, and the Duke accepted them in the presence of this Sedley. Sedley having returned to me, I 
               <persName id="t18050529-71-person648">drew</persName>
             the four bills in the presence of this Sedley, and paid two thousand pounds, and the Duke directed me to call at Mrs. Howard's on the 13th; I was not prepared; I wrote a note, desiring his Grace to meet me at my house in two or three days, in order that he might receive the balance; his Grace was punctual to that appointment, and received the remainder, one thousand five hundred pounds, at my lodgings in Goodman's-field. Previous to my lending the Duke the four thousand pounds, Sedley assured me, that if I wanted money, he would get a gentleman or two, or a thousand, that would discount a bill at any time; he never did; in consequence of which we quarrelled very frequently, for I not only parted with all the money I had to the Duke, but troubled my friends to get the money discounted at what we call common interest. By Sedley disappointing me, I got arrested, and in a very short space there were eight hundred pounds against me; there were two writs against me besides, which you have heard in Court, that the officer took my word for, besides all the other actions. I had got these bills, and no person would discount them for me, and my friends whom I have here would not bail me; I owed better than five thousand pounds; all this while I had never satisfied my new creditors; my friends said it was no use to bail me, my other creditors might do the same, and I might be in prison all my life-time for my new debts; at the same time I had no doubt; I rested fully assured it was the Duke of Leinster who had accepted these bills, and I was convinced in my own mind that these bills would be paid when they became due; thus I buoyed myself up in the best manner I could. In this distressed situation I was cast into Newgate; I remained<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180505290055"></xptr>there till the 11th of January, when Sedley called upon me very frequently, and promised that he would get these bills discounted for me, which, on the contrary, he never did. When I was in the Fleet, finding by the London papers that his Grace was dead, and that he died in Ireland on the 20th of October, I wrote to Mr. Berrisford, the banker, in Dublin, and informed him that I had four bills of exchange, for which I had accommodated the late Duke of Leinster with money for them; they replied to my letter, as I was a stranger to them, they would thank me for a reference. On the 16th of January, I presented the bill at Thomas's hotel, where it was payable; the book-keeper informed me that they had no orders whatever; they informed me that Lord

             was in town, and the young Duke, but that Mr. Ogleby was the most likely person to inform me who were the executors; I went to Mr. Ogleby, and he was not at home; there I left a copy of the bill and my address, and desired Mr. Ogleby to drop me a line who were the executors. I then called on Mr. Sargeant, in Jermyn-street; I shewed him the bill, and asked him if he knew of a notary who lived in that neighbourhood; he did tell me of one, but I did not go; Mr. Sargeant informed me that he worked for some of the family. On the next morning I received a letter from Mr. Ogleby's servant, saying that Lord Henry was either executor or guardian to the young Duke; I called several times on Lord Henry Fitzgerald at Miller's hotel, Jermyn-street, before I could have an interview with his Lordship. At length I saw him; I gave his Lordship the bill, and told him my business; he desired me to give him the particulars of the bill, as his solicitor was in Ireland on the business; I went home, and wrote a copy of the four bills and the transaction, and left them with the landlord of Miller's hotel. In a few days afterwards I wrote again to his Lordship, and then Lieutenant-general Ormsby called at my house, where I have lived ever since I came up to London, for better than three years.</p>

               <p>Q. I understood you to say you lived in Goodman's-fields? - A. Yes, in winter-time, it is too far to go to Islington, and then I live in the City. General

             left a note. I waited on him the next morning, in consequence of his saying it came in a questionable shape, and I being an innocent person, not supposing but it was a regular transaction with me and the Duke, it preyed on my feelings. I called the next morning to know what he meant by that expression, and if he did not say it was a fraud, it was the same thing as a fraud, as I had given a consideration for the bills. I called on my solicitor, Mr. Hurd, and desired him to write to Lord

             for the demand, which he did. I wrote to Lord Henry, desiring to know who was the solicitor employed in Ireland; I received a letter, and I waited on Mr. Trebeck, and my solicitor went along with me, as Mr. Trebeck did not wish to ask me any questions alone; he was not at home; the next morning, as I was going, I met Mr. Trebeck, and he informed me that the executors could not pay me till they were better informed; I met Mr. Trebeck in March, I think it was in Oxford-street. I desired my solicitor, on the very day I met Mr. Trebeck, to take out a writ to recover this money, and told him that I had a very able body of people to contend with, as I was informed by General Ormsby that he meant to file a bill against me to prove the hand-writing; I had entered my action in the Court of Common Pleas, on the 13th of March; I desired Mr. Hurd to retain three Counsel - one in the Common Pleas, one in the Chancery, and one in the Exchequer, being confident that I should have to prove the value given for the bills, and the hand-writing. I left the bill along with a friend of mine at Liverpool; I was offered several times eight hundred and nine hundred pounds for it; I would not take the money, not doubting the validity of the bill; I came up to London, and offered it to Mr. Sargeant; if I could have disposed of it by a trifling loss, I would; he said he should see his friend, and if I would call again, he would inform me. I did call again; he gave me an answer that he had seen his friend, and that his friend could not discount the bill, for cash was very scarce, even for bankers' bills; he went to Sedley after that, to know where I lived; Mr. Sedley wrote a letter to me by Mr. Sargeant's desire, saying that Mr. Sargeant would give eight hundred pounds, and two hundred pounds in goods for the bill. I thought if I could dispose of the bill to keep quiet a few fractious creditors, I would; I went to Mr. Sargeant, and I gave him the bill, I knew he was acquainted with the family; I went to a public-house to get a pint of ale, I had walked a long way that morning; he returned, and took me into a little room; he gave me a glass of liquor of some kind; he said, you had better tell me what is the lowest money you will take; I said I wanted to dispose of this bill to quiet a small number of my refractory creditors; he then said he would give me nine hundred and twenty pounds for the bill, and a five guinea watch for my wife; I was to pay the common interest for the nine hundred and twenty pounds; I waited in the shop till he sent the officer to take me.</p>
               <p>DAVENPORT SEDLEY sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - A. Yes, I have been acquainted with him eighteen months.</p>
               <p>Q. You, I believe, transact the business of lending money; you have been in that business? - A. I have.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180505290056"></xptr>Q. Do you remember having any intercourse with the prisoner respecting money? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it? - A. The earlier part of July; in the earlier part of April, prior to then, I was applied to by the Duke of Leinster to enquire amongst my connection if I could borrow the sum of four thousand pounds; I had not an opportunity of finding out a person who had such a sum of money to lend. A similar application was made to me by the Duke of - . In consequence of that application I went along with him to the hotel, in St. James-street, to propose or offer a sum of money to a nobleman who had applied, that lived in the hotel; on our going together to the hotel, we received word from Lord - that the nobleman had been supplied with what he wanted; in consequence we left the house, and in getting out into the street we stopped some little time together to know which way each party was going; I was going over Westminster bridge, and while we were in conversation the Duke of Leinster happened to go by.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was this? - A. On the 5th of July; he rather nodded and waved his hand to me, upon which I took my hat off and made a salute; I immediately observed to Mr. Hitchin that as the other nobleman, who wanted on a former occasion, had been supplied, probably the Duke would be glad to have the money; Mr. Hitchin desired me to offer it to him. I went after the Duke and mentioned the matter to him; I immediately returned with him, and in the presence of Mr. Hitchin, I mentioned the matter to the Duke. The Duke observed that he wanted money, and it would be particularly convenient to him to borrow at that time, upon which Mr. Hitchin requested a few days to consider of it, and they fixed upon a meeting four days afterwards, which was to have been at a coffee-house, almost opposite where we stood at that time, the York coffee-house in St. James's-street; we then parted, and at two o'clock, or near that hour, on the ninth of the same month, we again all met, and nobody else with us, as I can recollect, when a conversation ensued between Mr. Hitchin and the Duke; Mr. Hitchin said he had enquired about the Duke's solvency, or words to that effect, and that, as far as four thousand pounds went, he should have no objection to take his Grace's security, in bills of exchange, for he expected to convert them to that use, and that would answer his purpose equal to money, but that then he could not pay the whole amount, but should pay him down two thousand pounds, and in three or four days after he should settle the business with his Grace, in case a negociation should take place; at which moment Mr. Hitchin requested of me to retire for a few moments; I went into another part of the coffee-room while the Duke and Mr. Hitchin were in conversation, and remained till I was called to come forward, at which time Mr. Hitchin pulled out from his pocket-book four different bill-stamps, and began to draw one bill, and as soon as he had written the one thousand with an L before it, the Duke observed to him, as I am to have the balance of this money on the 13th, date your bills on that day, and come to me, I believe, to the best of my recollection, it was No. 7, Portland-road, or Portland-place; it was there he appointed Mr. Hitchin to come, and prior to my quitting the coffee-house, four bills of exchange of one thousand pounds each were drawn by Mr. Hitchin, upon the Duke of Leinster, payable at Thomas's hotel, in Berkley-square, which were dated on the thirteenth of July, to the best of my recollection, at six, eight, ten, and twelve months after date, payable to Hitchin or order, to which four bills I saw the Duke write Leinster, and he handed them over to Mr. Hitchin, upon which he took up some Bank notes that were lying by him: he counted them and turned them over, and said very well, or words to that effect; upon which Mr. Hitchin and I left the room, and went away. That is the whole sequel that I know.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Raine.. Q. You have first of all said, you have been in the habit of lending money; your business was in money transactions? - A I used to do so certainly, when I had an opportunity.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is it ago since you had the last transaction? - A. I have not for these last seven or nine months.</p>
               <p>Q. Probably not, you have been in custody for the greater part of that time; I believe you have been in confinement for about seven months of that time? - A. I have, within that time for debt: I was brought first to Newgate, and from thence to the Fleet.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner and you were both together in the Fleet? - A. We certainly were; the last money transaction that I had was with a Mr. Haines, about a month or six weeks before I got arrested.</p>
               <p>Q. During your money transactions, had you ever occasion to advertise? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Never is actually wrong? - A. Not for these twenty-five years.</p>
               <p>Q. Then twenty-five years ago you did? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What name did you go by? - A. No other name but my own.</p>
               <p>Q. You are an Irishman, are not you? - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were last brought from Ireland you were brought in custody? - A. I was; it was on a fallacious charge; a charge that did not exist.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray what may be the means of your subsistence? - A. From a great many sources indeed - One general source is, that I have had an intercourse<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180505290057"></xptr>between people who had money to lend, and people of fortune who wanted to borrow money; I have been engaged in mining down in Wales, near Pontipool; that I left off last February was a twelvemonth; I got some money by speculation in Wales; perhaps I got ten or fifteen pounds in a day; sometimes buying a load of coals, and sending them down the canal.</p>
               <p>Q. You never knew who the particular man was who advanced the money? - A. I never did; I saw a parcel of Bank notes; some of two hundred pounds, which I understood to be so put into the hands of the Duke by Hitchin, and I saw the Duke of Leinster put into the hands of Hitchin bills to the amount of four thousand pounds; that he did in my presence.</p>
               <p>Q. Nobody was by to see this transaction but yourself? - A. No, only us three.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if any body had said there were other persons there, that is not true? - A. Certainly not, there were no more at the table; only us three.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

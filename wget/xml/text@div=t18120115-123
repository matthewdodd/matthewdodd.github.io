               <p>- JENNETT. I am a painter and glazier, 15, Compton-place, Brunswick-square. I was coming up <placeName id="t18120115-123-crimeloc730">Marchmont-street</placeName>

               <p>Q. Is he a butcher - A. Yes, in Marchmont-street. I thought they were suspicious character; I passed them, and when I got to the top of the street I crossed over nearly opposite, I saw the two prisoners near Mr. Woodhatch's door; Drew reached over the partition which parts the shop from the private door, and drew over a piece of beef, and rolled it in his apron, and walked away; Holland looked into his apron as he was rolling it in. I went and told Mr. Woodhatch that a man had taken his beef away; I pointed out to him the man that had got the beef. Mr. Woodhatch took him back to the shop. I took Holland and brought him back.</p>
               <p>Drew's Defence. I throw myself on the mercy of the court.</p>
               <p>Holland's Defence. I am innocent.</p>
               <p>Constable. I went to Mr. Woodhatch this morning, I said the prisoners were going to be tried to day, he said he did not care for the Old Bailey, we might all be d - d, he would not come.</p>
               <p>The prosecutor was called, and not appearing in court, his recognisance was ordered to be estreated.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a smith. On the 18th of February I was in company with one of my shopmates, Thomas Morrell—we were in Vinegar-lane, St. George's, about one o'clock in the morning—the two prisoners were standing at the door of their house—my shopmate knew one of them, and we went in—they began asking for something to drink—we told them we had no money, but I said they might go to Mrs. Dodd's, at the Ship public-house, and ask for some beer in my name—Hall went, and they would not let her have any—I went myself and fetched some beer—we drank—I and Hall then went up stairs—I had some money in my pocket, but she did not know that—I had my watch—I drew that out of my pocket, and laid it on the window sill—Hall was in the room at the time—I began to pull off some of my clothes—she took up the watch, and ran down stairs—I put my clothes on as quickly as I could, and hastened down after her—when I got down, the two prisoners and several more, men and women, were in the room—I asked for my watch, and said if they would give it me I would say no more about it—Hall would not give it up, and I called the police—they began pushing me about and scratching me, and wanted to get me out—the policeman came, and I gave Hall into custody—I saw the officer draw the watch from Atkins's bosom, and she said it was left with her for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. by Hall.</p>

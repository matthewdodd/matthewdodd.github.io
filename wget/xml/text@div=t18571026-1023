                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, of Nicholas Lane, Lom<lb></lb>bard Street I have a banking account at Hankey and Co.'s—the prisoner was in my employ rather more than a year—he and a clerk named Bunning were the only two clerks I had—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my cheque book—I kept it in the drawer of my writing table, which was locked when I went away at night, but not during the day—I never allow anybody to sit in my room when I am out—my office is at the back, and the prisoner's in front, on the same floor—the prisoner and Bunning sat at one large desk, which was separated—this cheque is not in my writing, or written by my autho<lb></lb>rity—it is an entire forgery—nearly all my cheques were filled up by myself, but occasionally by Bunning if he was there, or anybody else, and I signed them—I have not missed any cheque from my cheque book, but this cheque exactly corresponds with a foil at the end of the book, where I cut out cheques to carry about with me—it fits here, and nowhere else—my cheques are all one number throughout the book—I receive weekly from my bankers cheques which have been paid in and are cancelled, and about every four or six months it was the prisoner's business to sort them according to the dates, and do them up in a parcel—I have not personally looked into the bundles since this has occurred to see if they are there—it was most probably Mr. Bunning who examined them—I have had frequent opportunities of seeing the prisoner write—I believe the writing on the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and on one of the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, to be his, but to the other I have some doubts—I last saw him in my office on the morning of 13th June—I left by the 12 o'clock train that day for the country, and the probability is that it was at half past 11 o'clock—I have no doubt he was there when I left—he was there in the morning—I was not aware that he intended to leave me—I sent my clerk to inquire for him after the following Tuesday, hut heard nothing of him till Oct, when he was taken into custody—he is about seventeen years of age—he wore jackets then—he received from 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. salary, which was paid weekly—he was sent to Hankey's probably every day he was with me to pay in money, and get cheques changed.</p>

               <p>can only say, as I have said before, that the" writing is a striking resem<lb></lb>blance to my own, but I did not write it—the strongest reason I have for saying so is that all the cheques I filled up for Mr. Hewitt I know what the amount was for—I never heard of the name of Farley before.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MRS. BRYANT</hi>. It was my duty to clean the office of Mr. Hewitt, in Nicholas Lane—latterly I have noticed the prisoner there, after the rest of the persons have left—I saw him take the pen into Mr. Hewitt's room several times after they were all gone; he looked at Mr. Hewitt's diary first and then took the pen and wrote inside his own desk with the lid resting on his head—he took Mr. Hewitt's pen. off Mr. Hewitt's table into his own</p>

               <p>room, and wrote something in the bottom of his desk—I think he did that regularly of an evening for about a week after the rest were gone—I had a reason for noticing it, because I was afraid Mr. Hewitt might think it was my children—I think this was about the latter end of May.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You were not examined before the Magistrate, I believe? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; it is not my wish that I should be examined now—I heard about the forged cheque some time after the prisoner had left, and I told Mr. Bunning what I had seen—Mr. Huggett never spoke to me about it—I spoke about it to Mr. Bunning, and I think last week to Mr. Hewitt, or the week before—I told Mr. Bunning about it before the prisoner left the office—Mr. Hewitt's pen is different to the clerks' pen—Mr. Hewitt's is a steel pen; I should know a pen like it, but I did not take notice much—it has a flower on the top, and the handle pushes in—it is different from the clerks'.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a detective officer of the City. I took the pri<lb></lb>soner into custody on 4th Oct., at a coffee house, in Farringdon Street—I found him in bed there—I told him that I should charge him with forging a cheque on Messrs. Hankey for the sum of 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 13th June last, pur<lb></lb>porting to bear the signature of his master, Mr. Hewitt—he said, "I don't understand it"—I said, "You must get up and dress, and go with me"—while dressing himself, he said, "I confess I know something about the cheque you mention, but I have not committed forgery"—I had been looking for him since 6th July last.</p>

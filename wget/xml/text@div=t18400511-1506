                  </hi>. I am a green-grocer, and live in High-street, Row. About two months ago I purchased three or four chaldrons of cinders and ashes mixed together, and placed them at the back of some stables, against the mills, in Marsh-gate-lane, Stratford—I missed some little lots in about three weeks—on the 14th of April, a little after six o'clock in the morning, I missed two loads, worth 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and found some strewed all about—then was no other heap, of that same sort of dust, in the neighbourhood, to my knowledge—I have often seen the prisoner about, and I have seen him at the place where the officer found him—he was in the habit of carting greens, and lately I have seen him carting dust, with a blind horse—I had seen the heap safe about a quarter-past eight o'clock on the Monday night—I never gave him authority to go to my place and take ashes.</p>

On Tuesday, the 14th of April, I was up at half-past five o'clock in the morning, and saw the prisoner with a cart-load of ashes and dust together—he was going up from the lane into the high road—the lane leads from where the prosecutor's dust was—the cart was about 100 yards from Bone's heap when I saw it.</p>

            . Q. In the course of last spring did the prisoner come on purpose to nurse your wife - A. She did. My wife died on the 11th of March. She quitted my house on the 26th of March.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time she went, had you and she been upon good terms - A. We had not quarrelled. I had a constable to see her out of the house. I sent for a coach to take her peaceably away.</p>
               <p>Q. Two days after that were you well or ill - A. I was ill and in bed.</p>
               <p>Q. While you were so ill on the 28th, did you know of the prisoner coming to your house - A. I did not know of it; I heard of it, and saw her there. She came into my room and asked me for her things; she had leave to take her own things and part of mine that were in the wash; none but what were in the wash. She had began to wash before she went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Shortly after that did you discover that any of your property had been missing - A. I did, before and after too. I lost silk handkerchiefs and gowns, my wife's great coat, and a waistcoat of mine, and five shirts, and all the curtains of a bed, except the top and the vallance. I lost a shift, and a shawl, and bed gowns. I have lost a hundred times more than I have recovered.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. How old are you - A. I am forty-nine.</p>
               <p>Q. You lost your wife, poor man, in March - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not like long to be single - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you buy a ring for Cousens, and pass her for your wife to your servants - A. No, I did not. She asked me to lend her the money to buy her a ring to turn that man out of her house. I lent her the money to buy a ring, and I went with her to buy it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not lived with her as your wife - A. No, never. I have acknowledged I was her husband.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did you live with her as your wife - A. She certainly came to bed to me; I will not deny that. She wore a ring, as if she was my wife.</p>

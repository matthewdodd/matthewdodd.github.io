The prisoners came to my master's office on 12tb or 18th July, and applied for the house—the female had been before, and represented her name as Steed, and when she came on 12th or 13th she introduced the male prisoner as her husband, saying, "This is Mr. Steed"—he said he had been employed a number of years in the Ordnance Department at Woolwich, and the person who placed him there had given him a superior situation at Somerset House—I said I should require the usual references, and he referred me to Daniel Good, the landlord of his house, at Woolwich, and gave me his address—I found him at the address, and considered his representations satisfactory—he also referred me to Mr. Boudler, of Jewin-crescent—in consequence of those references, I let him the house, and he entered into this agreement (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I saw him sign it,</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 10, Great Ormond-street, and am proprietor of 11, Remington-street, City-road. The female prisoner came to me about 27th Sept., and wished to look at that house, and appointed for me to meet her husband there at four o'clock that afternoon—I went, met both the pri<lb></lb>soners, and they agreed to take the house—I asked the male prisoner for his reference—he gave me his name as Blessington; said he had been in the Excise at Woolwich, and was removed to Broad-street, and gave me the name, "Steed, 13, Wynyatt-street," as a reference, who, he said, was the landlord of the house he occupied at Woolwich—the male prisoner accompanied me to the door of that house—I saw a person there who represented himself as Mr. Steed, and his statements seemed satisfactory—we then returned to the house, where the female still was, and I let it to them, and gave them the key—the rent was 28<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I happened to pass the house in Wynyatt-street two or three days after, in the beginning of Oct., and saw it shut up, and the windows plas<lb></lb>tered over with mud—my suspicions were then aroused—I found the whole statement false, and I left a message to that effect at my house, and wished them to leave it immediately—a man calling himself Keen, who said he lived in Smith-street, called on me directly after, said he worked for Mr. Blessing<lb></lb>ton, and he considered they were very respectable parties—I said I was not satisfied, and wished them to quit it—the possession was given up to me three or four days ago, since the prisoners have been in custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a linen-draper, in the Goswell-road. About the end of Oct. the female prisoner, and a man she represented to be her husband, not the male prisoner, came to my shop—they stated that their name was Keen, and they lived at 5, Upper Smith-street, Northampton-square—they said an uncle of theirs had died, they wanted a little mourning, and wished credit for a short time—that he had left them 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which was likely to be paid in five or six weeks—I required a reference, and they referred me to Mr. Leighton, of Remington-street, a builder—I agreed to call on him, and they were to call on me to know the result—I called that day or the day after, and saw Leighton, it was the male prisoner—I said, "You are Mr. Leighton, the builder?"—he said, "Yes"—I then asked if he knew Mr. Keen, of 5, Upper Smith-street, he said he did—I said they wanted goods on credit, and asked if he would give them a character—he said he would give them an excellent character; they had lost a friend, and he had lent them money—he gave me to understand they were husband and wife—I asked him how long he had resided at that house, he said, some consider<lb></lb>able time—I think he told me twelve months—I told him, in consequence of the character I had no objection to give credit; and he said it would be all right, it was quite safe—the parties came again that evening, and</p>

               <p>asked if I had been to see Mr. Leighton, I told them I had—they asked if I was satisfied, and I said I should have no objection to let them have the goods—the female said she hoped it would be settled in six weeks, and wished to look out the goods—I said it was late, and wished it to be postponed till the Monday—the female came on the Monday, and began selecting some twill merinos and other things, to the amount of 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—while she was selecting them, I called her away from the counter, and said, "You are Mrs. Keen?"—she said she was—I told her I did not like to go much above 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and she said I need not frighten myself, that her husband was a respect<lb></lb>able working man, and it was all right—she said her husband worked for Mr. Leighton—the goods were afterwards sent to the place she asked—she came again in two or three days for some more goods—I called her into the parlour, and told her the bill was between 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—she said, oh, she had done nothing but what her husband knew of—a short time after, I re<lb></lb>ceived this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I sent for Keen—he came to the shop, and I asked him questions out of the letter—I asked him if his cousin was a respectable man, as he wanted to have goods on credit—he said it would be quite safe to let him have the goods, he was a very respectable hard-working man, and lived in Shoreditch—in consequence of suspicion, I afterwards made inquiry at Smith-street, and saw only the servant—I went to Remington-street, and could not get admission—on Saturday evening, 10th Nov., I went again to Remington-street with a policeman—after a time we got admission, and there found the two prisoners—I said to the female, "You are the woman I want, as Mrs. Keen"—she said," This is my husband; he did not give you a false reference"—the male prisoner was at her side—I looked at the male, and recognised him as the man who had given me the character—I gave them both in charge—the male prisoner cried, and on going to the station, the female said, "I never had any goods of you—they both gave the name of Leighton at the station—on the Monday evening I went with the policeman and the two prisoners again to Remington-street, and on the way the female said, "I declare to God I have not got the goods; I gave them to Keen; if I was let go I could produce them easily"—when she first came to the shop she was very respectably dressed, better than afterwards.</p>

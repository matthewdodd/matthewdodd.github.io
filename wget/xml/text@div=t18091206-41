             had robbed me.</p>
               <p>Q. In what way had he robbed you - A. I cannot say in what way he robbed me. After he had introduced himself as a customer to me, about four months back, he purchased a watch of me, and three or four small articles; he was in the frequent habit of calling in to see how his watch went, by which means he gained a kind of familiarity: at last, he was in the habit of calling two or three times a day. On the 18th of November, Mr. Presman came into my shop, to caution me against a little man, who he conceived to be a foreigner; the prisoner happened to be in the shop, upon which he said he should take charge of him; he ran out of the shop. About an hour afterwards, Mr. Presman returned, he said he had succeeded in securing the prisoner; he told me he had not searched him. I then went with him down to the watchhouse; on entering the inner door where the prisoner was locked, we found a number of pieces of paper torn as small as could be, I took them up and returned.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search him - A. We did, we found nothing more. While we were picking up the paper, he said he did not know what they were; I said, they appeared to be pieces of duplicates; he said, they might be, but he had no knowledge of them. When we put them together, we found they were three duplicates, one for a gold chain, seal, and key, for three pounds, ten shillings, at Mr. Parker's, 91, Houndsditch; and a pearl broach, twelve shillings, at Mr. Parker's, 115; Mr. Parker has two shops in Houndsditch; the other was a plain ring, which I could not prove. On seeing the articles I knew the whole of them to be mine.</p>

            . I am a stationer. On the 18th of November I went to Mr. Morris, to caution him of the prisoner at the bar; just as I came into the shop, the prisoner was standing with his back towards me; he turned round, and said, how do you do, Sir; I said you are the man I am looking for; I told him I would take charge of him; he said, for what; I told him, for stealing a watch from Mr. Esdaile; he immediately ran out of the shop. I pursued him as far as East Smithfield; I stopped him and took him to the watchhouse. I returned to Mr. Morris, and told him I had succeeded in taking the prisoner. Mr. Morris asked me if I had searched him; I told him I had not. We returned and searched, and found nothing about him, but where we were standing, there were several small pieces of paper; I took them, we found they were duplicates. I went with Mr. Morris to Parker's to examine the articles; Mr. Morris said they were his.</p>

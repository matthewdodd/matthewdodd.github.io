On the 17th of January, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I received information from some little girls, and pursued the prisoner; I saw him opposite the Yorkshire Stingo public-house, with two or three other persons; I seized him, put my hand to his pocket, and felt this parcel of tobacco; he begged I would not give him in charge; but wished me to go with him to Stingo-lane, and he would hand me over another parcel of tobacco, which he had given to another boy; I refused, but took him into a shop; he gave me the name of the other boy, which was Collier - he wished to go away, and offered to leave his coat; I left him in the shop, and went with my brother to Stingo-lane, but could find no such person; when I returned, he told the officers the name of Collier, and they took him; he said the prisoner had thrown away one packet of tobacco; when I first took him he said he took it from my window, and begged I would not give him in charge - they are packets of Dutch C'naster, and I have brought another to shew the similarity; I had three packets of this sort, and all in blue papers; I have not opened them, but they feel like tobacco - I had them from a very respectable house; I have not any dummies in my shop.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you any mark of your own on this parcel, before it was taken? A. No; I did not say I would not hurt him, if he would tell me where any of the other boys lived; nor anything of the kind; I will not swear that this parcel was not mixed with others before I marked it - I marked it in my shop, before it went to the office - it was then laying on my shop-counter - I can only swear I had packets similar to this, and lost packets similar to this.</p>

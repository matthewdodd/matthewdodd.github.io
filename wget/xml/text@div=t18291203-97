               <p>ROBERT BURGOYNE WATTS. I saw these stockings secreted on a wall in a dark cellar, on the 11th of November; they were in a paper that had a mark on it - these handkerchiefs were also on the wall, and they have still our mark upon them.</p>
               <p>HENRY THOMLINSON COOMBE. I was desired by Mr. Cross to watch; I went to Navarino-house an the 18th of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182912030041"></xptr>November, to watch who came to take two parcels from a wall under the shop floor - I secreted myself in a waterbutt, and about a quarter before six o'clock in the morning the prisoner came, and hammered a nail in the wine-cellar door - she then went away and swept the place out; nothing occurred till about four in the afternoon, when she opened the wine-cellar door, and took out a bottle of wine - I remained in the water-butt till about half past eleven at night; but about nine o'clock the prisoner and Powell went in the water-closet, which is in a line with the waterbutt - the prisoner put up her hand and took down the two parcels from the place described, she took them into the privy, and was there about five minutes - she came out; she had a broom-stick in her hand, the bottom of which was wet, and put it into the dust-hole, and then called out to the other servant, as if she had been at a distance, "If I were you I would make Thomas carry up the coals;" I saw no coals.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How long were you in the water-butt altogether? A. About eighteen hours; I took a bottle of sherry with me, and nearly finished it - Mr. Watts brought me down a penny loaf about two o'clock; I think I left about one glass in the bottle -I was not in the least affected by it; I have seen the young man who was convicted this morning - whether he placed the things there or not I do not know; I drank the wine neat - I did not sleep at all, and was not in the least drowsy; there was just room for me to put my feet down -I had a stool to sit on; I had two holes made to look through, one to view the wine-cellar, and one to look at the parcels - I raised my head over the water-butt when no one was there, but when any one came with a light I looked through the holes; a person might have come and put the parcels there while I was drinking - I believe Reid was a sweetheart of hers, and had access to the shop.</p>

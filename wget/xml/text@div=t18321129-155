            . I am a surgeon, and live in South-street, Manchester-square. I was applied to by the mother to see this <rs id="t18321129-155-viclabel882" type="occupation">child</rs>

               <p>Q. Can you say whether that deep penetration arose from putridity after death, or would it have been so if you had examined it immediately after death? A. It could not have arisen from putridity; in my opinion, if I had taken the plaister off previous to death, the same appearances as to depth would have been exhibited - it appeared to me that the injury of the head had been produced by some irritating application - and there was no other cause to account for death; I attribute the death to the injury done to the head by some external application - I attribute it to the sloughing; it was impossible, from the state of the plaister, to form a judgment of what it was composed, it was in that state of filth.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When you left the child, on the 4th of November, it was in a general state of disease? A. Yes; it had a scald-head, and the humour showed itself in various parts of the body; scaldhead is extremely prevalent now - I have several under my care; the scalp was thicker than a shilling; the part which was penetrated may be as thick as half a crown, or thicker - the flesh was swollen; it might be thicker than half a crown; when the child was alive it was getting rapidly well under my care; I expected it would have been well in five or six weeks; I had stated to the parents the improvement in its health.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not a very innocent plaister, kept on too long, cause ulceration, by becoming dry? A. A plaster of an adhesive quality, by being taken off after being kept on too long, might break the skin - if I directed a plaister to be kept on two days, and it was kept on five, I should think that was neglect.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. When you first saw the child had it a plaister? A. No; it was then under Dr. Sims; I applied no plaister to it - the mother told me it had been under the care of many medical men.</p>

            . I am a fishmonger and live near Manchester-square. The deceased was my child - her name was Mary Elizabeth; my wife took her to Highgate on the 7th of November - I did not go with her; I saw the child when she brought her home - when she went out she was in bodily health; she had a few sores, on her head and a few blotches and sores in different parts of the body - when she returned she had a plaister, which covered the whole of her head, except her temples and face; the child was at home on the 4th of November, and Mr. Carter saw it - she gradually grew worse from the day the plaister was applied to her head; the 10th of November was appointed for her to go to Mrs. Spiller's again, as I understood, but it being a very wet morning, I did not take her till the morning of the 11th, (Sunday) I saw Mrs. Spiller; she took the plaister off the head, and applied another plaister to it; I told her the day being very wet, and the child being very ill, I deferred coming till then, and she said it was of no consequence - I took the child home again; that plaister remained on till Tuesday afternoon, when I took her again, by appointment - I saw the prisoner; the child had been very ill between Sunday and Tuesday, she was lightheaded and not on her legs all day, and she had eat nothing from the time the plaister was applied - except one small bit of bread; on Friday after the first plaister was applied she got light-headed at night - when I went to Mrs. Spiller's on Sunday, I said she had been light-headed, and her appetite quite failed; she told me to give her a little gin and water, or brandy and water, or beer, or ale - that any thing nourishing would keep her alive - and she said the same on Tuesday; I asked her if any other medical assistance was wanted, telling her the state she was in - she said, "No, have patience and your child will be better, you will see her better in a day or two;" but the second day after she expired: after the Saturday night, Mrs. Spiller desired a few drops of laudanum might be given her, as my wife said, and on that Saturday night she had laudanum given to her, and on the Sunday night - five or six drops each night; on the Tuesday she applied a fresh plaister, and gave me a box of ointment, and some lint for my wife to apply a plaister on the Thursday morning, which was done - she put it on on the Thursday morning; after it was put on, the child screamed dreadfully, and was very light-headed indeed -I was obliged to shut my shop door, for she screamed so dreadfully until between one and two o'clock; it began directly after the plaister was applied, which was between nine and ten - she died on that Thursday (the 15th of November,) between 4 and 5 in the afternoon; she seemed a little easier on Thursday morning, before the plaister was put on, and took some barley in water - my wife gave her some sago and beef-tea; I was recommended to the prisoner by Mr. Beckley, a grocer, in David-street, Oxford-street - I paid the prisoner on Sunday, the 11th of November, 1s. 6d. for the plaister, and 1s. for the box of ointment, which my wife had to rub the various parts which were affected.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You found the prisoner out, she did not come to you? A. No, she lives in the <placeName id="t18321129-155-crimeloc883">Archway-road, Highgate</placeName>

I told her why - she said it was of no consequence; Sunday was a very fine morning - I carried the child to Camden-town; I then put her into a cab. I got there about ten minutes to six o'clock on the Tuesday evening - it was a foggy day, but warm, and she was properly wrapped up; I took her in a cart - she was not exposed to the air, but had a cloak and blankets over her; she got light-headed and feverish on Friday, and got worse and worse.</p>
               <p>Q. Instead of taking her in the open air, why not get Mrs. Spiller to come to her? A. I understood she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183211290080"></xptr>never came to see patients - I did not ask her to come; she had been under three doctors before I went to the prisoner; I was perfectly satisfied with Mr. Carter as to the head, but there were blotches and sores in different parts of her body; I was anxious to try for the best - it is nearly eighteen months since she first had the disease - she was two years and eight months old.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did any of the medical gentlemen express, in your hearing, that the complaint was incurable? A. No.</p>

            . I am a surgeon. I assisted Mr. Carter in the post mortem examination; the general appearances of the body were healthy, except a few spots on the joints - the body did not appear at all reduced - it was not at all emaciated; the interior appeared perfectly healthy - there was no organic disease; there were a few eruptions of the joints, I could scarcely give them a name - there was a plaister on the head, spread on lint, I think, but will not swear it was not leather - I could not tell what it was composed of; it was removed in my presence, and the head washed with soap and water - it appeared at first sight quite pulpy, and disorganized; on a closer examination, I found a deep ulcer at the back of the head, extending nearly to the bone; on the left temple there was another ulcer, but not so large; I removed the scalp - the inner surface of it was highly inflamed, and in some parts ulcerated; the dura maler very firmly adhered to the inner surface of the skull, which is very common with infants, and I do not consider it a cause of death; the adhesion was greater than natural at that age; I will not say it arose from any topical application, but rather from long-continued irritation of the surface of the head, during the eighteen months it had been ill; I can say confidently, that could not cause death; we carefully examined the brain, and found little or no effusion - there was nothing in the brain to cause death; my opinion is, that the child died from irritation produced by the extensive disease of the scalp, excited by some irritating cause, and that from a recent period - I could not say how recent.</p>
               <p>Q. You have heard the father's account, and that of Dr. Carter - might not the irritation and excitement, and the inflammation it would produce, have commenced long before the child was placed under the prisoner's hands? A. I should think not; I think the irritation proceeded from the same exciting application.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What depth was the wound on the back of the head? A. It extended from the surface to the skull; it might be an eighth or a quarter of an inch; the part the plaister covered was ulcerated through, and I should think the other wound was under the plaister - the plaister was over the ulceration on the temple, I am sure; it might be rather above the temple; there were three or four lacerations, and the whole surface pulpulated - I consider the whole irritation of the scalp to have caused the death; that disease could not be going on while it was under the doctors - I presume the cause of death occurred from the period she was under the prisoner.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Will you take on yourself to say that? A. I will not - I only know from the evidence of the child being apparently in good health.</p>

            . I am the child's mother, It was two years and eight months old; it had been afflicted with this scorbutic attack for nearly eighteen months - it came out at first, I think, about six months before I applied to any medical man; it made its appearance first at the ears, and extended afterwards to the body - it had not made its appearance on the body when I applied to a medical man; Dr. Sims was the first gentleman I applied to - he wrote for it; I only took it to him twice - he said it was very simple, and gave me an ointment to apply; I used that about six months - she continued getting a little worse, and I then took her into the country; that brought it out a great deal worse on the head, but not on the body: I had a doctor while I was in the country, and he gave her two or three powders - she seemed better; I brought her home, and after some time went to Dr. Mclntyre - she was under him for a month or five weeks, and the breaking out came on her joints when I took her to him - she was much the same when I left him; I continued by his prescriptions until Mr. Carter saw her; she got much better under him- I first applied to the prisoner on the 7th of November; I went to her in the Archway-road, and saw her - that was on Wednesday; I showed her the child's head, and asked if she could make a cure of it - she said she could; she said it was a scald-head, and affected the body all over, it must have its head shaved - she sent her servant with me to have it shaved, and when done I washed it with soap and water there; she then put a plaister on it: she did not tell me what it was; it was spread on lint - it was a light chesnut brown plaister; after putting it on she said she generally did these things by contract - that I was to give her a sovereign down, and two more when the child was cured; I said she should have told me so, for I had not the money with me - I did not pay her then; she said the plaister would make her very ill, and make her head all sore, for the humour must be all drawn out in the head - that the places which were healed up were bad flesh, and it must be all drawn out; I asked if there was any medicine required - she said I might give her a little cooling magnesia, if required; I asked if I need be particular in her diet - she said No, I might give her any thing, I might give her a little weak brandy and water, or gin and water, and she offered to give it a little gin and water then - I refused that, and she said I might give her a little laudanum; I said it was dangerous to give landanum to a baby: she asked its age, and said I might give it from five to six drops - she did not say how often; she said it was to lull the pain, and make her sleep - she said she must see it two or three times a week; I asked if she could not come and see it, as I had got a young baby, and could not come so far - she said No, she never went out; I was to let her see her again on Saturday - her appetite failed her directly, and on Friday she was taken with a giddiness in her head; she was very giddy, and continued getting very ill: Saturday was very wet, and on Sunday my husband took her again; the plaister remained on her head till she went to Highgate - I never saw the prisoner afterwards; when my husband brought her home on Sunday she was taken with a violent reteching, almost directly that she returned - I had given her nothing; the retching continued the whole day - she brought off her stomach all that she had drank, and then it went off; I had given her arrow-root,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183211290081"></xptr>made with water - I got it at the grocer's opposite where I live; I gave it her in the morning, before she went to Mrs. Spiller's - I gave her nothing when she returned; she continued ill all day, and on Monday she was worse; she had no appetite, and seemed quite exhausted and faint from fatigue - she complained of her head, and wished me to take the plaister off, but I did not: on Monday she was quite light-headed all night, and all day on Tuesday, and on Tuesday night she went to Mrs. Spiller's again with her father - I did not think that she was in a fit state to go out, but Mrs. Spiller telling me she did not go out, we were obliged to take her; I wrapped her up in several things, put her into my great cloak, and covered her over, head and all - no evening air could get to her; she returned at a quarter or nearly half-past six o'clock at night - they left home about five: she was very bad indeed on her return, and on Wednesday still continued worse - she was very bad on Thursday indeed, and at five o'clock that day died: she had a different plaister on her head on her return from the prisoner's, and some lint and ointment was brought for me to spread another, and to apply on the Thursday morning, which I did; she seemed exhausted at her return from Highgate, and slept for an hour or two that night, at intervals - the vomiting did not come on again, but she could not bear any thing with milk in it; I gave her a little beef-tea, barley-water, gruel, and sago; after the plaister had been on on Thursday morning about half an hour, she was taken in a screaming way, from pain - she complained of pain, and told me to take the plaister off, and it would make her well.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Your child was thirty-two months old? A. Yes; it got worse after I took her out of town; it spread over her body - I had not shaved the head then - I cut away the hair as the sore places spread; the doctor in the country attended her for a week; she then got better, and I removed her to town - she then got worse, and I took her to Dr. Mclntyre, and while under him it broke out in her joints - she was under Dr. Carter for six or seven weeks; I had no doubt she would get better under him, but I took her to the prisoner by my husband's advice; I put on one plaister myself from the ointment he sent; I have kept none of the ointment; she lost her appetite from the first day she went to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. She had nothing to eat while she was under the prisoner's care? A. Only a bit of bread and butter which Mrs. Spiller gave her; she lived upon drinks, but got very thin - she had arrow-root, gruel, and beef-tea every day - she could not take food - I put on the last plaister about ten o'clock in the morning, and she died at five in the evening - I did not think it right to call in a medical gentleman while the prisoner was attending her, as she said she would be better in a day or two, and she kept saying so to the last - when I went to her she said she would be ill - I naturally thought that she was doing right - I had heard she had performed such wonderful cures - I sent a message to Dr. Carter on Sunday to say she was gone to Highgate; my husband expected the horse and cart to take her in the day-time on Tuesday, but the horse was engaged till the evening - I gave her two spoonsful of brandy and water on Sunday, which stopped the sickness - when I put on the last plaster she was very bad - I did not send for any body to look at her - I have not spoken to Mr. Carter since the inquest.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). No one can regret more than myself the death of the poor child, but my conscience acquits me of all blame; I used the same remedy I had successfully used to many others, and had hoped the same result, but for the inattention to, and neglect of, my directions. Upon the first occasion, when the child was brought to me, it was in a very black and emaciated state, and as I understood had been under medical advice, without relief for a considerable time; it was on a Wednesday when the child was first brought to me, and I desired that I might again see it on the Friday, instead of which it was not brought until the Sunday, and the plaister I had put on had got hard; I told the father he ought to have come on the Friday, he excused himself by saying he was busy on that day, and as Saturday was wet, his wife would not allow him to bring the child out; I then dressed the child's head, and particularly desired the father to come again to me on the Tuesday morning, but my directions were again unattended to, for the child was not brought until near eight o'clock at night, which was cold and foggy; and as I afterwards heard taken to the father's house in Marylebone, from my house in the Archway, road Highgate, in an open cart, and on the Thursday morning following it died. I shall call before you many persons who have been relieved and cured by me, and who will tell you how incapable I am of an unkind act.</p>
               <p>Eight witnesses who had been under the prisoner's care for scrofula disorders, deposed to her skilful, humane, and kind treatment.</p>

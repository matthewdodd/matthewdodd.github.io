About 3 o'clock in the morning, on 1st June, I was on duty at Camber well; I met the prisoner carrying this bundle—I asked what he had got there—he said what he had got belonged to himself, or was his own—I looked and saw there were some shop marks on some of the things—I took him to Camberwell station, and asked him some questions—he said, "You have no occasion to ask me any more questions, I stole them, but you have got to find out where"—after I heard there had been a burglary, I took the prisoner there—I said, "We shall get to the house presently"—I then said, "That is the house"—he said, "Yes, it is."</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 13, Crosby Row, Walworth. On 31st May I went to bed about 12 o'clock, but I had gone out at 9 o'clock, after fastening my shop, I returned about 11 o'clock, but I went in by another door—I did not go into the shop—the next morning I was called up at a little after 7 o'clock—I found the skylight had been broken, and I missed this property—I have seen it since; it is mine—after I had gone to bed, I heard a noise in the night; it was like the falling of a chair—I found in the morning that there had been a set of steps under the skylight, and a chair put on the top of them—he must have got in by removing the skylight.</p>

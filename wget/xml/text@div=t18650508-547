                  </hi>. I live at 3, Orchard-cettages-kingsland-road—I have occasionally assisted the police—on 15th December I accompanied Underwood to Messrs. Board's distillery—I saw a van leave there driven by Parry and Harris, they delivered thirteen gallons of gin in Great Chadwell street, and then they drove to the prisoner's house, the Prince of Wal 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Parry went in with some papers, and showed them to the prisoner, and Parry and Harris then opened the doors of the public-house, and opened, a hole in the public parlour—I saw Parry draw off some gin by means of a syphon from two casks that were in the van—he had a measure in his hand—he took twenty-six measures out of the first cask, and twenty-eight and a part of one out of the other cask—Harris carried it in—I think I saw thirteen measure of rum go in—I won't be certain—I saw two four-gallon bottles in baskets</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186505080058"></xptr>
               <p>go in—after they had finished, a female in the bar said to Parry, "I suppose you want to see the governor"—he said, "Yes"—she called the prisoner—I won't swear whether he came out of the bar parlour, or out of the passage—I saw him sign a paper or book, he then took from his pocket a shilling, and then searched in his purse, and put down what I believe to be a half-sovereign—it was gold—I would not swear whether it was a half-sovereign or a sovereign—I believe it was gold—Parry took the shilling, and put it into a; bag, and pushed the other coin to Harris, who put it in his pocket—they remained about two hours in the public-house—Parry had a cigar, and Harris had some gin-and-water—they were talking with Capes—the conversation was about his children coming home for the holidays, and Parry said he should like to send his children down to the same school as Caps' children when they went back again.</p>

Russell" means Sergeant Russell—he employed me, not Underwood—I was asked for that memoran<lb></lb>dum at the police-court, but could not find it then—I wrote it when I came out of the public-house—Parry drew the measures off as he would for anybody else—I could not swear that they were full—I went in at the same door that he did—he might have been about four or 6ve feet from me when he brought the gin in—there was nothing between us—Underwood was there outside—I told him when I came out—I get 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a day and my expenses—I am not often employed—sometimes I do cooking—I have been a witness four or five times before.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>).

                  </hi>. We send out measures for the men to deliver the gin in, they hold four gallons—we allow half a gallon in every hundred gallons—Parry and Harris would have been entitled to deliver 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. gallons on this occasion—I do not know the quantity that went out in the casks that day.</p>

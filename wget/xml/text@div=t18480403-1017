                  </hi> I am the wife of James Garnell, a general dealer. On Friday night, 10th March, about a quarter before nine o'clock, the prisoner came, asked for a penny candle, and gave me a shilling—I put it into the till—there was another shilling in the till, an old smooth one; I gave the pri<lb></lb>soner that with the candle, as I had no change, and said, "Perhaps you will pay me to-morrow?"—I know it was the other shilling I gave him, by his manner; he sneered at me, as he went out, and said, "I live at No. 2, I will"—I had not taken the old shilling many moments before, and had given the only sixpence I had in change for it—I looked at the shilling he gave me as soon as he was gone—it was bad—I gave it to my husband, and he marked it—this is it—it is a new one—on 11th March the prisoner came again and asked for an ounce of tobacco—I recognized him before I came into the shop—while he was there my husband came in, and I asked him to come round the counter—the prisoner gave me a half-crown—I took it, and gave him the tobacco—I said to my husband, "This is the young man that gave me the bad shilling last night"—he marked the half-crown, and the prisoner was given into custody.</p>

                  </hi> I got a bad shilling from my wife on 10th March—I cut it and kept it—I afterwards gave it to Hanson—on 11th March the prisoner came—my wife said to me in his hearing, "I wish you would come round here, perhaps I may want to go away"—she then gave the prisoner the ounce of tobacco, and he gave her a half-crown—she said, "This is the young man that gave me the bad shilling last night"—I took the half-crown, and marked it with a penknife—I kept it, and gave that and the shilling to the policeman.</p>

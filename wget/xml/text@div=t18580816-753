                  </hi>. I am a costermonger, and live in Bennett's Court Drury Lane. On Wednesday, 28th July, I went to a public house in Holborn with a friend—we had something to drink. While there the prisoner came in; she drank with us—she had a basket with her; this is it. After that I went with her to No. 11, George Street, St. Giles'—I undreseed and went to bed—she was partly undressed. I was not sober; I had been drinking. About 4 o'clock in the morning there was an alarm, when the prisoner was getting over the landing. The man of the house went out for the policeman himself. When I heard the alarm, I ran and looked at my trousers, and I missed from them 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. The prisoner was gone from the room. I had given her a shilling. I went down stairs—a constable came, and I wished the prisoner to give me the money and I would have nothing to do with her—she said all the money she had was half a crown and a few halfpence in her hand—I said I would give her in charge, and I did so. I over-slept myself the next morning, and I did not appear against her. I did not see what was in the basket on the night before when I was in the room—but she showed me a shilling and one of these moulds—that was in the room—I am not sure whether the mould was in the basket or not—the shilling was in her hand—she showed it to me; I looked and saw it was a shilling—I could not say whether it was good or bad—she said, "Look at this."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What time was it you left her? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About 4 o'clock—it was daylight. I did not know the prisoner before. I am in no one's employ—I was in the Land Fencibles in the Crimea for a short time—I and my mother keep a room in Bennett's Court. I was in liquor; I can't say whether the prisoner was—if I were sober myself I should know the difference between a person being drunk and sober—I knew what I was about—the prisoner could not be very drunk; she might be in liquor, but I could not swear it. I paid for what we had. She showed me the mould; I could not say where she took it from; I saw it in her hand—I examined the shilling and gave it her back again—I dare say she put it in the basket—I never took particular notice. I mentioned about this at the Court House. I heard part of my examination read over—I did not hear it read about her showing me the shilling and the mould—I signed my examination—the words I said were read over to the Magistrate, not to me—I told the Magistrate about her having shown me the mould.</p>

When I was at the police office the prisoner was not charged with robbing me—the Magistrate said he was not trying on that—the charge was having these moulds in her possession—I knew that. This is my statement (<hi rend="italic">This statement contained no mention of the shilling and the mould.</hi>)</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, E</hi> 72). I was on duty in George Street, St. Giles', on 28th July, about 4 in the morning—I was called to the house No. 11, George Street, and the prisoner was given into my custody by the last witness on a charge of robbing him. Both the prisoner and the witness were in liquor when the charge was given. I said to the prisoner, "Do you know what you are charged with?—stealing 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out of Reilly's pocket—she said, "All the money I have is this half crown, and 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., in coppers; and this half crown he gave me." She had this basket in her hand, and as</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185808160027"></xptr>
               <p>we came out of the house, she said, "Will you let me go? if you do, I will feel much obliged to you"—I said, "I can't do that"—she kept the basket in her hand—all through I demanded it of her in going to the station, and she refused to give it me—she said she would not. I took her into the station, and the charge was pressed against her by the prosecutor, stating he had lost the 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the prisoner denied all the way through that she had any more money than the half-crown and 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. I called Mrs. Reed, the female searcher, and demanded the basket again of the prisoner—she laid she would give it to Mrs. Reed, not to me. After they had retired, I went to her lodging to see if she had thrown any money away—I searched up and down with the lamp, but I could not find any—Mrs. Reed and the prisoner came in again, and Mrs. Reed placed this basket on the desk—she said she could not open it—I opened it, and found in it these four moulds and some old fragments of moulds which had been broken, and six half-crowns and seven shillings, all in this piece of paper.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> The prisoner was very drunk? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not very drunk—she was a little the worse for liquor, not exactly stupid altogether. There was something of an old rag and two keys in the basket—the articles are here now which were in it when I took it from her. I made the search where the prisoner lodges—she gave her address; I went and found the address correct. She denied altogether that the basket belonged to her—she told the Magistrate that she did not know how the moulds came there—she said she met some young man who gave her something to drink, and who put the things in the basket she did not know.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Reed; I am female searcher at the station. On that Wednesday, I received directions to search the prisoner—she had this basket with her—I asked her to give it to the constable; she said no, she would take it with her and give it to me—I tried to open it; the lid was pressed down so tightly I did not think there was anything in it—I gave it to the officer, and he opened it. I bad before that searched the prisoner, and found a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece in her bosom, and three half-crowns and one shilling dropped on the floor in untying her petticoat—one half-crown and 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was in her hand—one of the half-crowns was bad, but I can't say which it was—she was not charged with bad money. I gave the money to the constable—there was some hesitation, and he brought it back and gave it to me.</p>

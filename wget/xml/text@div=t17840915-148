             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am head waiter at the Swan and Two Necks, in Lad-lane; I went to her house to buy some money, for the purpose of apprehending her; she called me into her yard, I said I was informed she dealt in bad money, and I could be a customer to her; she told me I could get more by dealing with her, than I did from the perquisires of my place; she called to her maid, and desired her to hand a brown paper that she had in her pocket, the maid did, in which was a quantity of bad silver, which she wanted me to purchase; I said I had no money then, but must defer it to another time; the prisoner Mackenzie was in the yard at this time, he stood neuter all the time; he saw her shew me the money. I were in about two or three days again, Palmer desired me to get a guinea's worth of this silver, for the purpose of apprehending her, and when I went there he stood at the corner of Bull and Mouth-street; one Isaac was with Palmer, and I then saw both the prisoners in the kitchen; I said I was come after a guinea's-worth of silver, that I had alked about the day before; the prisoner called to the maid, and desired her to bring another paper, wherein was this money, there were twenty-four shillings and twelve sixpences contained in this paper: after I had received them, this Mr. Mackenzie called to this maid, and desired her to hand a shilling from off the shelf, which she did, and he put a shilling into the paper; I then came out, and one of the officers took them into custody. I gave a guinea to this woman.</p>
               <p>Court. What was your bargain? - I had thirty-one shillings with the one he had put in.</p>
               <p>(An objection was here made, that the indictment was laid that the money given was twenty-four shillings and twelve sixpences, and it appeared by this, that twenty five shillings and twelve sixpences were given.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The shilling was given after I had received the thirty shillings and paid the guinea.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetwood, Prisoner's Council. Had you never been at her house before? - I never was there but twice in my, she went by the name of Mackenzie, otherwise Black Bess, I never spoke to her afterwards: I told her I heard she dealt in it, and would be glad she would let me have some.</p>
               <p>Did you know at that time you was committing a felony? - No, Sir,</p>
               <p>Did you mean to buy when you went first? - No, Sir, only to see if the fell; I meant to put a stopt the circulation of it at the house where I lived.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178409150172"></xptr>What did you in your evidence before the Magistrate swear that you received in exchange for a guinea? - My memory will not allow me positively to give an answer to that question.</p>
               <p>Did you, or did you not, positively swear there, that you received twenty-five shillings and twelve sixpences? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Will you say you did not swear that? - No, I will not say one way or the other; I know the Justice asked me if I had received that money from the woman, and I recollect the was committed on account of delivering the thirty shillings to me, and he was committed for aiding and assisting in ordering the maid to deliver the shilling off the shelf.</p>
               <p>Court. Was not the woman committed upon your oath for puting off twenty-five shillings and twelve sixpences? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Court. Shaw went by the name of Mackenzie? - I took her to be the wife of Mackenzie, but I cannot say; they both lived together, and kept this little girl as servant; they live in a court opposite the Castle and Falcon in Aldersgate-street.</p>
               <p>You do not know whether they are man and wife or not? - I heard the little girl call them master and mistress.</p>
               <p>And they live as such? - I suppose so, my Lord, but I do not know.</p>

               <p>What did he tell you he had got when he gave it to you? - That he had got one and thirty shillings-worth; I carried them to Mr. Blackborow's.</p>
               <p>The man was not committed at that time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When was he discharged? - I believe the next day, when they were examined, Shaw was committed.</p>

               <p>How came you to carry the prisoners before Mr. Blackborow, and not before a Magistrate? - There was no Magistrate to be found when we took them, Sir.</p>

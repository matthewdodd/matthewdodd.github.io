            . - A. Yes; between one and two o-clock I saw the prisoner standing at my father's street door, I saw the prisoner go towards the tap room, he turned back and went into the parlour with something white in his hand not a bundle; in about ten minutes after he came out with a bundle under his arm; I called to my mother instantly, I had heard my mother say that she lost things before; I knew that he did not call for any liquor. He went out. I went to the door and looked after him, he went towards Crown court.</p>
               <p>Q. Your mother then went into the parlour to see if any thing was missing. - A. Yes. He was brought back, he had candles in the bundle. I am confident he had no bundle when he came in, only something white in his hand.</p>
               <p>- WARREN. I am an officer of Marlborough-street. On the 26th of November, about two o'clock, I was going to dinner in Carnaby-street, I met Mr. Cloney he had hold of the prisoner by the collar, he delivered him over to me and charged him with stealing of candles. The prisoner said he was innocent.</p>

               <p>Prosecutrix. There are such sort of candles as I had in my closet; I have brought some of the same kind.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The cloth and candles belong to me; I have got a witness here.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutrix. You saw the quantity of candles brought back by the prisoner, did they correspond with the quantity that you expected to be in the box, so far as your eye could judge. - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner. - A. Yes, he kept an eating house No, 28, Marybone-lane; I live in Shoemaker-row, Doctors Commons.</p>
               <p>Q. When this charge was made he was removing his goods to a sister-in-law of his. - A. Yes; I assisted him in removing his goods.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see at the time of his moving any candles. - A. I did; I suppose there might be two or three pound.</p>
               <p>Court. What time was he moving. - A. The best part of two days.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he taken up on the days he was moving. - A. No, he was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then of course it cannot allude to this transaction; was it a day or two before he was taken up. - A. I think it was.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I kept an eating house in Marybone-lane; through breaking my leg, and upon account of letting the house, I was obliged to move; I moved some of my things to my sister-in-law, among which were some candles; my sister in law lives near Mr. Cloney; and my taking of lodgings I had occasion to take some candles. I had told an acquaintance that I should be at Mr. Cloney's; I went to my sister's, I brought them candles; Mrs. Cloney says they belong to her. They do not belong to her. I went into the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180712020051"></xptr>parlour; finding that my friend was not in the parlour I went into the tap; not being satisfied I went backwards, and finding that he was not in the house, I didnot call for any thing to drink; I went out; I was pursued by these people, who brought me back to the house they insisted upon them candles, I insisted upon not giving them up.</p>
               <p>Jury to prosecutor. Prior to the candles in question, had you missed any out of the box. - A. Yes, eight days before; him and the other man was in the house on that day.</p>

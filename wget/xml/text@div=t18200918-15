I missed a lady's beaver hat three or four days before the purse was missed, but was not quite certain it was gone. I had him apprehended on Monday morning, the 10th, and went with Cobham to his house in Warwick-row - the prisoner said it was his mother's house. We found the hat and hat-box in the front parlour there.</p>

            . I am an officer of Queen-square. I took the prisoner at Mr. Swallow's shop. I found a watch, a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182009180010"></xptr>little pocket-book, and a knife, on him, but no money. I asked him what he had done with the money - he said, voluntarily, that he had spent it, and had bought the watch, seal, and key, with part of it, at a shop in the Broadway, Westminster; he said he did not know the man's name, but he knew the shop; that he spent the rest of the money; one part he hired a horse with, and that the purse and ring were at his mother's, in Warwick-row, Pimlico. I went there, accompanied by him and Mr. Swallow, he went in, and whispered to his mother, she then produced the purse, and said the ring was given to some young woman, but she would get it. The prisoner said he gave the guineas to Mr. Rudd, a broker, in Pimlico, to change, who changed them at Wadmore's, the Magdalen, at Pimlico. He took me to the shop in the Broadway, where he bought the watch. I returned to his mother's in the evening, and found the hat and box, which I produce.</p>

            . I am a broker, and live at Pimlico. On the 19th or 20th of June the prisoner requested me to get some guineas changed - it was about a fortnight before he was apprehended. He asked me if I could give him change for three guineas, as his master was distressed for change, and he was going somewhere with goods, and wanted change. I said I had not sufficient. I went to Wadmore, who keeps a public-house, and got three 1 l. notes and three shillings, which I gave him - he waited in my shop. I told him I would get the change there.</p>

They were doubled up carelessly. They turned up Queen Ann-street. As soon as they turned the corner they set off running. They ran about two hundred yards, and met a tall boy, with a light rough great coat on, who took the coats of them. I believe it was Lowe, but am not certain. He buttoned them up in his coat, and they all ran into Lamb's-place together; two men were running after them. One man stopped the two who were pursuing and asked what they were running after those boys for, as they had got nothing of their's. The boys then run off different ways. I knew Belfour before, by sight, and am sure I saw him come out of the house.</p>

            . I was at No. 6, Harley-street, opposite the prosecutor's, looking out of the parlour window, about a quarter past four o'clock in the afternoon, and saw three boys sitting on the steps of No. 69. I believe Belfour to be one, the other I am not certain of. There was a larger boy with them, in a light rough great coat. He appeared about the size of Lowe. I saw Belfour and the other boy go down the area steps of No. 68. The tall boy got up and walked on, and stopped near No. 67. Immediately after that, Belfour and the other came up out of the area;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181812020029"></xptr>Belfour had a brown paper parcel, and gave it to the tall boy. They all crossed the road together, and went down Queen Ann-street. Belfour and the other boy returned in about two minutes, on the other side of the way, without the parcel. I then came out and went up against them. I am sure Belfour was one. I had followed a woman, whom I had seen come out of No. 68, to tell her of it, but was obliged to go back. After that I saw them come out of the same house, with a large bundle; it was dark brown coats. The other boy carried them. A milkman and another man ran after them.</p>

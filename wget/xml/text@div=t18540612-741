I belong to the brig <hi rend="italic">Relief</hi>, of Sunderland, which was lying off Mill-hole—on Whit Tuesday, between 12 and 1 o'clock in the morning, I was going along Wapping; the prisoners came up to me, struck me, knocked me down, and made me bleed from the nose and mouth; they then took off my shoes and my hat, and used me very badly—they said as I was quiet they would spare my life—I had only 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my pocket—I had never seen them before—the police came up in about ten minutes, and I got back my hat and shoes about 2 o'clock.</p>

About a quarter to 2 o'clock on We<lb></lb>dnesday morning, 7th June, I was on duty in Wapping-wall, and met the prosecutor without any shoes or hat, and bleeding from the mouth—he was tipsy—I went with him, and in about three minutes met the prisoners—two or three yards before I got to them, Conlan dropped a cap from under his arm—I said, "Where did you get that?"—he said, "I picked it up"—I said, "These boots would be better off, they are too long for you; I think they are the old man's boots," meaning the prosecutor—I took them both to the station—Sweeney said he got them from a public house in Wapping-wall, about 100 yards distant—this public house was open a few minutes before, when I passed down the street—I found on Sweeney three sove<lb></lb>reigns, a half sovereign, a watch, 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper, and a knife—I took these boots off Conlan, and Dove identified him.</p>

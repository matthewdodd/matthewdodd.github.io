The prisoner came to my house on the 31st, of December and two women with her. They sat down by the fire and had some gin and two threepenny worths of rum and water. She was above an hour in the house. I am sure she is the same woman. I was busy at the bar, she asked me to give her change for a guinea and take the reckoning. I took the guinea and weighed it, it was a very good one, she then said, she believed she had silver enough to pay without changing. I gave her the guinea again and she put it in her mouth. As I was busy I turned my head, and then she said she should want change before she got home and desired I would give her change. She gave me a guinea, I thought it was the same and gave her change, and she went away directly; when she was gone, I thought it felt light and I weighed it and found it was a bad one. I went after her but could not find her and I never met with her till last July, then I took her up. The counterfeit weighs about twelve shillings.</p>

She changed a guinea with Mr. Elsmore, and after she was gone, he said, he believed he was taken in, the guinea was light, she was gone in an instant; he went to see after her but could not find her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Mr. Pearce, at 203, Holborn; we are opticians and dealers in pictures. On the evening of 9th Dec. the prisoner called on me—I had seen him several times before, but had had no previous transactions with him—he came about a case of pictures—I said the amount was large, and I should require a reference as to his respectability—he did not tell me where he wanted to take them to—he said I wanted to get or know his customers—I said I was incapable of that—he objected to refer me to any one in trade, as there was so much jealousy—I said I only wanted to know any one who had trusted him to that amount; I did not care whether it was a picture-dealer or not; but he gave me no reference that day—he came again next day about the same case of pictures—I had not seen them myself; they were packed up and lying in the shop at the time—the cost price of them to us was from 5 to 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I asked him as to his respectability, and for a reference; and he produced a bill of exchange, drawn by a person</p>

               <p>named Jocelyn, which he offered to deposit with me as security—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced by Walker</hi>)—he said he had taken it for pictures, and he had not parted with it, because he would not pay discount for it, that he might have the whole of the money to receive when it came to maturity—he said I might apply about it, and gave me a written direction, "Mr. Newnham, Bomshen, near Macclesfield, Cheshire," as the acceptor of the bill, and the name of a manager of the London and County Joint-Stock Bank at Worthing, who would answer any questions as to respectability—he had before that written his own address, in my presence, "28, Great Pulteney-street"—I did not on that occasion ask him where he lived, because I took it for granted that was right—he said he occupied the ground and first-floors, and that the furniture was his own—I was to write into the country about the bill of exchange, and he then left me—on the 11th he came again, and wished to take the picture in question, by Backhayser—he wished to show it to a young nobleman—I told him I had not received any answer from Cheshire or Worthing; and he said it was strange I had not—this memorandum (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was then drawn up; it was dated 11th, but altered on the following day to 12th—he expressed a desire, in the event of the young nobleman requiring the picture to be left beyond the night, to retain it; and I said, "Certainly not"—he said there was not time to get a decision: he left without it—it was the middle of the day—he called again, earlier, on the 12th, for the picture, and signed the memorandum I had drawn up on the 11th, and the 11th was altered to 12th—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>: "Heceived of Messrs.

               <p>towards Marlborough-street office, to give information, and as I came to the corner I saw the prisoner—he bad evidently seen me before, and was all but into a public-house—I could just see it was him, but could hardly be certain till I got into the public-house, where I collared him, and said, "You are a swindler, and I will give you in charge to the first policeman I meet"—he begged me not to do so, and said if I would go to St. Martin's-lane he would give me the picture—I walked with him, looking about, but did not see a policeman—just as we got through St. Martin's-court, he rang the bell of an attorney, Mr. Columbine—a person opened the door, and he or the prisoner beckoned me in—I refused to enter, and, seeing a police-inspector passing, I beg ged him to come—he came in—we went up-stairs—I saw the prisoner and a clerk there, and I said, "This person has brought me here for the purpose of giving me a picture"—the clerk said, "We have no picture; we do not know him;" and I gave him into custody—this is the picture(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—believe it cost me 125<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I should not have parted with it had I not believed what he represented was true.</p>

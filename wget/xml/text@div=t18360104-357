                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Lupton, a grocer, in Northemp<lb></lb>ton-street, Clerkenwell. On the evening of the 16th December, the prisoner came to my master's shop for an ounce of coffee, and offered me a bad shilling—I returned it to her, and told her I would chop it—she begged me not to chop it, because she took it with two others, of her master, for work—she went away—my master came in and followed her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Saunders' master. I followed the prisoner—she met a man about two hundred yards from my house—he was dressed in a butcher's frock—she said something to him—they walked then to a window—I saw him put his hand into his pocket, and draw out some money, and give to her—she then seemed to count it, and put it into her pocket—the man turned round—he recognised me, and called to the prisoner—he ran away—she followed quickly after him, not hearing exactly what he said—I followed her; but the policeman saw her, and took her—she then thrust her hand under her clothes, and <hi rend="italic">squatted</hi> on the ground—her hand was under her clothes for three minutes, I should think—she was then forced into the public-house, and the policeman searched her.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> You said that you saw him put money into my hand, which was impossible for you to tell, as it was wrapped up in a cloth—the woman at the station-house begged me to give it her, and said it would fare better with me—my shawl fell off in the street, and the policeman took hold of me—I said, "I am picking up my shawl"—he said, "Never mind your shawl"—as soon as the man saw him coming, he put the money into my hand, and ran away. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I did not see the money myself—he apparently took money out of his pocket; and I saw her apparently turning the money over in her hand, and I saw something pass from the man to her—I cannot swear it was money—what he gave her, was put into her hand; she turned it to the light, and looked at it.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you loose a mare at any time, and when? - A. In February, 1803, between the 21st and 26th, I lost her out of the yard of Mr. Thompson, a farmer.</p>
               <p>Q. What kind of a mare was it? - A. A bright bay mare, about fifteen hands high; there was an accidental blemish on the near hind foot (she had got her foot in the halter), by which means the hair rather grew upwards; I was informed when I bought her of the accident; I bought her at a sale of Mr. Crane's; she had four black legs, and a small common star on her forehead; I was informed the next morning after she was taken out of the straw-yard, that she was taken with another; I had had her about a year and a half; she might be about eight years old; she had a black mane.</p>
               <p>Q. This was in February, 1803; when did you see her afterwards? - A. The latter end of April or the beginning of May, in this year; then I saw<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180407040026"></xptr>her in Mr. Preston's stables, near Battle-bridge; I did not tell him I knew her the first time; I called a second time, then she was not there; I called again, and while I was there the mare came into the yard; she had been out on hire; he called her his blood mare; I will swear to her at any time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You took up Preston, and brought him to Hatton-Garden; Preston came to Hatton-Garden, and stated that he bought it of Mr. Shackleford.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. The horse was found in Preston's possession; you took Preston up, and the prisoner came, and said he was the man that sold it to Preston? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - I am a stable-keeper.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you know of this mare? - A. I never saw her before I saw her at Mr. Marsden's livery-stables; Mr. Shackleford was upon her back.</p>
               <p>Q. The mare was found in your possession, which you had in April last, and which Mr. Brown claimed as his mare, and for which you were taken up to Hatton-garden - how long had you had that mare? - A. Near a twelvemonth, to the best of my knowledge; I bought her of Mr. Shackleford at Mr. Marsden's livery-stables, Tottenham-court-road, at the gateway.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she any particular marks on her? - A. Blind on the near eye, with a broken knee, the off knee.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she the least shew that she had been hurt with a halter? - A. Not the least; her legs are as clean as any mare's in the world.</p>
               <p>Q. A horse may have a clean leg, and yet she may be hurt with the halter? - A. There is not the least appearance in the world of her leg being hurt with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she hurt herself with a halter while in your possession? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any marks about that one you bought of Shackleford? - A. There are many particular marks about that mare; in the first place, near the hip, there is a kind of a hole you may put your finger in it when she walks forward; she has four black legs, and on the off side of the body there are three or four white marks; a small white mark on her forehead, and one foot less than the other before, and was always a little tender-footed; I bought her as such.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Did you take any receipt of Mr. Shackleford? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you cannot speak to the time? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When Shackleford came to the office, he went and surrendered himself, that was on Tuesday last Sessions? - A. I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Q. He then went down to Leiceistershire with an officer to bring the person whom he had bought the mare of - did he not return as fast as a mail-coach could take him with the person? - A. To the best of my knowledge, he did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. He was in Court on Friday last Sessions.</p>

             sworn. - I live at Hornsey, I am a farmer, I know when she was lost from my premises.</p>
               <p>Q. You have heard two descriptions of this mare, which is the right? - A. I very well remember the star was on one side of her forehead, she was between fourteen and fifteen hands high; her eyes were perfectly good.</p>
               <p>Q. When you took her in the straw-yard, did you observe whether she had hurt herself with the halter? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing about her feet, or whether she had any white spots on her side? - A. No, neither.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to say, whether that is the same mare you had in your straw-yard? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. By what? - A. By her gift of going, and by her size it is.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pace her? - A. I used to see Mr. Brown ride her three or four times a day before I had her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe her only to have one eye? - A. No, I cannot say I looked over her particularly.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You seem to be a man of some courage to swear that this mare was lost out of your straw-yard - you had not noticed these spots? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is she not here? - A. No, the parties on both sides saw her yesterday.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether this mare has one eye or two? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear to her having four legs, you seem not to have looked over her? -</p>


               <p>- CRANE sworn. - Q. This was your mare once? - A. Yes, I saw her on the 8th of May.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you had her before you sold her? - A. Between four and five years, I sold her to Mr. Brown; I saw her when she was brought to the Office, I believe her to be the same mare.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the white marks on her then? - A. Only the star on her forehead.</p>
               <p>Q. None of the side? - A. I did not take particular notice.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to identify, one would have thought that you would have took particular notice of every hair in her body almost - how old is she? - A. She is eleven years old; I bought her at a year old, and kept her five years.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she hurt herself with the halter? - A. A servant of mine informed me she had three years before I sold her; I have seen the mark, it continued when I parted with her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You do not know that she has any marks on the side? - A. No.</p>

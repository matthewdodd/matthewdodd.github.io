On the 13th of August he asked me to purchase a piece of rosewood, and I hesitated - he said it was worth 20s., and he would let me have it for 5s.; I said it was of little use to me, but if he got it out I would see about it - he said he would send it out that afternoon by Latham's cart; on the 23rd of August I saw him again, he said he had an opportunity of getting it out that morning by the dust-cart- he afterwards called me to his box in his office, and said there was a watch on it; it was stopped - when he showed it me it was by the pile of wood; it laid there a considerable time - it was then moved, and stuck into a pile of rosewood, in the north corner of the quay; I gave him half a crown on account of it - I was aware there was something dishonest; I gave information, and took advice of the superintendent.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. What are you? A. A stone-mason - I told the Police within an hour after the prisoner spoke to me; it was not removed till a few days afterwards - it was stuck into the pile on the 23rd, which was a very proper place.</p>

            . On the 23rd of August I spoke to Cuming about moving some rubbish - the prisoner came up, and asked if he was going to cart away the rubbish; he said Yes - the prisoner then said, "You can take that bit of wood at the same time," and he agreed to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183009160044"></xptr>do it - the prisoner then said to me, "There will come a bit of wood in the cart, will you take care of it?" the rubbish came to my yard, but I did not see the timber, and do not know what it was.</p>

            . I am a watchman to the St. Katherine-dock Company, by order of the superintendent; I watched a particular piece of rosewood - about nine o'clock, in the morning of the 23rd of August, the prisoner came, took it on his shoulder, carried it about sixty yards from the pile of rosewood, and threw it down by the side of a pile of logwood nearer the gate - I said, "What are you going to do with that piece of wood?" he said, "Merchants often have pieces lost, and that will come in for weight;" I made him take it back.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is the place, to which he took it, a place which Latham's cart would have to pass? A. Yes, within a few yards of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where did you see it carried from? A. From the pile - the prisoner was foreman of that part of the quay; I thought he had a right to remove any timber.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Cuming said it was a nice bit of wood, and it would just suit him to make veneers - he offered me 5s. for it; I did not know he was going to take out any shavings for Latham - when he found the wood was not sent out, he told the superintendent; he came every day to ask me if I had got it out, and he named four houses at which I might leave it.</p>

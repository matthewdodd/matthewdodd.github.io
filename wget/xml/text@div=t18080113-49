               <p>Q. Did you see Mr. Adams at all. - A. He was in the shop; he weighed the copper, and she took the money.</p>
               <p>MR. LANE. I bought the copper of Rodman, I gave him a shilling a-pound for it, it weighed eighteen pounds.</p>
               <p>(The property produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>COURT. This woman stands indicted for a felony, she buying this copper, knowing it to be stolen. If you believe the evidence it was done in the presence of the husband. It is not a strict felony because her husband was present; he is supposed to have a controul over her. Why they did not indict the husband, or both husband and wife, I know not.</p>

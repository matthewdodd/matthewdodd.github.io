               <p>I am a shipwright. I took this saw from the prisoner about half after one; he was on board the new ship; the prisoner says he is a shipwright; it was between his breeches and his trowsers; he said he took it through want: I gave it to Mr. Page.</p>

               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Were there any chips that he might cut? - There might.</p>
               <p>Court to Colesworth. Where was the prisoner? - He was walking about when I took the saw from him; I do not know whether he was going to cut any thing, or no; he was not on board the ship; he was walking from the ship.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have nobody here but myself; my wife is dead since I have been in confinement; I have had a great deal of trouble.</p>

               <p>Q. How far had the man got from the patrole? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner the patrole? - I don't know; I know it was the patrole that fired; but I don't know the prisoner to be the patrole; I saw the patrole stoop and he appeared to pick up the bonnet from the ground and gave it to the woman, and he says, Mistress, here is your bonnet, I have got the bonnet; and she said, thank you</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. This was in a place not thoroughly inhabited? - Yes, it was.</p>

               <p>Q. Now within half a dozen yards from where the man was shot it is all new buildings, uninhabited houses? - I cannot pretend to say that the man was shot because I did not see him shot; I did not hear the man was shot till the next morning.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I was told that this young man was shot, in consequence of this I went to Bartholomew's Hospital and there I found him; I believe he was shot on Sunday night the 18th of November, and the Tuesday following I went to him, to the best of my knowledge, and we found him in Queen's Ward, his father was with me, and his father asked him how it came to happen; he said, that he came to a new public house near Tabernacle Walk, and a woman of the town and he had some crank, gin and water; on this he said, that he was there and when he came out he heard this patrole, who is the prisoner, cry patrole; this woman went up to him and said to the patrole, this man has got my bonnet; has he? says he; then he pointed the bayonet at him, and he ran away being frightened at the bayonet; on this he said that he ran very hard; I understand that he was rather deaf of hearing; on this he said that he ran near an hundred yards before he dropped; we begged of him to tell us the truth for the physicians had told us his life was in danger and he could never recover.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the deceased told that he was in danger? - Afterwards we told him the next day, for the physicians had told us that he was so; he said he ran away being frightened, and in about an hundred yards he dropped; in consequence of this we went to the neighbourhood to see if we could learn any thing of this transaction, at last we found one Mr. Mills and he told us he knew and had seen every thing transacted of it, and we went to the sister and she told us; on this we made particular enquiry whether there was any alarm of murder. Also the Sunday before he died he declared that was the truth that he had said to us.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing to you about the bonnet? - He observed one time to the nurse that she threw her gown over her head when he saw the patrole and the bonnet dropped.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Mr. Jones what are you? - I belong to the India House.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you act as an attorney in this business? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never represented yourself as acting in this business? - I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you attend the Coroner's inquest on this occasion? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. The Coroner's jury who heard all this deposition, I believe, brought it in this was justifiable and inevitable homicide on the part of the man? - We were turned down and knew nothing what was brought in; for any thing I know the jury brought him in guilty of shooting him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to stick by this answer? have you never heard that the jury brought it in justifiable homicide? - I don't know the terms of the law in that. The prisoner was not taken up till after he was at Hounslow Heath; there were four bails against him and they never surrendered him up.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath did not he attend the Coroner's jury himself? - I cannot say; I never saw him but once and that was before the Lord Mayor.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200078"></xptr>Q. You never learned what was the verdict of the Coroner's jury? - I understood that they brought it in not guilty of murder, but of shooting.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you ever make any enquiry what the verdict was? - No, we were ordered to prefer a bill before the Grand Jury.</p>
               <p>Q. By whom? - By different opinions of different people.</p>
               <p>Q. You swear you was ordered to attend the Grand jury and prefer a bill of murder against him? - The father-in-law was advised to do so and I told him I would attend and give my evidence.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you take that to be an order? - Mr. Shelton drawed out the bill or his clerk.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any man ever order you to attend the Grand jury to prefer a bill of indictment? - We had a just right to get justice done; the prisoner was under bail of four men of forty pounds each; he was bailed before the death of the man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Now we must go gently on with you? - If you please.</p>
               <p>Q. Then they bailed him with four men in forty pounds each that he was to surrender if the man died; then he was to appear before the Coroner's Jury? - I supposed that the bail ought to bring him there.</p>
               <p>Q. Now on your oath did not you hear that the Grand jury had acquitted him, and that therefore you advised the the father-in-law to indict him for murder? - I did not we were advised to come before the Grand jury.</p>
               <p>Q. You was advised to that? - I had not a doubt but I should go before the Grand jury, I was compelled to it because there were subpoenas given.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you advise the father-in-law to indict the man, yes or no, for murder? - I cannot charge my memory, it is three months ago; several of us did; I might say prefer the bill before the Grand jury.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you or did you not, on your oath? - I might for what I know, but I think to the best of my knowledge I did not; I cannot answer.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not think you did? - I have told you as I told you before; I cannot take on me to say; we were advised in different companies to do it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who took out the subpoenas? - Mr. Cummins the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after the Coroner's jury had sat.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you prefer the bill for murder? - The very next sessions.</p>
               <p>Q. When did the Coroner's jury sit? - On the 28th of November.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you was not at all bound over to prefer a bill of indictment? how came you to tell me you was ordered to attend the Grand jury? - Ordered or not ordered we were advised.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you again whether you was ordered? - No further then we were advised; who could order us, we were advised but not ordered.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to swear that you was ordered to go before the Grand jury? then you was never ordered? - By no authority.</p>
               <p>Court. You come here to speak to expressions, and you therefore ought to be accurate in the expressions you use; was you examined before the Coroner? - We were examined before Mr. Shelton, I think there were a few questions asked.</p>
               <p>Q. And your examination taken down? - To the best of my knowledge Mr. Shelton might; I did not sign any thing, I believe he would not hear but very little what I had to say, because he said I was not present when the man was shot.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear a man of the name of Cropwell and Black examined; they were not present when the man was shot, he heard them? - Mr. Shelton asked them who ordered them to there? and they made answer that the bail had ordered them; that they found we had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200079"></xptr>the runners to take this man up; Mr. Shelton advised the father that it would be only throwing his money away to prosecute the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you present then? - I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you begin with saying you was ordered? - He was not taken up on the Coroner's inquisition at all; I did not see him there.</p>
               <p>Q. After the Coroner had brought in their verdict you did not enquire what it was? - I was told afterwards that it was brought in guilty of shooting, but not of the murder.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you subpoena all the witnesses that were examined before the Coroner? - We did not know of it till two hours before the jury sat.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you was compelled by being subpoened to give in evidence before the Grand jury. Did you subpoena all the witnesses that were before the Coroner? - No, only Sarah Mills and I, and another witness; they were all subpoened but the doctor, who could not be found.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you meant to say that the other witnesses who were examined before the Coroner, where subpoened before the Grand jury? - Yes, the two were; Mr. Cummins subpoened.</p>
               <p>Q. Were all the witnesses subpoened? - There were several witnesses examined before the Coroner in favour of the prisoner, but not in ours.</p>
               <p>Q. What have you to do with it; is it your cause? - No, it is Mr. Cummin's cause.</p>

               <p>Q. Why did you make use of those words, our cause? - It is an error in judgment no doubt.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath did not you go before the Grand jury of Middlesex first, and did they not throw out the bill? - I almost undertake to say it was not drawn up</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know there was a bill prefered in Middlesex and thrown out? - No, I believe not on my oath, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q.Did not you say at some time of the last sessions that you would give such an oath as would do that man's business? - No, I never did to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you know Mr. Hedge? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Moody? - No.</p>
               <p>Q Mr. Rederick? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never said that you would give such an oath as would do that man's business? - No, never to the best of my knowledge; I might have said that I would do all my endeavour to take the prisoner, but never to say that I would do for him, to any person whatever.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never declared to any body that you would make such an oath as would do the prisoner's business, or words to that effect? - I will take my oath that I never said that I will do the prisoner's business, but I would do my endeavour to take him prisoner.</p>

               <p>Court. Did you never say words to that effect? - If I was to die this moment to the best of my knowledge I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. It is a fact which you must recollect? - I cannot, if I knew that I had said so I would acknowledge it; I positively do not think that I ever said such a word.</p>
               <p>- GALE sworn.</p>

               <p>I live in Whitfield-street, Tabernacle Walk, No. 19; I had been out on Sunday evening and returning home I found the deceased laying in a sad situation, near about half past nine to the best of my knowledge, he was laying at No. 4, Friendly-place, at the steps; I thought that the man really had been in liquor; I then knocked at the inhabitants door the deceased laid at, and they brought out a candle; I examined the man and I found he was speechless, for some time I could not get any thing at all out of him, so then I said to the inhabitant, it was a pity the man should lay there in that situation; I supposed the man had been in liquor and had had a fall, and hurt himself; immediately some blood came out of his stomach; I then said, to the inhabitant that lived at the house where the man then laid at the door, it was necessary that that man should be taken care of supposing he had been in liquor and hurted himself by some means, directly hereupon the gentleman at No. 3, says, do you know any watchman that will take this man away? I said, I dare say the patrole is on his duty I will go and desire him to take him; when I came into the street the patrole was crying his round as usual; I then said, Boyle, I want you, he immediately made away to me, and crossing the street he told me, master I have shot a thief; well, says I, what did you do with him, have you taken him; no, sir, says he, he has got away; says I, I have got a man that lay in a shocking situation in Friendly-place; it is about two hundred yards from where the man discharged the piece; I then said to the patrole, there is a man laying in this court perhaps it may be the man you have shot at; do you know the man? he said, no, he should not; it was a very dark night to the best of my remembrance; then I asked him where he had shot him? he said, if I have shot him at all I have shot him in the legs I believe; says I, come up along with me and we will go and look at the man's legs; I examined the man's legs and I found the blood to drop out of the band of his breeches; then the patrole asked him if he had been shot? he said, no; that was repeated twice to the best of my remembrance, and he twice denied that he was shot; in about ten minutes we asked him again; he said, O damn that person that has led me into this error; to the best of my knowledge he then asked him if he had been shot? he immediately said, O! says he, I am shot in the back; directly when we found the man was shot, the inhabitant charged the watch with him, suspecting him to be the thief; I then applied to two of the watchmen and the watchman going past took him; he did not approve of the watchman taking him, he wanted to go in some public house; says I, my friend if you want any thing to support you I will get you something; I went into a public house going past and brought him out a drop of gin, and gave it him and he drank; then in going from that public house to the watch-house he kept still in the same mind, he did not want to go to the watch-house; we went to the watch-house; I spoke to the constable of the night and when they put him in they found the wounds where over the left shoulder; then I said</p>

               <p>to the constable of the night, it was proper the man should have a surgeon to examine his wounds, suppose he was a thief; the constable of the night immediately applied to a surgeon and examined the wound, then my lord I left the watch-house, and saw no more of him till two or three days afterwards, I went to the Hospital and he said, it was some boys that took off the bonnet, and he took it away from the boys.</p>
               <p>Q. And did he say any thing about a bayonet at his breast? - No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I believe this place where the patrole stood on guard is a place much infested with robbers? - There is scarce a week but there is some robbery committed.</p>
               <p>Court. Did Jones attend the Grand jury? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he examined? - He was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I believe this place has a good many uninhabited houses about it? - It has.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course it requires a very active patrole. This wound was not received in front it was in the back? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. The man was discharged by the Coroner's jury? - He was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a secret at all there abouts that the Coroner's jury had acquitted the man? - This Jones stood by the side of me when the jury brought it in that the man was accessary to his own death by running from justice.</p>
               <p>Q. Jones must have heard that? - He certainly must.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you subpoened to attend the Grand jury? - I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. This is nearly about the same spot on which Goodall and Mayo committed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200083"></xptr>the robbery. What is the character of the patrole, is he a malicious man? - I always found the man to be a very just dealing man; he was always very civil indeed; I actually do think he was fit to be trusted in his station.</p>

I was told he was very poorly, Mr. Black went to him first and spoke to him, and asked him how he did? he said, very ill, and asked what was the occasion he was shot? says he, I had been near an hour at Whitefield's Tabernacle; he said, that he had met with a young woman and she and he agreed to go together, after they had agreed to go together, she refused going with him; then says he, I snatched away her bonnet from her and ran away, and I ran such a way that I thought no watchman would meet with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Cropwell are you sure that he made use of these expressions? - I am positively sure; I communicated the sentiment to the employer of him that very night.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Did you think any body could be ignorant that the man was acquitted by the Coroner's verdict? - I should think not.</p>

On Sunday the 18th of November last, between the hours of nine and ten I was sent for, the watchman informed me there was a man had been shot and carried to our watch-house; accordingly I attended, when I came there there was a gentleman of the name of Wilson, he had examined the man before I came and advised him with all expedition to send him to the Hospital; accordingly I did, I sent him to St. Bartholomew's; the next morning I met the houseman and the officer taking the prisoner before the justice; he said to me, the man that was shot last night is now dead. We came near Mr. Hedge's house, and I thought proper to acquaint him with the business; the man was not dead; I went to the Hospital the Sunday following and told the sister of the ward I would be glad to see Mr. Calland; she gave me a candle to go to see him, and he told me that on the Sunday before he was coming along by the Tabernacle that he met with a woman, that he snatched the bonnet off her head and run away; that the woman called out stop thief; that he was stopped by some body; with that he said, that he had passed the patrole, and the patrole said, if he did not stop that he would fire; he said, that the patrole attempted to stop him, but he got by him; soon after that the patrole fired, and that when he shot him he did not know that he had more than stunned him, and that he ran down Friendly-place, about three hundred yards from the place where he was shot; he denied telling his name; when I first sent him to the watch-house he gave me two or three different names.</p>

I saw Evans; she asked me to go home with her - I refused. She put one hand on my thigh, and the other on my neck, and pressed me up against a shop front. McDonald came up, and thrust her hand into my trowsers pocket, and took out some money (I had 9 s. 6 d. there); I seized her hand while it was in my pocket, and saw some money pass from her to Evans, who returned some to her again. On my calling for assistance, McDonald gave me a shilling, and said that was all she had taken, and she got away. I gave Evans in charge of the watchman - she said, she knew nothing of the other woman. McDonald was not taken till next night. Evans was never out of my sight. I did not see McDonald myself for two mornings after. I am certain of her - she was pock-marked. I missed 5 s. from my pocket, besides the shilling returned me. It was a moonlight night - and I held McDonald by the gas light for three minutes.</p>

On Monday, the 28th of October, she came home between nine and ten o'clock at night; she lives on the 2d floor - I live down stairs, and let her in, and was up till near one o'clock. I double locked the door, and it is impossible she could go out - she had no key. She did not leave the house till between eight and nine o'clock in the morning.</p>

The women said they would have something, and dragged the feathers out of my bonnet, and handed them to Pickering. They ran to the end of Charlotte-street, and the man also; I followed, and secured him with my property. He held the feathers under his coat-the women went another way - I told the watchman, but he would not take him. I held him - He knocked me down. I seized and held him for half an hour, until a watchman came. I am sure the prisoners are the persons.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you never gone by another name - A. No, Lowe mentioned my mother's name. She said "Here comes mother Brinkle's daughter". She first wanted to put her two-pence to mine to get something to drink.</p>
               <p>Q. have you never gone by the name of Mitche - A. No, I knew a person of that name eight years ago-my husband was in prison two years ago.</p>

I never lost sight of him; I saw him stopped by the witness - the reticule was then on the ground; Mr. Edwards took it up. There was a pocket-book in it, containing twenty sovereigns and eight shillings - one sovereign and five shillings were loose in the reticule. I had received the money at the Bank of England about an hour and a half before. He was stopped about one hundred yards from where he took the reticule.</p>

            . I was crossing Norway-street - the prisoner ran down the street, right against me; I stopped him - there was no person before him. I laid hold of him by the shoulder. I saw a quantity of silver at my feet; I stooped down, and found my hand upon the reticule - I put it into my pocket, and the prosecutrix came up and claimed it. There was a mob behind the prisoner. I am quite positive he was the person who was in front of the mob.</p>

               <p>JOHN WATSON. I am a Police-constable. On the 19th of November I saw a distiller's waggon in <placeName id="t18291203-181-crimeloc934">Portman-square</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. What time was this? A. After five o'clock - the lamps were lighted; I do not know whether it is usual for spirits to splash in casks; I was twenty or thirty yards off when I first saw it - I did not examine the cask to see if it was leaky; it appeared to me to be a distiller's can that it was poured out of - I would not undertake to swear the prisoners were the men, but their dress was similar, and one man was taller than the other - they appeared to me to belong to the waggon.</p>

             and Co., of Holborn. I sent one hundred and twenty-five gallons of gin in a large pipe to Mr. Johnson; I did not examine the pail when it went out, but I believe there was nothing in it - I have been fifteen years in the service; they took out a can with them: we occasionally send a little in the can, if the cask is short of measure, but this cask had its full measure, and was bunged down properly- Blackmore had been thirteen years in my masters' employ, and Cornell about twelve months.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had they a good character? A. Yes - we have not heard of any gin being deficient.</p>

            . I keep a public-house in St. John's-wood-road. The waggon arrived, brought by the two prisoners, about six o'clock in the evening - they said they had brought the pipe of gin, and delivered the note; they took it out as usual, in a four gallon can - I put it down on a slate; they brought in the last can, and said that made the quantity right - I said it did: Cornell then said to Blackmore."I think we can squeeze master out another, and if we can I dare say he will stand something handsome;" I took out a light, and they turned the cask up to empty it into a pail; it was about three parts full -I considered I had good measure, and was very well satisfied; all the gin in the pipe was my property - it does sometimes run over measure; the officer found two bottles- one had a seal on the cork of it, and that was also directed to a Mr. Johnson; the other bottle had only straw in the neck - it was gin, and certainly appeared of the same quality as that in the pipe - this is the bottle.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I believe you are liable for one hundred and twenty-five gallons? A. Yes - I considered I had that and the overplus; I was quite satisfied with the quality - I proved it by an instrument.</p>

            . I have not tasted this in the bottle - it does sometimes happen that there is over measure; we allow for re-measuring - it was the usual quality, about 25 per cent. under proof.</p>

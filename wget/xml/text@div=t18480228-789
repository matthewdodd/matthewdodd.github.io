                  </hi> I like at Harefild—the prisoner is my nephew, and was in my service. On Thursday, 10th Feb., about eleven o'clock at night, I sent him to London with six hundred weight of copper—he ought to have returned about seven on Friday evening, but did not return—I found him at home on Tuesday, the 15th, and gave him in charge—I found the cart, harness, and till, at the Swan, at Bayswater, and the horse at Mr. Hedges,'on the 12th—Franks, the ostler at the Swan, has been taken up and discharged—I asked the prisoner how he could think of selling the horse—he said Franks sold it, and had 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of the money, and he had 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that he was very drunk, and was sorry for it—I gave him no authority to sell it.</p>

               <p>asked him if he wanted to buy a horse—he said he would not get in a bother by buying another horse—they went together to Mr. Brooks to see if he would buy it—I said at the Swan—Brooks and Hodge came there—they and the prisoner went down the yard together—the prisoner came and told me he had sold Mr. Gadd's horse to Hedges, and had bought a brown one, and that Hedges went to kill Gadd's horse, and found it dead; but I saw Hedges with the horse, standing against the railings, going to take it away—the prisoner gave him a whip to drive—I did not see it go away—I and the prisoner went into the Swan, and staid there that night—I went home next day.</p>

I am a shopman, of Hodderley Road Peckham—on 22nd September, about 9 o'clock p.m., I was passing along Camberwell New Road—I heard a woman's screams on the opposite side of the road from down a little turning—I ran across the road and saw the prisoner run out—I followed him, he ran up Flodden Road, on the same side of the road, the next turn farther on—he got to the top of the road and then he turned round and stopped—he said "What are you following me for?"—I said "What have you been doing to a woman?"—he said "I struck her "—I said "You must have hit her very hard to make her scream like that"—he then wanted to go away; I asked him why he struok her, he said that she wanted to steal his coat, that he had been waiting at the railway station". for his brother two hours, and he came in this little turning—I did not see that his coat was torn—another man came up and said to his hearing "Keep him here, I will go and see what he has done "—he returned and said "He has stabbed a woman "—the prisoner did not say anything—I said "You must go to the station "—at first he said that he should not go; but I overpowered him, and he said he would go quietly—on the way he said that he had got, a knife in his pocket; he took it out of his left hand pocket, and said that that was the only thing he had about him, and he could not do it with that—he said that he had done it with his fist.</p>

About 10o'clock, on the evening of 22nd of September, the prisoner was brought to the station at Camberwell Green, by two gentleman—I did not hear the charge made then—I did not see anyone else there; I charged him to the inspector on duty; in consequence of what the sergeant told me I went to Camberwell New Road, and found that the prosecutrix had been taken, to the hospital—I went and saw her there; I saw she had had an injury to the eye—I returned to the station and charged the prisoner—he said "I admit I struck her with my fist, but not with a knife "—I had previonsly searched him and found on him this old razor. (<hi rend="italic">A razor blade fixed in a deal handle</hi>.) On the following morning I took him to the prosecutrix's bedside—I asked her if she knew anyone there—she said "Yes, that is the man that did this to my eye "—he did not reply; I noticed his clothes; they were not torn.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at St. Thomas' Hospital—on 22nd September the prosecutrix was brought there about 10.30 at night—I received her and examined her—she had much swelling about both eyelids of the left eye; there was a large opening in the left eyeball, and some of the contents had escaped through the wound, the vitreous humour; the rent was about three quarters of an inch long—this knife might have caused it; it was more likely to have been done with some instrument than with a fist—she cannot see at all with that eye, the sight is quite destroyed—she left the hospital about 31st October and has been an out-patient ever since.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> As a student I have had hospital practice some years——since I have been a surgeon I have directed my attention to the study of wounds; it is quite possible for a wound to be the result of a blow, and when the eyeball is burst by it it presents the appearance of a clean cut wound—the contusions point to a blow with a fist rather than an instrument—the bursting of the eyeball would give a sensation of sharp pain; it would be correctly described as a feeling of something entering and coming out of the eye.</p>

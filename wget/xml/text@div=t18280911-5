               <p>NICHOLAS MABLESON. I live at Boston, in Lincolnshire. I was in London on the 6th of August; I met a woman on the evening of the 6th or 7th of August - the prisoner was not the woman who I met in the street; she overtook me - I followed her to a house in a court; I do not know the name of it - it was not far from Spitalfields-church - we went to a public-house, and then to a private house, where I saw the prisoner - we were in a room on the ground floor - the other woman brought a light: I gave her half a crown, then pulled off my coat and laid it on a chair at the foot of the bed - my money was in a canvas purse in my side coat pocket: the prisoner then pushed the door open, flew at me, and struck me in the face; nobody came into the room but her - she then flew at my coat; I said, "You bad villain, what are you going after" - they both got hold of the coat together - I said"You bad husseys, you are going to rob me" - I caught hold of the coat, we all pulled, and they pulled me into the passage: the prisoner had got hold of it first; there were several others in the passage, I received a blow on my right side, and somebody said, "The rascal, murder him!" I thought it was a man who struck me, but I could not see. I had hold of the coat when I received the blow, but I could then hold it no longer - I had almost got out of the passage when I received the blow - I went home without the coat, and saw no more of it till about ten o'clock, when I went there with a watchman - we found the prisoner and took her; both the women had hold of the coat when I let go of it; there was a 10l. and a 5l. Boston Bank note in the pocket, also two 1l. Lincoln notes and fifteen sovereigns; they were all in a purse; I had seen it all safe half or three quarters of an hour before, and am sure they were safe when I went into the house; I went to the place with a watchman about ten o'clock and took the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. When they took your coat, what became of them? A. They all went away with it and a man came into the room and said "What do you do here?" when I went there at ten o'clock, that room was locked; we went into the other room - as soon as the watchman opened the door I saw the prisoner, and said, "You are the woman who helped to rob me" - she said "Me! that I did not" "Oh! you bad hussey, (said I) I know you well enough, you helped to rob me;" she was taken to the watch-house - I am certain it was her; I was perfectly sober, and had drunk nothing but a 6d. glass of wine and water, and about half a glass of gin with the woman who decoyed me in.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you see me in the street? A. No, you helped to rob me in the room.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How came your coat on the chair? A. I gave the woman half a crown and was going to stop there, but immediately I put the coat there, the prisoner broke the door open - they both got hold of the coat before me; I did not catch hold of it a moment after them - we all caught hold of it together as near as possible; I received several blows in the passage - I pulled till I received the blow in the passage; I received several blows, but cannot tell who gave me the blows: I held the coat till I received the last blow - the prisoner said "You rascal, we will murder you if you offer to resist" and she struck me the moment she came in.</p>

            . I am a watchman. The prosecutor called to me as I was going my rounds on the 6th of August, about five minutes past ten o'clock, and complained of being robbed; I went with him to the prisoner's apartment - I found her in her own apartment, and several others with her; the house is in Christchurch parish: the prosecutor saw her and said she had helped to rob him - she strongly denied it; I took her to the watch-house - it was five minutes after ten o'clock when I got to her apartments; the prosecutor pointed out nobody but her - he was perfectly sober; I did not search her - I searched the room she was in, and the adjoining one, but found nothing.</p>

            . I am a cnductor of the nightly watch of Christchurch - the prisoner was brought to the watch-house on the night of the 6th of August; the prosecutor accused her of the robbery - she strongly denied it, and said she was out nursing in Widegate-street, in the neighbourhood, nursing two children, and was not at home at the time of the robbery; I searched the house all over but found nothing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been out nursing two children all day, I came home at half-past ten o'clock and was going to bed, when the watchman came and said I had robbed a man - I had not been in my room at all, and never saw the prosecutor before.</p>

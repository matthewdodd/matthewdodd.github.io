               <p>Q. That is a drug that is used, I believe, in colouring and dying? - A. Yes, it is used but very little in London; we have sold it at seven shillings a pound to the trade; be the quantity what it will, that has been the price these two years.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you a servant in your employ, of the name of Darbyshire? - A. We had.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of any information you received from Darbyshire, did you go to the house of Marker, the defendant? - A. I did, with two constables, Wainwright and Hall, we had a search-warrant with us, on Wednesday evening the 26th of November last.</p>
               <p>Q. What business does he appear to carry on? - A. It has the appearance of a druggist's shop, there are bottles in the window, situated in Petticoat-lane, in the city of London; we went about three o'clock, Mr. Fullwood went with us.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the defendant a customer of yours? - A. No; I did not know there was such a person existing before.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it usually sold wholesale or retail? - A. What we sell to people who sell by retail, is three or four pounds at a time, and very small quantities, but what we principally sell in London is for shipping; Marker was in a littleroom adjoining the shop, he asked the officers what they wanted, and they said, to look over his house; he said, what do you want, the officers said, annatto; he said, do you want to buy any; I am not sure, but I think he said, I make it; I said, we want it, and we must see whether you have got any or not, and made towards the counter in the shop; they said, we must see what you have got in the drawers in your counter; he opened two drawers which contained nothing of that sort, they were the upper drawers of the counter; the officers said, we must see the lower drawers, he got his back against them, and was very much averse to opening them; they said, they must see into them; then, with a great deal of reluctance, he opened one a little way, and shut it up again immediately; we found a quantity of annatto in the counter, in these drawers; the officers then examined the drawers, and found a quantity of annatto in those drawers, there is about eighty pounds weight of it found in two large drawers, and some little in another place; upon looking at that, we believed it to be our property, some of it has got our original mark, we found it exactly according to the information we had from Darbyshire.</p>
               <p>Q. Does he continue in your service? - A. Yes, and we mean to continue him; the annatto is all marked when we manufacture it; but there is a great deal of it defaced, some totally, and some but little.</p>
               <p>Q. Besides these marks, have you any other reasons to know it to be your's? - A. Yes, the composition is such as I never saw it equalled by any body in the consistence of the colour and the quality of it; it is a particular article that I never saw made by any body; he said, as he said before, that he made annatto; we then took him before the Magistrate, and he was committed, and afterwards bailed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You first said, you believed the articles to be your's? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You believe also that you are the sole manufacturer of it? - A. Yes, of this quality.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know any body else in the city of London, or its environs, that manufactures annatto of the same quality? - A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that annatto of the same quality is not manufactured in the city of London, or it's environs? - A. Not to my knowledge, I never saw any.</p>
               <p>Q. He said at first when he came into the shop, that he made annatto? - A. Not at first.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might if be after? - A. In answer to the third question.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he, after the annatto was put into the drawer, say, he made annatto? - A. He only said so once, I did not hear him say so a second time.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. I take it for granted, Marker said, as he said before, that he made annatto? - A. I stand corrected, I believe I did say so.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to the house, did you make it known to him that you had a search-warrant? - A. They told him they must look all over his house, for they had an authority.</p>
               <p>Q. Darbyshire, upon whose information all this case depends, you found had robbed you to a considerable degree? - A. I cannot say to what amount.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he not robbed you to the amount of five pounds? - A. God knows what amount, I dare say a great many pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he not been in the habit of robbing you for a considerable length of time? - A. I dare say he had.</p>
               <p>Q. How great a length of time did you learn, from his information, that he had been a thief to you, instead of a servant? - A. There was another man that lived with us that robbed us.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you, how long Darbyshire stated to you that he had been robbing you? - A. It is impossible for me to say; he had been with me about two years.</p>
               <p>Q. How much of that time had he been robbing you? - A. I don't suppose he robbed us at all, till that other man came into our employ, he was an extra man.</p>
               <p>Q. When was that? - A. In March last.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180101140102"></xptr>Q. Soon after March, I suppose then, he commenced thief? - A. Soon after, I suppose.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you any thing about the other man having robbed you, before you caught him? - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. As to this extra man, as you call him, this extra thief, he never told you of it till he was detected? - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever sell annatto by retail? - A. When people bring money, we never turn them away, but we are very seldom enquired of for it.</p>
               <p>Q. To oblige a customer, sometimes, you sell small quantities? - A. Any quantity they chuse.</p>
               <p>Q. You have a pretty good trade, I suppose? - A. Pretty well, but not so good as your's.</p>
               <p>Q. I wish you could make that out-my friend stated in his opening, that it is used for colouring cheese? - A. Yes; what is used of it in London is for making picture-frames; cheese is coloured in the country.</p>
               <p>Q. Cheese may be coloured with it in London? - A. Cheese is not made in London.</p>
               <p>Q. Oh yes, it is; I have eat very good cheese made in London-will not annatto in travelling easily lose its marks? - A. It may.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am in partnership with Mr. Jackson; I went with him and the officers to Marker's house, but my attention was principally paid to the drawers where the annatto was locked up; I called in the constables, and pointed to the drawers, according to the description that Darbyshire had given; Marker first of all said, he did not belong to the house; I immediately pointed to the drawers; Hall, the constable, said, he must look into those drawers; then immediately Abraham Marker came, as though he belonged to the house; there are two counters; these were the drawers in the left hand counter; Marker put himself against the drawers, and was averse to opening them; at last, with much ado, he opened two or three drawers, I cannot say how many, and there was no annatto there; Hall, the constable, insisted upon seeing the other drawers opened, he opened one of them a little way, and said, there is annatto, and shut it again immediately, and so he did several times; Hall, the constable, insisted upon having these drawers opened wide, that he might see; I desired it might be taken to the light, that I might see if it was our annatto, as I know the article so well, and I found that it was.</p>
               <p>Q. About what quantity was there? - A. About eighty pounds; as soon as ever it came to the light I knew it to have gone from our house, to be ours; he was then apprehended and carried before a Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Was Mr. Jackson by at the time that you heard Marker say he did not belong to the house? - A. He was in a little room, but whether he might hear that or not, I cannot say, I rather think he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Now and then, to oblige customers, you let small quantities go out of your house? - A. Very few want small quantities; it runs generally seven or fourteen pounds at a time, sometimes more and sometimes less.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it when they do go out in that way, they go out with other marks upon them? - A. They do; they make it a rule not to order it till it is wanted, because we can keep it better than they.</p>

I am one of the Marshalmen of the city of London; I went with a search warrant to the house of the defendant with Wainwright and the prosecutor; the defendant's house is in the city of London; on the 26th of November last, we went through the shop into a back room, where the prisoner was then sitting with his wife; I enquired of the prisoner whether he was the master of the house; he replied what do you want; I then said again, do you belong to, or are you master of this house; he said, no; whether you are or not, says I, I am going to search the house; why, what do you want, says he, I am the master then; I told him we had come to look for some annatto; he said he had annatto, what did I want with it; I told him we must look at what he had got; he then said he made it; we then went into the room where Jackson's partner was, and I told the prisoner we must look in those drawers that were under the counter; the prisoner then opened some drawers at the top of the counter which did not contain annatto; I told him I must see the whole of the drawers opened; he then opened the drawers, and Mr. Jackson's partner said that was annatto; the prisoner said, you will spoil my goods, you will spoil my goods, and then went to shut the drawer again; I told him we must see the drawer out, which he was very loth to do; he then said it was not as he made it; Mr. Jackson and Mr. Fullwood claimed it; then we opened some more drawers, and we found some more; we did not take the whole of it away; Mr. Fullwood and Wainwright took it; we did not get the whole that is here till the next day; Marker said, I might go up stairs and see the stuff, and where it was worked; we went into his work-shop, and there was a tub with some stuff in it, that they told me was annatto; the prisoner desired us particularly to go up there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined Mr. Knapp. - Q. Did you go in your present dress? - A. Yes; and Mr. Marker knew me, for he asked me how one of my partners did, that he had known many years.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know of his having any annatto of your master's? - A. Yes; a fellow-servant of mine, of the name of Thomas, I think, Thomas Walton, I am not sure, had been with some annatto to Marker, and he persuaded me to go with him.</p>
               <p>Q. How long ago is that since you were persuaded to go with Thomas to Marker's? - A. I think the latter end of June or beginning of July; I am not positive; we both took some annatto.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. The indictment charges the 20th of November.</p>
               <p>Court. I think you must confine yourself to some one time.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. When was the last time you carried any annatto to Marker's? - A. I think Thursday, the 20th of November.</p>
               <p>Q. About what quantity did you take him then? - A. I think about four pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it your master's? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Marker know who you were? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he know who you lived with? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he give you for that quantity? - A. One shilling a pound; he put it into a drawer under the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after was it that your masters detected you in taking their goods away? - A. The Tuesday following.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you then give them any information of what you had been doing with this annatto? - A. Yes; I told them they would find it in the drawers under Mr. Marker's counter.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had he known whose servant you were? - A. Ever since July.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever tell him how you came by the annatto? - A. Yes; I told him it was my masters' property; it was the annatto that we worked, and I told him that he knew how we came by it, and he said, very well, he would take it then.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever say any thing to you about coming in company or alone? - A. Yes; when we both came together, he desired us not to come together again, because people would take notice of us.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he perfectly acquainted that you came dishonestly by it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. On the 20th of November was Walton with you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. That was a little private transaction of your own? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You know you are saving yourself from prosecution by giving evidence to-day? - A. I don't know that.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I tell you that you do; you have had no promise from your master to remain in his service? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And you do not understand now that you are to continue in his service? - A. I do not know but what I must be turned out.</p>
               <p>Q. You gave no account of this till your master detected you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore, whatever Walton told you, you prosited by? - A. Yes, I followed it up, but I never profited much.</p>

               <p>Q. You thought this a very honest thing, I suppose? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. However, the beaten track that was marked out for you, you followed? - A. Yes, I had been several times.</p>
               <p>Q. And you did not say one word about it till you were found out? - A. No.(Wainwright produced the property.)</p>
               <p>Q. (To Mr. Fullwood). Q. Point out the mark? - A. I know it as well by the quality as the mark quite; I never saw any like it before; ours are all marked with a P; most of these are obliterated; there are several with his name at one end, and my P at the other end; here is one that has A M at the one end, and my P obliterated at the other end; I have some with me that I have brought from home. (Produces them.)</p>
               <p>Q. Have you also your marking-iron? - A. Yes. (Produces it.)</p>
               <p>Q. Independent of that mark, is there any composition sufficient for you to swear to? - A. I would swear to it sooner from the quality than from the marks; I never saw any of such quality; besides, I know it by the peculiar smell, and the composition that keeps it from getting mouldy, and is very different in its flavour; I have tried the colours in water, and they exactly resemble one another both as to the quality of the colour, and as to the colour itself.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you tried any other experiment - there are some with only A M upon them; have you tried any of them? - A. Yes, and they correspond exactly.</p>
               <p>A. Did you go up stairs into Marker's house, where the tub was? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the contents of that tub appear to be annatto? - A. Yes; it appeared to be our annatto mixed, there were two sorts in the tub; it had got hard, and that was to soften it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you employ a person of the name of Weedon in your manufactory? - A. Yes; he has been eight years.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. The marking-iron, with a P at the end of it, would be a very remarkable thing?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180101140104"></xptr>- A. There might be a P, but I don't think any body can resemble the quality.</p>

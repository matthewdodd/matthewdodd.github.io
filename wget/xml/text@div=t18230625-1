The hole was not in the roof the evening before; it was two or three yards from where the coats are kept. I missed ten coats - the bundles appeared to have been undone, and some taken from each; they were intermixed. There was a black coat, and a pair of pantaloons there on the evening before, which I also missed. I found the ten coats at the Thames Police Office.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the morning of the 5th of June, between one and two o'clock, I met the prisoners in Upper East Smithfield - I stopped them and asked where they were going; they said a little further - they had each a regimental great coat on. Bassett had two pair of pantaloons under his coat; one pair was linen, and the other kerseymere - I took them from him, and desired the watchman to assist in taking them to the watch-house. While he was taking Bassett along, Moakes slipped off his great coat and ran off - we caught him again; I am certain of him.</p>

            . On the 11th of September last, I was going from Cheapside through <placeName id="t17550116-18-crimeloc96">St. Paul's church-yard</placeName>

A little beyond the Chapter-house I missed my handkerchief (I had used it as I entered the church-yard); I made a full stop, and said to Mr. Unwin, I have lost my handkerchief since I came into the church-yard. Two boys came up and told me, if I would follow them, they would shew me the person that took it. They running before me, I and Mr. Unwin went after them, and betwixt the Goose-and-Gridiron and Child's coffee-house I met with them. The two boys said, these are the boys ( pointing to the two prisoners) one picked your pocket, and gave it to the other. We secured them immediately; in going to search them, I saw my handkerchief lying about half a yard behind the boy I had hold of, (the handkerchief produced in court, and deposed to.) I did not see it drop from either of them; it is a linen handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they run away?</p>
               <p>J. Heley. They were walking very briskly, but did not run.</p>

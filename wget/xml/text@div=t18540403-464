                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. William Sproston, a fishmonger, No. 9, Love-lane; the outer door of his place was fastened with a spring lock; other persons use that. On that Saturday night I locked the door of the counting house, and shut the outer door—I cannot say what property I left in the counting house, except books and an iron chest; no valuable property—there were old bills of parcels of no value—there was a day book, and three or four other books in the iron chest, but that was not opened—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185404030014"></xptr>
               <p>there was nothing in the desks but paper and books of no value, as I am aware of—I should think they would not sell for anything—there was nothing but papers and books; there might have been a few pens—I am not aware that there was any penknife; there might have been; there were some old checks—the two desks were broken open, and the papers which were in them were scattered about the floor—there was nothing besides the papers and books removed, except the coat, which was moved off the chair—this piece of iron was not in the counting house when I left it.</p>

The statement I gave to the Court and Jury in the last case was correct and true—there was a cap and a jacket, and two or three coats, I observed in the counting house, when I went there, at 6 o'clock—the coats were old, they were on the floor—the jacket was on a stool, and the cap on a desk.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a greengrocer, and live at No. 157, Union-street, in the Borough I was disturbed on the morning of 8th June, some one tapped at my window—I went down stairs, and found the window open which leads into the passage of the public house adjoining—when I went to bed, that window was closed, and a bundle was placed to keep it fast to—I missed the bundle and a tea chest, which was standing on a table close by the window—the bundle contained shirts, stockings, and drawers, and other things—I went into the public house, found the prisoners in custody, and saw my property, which I have described—there are shutters to that window, and they were closed the night previous—they did not fasten; it is a sash window, which opens upwards.</p>

I am waiter at the public house next door to Mr. Clay's—I was in the bar last "Wednesday night—there had been a concert at our house—I saw the prisoners there—they came up about half past 10, or a quarter before 11 o'clock—the room was closed about half past 11 o'clock, and the company came down and had refreshment at the bar—I thought the prisoners were gone home, but they came from backwards, with a bundle and a tea chest—they must have come through the passage into which the prosecutor's window comes—Jones had both the bundle and the tea chest—I knew very well that they had not had the bundle or the tea chest in their possession before, and I went round and told Jones to drop the bundle, which he did—I took him round to the tap room, and took the tea chest from him—Henderson went away—the landlady said we had better go after him—he was pursued, and brought back.</p>

I left home at half past four o'clock that morning, (the 19th), and left my wife at home. I returned about eight o'clock in the evening; it was then dark, and my wife was not at home.

We each have a key; I returned, and met my wife; we went home together; the room was in disorder.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's wife. I left the house at half past seven o'clock in the morning - I locked the door, and to the best of my knowledge, took the key with me; when I returned, I found the things which I had left there in the morning, taken away. I missed a Norwich-crape gown, which I had worn on the Sunday before; this was Monday; my husband's blue coat, his hat, two silk handkerchiefs, and a shawl.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ADOLPHUS. Q. You think you locked the door? A. To the best of my knowledge I did. It is usual for me to go and breakfast with my mother, and to come back to see if I had locked it, and I did so that morning. The prisoner Reading's mother lodged in the house, and I believe he lived with her; I had not seen him that day; there is another lodger in the house; the street door goes on a pully in the day time.</p>

On the 19th of September, about two o'clock in the morning, I saw the two prisoners - Preston was in the yard - I saw Reading come to him. - I thought Reading went up stairs as he went back, and Preston went into the privy. Girling lives in the first floor back-room. I did not see Preston come out - but shortly afterwards I saw Reading go into the privy, and thought they were both there. I was in the house myself - but I do not know whether any body else was.</p>

On the 19th of September, about six o'clock in the evening, both the prisoner's came to the shop with a great coat, a gown, a shawl, two handkerchiefs, a hat and whittle. I asked who they came from - they said from their father, who lived at No. 2, Fashion-street, Spitalfields; that he was at Smithfield waiting for 2 l., as he had bought a horse for ten guineas, and he wanted 2 l., or two guineas more. I said I could advance only 35 s. - they said they must bring something more for 5 s. I lent them 35 s. - they gave the name of Thomas Williams, Fashion-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you know either of them before? A. I do not recollect having seen them - I live about a mile from Palmer's. I could only afford 5 s.</p>

               <p>I am a constable of Hatton-garden; I saw nothing of the robbery; I apprehended the prisoner on Saturday last in the parish of Clerkenwell, near Clerkenwell Prison; I examined her, and found a guinea and a half in gold, and eleven shillings and six-pence in silver, good and bad; six-pennyworth of copper farthings and half pence; two small shut knives, commonly called pen knives, both clasp knives; fifteen duplicates; but they did not lead to any thing as I have understood; and a box key; I found two half crowns, one bad one.</p>
               <p>Court to Shifton. Are any shillings marked? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you speak to any half-pence? - No, I can speak to the clasp knife, I know it by the wear; I had it two years, there is no mark particularly, but the person who ground it last put S. or Shipton on it, I don't know which, the maker's name is Charwood.</p>
               <p>Jury. Do you swear absolutely to this knife being in your possession? - I do think also I know the half crown; I knew Mr. Randall gave me one, and I believe it to be the same I received of him.</p>
               <p>Randall. This is the half crown I gave him positively, it has two or three scratches on it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Between eleven and twelve o'clock I was walking up Holborn, and another young woman with me, I met this gentleman and a tall thin young lad, and I spoke to the young lad that was with the gentleman, and the other young woman spoke to that gentleman; says she to me, shall we all go home to your room? no, says I, my landlady don't like it. O, says she, she will be in bed. We went to my room, and the gentleman gave me six pence to get something to drink; he did not chuse me, he liked the other young woman best; so I asked him for a trifle more; he gave half a crown and a shilling to get some rum, and I went down stairs, and left the other young woman with him; the other young man went off before we were at the top of the stairs, and said to me let me change hats with him, he is quite in liquor, he will not know it. I suppose this man robbed him, I know he was nothing better that a pickpocket, I suppose he robbed him, and then wanted to get rid of him.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Was you in company with any other young woman? - I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to bed with this woman, did you give her any money, or make her any present? - I did.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you give her the half crown? - I don't know that I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect whether you gave her gold or silver? - Silver.</p>

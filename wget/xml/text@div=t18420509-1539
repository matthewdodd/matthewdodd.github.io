                  </hi>. I am assistant overseer of the parish of St. Marylebone. The prisoner was a pauper in the Union-house some months before the 3rd of April last—I ascertained from him that he had been an attorney's clerk, and I employed him a considerable time in the office as a copying clerk—I did not give him any wages—on the 3rd of April we had a family chargeable to the parish, which we wished to remove to Leatherhead—I provided a conveyance to take them to Leatherhead, and gave the pri<lb></lb>soner instructions to start with them early on the Monday morning, to de<lb></lb>liver the papers to the overseers at Leatherhead, and to get an abandonment of the order of removal signed by the proper officers there—I furnished him with a bill of 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., at the same time telling him not to wait unless the amount was immediately paid, but to come back—I anthorized him to re<lb></lb>ceive the 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and bring it back to me—this is the bill I gave to the prisoner—it is in my own handwriting, besides which I gave him 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to provide the family with a little refreshment on the road, and what he could save out of it for himself he might keep—that was quite distinct from the 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he had no authority to keep that—I provided a person to drive the cart—the cart came back about twelve o'clock the same night with the driver—the prisoner arrived about three quarters of an hour afterwards the worse for liquor—I asked him for the papers, which he gave me—I said, "Have they paid you the money?"—he said, "No, but the overseer will send it you in a few days"—the master of the workhouse ordered him to bed—I do not know whether he did go—I left the house then—he left the workhouse next morning—I inquired for him at the office at ten o'clock, and found he had been sent out by the master, and finding he did not re<lb></lb>turn as he should, I discharged him from the house—I believe he was not there again—I never saw him till the 16th, when he applied to me fur the sum of 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to enable him to purchase a coat—that sum had been ordered to him by the Board of Guardians in February last—he said he had a situation, and wanted the coat to enable him to go to it—on that occasion I said to him, "Keene, what have you done with the 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.?"—he said, "What 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>?"—I said, "You must be aware that by this time I have written to Leatherhead, and I have a copy of the bill and receipt now in my possession"—he said, "I have never received the money," on which I gave him into custody—he had never accounted</p>

                  </hi>. In April last I was overseer for the parish of Leatherhead, in Surrey. On the 4th of that month the prisoner came to me with a family from Marylebone—I consented to receive them—he presented this bill to me, together with another paper, and said, "I am requested to produce these to you from Mr. Messer"—I said, "Very well, I will sign the other paper and this, and send you up the money in the course of a few days"—he then pointed out to me that the bill being al<lb></lb>ready receipted, not doubting but what we should find it right, and pay it immediately, he of course could not leave it unless I paid him the money—I made enquiries of the paupers, and after that I gave the prisoner a sover<lb></lb>eign, and he returned me half-a-crown out of it—he then left me this paper—(<hi rend="italic">the receipt upon this paper was as follows: "April</hi> 3, 1842, <hi rend="italic">Received the above for J. J. Messer, assistant overseer,</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">W. H. KEENE</hi>")—I paid the 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to the prisoner for the Directors and Guardians of Marylebone—he brought the receipt ready written—it is dated the day before—he told me it was his own handwriting.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. MESSER</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">re-examined.</hi> This receipt is the prisoner's handwriting—I took the prisoner into the office—I have not had to pay the 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to the Guardians—that question has not been disposed of—I do not know yet which will lose this, the Guardians or myself—if the Guardians insist on it I shall pay it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> When Mr. Messer gave me the account to receive the 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., he said if the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was not enough to pay the expences, I could take some of that money and account to him. I have the account made out how the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was expended. My expences came to 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. which made me press Mr. Billinghurst for the money, not having sufficient without. I perhaps took a little too much, and when I got back the master of the workhouse ordered me to be locked up in a cell, and next morning sent me out to look for the horse and cart, which all the while was in their own possession. I said I did not know where to look for it; he said if I returned without it he would have me transported, for making away with it, and I was afraid to return to the house on that account. I admit that when Mr. Messer asked me if I had received the balance I said I had not, but I only intended to retain it till the morning, and then make out the account, but no opportunity was given me of doing so. I had no inten<lb></lb>tion of appropriating the money to my own use.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">re-examined,</hi> I never said to the prisoner that if he had not enough money with what I gave him to pay his expences, he might take some of the other—the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was ample, and he might have had 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184205090081"></xptr>
               <p>out of it—he never mentioned before to day that he had spent part of the money on the road—he never gave me any account—he charges us with corn, and he had more than enough corn provided, for he brought some back with him.</p>

               <p>Q. On this ground where you had been playing were there not a quantity of bricks piled up, which had been pulled out of the old buildings. - A. Yes, there were bricks piled up.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not the boys on that occasion, when this unfortunate accident happened, and on former occasions, pulled down these bricks. - A. No, they never touched these bricks.</p>

               <p>Q. The man at the bar had been put on the premises for the purpose of taking care of the property. - A. I did not know that.</p>
               <p>Q. He lived in a little house that was inclosed by a wall. - A. Yes; there were all bricks piled up about the house; there were two doors to this house.</p>

               <p>Q. Then when you come to the other door from which he fired the gun, would be upon his left hand. A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. After the brick bat was thrown, and before the gun was fired, did not the boys run about from one door of the house to another door. - A. No; as soon as he throwed the brick we ran a distance off.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not some of these boys climb up these bricks and stones that were piled up at his house, and pelt his house with brick bats and stones, and threw them in at his windows. - A. No, there were none of the boys did that.</p>

I immediately put my hand down by the back part of his head, I found a hole, I saw he was shot; I took his coat off, and found a hole in his neck, and a hole in his coat and waistcoat; then with assistance I took him home to his aunt's in Bell-lane.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you quite sure that at the time you saw and heard the piece go off, and the time you fell over the deceased, that only one piece went off. - A. Yes. After I had taken the boy home, I went and shewed the people where the prisoner lived; I opened his private door, the front door, and he was washing his hands; and I shewed them his back door where he let off the piece. On seeing him washing his hands, I said this is the man that let off the piece, I knew him before; they said go and fetch an officer. In the mean time I was gone they took him in custody.</p>

               <p>Q. So light that you were able to distinguish a stone from a brick bat. - A. Yes; I picked up the brick bat afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet not light enough to distinguish whether it was a gun or a blunderbuss. - A. Because as soon as he pulled the trigger, he let it off and went away.</p>
               <p>Q. How came it about that you fell over this boy, as it was so light - A. As I turned the corner I happened to slip over him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had there been no brick bats thrown by the boys nor no noise. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You have told us that the prisoner came out of a door with a gun or a blunderbuss, I ask you, supposing you were standing with your back to the prisoners's house, would that door be to the right or to the left. - A. It is the right hand door.</p>

I did; between five and six o'clock in the afternoon upon the ruins in Strype's-yard, there was a number of boys playing about in Strype's-yard; Houghton put his right hand into his right hand waistcoat pocket, and pulled out some shots; he then said he should shoot some of them into these boys; I went away then.

               <p>Q. Did not the man at the bar, against whom you said you had no ill will, did not he within ten days before this commenced, detect and stop you carrying away a piece of timber. - A. He did not.</p>
               <p>Q. That is as true as all you have said; now in charity let me ask you, upon your oath, did not that man while these buildings were pulling down, stop you with a piece of timber on your back, which you had taken out of that house. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember at any time when Mr. White was attending with the prisoner at the bar, and another man, the prisoner having said to Mr. White you was the man that was stopped when you was carrying away the timber that was stole from the house. - A.

             about this prosecution. - A. I never said one single syllable to her except once.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell her what she was to say, and afterwards told her to take care to speak to the story you had given her. - A. No, I never did.</p>
               <p>Court. Nor any thing to that effect. - A. I did not, and so the girl will say when she comes here; I have never been in her company but when I was going to the magistrate, and before the coroner's inquest and coming here.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Do you know her mistress. - A. I do, being a neighbour.</p>

               <p>Court. You are not to be threatened at all.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Have you been threatened by the prisoner's brother. - A. I have been threatened by the prisoner's brother.</p>
               <p>Court. How far were you from this place when you heard the report of the gun. - A. I might be thirty yards distant; I did not go out, because I was used to hear the report of a gun two or three times of a night; I did not think the man would be guilty of it.</p>

Among the boys that were playing in the ruins; Joseph advised him not to do so if he wanted to frighten the boys to put a little loose powder in the gun and to fire it in the air, that would frighten the boys and they would run away; I then went home.</p>

Yes; it was between five and six o'clock; I was two or three yards from Houghton's house; I saw Houghton come out of his own door with a gun in his hand; there was some boys playing at hoop among themselves; they were not doing any thing as I could see.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see him do any thing with the gun. - A. He pointed it at the boys and directly let it off.</p>
               <p>Q. Had either of the boys before that done any thing to him. - A. Not while I was there. I did not see the boy fall among so many; directly almost he had let the gun off, he went in doors; as he was going in doors he said these words to himself, d - n your eyes, you young rascals, I think I have shot some of them into you. I saw no more; I was there about two or three minutes before this accident happened.</p>
               <p>Q. Before the gun was fired. - A. Yes; I was almost fronting of the house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. You say the first thing you observed was the man coming out and firing the gun - how near was he to his door when he fired. - A. About two or three yards from his own door.</p>
               <p>Q. Your expression now is that he pointed the gun at the boys. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not said that the gun was not pointed to any one. - A. I never said any such thing, nor any thing like it.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance was it from the place where the man stood to where the boys stood, was it the distance from one end of this room to the other. - A. It might be about that length; the boys stood right front of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a great quantity of bricks on this ground. - A. There were a great many, but they had not been touching them.</p>
               <p>Q. The pile of bricks were higher in some places than in others. - A. I cannot tell, they were very high.</p>
               <p>Q. If the boy was standing in the front of that man's house, must not the pile of bricks be direct between the man and the boy that was killed. - A. No; the man came past one pile of bricks; he stood at the side of the last pile. I was standing two or three yards from the door that he came out off.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he pass by you. - A. He did not.</p>

               <p>Q. You said the boys were all quiet, and had not been doing any thing at the time of the firing. - A. They was not.</p>
               <p>Q. He came out in that wicked way and fired at them and they were doing nothing at all to him. - A. They did not at that time, I was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you not shortly before seen them throwing of bricks about. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. You had just come down, you saw the thing done and then went up stairs. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Had you ever been on that ground before. - A. Never but once before.</p>
               <p>Q. Your mistresses house is but a short way from the place. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You know where Mr. Joseph lives, who has been a witness. - A, Yes, I do; he lives in a building facing my mistress's house.</p>
               <p>Q. He comes to your mistresses' house now and then as he is a neighbour. - A. No, he never came up in our house.</p>
               <p>Q. How often have you been in company with Joseph since the boy has been killed. - A. I never was in company with him only in coming up with him and the rest of the witnesses to the magistrate, and to day.</p>
               <p>Q. How often have you been to Joseph's house. - A. I was never at the place where he lives.</p>
               <p>Q. You have never seen a man hanged, I hope. - A. I would not wish to see such a thing.</p>
               <p>Q. You have never said you would like to see the prisoner hanged. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Take care, and remember you are upon your oath, be cautious in the answers you give me - have you never said you should like to see the prisoner hanged. - A. No, I never have.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it that induced you to ask Joseph what day the man would be hanged. - A. I did not say such a word.</p>
               <p>Q. Remember, Joseph has been examined, therefore attend to the question I ask you - whether you did not enquire of Joseph at what time the prisoner at the bar would be hanged. - A. No, sir, I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember returning home with him from the coroner's inquest. - A. We all come home together from every place were we have been; I had no conversation with Joseph, I walked next to my master.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not say one word to him coming from the coroners. - A. No sir; what should I trouble my head with the man, he did not trouble me.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not the curiosity to enquire of him what time the man would be hanged. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You are a servant, and in the same place now as you were then. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether your mistress has ever been asked whether she would give you a holiday. - A. She has never been asked.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you tell me that Joseph never told you he would ask your mistress to give you a holiday to see the prisoner at the bar hanged. - A. No, he never did.</p>
               <p>Q. You have the opportunity now to be cautious, and to take care to speak nothing but the truth - then Joseph never said any thing of that sort to you. - A. He never did.</p>
               <p>Q. You know Mr. White. - A. Yes, I have seen him on the premises.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you never said to Mr. White, that you would do all you could for the purpose of hanging the prisoner. - A. No sir; I never did.</p>

             - a crime above all others that is punished with immediate death - that punishment the laws of the country has inflicted upon all those that transgress them. I can assure you the death of the youth arose from accident; and were I guilty of the charge, I should tremble at this bar, and yield up my life as an atonement to his injured relatives; but conscious that I am not guilty of the charge, I will relate the following circumstances to you, in order that you may come to a proper conclusion on the subject upon which you are to pronounce your verdict. - I was brought up a carpenter. In 1804, 5, 6, I worked at the new brewery in Golden-lane, where I had the misfortune to fall from the premises and break my leg, and one leg being shorter than the other, I was unable to follow my business, and seven weeks before this melancholy accident happened, I was employed by the proprietors to superintend the works going on there. In consequence of several robberies having been committed on the premises, one of the proprietors gave me a musket, some powder, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180710280043"></xptr>small shot, to repel any attempt that might be made to rob the premises; notwithstanding I was in the habit of firing the powder off every night, yet frequent robberies were committed on the premises, as will appear by Mr. White, who is one of the proprietors. On Saturday afternoon, and the whole of the Sunday, I was generally annoyed by boys and men, who were on these days employed in tossing up, and who when requested by me to desist from these proceedings, have assailed me with brick bats and stones. I have frequently fired over them with powder only. On Sunday the 7th of October, hearing a great noise in one of the houses, I went and desired these persons to depart; I was then under the necessity of running away; I threatened to fire at them, they said fire and be damned; and after having fired, the door was pelted with bricks and stones. On the afternoon the accident happened, several boys and men began to assemble in Strype's yard; they threw bricks one after another. I repeatedly requested them to desist; instead of desisting, they continued till they pulled down the lining of a large stack of bricks, by which a great many were scattered about. About half after five, two persons of the name of Bottle and Martin, who had contracted to take down, clean, and stack the bricks at a certain sum per thousand, when they had done work I discharged them, for which purpose I went into the house; I was occupied in washing my hands, when I heard a great noise in the yard; I went out immediately, I was assailed with stones and brick bats, when I begged them to desist. I went into the house and got the gun, and fired it off, thinking it was loaded with powder only, and when in the act of letting it off, standing on some bricks, I fell down. After the gun had been fired, my next step was to enquire for a peace officer, that the offending parties might be secured. - You will find by the evidence of a person who will be produced before you, that I went in company with him to the office in Worship-street for assistance. - I now have communicated to you the pure, simple, and unadorned truth, attending this melancholy event. - Permit me to ask you, from these facts, whether the crime of murder can be alledged against me. It is alledged that I knew the unfortunate youth - can it be said that I did it to obtain his property - certainly not; was there any other end that could be answered by his death - no, there was not. - I appeal to that God who gave us all life, whether the death that has happened has been occasioned by any wilful act of mine, or whether it has not arisen merely by accident. - Gentlemen, it may be asked, why do not I bring some person to prove what I have asserted, who were there present at the time; I will tell you - this happened at a time when all the workmen were gone from their work, and not an individual remained, unless those that were engaged more or less in the affray. I shall supply that defect by bringing forward a witness, who will prove what was the conduct of the persons then assembled, and when I was with them; I will produce witnesses that have known me many years, who will prove to you that I am not possessed of a vicious or a bad mind. You are now engaged to try a man for the murder of one whom, from his situation in life, he could never be benefited by his death, and who had no object in view in the destruction of a fellow creature - who has been instrumental in bringing one child into the world. - May that God that rules all your minds overrule mine, and if it be your verdict this day that I am doomed to suffer the awful sentence of the law - conscious of my own innocence, I shall resign my soul into the hands of that God who gave it, and though my body may be destroyed on earth, my soul shall arise triumphant in glory, and see the face of God, in whose presence there is fullness of joy, and at whose right hand there are pleasures for ever more.</p>

            . - Mr. Alley. What are you. - A. I am a coal merchant.</p>
               <p>Q. You are one of the proprietors of the premises that we have been speaking of today. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of you and some others purchasing these premises, did you employ the prisoner to take care of these premises. - A. I recommended the prisoner, and he was so employed.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you assigned him a house on the premises for his abode. - A. Yes, while he was in our service. And three or four days after he was put on the premises, he applied to me in consequence of some depredations that had been committed on the property; I furnished him with a gun, some powder, and shot.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you in point of fact know that depredations had been committed on the property. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The house that he inhabited, is there a wall in the front. - A. There is a yard, and a wall round it; there are two doors, one to the right, and the other to the left.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they in the front - look at the plan, and tell me whether that is an accurate description of the place. A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. If you stand with your back to the front of the man's house, you have your right hand to one door and your left hand to the other. - A. Exactly so.</p>
               <p>Q. When a man comes out on the left hand door, there is no bricks nor stones to interrupt the passage. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. If you turn yourself to the right hand door, then the bricks present themselves before you. - A. Yes; there is a clamp of bricks piled up about three feet and a half from the door; they are of an irregular length; some part one foot, and so on to six feet.</p>
               <p>Q. What directions did you give the man. - A.We gave him directions the protect the property belonging to the concern; we told him to fire the gun off every night before he went to bed.</p>

            . - A. I have, On the Monday morning before the coroner's jury sat, I was on the premises in Strype's yard, near the pump, giving directions to the men to secure all the avenues leading into it, by a fence, and the evidence Terry was close to me where I was speaking to the men; she said she would hang the man; my reply to her was, you little puss, do you know any thing about this concern; she said it did not signify, he should be hung on that ground.</p>
               <p>Q. I would ask you the character of this man. - A. I have known him this three years, I have employed him in my own house for some time; I found him to be a sober, honest, and industrious young man; on that account I recommended him to this concern. The property that he was entrusted with was between two and three thousand pounds. He had applied to me for some assistance to protect him; I ordered him to engage a watchman, which he did.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you told me that the property had been considerably plundered. - A. I am clearly convinced of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180710280044"></xptr>that, because I know the articles that were plundered.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. I observed you said there was a clamp of bricks at some distance from the door. - A. Yes, towards Bell-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. They are of different heights all along the clamp, one of six foot, another of four, and another of two foot, just by the door. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What height - was it three yards from the door towards the pump. - A. It may be four foot, running down to one.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose you were to take three yards on the side of the door, and then towards the pump, was it not less than four feet there. - A. Most assuredly, it was as low as one foot at the end of it.</p>
               <p>Q. You have told us of some expression used by the girl Terry - had you any conversation with her previous to the expression that she made use of. - A. She spoke to me before I opened my lips to her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you attend before the magistrate. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you happen to mention these expressions before the magistrate, - A. I did not, because the magistrate said I had no right to say any thing without the prisoner was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you produce the gun then. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. I observe you said you employed this person, and you gave this person directions to fire with powder at night - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever give him any directions to fire with shot. - A. Not without he was beset at night; I told him to protect himself, not when I gave him the gun, but in a week afterwards I did, and so did sir

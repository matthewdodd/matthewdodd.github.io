                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, P</hi> 126). I have been nearly six years in the force—some time in June last, I received some information with refer-ence to Sunter, in consequence of which I watched him—I was in plain clothes—on Wednesday, 19th June, I saw him go into the Bridge-house public-house, in the Borough-road, about twenty-seven minutes past 4—Cutmore was barman there—he was behind the bar when Suuter went in—I had gone in previously, and was talking to Cutmore as a customer—I was drinking half a pint of beer—while I was drinking it Sunter came in—he called for a half a pint of beer—Cutmore served him; he put down a six-pence on the counter—Cutmore took up the sixpence, took some coppers out of one till, went to another till and took out two shillings; he came direct to where Sunter stood, and put down the two shillings and some coppers on the counter in front of him—it was put behind the beer engine, nearly out my sight—upon seeing the money put down there, I directly moved up closer to Sunter, and I saw the two shillings and some coppers—Sunter took them up and left the house—no conversation took place between the prisoners—no more than asking for the half-pint of beer—Cutmore pot the sixpence in the till—when Sunter took up the money, I was so close to him that my sleeve touched his arm—I am quite certain there were two shillings, and that only sixpence was given—I followed Sunter to a public-house in Newport-market, and to several other public-houses—on that occasion Sunter was walking in his waistcoat, and with his shirt sleeves tucked up, and I was the same myself; he had no coat—after going to several public-houses he came back to the Bridge house—I did not take him into custody that day—on the following Saturday, about 4 o'clock, I went again into the Bridgehouse-tavern—he went to another public-house that same evening, and shortly afterwards, about 9 o'clock, he was taken into custody—I was not present when he was taken; I beard of his being taken—on Saturday evening I went to No. 1, Duke-street, Westminster-road; that is a shop which Sunter holds; he could not live there, it consists of only two very small rooms, full of all sorts of locks, and keys, and other things—his name was up over the door—Sunter was in custody at the time I went there—I searched the premises—I found five or six packets of copper money, con<lb></lb>sisting of 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each, and some silver money also, amounting altogether to 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 0 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I found the copper money in all parts of the shop, some in an old pint-pot, some in an old boot, and some in an old watering-pot; I also found some other articles there—I took Cutmore into custody on the Saturday night (that was before I had searched at Sunter's)—I told him I was a police-constable, and I should take him into custody for robbing his employer, on Wednesday the 19th, of 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>—he said he knew nothing about it.</p>

I bonght it—I reported this matter the same night to my superintendent, Mr. Payne, of the P division—I believe he is not here—I did not enter this in my book, because I always enter such things as this on a sheet of foolscap that I carry purposely—I merely enter rubbish in this book, all sorts of things (<hi rend="italic">handing it in</hi>); some of them are private entries and some on business—I enter any<lb></lb>thing that occurs on my beat, such as goods removed, or the numbers of cabs, and such things; those I enter in the book when I have got no foolscap with me—you may find this matter entered there, and now I come to recollect I believe you will—I made it on foolscap—I buy the foolscap; I do that out of my pound a week and less than that—no books or papers are provided for us; I have always found them for myself ever since I have been a police-constable—I see there is no entry here—there was nobody but Sunter and I in the compartment I was in at the time this occurred—no one but Cutmore was behind the bar—I did not call the attention of any, one in the house to this until the Saturday night.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a warehouse-keeper at the Commercial Docks, Rotherhithe—on 14th September, I saw the prisoners near the "F" ware-house about half-past 11 o'clock in the morning—I asked them what they were doing there—they said they were looking out for a job—I told them that was not the place to look for a job, and that they had better go about their business; in about half an hour I saw Daniels coming out of the warehouse, and Maryon from behind the warehouse—neither of them had a right to be. there—I went up to them and told them to walk out of the dock—they did so—on my way I went direct to the pile of deals close to the <hi rend="italic">s</hi>. "F" warehouse, and saw two bags there—I examined them—they con<lb></lb>tained barley—there was barley in the "F" warehouse at that time—I examined the contents of the bags with the contents of the bulk in the warehouse, and the barley was similar in quality—the bags are here, and I have some of the bulk in my pocket—the bags do not belong to the company—upon finding the bags I said something to an officer, and he watched in consequence—the value of the corn is about 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I have charge of the bags of the Commercial Dock Company—I watched some bags for half or three-quarters of an hour—the prisoners came up to them—Maryon took them from the pile and carried them to the fence, which is about ten or twelve yards, and deposited them on a pile of deals as near the side of the fence as could be—he followed me to the gate and outside the dock—Daniels undid a bag again—they had been tied together previously—I took the prisoners to the office, where Daniel said that he had got the pass for it, and that it was all right—no distance was saved by going that way—it was half a mile out of their way, if they were going to London with it.</p>

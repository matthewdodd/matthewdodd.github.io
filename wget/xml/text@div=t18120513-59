On Saturday, the 2nd of May, I went out to a charity committee, for which I always go one day in every month; that my servant was well aware of. I was gone about two hours and a half. On my return my servant was gone. I found almost all my plate gone, except some weighty articles that she, I suppose, in her hurry, could not take away. On the Monday I received a blank cover, containing thirty-four pawnbroker's tickets, enclosed without any writing on the cover. On making a rough draft, between seventy and eighty pounds appeared to have been lent on these tickets. These are the duplicates.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she given you any intimation that she wished to leave your service - A. She had given warning, and she was to go on the Saturday.</p>
               <p>Mr. Challenor. The prisoner, you say, sent you back the duplicates - A. She did.</p>
               <p>Q. She had a child; had she not - A. I believe she had. I never saw the child.</p>

               <p>Q. What are they worth - A. From six to seven pounds. I produce also a soup bason, pawned for four pounds; and a milk ewer, pawned on the same day for three guineas.

               <p>On Thursday morning, the 8th of October, about half past nine, I saw the prosecutor at Poland-street; he said he had been robbed; I knew nothing of the prisoner, and went in search of her; I found her at the High Flier; I went up stairs; the door was locked inside; I knocked frequently; nobody answered; I burst the door, and found the prisoner sitting by the fire, and some of the property on the bed, tied up in a white table cloth; I found three shirts in the window; this handkerchief and stockings I found on the prisoner; I have the things.</p>

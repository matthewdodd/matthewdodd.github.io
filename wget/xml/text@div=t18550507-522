                  </hi>.

Cash and Wright is not entered to the prisoner, but a portion appears to have been torn off the 317 sheet.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would not they be put into another lift? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, when the prisoner was going the same route; but I believe he only went that way once afterwards, and that was the day that the amounts were found to have been paid—a boy whose name I do not know goes with the cart as well, to see that none of the goods fall off; he is thirteen or fourteen years of age—I know that there was a puncheon left in the yard directed to Cash and Wright—I find no notice of it in this bill—I did not deliver the bill per<lb></lb>sonally to the prisoner—I believe it is not in the same state as when it left my hands.</p>

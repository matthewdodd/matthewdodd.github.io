               <p>Q. Did you lose any money on the 11th of September - A. Yes, some then and some before; the money that I lost on that day was some of it marked.</p>
               <p>Q. How much marked money did you miss - A. Thirteen pence from the till in my bar; the prisoner lived servant with me. I observed the prisoner go up stairs: I asked a person in the house to go up stairs and hear if he was counting money, and when the prisoner came down stairs I perceived he had something bulky in his pocket; he was going out of doors and I stopped him; I desired him to walk in. I felt his pockets, I found he had money in them; I sent for a constable, I had him searched, I found upon him fourteen shillings and eight pence; amongst that money there was thirteen pence that I marked the over night.</p>
               <p>MR. LUDLEY. I am a constable; I searched the prisoner, I found upon him fourteen shillings and eight pence in penny pieces, half pence, and farthings. I produce them, I have had them ever since.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I marked them with a penknife, a cross on the head of some of them, and a scratch on the other side of others; this one is marked on the king's nose.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carman, and live in Upper Charlton-street, Fitzroy-square. On the 17th of September, about seven o'clock in the evening, I was at the Grosvenor Arms public-house, in Grosvenor-street—the prisoner came into the room, with other persons—I never saw him before—I had known Thomas Croft for about a month previous to this—I had seen him daily—he came in soon after the prisoner—the prisoner raised</p>

               <p>up his arms, and began sparring at him—Croft said, "Mr. Buckland, I am not in the humour to take any of your nonsense, if you do not desist you will create a <hi rend="italic">row</hi>"—the prisoner had pot attempted to strike him, but was only sparringr as I thought, in good humour—the prisoner then pushed Croft toward the door, and Croft pushed him back again—the prisoner then pushed him out of the room into the passage, and a scuffle took place in the passage for about a minute—I remained in the room, others went into the passage—the prisoner came back about a minute after, and appealed to me and others if we did not see Croft strike him—I said, "No, I did not see a blow on either side"—shortly after I heard Croft's leg was broken—I went into the tap-room, where Croft was sitting on a form, and somebody hold<lb></lb>ing his leg—a surgeon was sent for—the prisoner was not in the tap-room.—Croft was taken in a coach to the hospital—he was sixty-three years old—the prisoner is about thirty-five, I believe, and is a gentleman's servant.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cheesemonger, and live in John-street, Golden-square. I was at Owen's public-house on this evening, about seven o'clock, standing in front of the bar—I saw the parlour-door open, and Croft walk out backwards, followed by the prisoner—I never saw either of them before—as Croft came out of the door I heard him say, "Don't strike me"—I saw the prisoner strike him about the head and face, and he fell down backwards in the passage—I rather think it was a back-handed blow—I did not see any stick—I did not hear Croft speak after<lb></lb>wards—they took him into the tap-room directly, and the prisoner went into the parlour again—in about half a minute a policeman was tent for, and he was given in charge—the surgeon came, and I saw Croft on the form—I believe he was the same person I had seen in the passage, but I could not get near him for the crowd.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a servant out of place. I was in the parlour at the Grosvenor Arms public-house—the prisoner came in with a friend of his named Brammage—I know the prisoner very well, he is a gentleman's servant—I believe they did not bit down—they had a pint of beer—the prisoner was rather in liquor—Croft, who was the waiter at the house, came in a few minutes after—he and the prisoner were known to each other—there was no quarrel between them—Croft came and stood close to the prisoner, and turned round in about a quarter of a minute to go out into the passage—the prisoner said, "Why did you strike me?"—I had seen no blow struck—Croft went out directly into the passage of his own accord, as far a I saw—the prisoner stepped after him, and spoke to him—I had not seen any sparring in the room—I heard a noise, and went into the passage—I saw Croft lying on the floor—I went to take him up—he was taken into the tap-room, and sat on a form—the prisoner re<lb></lb>turned into the parlour, and sat down very peaceably—he never attempted to move—Croft complained of his leg being broken—I heard the prisoner say he was very sorry for what had happened, and I believe no man was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184010190050"></xptr>
               <p>more so—he appeared very sorry—the gas was not lighted in the parlour it that time—I do not know whether it was lighted in the passage—I saw it alight after the surgeon came.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had you seen Croft and the prisoner together be<lb></lb>fore? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—they always appeared on very friendly terms—the pri<lb></lb>soner said it was entirely an accident; that be meant no harm towards the man; and that liquor was the cause of it—I have known the prisoner about twelve months or upwards—he has lived in respectable situations, and appeared a quiet, well-disposed, inoffensive man, except when in liquor—he is then rather frolicsome than angry—I went to the hospital to see Croft three times, and talked to him—he was the same person as was in<lb></lb>jured at the house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at St. George's Hospital. I saw the deceased there on the 19th of September—he was admitted on the 17th—he had a fracture of both bones of the right leg—the larger bone had protruded through the skin—there was a wound of about an inch in extent on the fore part of the leg, from the protrusion of the bone—I attended him till the 11th of October, when he died in consequence of the accident—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination, and found he died with abscesses on the liver and lungs, arising from the fracture of the leg—I judge of that from many cases I have seen before of the same kind, in which the matter is taken up from the leg to the liver and lungs—I have no doubt whatever that the injury of the leg was the original cause of death—the fracture might have been produced by many causes—there was no disease of the bone to cause it to give way suddenly, only the bones of old persons give way more easily than others—there was a good deal of external bruising around the fracture, about the middle of the leg.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Might the fracture be occasioned by a sudden fall on the floor, without any thing else? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the deceased's constitution was very much broken—if he had been of an unbroken constitution I think he would have recovered.</p>

I saw the pane half an hour or twenty minutes before, it was whole then - it was dark. I also missed a roll of flannel, containing about eighteen yards, which cost three shillings a yard, and two waistcoat-pieces, about three yards each.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the things again - A. On Monday the 22d. I saw all the patent cord in possession of Welfare and Reeve, it was then cut into two pieces, also about twelve yards of the corderoy, and about a yard and a half of one of the waistcoat pieces.</p>

            . I am an officer of the Town Hall, in the Borough. On Sunday, the 14th of November, about one o'clock at noon, I saw the prisoner, Moore, in New-street, Borough, with something under his arm, wrapped in a green baize; I suspected and pursued him - he saw me and ran away; I did not call to him as I was ill. He was walking quietly along when I first saw him. He met three more, who nodded to him, to inform him I was coming. He walked to the corner, and then ran. I saw him go in at a door down the yard of a livery-stable, by the Obelisk turnpike gate.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there any houses there - A. There is a house, and some rooms which are occupied as a coffee-shop - I did not see which he went into - the yard is no thoroughfare. I went into the house, then went into a bed-room on the opposite side of the yard, up one pair of stairs, and found two pieces of cloth and the green baize lying by the side of the bed. I do not know who the room belonged to.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you find the prisoner - A. Not there; I searched the house all over. The green baize was like that I saw him with, and about the same size.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe whether the baize was fastened when he had it - A. It was loose - I saw the corners hanging down; I have had them ever since. It was a fine day.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181912010008"></xptr>I took the cloth with me, and went to

            . I am a leather-seller. On Sunday, the 14th of November, about one o'clock, I saw Moore; he came into my room, No. 1, Obelisk livery-stables, which is up the yard; he had a bundle, which was not tied up. He asked me if Mr. Dyer (who frequents the rooms) was there? he was not there; he asked me if he might leave a parcel for him, which he did.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did it remain there - A. A very short time - I took it up to a bed-room across the yard, up one pair of stairs, and laid it on the bed - I did not see what it contained.</p>
               <p>Q. From the bulk and weight, might it have contained these things - A. I thought it was bigger than them; it was large enough to hold them. As I came across the yard I saw Welfare - this was three or four minutes after I carried it up; he appeared to be going up the bed-room stairs, I did not know what he was going up for. I have not been into the bed-room since.</p>

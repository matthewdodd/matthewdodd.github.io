                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my brother—we are brass-founders in St. John-square—the prisoner was in my service. On the 8th of February last, I saw him quit my premises—in consequence of in<lb></lb>formation, I followed him with Pearce—I came up with him in Wilder<lb></lb>ness-row, and told him I wanted him at home—he came back, and I told him to give me the metal he had got, and he immediately produced these weights and brass cocks—he said it was his first offence, and he hoped to be forgiven—when we got to the station, the policeman produced another weight—I asked the prisoner where he lodged—he said, in Castle-street, at the back of Shoreditch church—I went to the number he described, and found this key, which is from our pattern—I could not swear to it, but they are such as we have.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Frost. On the evening of the 8th of February I put my hand under some straw, and felt what I con<lb></lb>sidered to be a four-pound weight—I left it there, and watched till a few minutes past eight o'clock—the prisoner was the first person I saw go near the spot—as soon as he left the premises, I felt, and the weight was gone—I told my master—the prisoner came back, and my master desired him to give up the property—he produced part of a large brass cock, and several weights—among them was one four-pound weight—he begged to be for<lb></lb>given, he had done it on account of his embarrassed circumstances.</p>

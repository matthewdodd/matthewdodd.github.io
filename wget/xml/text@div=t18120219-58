On the 7th of February, between three and four o'clock, I was awoke by my dog, in a yard that adjoins my premises, I got up and dressed myself, I saw a light going the road from Stamford-hill, I came to the front of the house, and called out watch; the person said it was not the watch, he said his name was Soul; I told him to stop at the back gate until I came down, I wanted his light; I let him in, and searched the premise, I brought a musquet with me; my fowls were placed at the back part of the coach house. When I got to the coach-house door, I found the padlock off, and the door pulled too by the string; I opened the door, and found the prisoner standing towards the front of the coach-house, and by the side of him was a bag, it was filled with fowls and ducks; we took him in custody; he made no resistance; I told him to stand still, I searched him. I brought him to the front of the house, the watchmen were there; I delivered him into the custody of the watchmen. We then examined the bag, there was, I believe, eight fowls and three ducks in the bag, and he had four fowls in his blue apron; the officer took them out; all their necks were broke.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose fowls were these - A. Mine, I examined them all; I sould swear to them all.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was your place locked up - A. I am not certain whether it was or not.</p>

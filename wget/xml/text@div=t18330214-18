               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not say he had not taken it? A. No - I was out on my business; I am a chair-maker - I was about five yards from the cart; I never said I was not nearer than thirty yards; I could not identify the other men - I had never seen the prisoner before; I know the prisoner, because he was on the side of the cart, and when he turned and threw the tea at me, I looked him full in the face; it was about six o'clock in the evening - it was very light in some part of the street; I never missed the prisoner but once, and when I saw him again I was certain of him - the Policeman brought him up to me - there were no turnings about that spot; the other three passed me, and went up Bread-street - they were on the other side of the cart.</p>

            . I am a constable. I heard the cry of Stop thief! I saw the prisoner running without his hat - I followed, and stopped him; he said he had broken a window; I said he must come back and prove it - Darter came up in a very short time, and said he was the man who had stolen the tea out of Bread-street; he had a box with him then, I believe, but I am not positive - I saw the Excise-mark on the box; I afterwards saw it opened - it contained tea: at the watch-house the prisoner said he merely ran with other people.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you the person who apprehended him? A. Yes; a person had stopped him just before I came up, and he told him the same - nobody was holding him when I came up, the other person had let him go; I had seen him stopped on Old Fish-street-hill - Darter said, "That is the man that took the tea;" I stopped him in Old Fish-street-hill, by Labour-in-vain-yard, four or five hundred yards from where he had come, I suppose - I believe Darter had the box of tea with him; I know he had it before we got to the watch-house - it was enough for me to look after the prisoner; I had seen him come out of Distaff-lane.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Labour-in-vain-yard is not in Old Fish-street-hill? A. I believe it is - when I first saw the prisoner nobody but him was running, but several followed; there was nobody between me and the prisoner; I inquired all round the neighbourhood, and there was no glass broken; Darter was not with me when he said he had broken a window.</p>

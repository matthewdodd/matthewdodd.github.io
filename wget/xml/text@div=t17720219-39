               <p>Q. How do you know the prisoner is one?</p>
               <p>Matthews. It was light enough for us to see they walked close by me; It was about five in the evening; they walked close by the chaise. The other had a pistol, I did not see that the prisoner had any thing. They robbed me of a guinea. I went and made an information next morning at Sir

               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did no body describe him, nor point him out to you?</p>

               <p>Q. Are you very sure he was the man?</p>
               <p>Matthews. Yes; they both went by the side of the chaise. Then they turned back, and the prisoner came by me again, and run to the horses head, and the other claped a pistol to me. They did not use me with any violence. I did not see arms on the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. What business are you?</p>
               <p>Matthews. I am a horse-dealer, and keep the Grey hound in Holborn. I beg to recommend the prisoner for mercy, as he did not use me with any violence.</p>
               <p>Q. From the prisoner. Did you ever see me before the time you was robbed?</p>
               <p>Matthews. No.</p>
               <p>Q. From the prisoner. Whether you did not come last Wednesday to Newgate to Lewis, and asked him whether he knew me, and gave him a shilling?</p>
               <p>Matthews. I had signed a petition for Lewis to his Majesty, to beg that he might be transported for life. I went up to the gate, and said I have got the other man; he said yes, I hear he is in prison some where, but I don't know much of him.</p>

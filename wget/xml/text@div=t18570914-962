                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the Admiralty.

                  </hi>. I am senior clerk in the office of the Civil Service Commissioners. The defendant came to my office on 27th July—I asked him to answer in writing certain questions, which are printed on a paper, placing the paper before him, one of those questions being, "What was your age on your last birthday?"—this is the paper which he wrote in my presence—(<hi rend="italic">This described his birthday as May</hi> 22<hi rend="italic">nd</hi>, 1840, <hi rend="italic">and his age last birthday as seventeen</hi>)—he had before, or at the time he had that paper given to him, handed in certain papers which I examined, while he was filling up the form—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I looked at them, and noticed that there were erasures, and, when he brought me the paper filled op, I said to him, "Are you aware that both these certificates have been altered?"—he said, "Yes"—I then said to him, "How do you account for that?"—he said that Mr. Hatchard, who is the gentleman signing one of them, had at first sent them up wrong, and that he had returned them to Mr. Hatchard to be corrected, and Mr. Hatchard had returned them in their present state to him—I said it was impossible that that explana<lb></lb>tion could be the correct one, because one of the certificates was the super<lb></lb>intendent registrar's certificate, with which Mr. Hatchard would have nothing to do, and which he would certainly not alter—he repeated that that had been the cause—I again expressed some doubt, and he then replied that he did not know how it was; he supposed his father would know some<lb></lb>thing about it—I retained these papers—he was examined, I think, on the following day—the papers were then in the same state as they are now.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What was the office for which he was an applicant? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A temporary clerkship under the Admiralty—I have no means of knowing what the salary would be attached to that—the appointment would be one that he would be liable to be turned out of immediately, as I understand it, but I do not know exactly—I gave him the order for exami<lb></lb>nation in the usual course, and sent him in to the Commissioners, leaving it to them to do as they thought proper; turning him away from examination was beyond my power—he was examined before the Commissioners decided on the case, but the examination was never considered—I am quite certain that when I said to him, "Are you aware there have been alterations?" he replied, "Yes"—I can pledge my oath of it; I say so distinctly—he used the word "Yes"—when he spoke of the papers having been sent down to Mr. Hatchard, he said, "I sent them down," but that I am not so positive about; I believe he did not say they had been sent down, but I would not pledge myself that he did not.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Vicar of St. Andrew's, Plymouth. This certificate of baptism was both written and signed by me at the time it purports to bear date—I have with me the original register of baptisms—when I made this copy, it was not pasted on paper as it is now—there is an alteration in the document, which was not made by me, or by my authority—I believe it was never sent back to me after I parted with it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is there not a mistake in the name? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There is a transposition of names—I wrote the names on this paper as they are in the register, and by some one, who I know not, a transposition has been made by figures, which I had nothing to do with—the name in the register in my handwriting is Edwin William James—here a figure "I" is put over</p>

               <p>the "William," and a "2" over the "Edwin"—that was certainly not done by the clerk, the transaction was entirely my own—I cannot tell whose writing the figures "1" and "2" are—I have known the prisoner all his life; I never heard of his being other than a good boy; his friends are most respectable—I know his father and mother, and knew his grand-father—the boy was always thought well of—his brother lives at Plymouth, and I believe his aunt.</p>

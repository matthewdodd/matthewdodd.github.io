                  </hi>. I am single, and was staying with my brother at Hammersmith—I have been in the service of Capt. Travers—I became acquainted with the prisoner in 1837, when he was in the 12th regiment of Lancers at Hounslow—I saw him again last Dec—I was then living at Brigh<lb></lb>ton in service—he told me he had left his regiment, and promised to marry me—he staid at Brighton a little time—I left my place and came to London with him—I packed my own wearing apparel in three boxes, and went to the Roebuck in Tooley-street—I left my boxes there in charge of the prisoner to take care of for me while I went to visit my friends—I went on the 21st of Feb., and returned on the 27th—while I was away I received this letter from the prisoner—I know it is in his handwriting (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—" London, Feb. 1844.—You will be surprised to hear what has happened; since you have left London I Was taken by one of our men, and only for treating him well for three days I should have lost my liberty; I was compelled to pledge all your things for the money, and in consequence will leave London, for fear of your trying to have me taken. I will stop only till you write, so that I may send you all the duplicates; but I will be very cautious about going where I have directed your letter to come, as I am in great fear. Direct to me at the Hare and Hounds, Islington, I dare not presume any more, but ask pardon, and will, as soon as I get work in some other town, send the money to roe-lease them. I remain still yours, &amp;c. C. <hi rend="smallCaps">CLAIR</hi>."—I went to the Roe-buck—the prisoner was gone—I afterwards found him in custody, and charged him with having robbed me—he said he would redeem all my things for me again—I never authorised him to pledge or dispose of this property—they</p>

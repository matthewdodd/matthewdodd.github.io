                  </hi>. I am servant at this house. On the day the prisoner left, about half-past ten o'clock, I was washing the breakfast things, and heard footsteps coming down stairs—I knew it was not master's or mistress's feet, and the prosecutor was gone out with beer—I heard the back door open,</p>

               <p>and shut again after the person—I then went to the kitchen window, looked out, and saw the prisoner with a carpet belonging to the lobby of the staircase wrapped up as a bundle, and through a slit in the carpet I could see a black silk handkerchief, as he went into the skittle-ground—I then went up to him and asked what he had there—he said the carpets to shake—I said there was no carpet wanted shaking, and asked where the bundle was that was with it—he looked towards the bench, and there was the bundle, containing two coats, a pair of trowsers, and waistcoat—the carpet was by the side of where he stood—I took up the bundle, and he begged me to let him go, which I did; I was so frightened, I could not hinder him—I had not taken hold of him—he went out at the stable gate—I took the bundle into the bar, opened it, and discovered the prosecutor's clothes—I knew them, as I kept them in a drawer in my bed-room—I know it was the same bundle by the handkerchief which I saw through the slit in the carpet—I am sure I saw it in the prisoner's hand.</p>

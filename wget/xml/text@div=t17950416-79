On the 4th of April, information was received from Worship-street of a person stealing a sash. I could not attend then; but I attended the Saturday following, and I see the sash there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know it to be your sash? - Yes, from the number, and the form a it was marked No.7.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had it in Worship-street? - The watchman who took it, William Riddle. The frame was marked No. 7,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179504160206"></xptr>and we took it, and it matched the sash and the sash lines.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I would wish you to ask him, whether he did not hold a bond of four thousand pounds in possession from my brother, and he has done this on account of keeping me in custody, that I may not be able to prove that it is my brother's.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Is that your house, or his brother's? - It is my house. I was unfortunate enough to lend his brother two thousand pounds on it, I have the bond.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it your house? - It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you take it upon you to say, that you have the bond? - I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it a complete house? - Yes, it is; I have it for sale; I have been bid one thousand eight hundred pounds on it. I have no action against his brother.</p>
               <p>Q. You have never let it? - No.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a patrol of Finsbury-square; I am a labouring man by day. About half after eight in the evening, on the 4th of April, Mr. Bedford's servant came and called patrol! I immediately went and found the door open, the area gate, and likewife the kitchen window. I immediately went down to the kitchen, and on going down the kitchen stairs, I met the prisoner half way, with the sash under his left arm. I took hold of him; he begged for God's sake to let him go. I would not let him go; I told him, if he offered to stir, I would knock him down.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it a glazed wooden sash? - Yes; I have had it from that time to this.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see what part of the house it belonged to? - I went along with the carpenter, and see it matched.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did it match to? - To No. 7, the second pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. In whose house was it? - Mr. Evans's. (Produced.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I know it by the No. 7; we always mark the sash before we send it to the glaziers, and here is the mark of No. 7 on it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Please your lordship, and gentlemen of the jury, I was at work just by Moorfields-square; it was then between seven and eight o'clock. I was at the corner of Sun-street, and went to get some cheese there. It is an open house, and I went there with a woman, and I stumbled against this sash; here is a letter which will satisfy your lordship about my brother's bond.</p>
               <p>Court. You had better not have it read, it will do you no good.</p>
               <p>Q. To Evans. When did you see this sash last in this place? - I did not particularly look at it, it might be a month ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were the sashes put in the house? - They were not only put into the house, they were hung.</p>

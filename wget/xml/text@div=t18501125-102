                  </hi>. I am a fruiterer, and live at No. 7, Beaumont's-place, Islington. I have dealt with Mrs. Dawson for many years. On Saturday, 9th Nov., I bought two bushels of apples of her which were to be 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I did not pay for them—they were delivered to my cart, and brought home—on Monday morning, 11th Nov., a man or youth named Stanley, called at my house, and presented this bill—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"London, Mr. Low bought of C. Dawson, English and foreign fruit-salesman, Covent Garden-market, and Beale's wharf, Southwark; Nov. 9th, two bushels of apples,</p>

               <p>9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Sir, I hope you will excuse my sending for such a trifle, but I have received a lawyer's letter this morning stating, that unless I can make up a certain amount by one o'clock, there will be an action commenced against me, and I am obliged to hunt after every shilling. Yours, F. Dawson.")—I knew that the amount and date were correct, but on reading the apology written at the bottom, it struck me that it was the prisoner's writing—I knew his handwriting—I was not positive then, but from look<lb></lb>ing at other writing of his, I am now satisfied, and I can swear it is his writing—I have seen him write—I asked Stanley who had sent him—he said that he was engaged to collect in Mrs. Dawson's debts—I asked him who gave him the bill—he said a man at Mrs. Dawson's shop—I asked what kind of man—he said a tall man—I asked who he was to take the money to—he said to that man—I said, I did not feel disposed to pay him, I should see Mrs. Dawson—I did so, and she said she knew nothing about it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a fruiterer, in Covent Garden-market, and am widow of the late Charles Dawson. I keep on the business in his name—the prisoner is my step-son—he was formerly in partnership with his father, but that partnership was dissolved—this bill is not my writing—I never authorised any one to write it, or any part of it—to the best of my belief it is the prisoner's writing—I have frequently seen him write for many years—on 9th Nov., I sold some apples to Mr. Low—I did not give the prisoner leave or license to send any bill to Mr. Low for the pay<lb></lb>ment of this money, I had not seen him for three months before—I never gave him leave to ask for any money from any person—this bill has been transcribed from my day-book—the prisoner had no access to that book, but my shop was broken into on the Sunday night, and this book taken from a drawer under the counter where it was kept, and extracts made from it—the prisoner knew that Mr. Low dealt with me, and also with his father for some years—Mr. Low's address is not in the day-book; conse<lb></lb>quently the bill must have been made out by somebody who knew his address.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> The prisoner was in partnership with his father? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> For a few weeks only, and his own bad conduct made his father dis<lb></lb>solve it—he was gazetted—the partnership was in Tooley-street—he ceased to be a partner nearly three months before his father died, which was in Feb.—I have not seen the prisoner since July last—the partnership ceased about Oct. or Nov.—he was in the habit of coming to my place up to July—he took no part in the business—he did not make any claim upon me—he had no claim—I kept him from the time of his father's death till I fitted him out to go abroad in July, and I thought he had gone—he was in the habit of coming to me daily before that for what he required—my husband made a will, but he destroyed it at the time of the prisoner's bad conduct, as I was given to understand—I do not know anything about it myself—I have a foreman in my employ, named Michael M'Cormack—he has lived</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mrs. Dawson, and have been so nearly seven years.

                  </hi>. I am a warehouseman in the employ of Messrs. Durrant—the prisoner was their porter, and has been in their service nearly ten years—on the evening of 22d August, I shut up the premises about 7 o'clock, and left shortly afterwards, leaving the prisoner there—it was his duty to remain till 10, when the night porter Lomas goes in to sleep, and the prisoner leaves—on the night in question, I returned with Lomas at 10 o'clock, and saw the prisoner with a cap on, and a hat-box in his hand about to leave the premises—I asked him what he had got in that hat-box—he said, "A hat"—I requested to see it—he said, "Why?"—I asked him the same question several times, and at last he said, "Then I will let you see it"—he crossed the office into his own room, and began untying the string on the opposite side of the counter to me, tipped the lid on one side, and said, "There; nothing but a hat"—having a safety lamp in my hand I could not see, so I tipped the lid on one side and saw that it was this bundle of silk (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I put it on the counter, asked him if that was his hat, and told him I must acquaint the gentlemen of the house—I asked him what he was going to do with it, and he said that he did not know—he was allowed to go home in a minute or two, and was given in custody next morning—on Thursday evening, just before 7 o'clock, he brought this bag, carrying it in such a manner as to indicate that there was nothing in it—I afterwards went up into his room while he was out, and ascertained that the box was quite empty—here are five pounds and a few ounces of silk, at 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per pound—the silk is kept in the basement of the warehouse—the prisoner had access to all the premises, but he ought not to go down to the basement after I left—I can swear to the silk—only Mr. Snewitt, who lives in the house, and the servant-maid, were in the house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the silk department of Messrs. Durrant and Co.—I have several times seen the prisoner leave the premises with a hat-box similar to this—it was always tied up with string four times across; and it always appeared heavy—I saw him leave on 27th July with a hat-box like this; it appeared heavy—he carried it by the centre of the string—I had seen him bring it in in the morning—it then appeared light by the way he carried it, by the single string behind—on Saturday, 23d, he brought in a</p>

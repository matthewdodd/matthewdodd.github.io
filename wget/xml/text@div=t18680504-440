                  </hi>. I live at Church Street, Twickenham, and am housekeeper to Mr. Stedwell—on Sunday evening, 26th January, I was with another servant, named Matilda Hurrell, in a back room on the ground floor, between 9 and 10 o'clock; I am sure it was after 9—we were sitting together, and the door was pushed open—I jumped up, and went to the doorway, and saw two men in the passage: one went towards the stairs—one said to the other, "Is your pistol ready?" and the other answered, "Right"—the male prisoner then came into the room, and said, "Not a word, or I will blow your brains out"—he then showed me an iron bar, and said he would dash my brains out if I halloaed, or made any noise—he then said, "You have the keys?"—I said I had not; it was not very often that servants were trusted with the keys—he said that would do—he then asked me what money I had about me—I said I had none at all—he asked how many stories high the house was—I said, "Two"—he then said if I moved or called out, that he would dash my brains out with the iron bar, and he put the iron bar towards my face—he asked if I valued my life—I said, "Of course I do"—he said, "Then hold your noise"—I heard the other man up stairs all this time—I heard some breaking of things—after some time I heard a box fall—the other servant said to me, "That is the cash box"—I said, "No, it is the plate box," and the prisoner said, "Not a word"—the other man then came down stairs, and came into the room with a gun, and said to the prisoner, "Take this, shoot them: spare no lives"—the prisoner took the gun, and laid it on the parlour table—he said, "If you attempt to go to the window I will shoot your brains out through the window"—he then went out of the room, and looked the door—I gave evidence against the other man last sessions, or the sessions before; he was convicted, and got eighteen months—some time after they had gone I went up stairs—my room was all upset, and the clothes about the room—a small box had been broken open, and was empty: it had contained three brooches, two pins, and other articles—I have no doubt about the prisoner being the man—he was in the room about three-quarters of an hour—there were three gas burners in the room, full on.</p>

I am a servant in the employ of Mr. Stedwell—on the night of 26th January, I was sitting with the last witness in the back room—the door came open—Elizabeth Harris went round the table, towards the door, and the prisoner came into the room, and another man went up stairs—the prisoner came into the room and stopped there the whole time—when he came in he said, "If you say a word, I will dash your brains out"—before they came into the room, I heard one say, "Is your pistol ready?"—the other said "Right"—the prisoner kept walking up and down the room, and said if we said a word, or whispered to each other, he would dash our brains out—he had an iron crowbar and a pistol in his hand—I heard a noise up stairs, and heard something fall—I said, "There is the cash box"—Elizabeth Harris said, "No, it is the plate box"—the prisoner then said, "Not a word; I will dash your brains out"—he had the crowbar in his hand then—there was full light in the room—I should think the pri<lb></lb>soner was in the room three quarters of an hour—the other man came down stairs a little while after they had been in the house, and brought a gun into the room and gave it to the prisoner, and said, "Spare no lives; shoot their brains out"—shortly after that they both left—they said if we made any noise they would shoot us through the window—they then went out, locked the door, and took the key away—the other man was tried and convicted last Session—I have not the least doubt about the prisoner—I am sure he is the man.</p>

When you first saw him, you were not quite so sure, were you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am almost sure he is the man—he was in the room about three quarters of an hour—I screamed very much—we were both very much frightened—Harris stood up the whole of the time the man was in the room—he asked what money she had about her, and she said "None"—I think it was last month I was taken to see this man—I did not pick him out—I was not taken to the station—I saw him in the cart, when he was a prisoner, going to Brentford—there was a policeman with him—I have not the least doubt he is the man.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GRIFFITHS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you known him before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, for many yean—he was a tailor, and did many jobs for my husband—I was not before the Magistrate—I was told he was taken up about a week or so ago—his mother asked me if I recollected calling on her when she was ill—I said "Yes," and I had seen Charles May and his brother sitting in the parlour as I passed through—that was at 8, Waterloo Street—I had not been there for some time before that night; but her little girl used to go backwards and forwards, and she told me her mother was ill—the mother is not here to day—the little girl is six or seven years old—I have known his mother about twenty years—she has got four sons—I know them all, but not so intimately as I know the prisoner—he does not live with his mother—I think I saw the prisoner last year—I will not swear I saw him at all—I will not swear that I saw him in 1866, or 1867, or 1865—I will not swear at all—I do not know whether he is married, it is no business of mine.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you been to see his mother on other occasions? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I often drop in as I leave church in the evening. I did not go the Sunday following—I was at church, and after that I went home—I do not know where I was the Sunday after that—I might have called on my son—it is impossible to account for every Sunday—I have called on Mrs. May in the week days—I saw the prisoner a week before the 26th, in Camberwell, standing outside the Waterloo Arms—I had a basket of clothes, and I asked him to help me, and he did—it was the beginning of the week, because I fetch my work home at the beginning of the week—I do not know when I saw him before that—he might have passed me, and I might have passed him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's brother, and live at 2, Herbert Lane, Camberwell—on Sunday, 26th January, I was at my mother's house, and saw the prisoner there—my mother was ill at the time—I was there with him about an hour and a half altogether—I was there before he came in—I left about 9 or a little after—I left him outside the gate going away—he told me he was going back to Teddington.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I live at 91, Waterloo Street, Camberwell—on 26th January I had been out on a little business, and as I was coming home I met Charles May at the Waterloo Arms—that was near 10 o'clock, I think—he said he was going to the railway station, and asked me to go with him—I said I could not, as I was waiting to see somebody with some money.</p>

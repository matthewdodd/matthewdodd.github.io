I am one of the senior officers of the General Post Office—I was at the Poplar post-office on the morning of 12th May—the prisoner was there; I said to him "Have you any letters at home?"—he said "No"—I said "We are going to search your house; am I to under<lb></lb>stand that you have neither letters nor anything else, belonging to the post-office there?"—he replied "Yes"—I afterwards went with Hancock to 66, Sussex Street, where the prisoner said he lived—Hancock unlocked a writing-desk in the front room and in it found the letter produced—we returned to the office and showed the letter to the prisoner—I told him where it had been found and asked him how it got there—he said "I don't know how it got there."</p>

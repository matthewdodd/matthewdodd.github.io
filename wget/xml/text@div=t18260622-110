About six o'clock in the evening I saw a coat lay on some bricks - I took it up, and saw two pieces of pewter under it; I went into the counting-house, and made a hole through the wainscot, that I might see what he did; the prisoner came several times, and took some bricks - he removed his coat each time, and removed the pewter with it; he then came and took the coat, and wrapped the pewter in it, put it under his arm, and went out; I followed, and said, "What have you got here?" he said, "A small piece of lead." I found the two pieces of pewter in it - it was wrapped inside the coat; he had got two doors from the house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. CRESWELL. Q. Have you any mark upon the property? A. No; but I know it by the shape and size of it. I have been told he has four children.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Hoxton—I have the charge of the entering room at Messrs. Pawson's—on the 27th January I received a length of cloth—I saw the prisoner—I would not be positive whether he came into the</p>

               <p>room before or after I received the cloth, but it was close upon the time, within one or two minutes—he wanted a length of cloth for J. Rotherham of Shoreditch—I entered it in the book, "J. Rotherham &amp; Co. Shoreditch," and requested the prisoner to sign the book, which he did, "G. A. Johnson"—I delivered the goods to him, and he took them away.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did the prisoner see you before he saw Mr. Watson? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; he saw him and selected the goods before he saw me—the goods were sent to me by Mr. Watson, and a ticket came down with the goods, "J. Rotherham &amp; Co. Shoreditch"—the goods were sent to me, and the prisoner came and said he had come for a length of cloth that he had looked out for J. Rotherham &amp; Co. of Shoreditch—I think there were other persons in the entering room—I made this entry after I looked at the ticket on the goods, after the prisoner told me he required the goods for that name—there is but one Rotherham, a draper, in Shoreditch—I never knew of any other—I gave the prisoner the goods, and he took them away.</p>

Rotherham's employ since I have lived there—he had not, to my knowledge, any authority to obtain any goods on account of Messrs. Rotherham from Messrs. Pawson's—I did not receive from the prisoner about 27th January any goods from Messrs. Pawson's.</p>

Rotherham—I have referred to the books—they are not here—these goods were never received—I have made inquiries of the different partners, and of other parties—the servants are frequently leaving; I don't think there are more than 100, and they are changing every week.</p>

On Sunday, 26th Oct., I felt unwell, and went to bed about half past 9 o'clock—I was disturbed about a quarter past 10 by a knocking at the front door—I called to know who was there—my son answered, "It is me"—I knew the voice—he said, "Have you been to bed?—I said, "Yes"—he said, "All right, all right," and went away singing—I thought he was gone to his lodging at Putney—some time after I heard something that I thought was cutting the putty of the window—I went down; I found nothing, and I went to bed again—I then heard a voice, saying, "Will you let me in? if not, I will break every b—window in the house;" and a piece of brick came in at the window—my wife asked him not to break the window—I put my clothes on, and went out—I could not see him—I inquired of a neighbour; they did not know where he was—I went to the top of the square, and saw the policeman—we went into a yard, and my son was lying flat on his belly, as if he were asleep—he jumped up instantly, and struck the policeman—he said, "What have you got to do with it?" and directly afterwards he struck me on the left side—the policeman and I then closed upon him, he fell back-wards, and he had a knife, with the blade open—the policeman took the knife from him—I found he had struck me in the left side—I found a hole in my coat, and I found my clothes saturated with blood—I said to the policeman, "This is my son, take charge of him"—I went home, and sent for the doctor, who came and examined the wound—I had no more words with my son than what I have stated—I had seen him a week before—I thought by his conduct he was intoxicated; I cannot speak positively as to that—I had been on good terms with him, except admonishing him now and then for his irregular habits—I was confined in the hospital for three weeks.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in St. John-street-road. The prisoner Patt<lb></lb>man has been in my service from about the 5th or 6th of Nov.—I did not know the other prisoner until the day she was taken—I have seen the sheets, blankets, and the quilt now produced—I know them—I have identified them at the office—I do not know when the things were safe, because they have been taken at different times—I did not miss them till Monday, the 16th of March—on Monday, the 16th, I had been to the City—I came home and found the prisoner had absconded—I had left her at home in the morning—I missed three blankets off our bed—we have missed eight altogether—I gave informa<lb></lb>tion to the police, and next day I found the prisoner Pattman in custody at the station at Blackwall—the constable told me in her presence that she had confessed to taking several articles—she then said she had only taken some articles—she said she would get them out if I would let her—I said I had been so much robbed I could not look over it—on giving a list of the articles I had lost, she said she had taken no more than the blanket, quilt, and a pair of sheets—I asked her for the tickets—she said if I would forgive her she would get them out—I said I would not—I took down in my pocket-book where she had pledged them, and in consequence of what she said I went to Mr. Sharwood's and found one blanket, a pair of sheets, and a table-cloth wrapped up in a cotton pillow-case, pledged for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—at Waters' I found a quilt pledged for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had told Pattman all along I would not forgive her—I particularly said, "I hold out nothing to you, I will prosecute you to the utmost"—she said she had not pledged the blanket—on Tuesday, the 17th, I was near the policeman when Copeland was apprehended at an apple stall opposite Saddler's Wells gate—I asked if she knew Ann Pattman—she said she did—I said, "You have a quilt in your possession"—she said she had, and that Ann Pattman gave it her—I gave her into custody—she said she had a ticket of a blanket which Ann Pattman had given her.</p>

               <p>I saw the prisoner secrete three pieces of lace; I told Mr. Watridge of it. When the prisoner was brought back, she was taken down stairs into the kitchen; she let me search one of her pockets; I did not find any thing in that; she refused to let me search her any further: she said she had but one pocket on. As I still persisted in charging her with having secreted some lace, Mr. Watridge insisted upon having her searched thoroughly; then we took her up into the dining-room; my master's mother, the maid servant, and myself, went with her; one piece of lace dropped from her up stairs, and we found the other pieces of lace under her stays, and the ribbons in her other pocket.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a fishmonger at Hatfield—on Wednesday night, 26th December (Boxing night), I was in a public-house in Holborn—I saw the prisoner and a man named Quick there—I betted a half-sovereign about playing the tattoo on the table with my fingers—I handed the half-sovereign to Quick, and he said I had lost and gave it to the prisoner—I said the bet was not decided fairly—he said, "Oh! come along with me; it is only a joke, I will give you your half-sovereign back"—I went out with him, he took me into some alley and passed his hand round my neck, threw me down, and put his hand into my right trousers pocket—I got up and hallooed "Police!" as well as I could, and as I was running to the top of the alley another one ran out and kicked me at the bottom of the belly, I did not stop to examine him, but kept on till I found a police-man—I missed 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from my right trousers pocket; I could not say it was Quick who kicked me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had you been drinking? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, a little, I was not drunk, I might have had a dozen glasses of ale or beer, I had no liquor—I did not know the prisoner or Quick before—the tattoo is a tune that soldiers play—I had been ten years in the Herts military band—Quick was discharged by the Magistrate—I had five sovereigns in my waistcoat pocket—I might have taken them out when I put down the half-sovereign; the silver was in my trousers pocket, I had it safe in the public-house—the prisoner walked with me across the road to the alley, it was right opposite the public-house in Holborn, it was a dark place—the prisoner was taken into custody not above half an hour afterwards, I went with the policeman to several public-houses to find him—Quick was with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GRAIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you went out of the public-house, did the prisoner remain with you the whole time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, he was on my right hand, close to me, I had not been out of the house many minutes before it was done.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Police Sergeant</hi> 37). I saw the prosecutor in Fetter Lane about three o'clock on the morning of the 27th December—he told me he had been robbed—I went with him to Farringdon Street—he pointed out the prisoner and Quick standing outside a public-house along with about a dozen others, waiting to get in—he said they were the two men that had robbed him—I took them into custody—I found on the prisoner a half-sovereign, a half-crown, 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and a halfpenny—he refused his address at first, but afterwards gave the address of his mother.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How far was the prisoner from where you first saw</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186701070005"></xptr>
               <p>the prosecutor? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Nearly a quarter of a mile—the prosecutor had been drinking, but knew very well what he was doing—he said there were four men—he charged the prisoner and Quick with stealing money, he could not say exactly the sum, about 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver—he said at the station there was a half-crown amongst it—that was after it had been taken from the prisoner—I was with the prosecutor twenty minutes or half an hoar before he found the prisoner.</p>

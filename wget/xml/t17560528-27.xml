I went and took him up; then he told me he had 1 s. 6 d. of one Eakins of Devonshire, for driving it there; and that he was to come to him on the first of March, but he never came. I carried him before justice Keeling, and there he said the same.</p>

            . On the 28th of February last the prisoner came to my house, and said he had got a cow to kill, and that he would bring her on the morrow about eleven or twelve o'clock; but on the Monday morning following, between five and six o'clock, he brought this bullock (it was a black bullock with a little white on the tip of the tail, two clips under the teat on the thigh, and one upon the rump ) he desired me to kill it directly, to cleave it down, and then quarter and weigh it, for there was a great wager laid about it; he said he must make haste to Smithfield, and went away. Upon seeing no country mark upon it, I mistrusted it was not honestly come by, and went to Smithfield to enquire if any body had lost a bullock, when Mr. Ireland said he had. Mr. Jefferson went with me, and said it was the bullock he had lost. The prisoner having said he would come soon to see it weigh'd, Mr. Jefferson staid, and in about a quarter of an hour after the prisoner came. He said, have you kill'd the bullock? I said, no. He said how long will it be first? I said stay a little, and took hold of him. Then we asked him how he came by that bullock, and he said another man hired him for 1 s. 6 d. to bring it to me to be kill'd. We took him before the justice, and there he said he brought it through Islington turnpike that morning between five and six o'clock.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live in York-street. The prisoner was in my employ—in consequence of circumstances, on the 13th of March,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184304030100"></xptr>
               <p>about half-past three o'clock, I marked two half-crowns, and put them into a large leathern bag—the prisoner was in my workshop at the time—I left him there about half-past three—I was away about a quarter of an hour—when I returned I examined the bag, and missed one of the half-crowns—I sat down to work till half-past six—I then got an officer, told him to stand outside, about fifty yards from the shop, and I would send the prisoner out on an errand, and to take him in charge—after he was outside I accused him of having the half-crown—he laughed—he was taken to Denmark-street and examined, and it was found in his coat lining—I identified it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant H</hi> 10.) I received the prisoner in charge for stealing a half-crown—he said, in presence of the prosecutor, he supposed it was put into his coat, the same as a piece of cloth was the week previous, but he did not put it in himself—I found the half-crown sewn between the lining of his coat and the skirt, just by the tail.</p>

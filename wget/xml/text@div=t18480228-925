                  </hi> I am the wife of Thomas Ward, a carpenter, of High-street, in the parish of St. Giles—it is his dwelling-house. On 9th Feb., about half-past six o'clock in the evening, I was on the first floor, and heard a noise at the street door, which was shut, but not locked, at six—I had the key up stairs—my husband was at home—I listened, and in a few minutes I heard a sound like a rusty key turning on the inside of the street door, at the lock—my little boy, who was in the street, called, "Mother, thieves!"—I ran down, found the door open, the lock forced, and a strange key in it inside—some of the screws of the lock were out, and it was cracked—the prisoner was brought in about ten minutes.</p>

                  </hi> I am the son of the last witness. I was playing in the court with a little boy, and saw the prisoner and another walking up and down—they would not let us go by—I saw the street door on the jar—it was shut just before—I kicked it—the prisoner and the other man opened it—they were inside the passage—they asked what I wanted—I said I wanted my father—the prisoner said, "He does not live here, "knocked me against the wall, and ran away—he did not say, "I do not live here"—the prisoner had a white bundle under his arm; the other had a red one.</p>

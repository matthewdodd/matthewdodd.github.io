                  </hi>. I am a cheesemonger, at Hammersmith. The prisoner was in my service—on Sunday, 6th Oct., I marked eighteen shillings, and gave ten of them to Upton—on the Monday morning I put the other eight shillings in the till, and took the other money out—I left my shop about nine o'clock, leaving the prisoner in charge of it—he could go to the till—I came back about eleven, found Phillips, and took the prisoner out with me, in the cart—I returned in a few minutes, examined the till, and found 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., ten shillings of which were marked—I took the prisoner into the back room, and asked him to turn out the contents of his pockets, and there were six marked shillings there—he begged me to be merciful, and said he would not do it again if I would forgive him.</p>

               <p>placed the money on the table, and I said there were narked shillings, it is very likely he said, "Very likely; but I can explain how they came into my possession"—he said, "I was turning the silver out of the till on to the coun<lb></lb>ter, and got my money mixed with that <hi rend="italic">Old Jemmy</hi> had brought"—I might have next said, "I do not know what to do, but I have been going back lately"—I do not remember that the prisoner then said, "I can explain the reason to you"—I might have said, upon that, "I am going back very fast"—he did not then say, "I am sorry for it; I have never robbed you of a penny"—I should not like to swear he did not say that—I think he said, "The only wrong thing I have done was to sell goods under cost price, to make the business appear greater"—he did not get a commission on what he sold—I do not know what object he had in doing it, except to hide the deficiency—the constable took up the money, and put it into his pocket—I do not recol<lb></lb>lect then saying, "I do not know what to do," and the constable saying, "Oh, you had better drive us down in the cart;" after I had decided on giving him into custody, he said so, as it would be less noise; and the prisoner then fell upon his knees, and said, "I hope you are not going to have me locked up; I would rather work my fingers to the bone"—I do not remember his then saying, "I am quite innocent"—the constable did not urge me to give him into custody—he would not have anything to say in the matter.</p>

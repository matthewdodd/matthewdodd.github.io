I live at Angel-place, Stratford New Town—on the night of 19th May, I and my family retired to rest—I left all fast and went to bed about half-past 10—I got up about half-past 5 in the morning, and found the kitchen window open, and the curtain lifted down—I missed a top coat, a black frock coat, two bed-gowns, two shifts, and several other things—these boots (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are my own work—I put the soles on them—I had them on the night before, and I missed them in the morning—the policeman brought them to me on the following morning, about half-past 1—this knife is mine—I have had it some years—it was safe in my house the night before, on the sideboard—my house is in the parish of West Ham.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Stratford New Town, within 100 or 200 yards of the last witness—about a quarter-past 1, on the morning of 21st May, I was in bed laid up—I had occasion to get out of bed at that time, and I saw the prisoner outside the window in the street—my shutters open inside—he stood there a few minutes, and then raised my window up—he</p>

On the morning of 21st May, I was on duty in Stratford New Town—I heard a cry of "Stop thief!" and saw the prisoner running from the direction of the cry, with neither boots nor stockings on—I ran after him—as I came within about a yard of him he dropped this boot out of his hand—I stopped him, and asked him what he was about, and he made me no answer—I took him back and picked up the boot, in doing so he attempted to get away from me—I had a struggle with him for a few minutes, and then sprang my rattle—a brother constable came to my assistance, and we took him to Mr. Lancashire's house, called him up, showed him this boot which the prisoner had dropped, and he identified it—we then took the prisoner to the station, and the other constable found this knife upon him, which has been identified—we afterwards came back and found the fellow boot in the garden close by the house—some silent matches were also found on the prisoner.</p>

On the 24th of this month he passed me at the West gate, I observed he had something bulky about him, I followed him about forty or fifty yards, and then stopped him. I asked him whether he had got any thing improper about him, he said he had not; I told him I should not be satisfied without he went back with me and let me examine him. He then said he had a little bark; I took him back and searched him, and found in his coat pocket and his hat, three pound of bark, it is worth six shillings, the bark was the property of the London Dock Company. This is the bark.</p>

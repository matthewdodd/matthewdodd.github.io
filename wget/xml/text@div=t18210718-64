            . I am servant to Mr. Sanderson, who lives in Sunbury parish. On the 14th of July, I went out at eight o'clock at night, and left Griffin in the house. As I came home between twelve and one o'clock, I found some things laying outside near the window, which was open - I had left it shut. I called my master up, I rung the bell, came back to the cottage, and saw the prisoner getting out of the window, I secured him, he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182107180037"></xptr>tried to get from me - he had nothing with him. I said,</p>
               <p>"How came you to take these things?" he said I threw them out myself, and wanted to lay it to him. I took him to my master - I knew him before; he worked at the flax mills, at Hownslow.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carrier, and reside at Waltham Abbey. On Saturday, 15th March, I came to London with my goods—on returning I stopped at the Catharine Wheel public Louse, in Bishopsgate-street, between 7 and 8 o'clock in the evening—I went into the house—I left my dog in the cart, and left the cart at the corner of the gateway—there was in the cart a gallon of gin, twenty bars of iron, a tarpaulin, a nosebag, a whip, a shoulder of mutton, and some other things, which I was carrying in the way of business—I was in the office about three minutes—when I came out the horse and cart were gone—I can swear to this basket and this bar of iron.</p>

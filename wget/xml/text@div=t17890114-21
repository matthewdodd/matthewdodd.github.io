               <p>On the 6th of January, I lost my watch, between twelve and one at night. I was coming home, and I fell down, near to my master's door. I had been in the city. My master's name is Minees; he lives in the <placeName id="t17890114-21-crimeloc106">Strand</placeName>

The prisoner came up, and took my watch while I was down. My foot had slipped against the kerb, which occasioned me to fall down. When the prisoner had taken my watch, I got up immediately, and pursued him; I caught him by the flap of his coat, at the corner of Buckingham-street. I called the watch three times; and during that time the prisoner threw me down twice, and strove to get away. The watchman came up to my assistance, and he was then secured, and taken to the watch-house. The watch was found, the next morning, in an area, the corner of Buckingham-street, by the maid-servant, about eleven o'clock. I am sure the prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178901140038"></xptr>is the man that took my watch; I saw him take it out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Court. Was you drunk or sober? - I was not quite sober.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Silvester.</p>
               <p>On your oath, Sir, was not you excessively drunk? - I was not: I had been drinking too much.</p>
               <p>You say your foot slipped, and you fell, near to your master's door? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then you must have tumbled down forwards? - No, I rolled on my back.</p>
               <p>Did not two gentlemen come up just at the time you had got hold of the defendant at the bar, and was accusing him of having robbed you of your watch? - No, not till the watchman came up.</p>
               <p>Did not two gentlemen come up to you, and say, young man, mind what you are about; you are very much intoxicated with liquor? - I saw nobody but the prisoner till the watchman came up.</p>
               <p>How long had you been laying on the ground before the prisoner came up to you? - About a minute and a half.</p>
               <p>Court. Does a sober man, when he falls, lie a minute and a half on the ground? - If I chose to lay there, I might.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. I hope your lordship will take notice of his answer.</p>
               <p>Did not you ask the watch-house-keeper, the next morning, to shew you the person you had charged the over-night? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Did not you say you should not know him again? - I did not say any such thing.</p>
               <p>On your oath, when you charged the prisoner, did not two gentlemen come up to you, and say, they had watched the prisoner, and that he did not meddle with you? - No, they did not; they came up, and went on, and I followed them to Buckingham-street.</p>
               <p>You advertised this watch afterwards? - I did.</p>
               <p>The prisoner advertised it likewise, in the same paper, offering a reward of five guineas? - I did not see the advertisement.</p>
               <p>Do not you know that that advertisement stood next to your own, in the same paper? - I don't know; I did not look at the advertisement.</p>
               <p>(The advertisement put in by the prosecutor, and the advertisement put in by the prisoner, read from the Daily Advertiser.)</p>
               <p>You was not cautioned you say, by any body, to be careful, and mind what you was about, on account of your being so excessive drunk? - No, I was not.</p>
               <p>You was not sober the next morning, when you went before the magistrate? - Yes, I was.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman. About half past twelve, on the evening of the 6th of January, coming up Charles-court, I heard the cry of Watch! twice. When I came up, Cope gave me charge of the prisoner. It was near Buckingham-street, at the corner; Cope had him by the flap of his coat. Cope said he had robbed him of his watch; I said, mind what you are about, be cautious, this is a street robbery. Two gentlemen came up, and asked what was the matter: they said they would not go with such a drunken fellow to the watch-house; I said he need not be afraid to go, if he had done nothing amiss. We conducted him there.</p>
               <p>Was not Cope very much in liquor? - Not very much; he had drank a little too much, and he was a little sick in the watch-house. I heard that the watch was found the next morning, in Buckingham-street, down in the area.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was he very much in liquor? - He was in liquor, but he knew what he said; and he said the same the next morning, before the magistrate.</p>

               <p>I am a timber-merchant; I live at Cuper's-bridge, Lambeth. I was walking home, on Twelfth-Night, with Mr. Wheeler; we had been at the Bolt-in-Tun, in Fleet-street. At the end of Southampton-street the prisoner passed us with a gun on his shoulder; he walked faster than us. When we came to the end of Bedford-street, a man had hold of him by the flap of his coat, and said he had robbed him of his watch; it was by the pillars of Coutt's, the banker's door. The instant we came up, the watchman came up, and he was charged; the watchman rang his rattle, and another came up; the prisoner did not offer to run, as I saw. They went to the watch-house; they crossed the road, and went on the right-hand side, and turned up Church-court. They crossed directly opposite to Coutt's door; I followed close behind. The prisoner did not offer to make the least resistance, or to make use of his gun; he went very quietly. The prosecutor was very drunk, excessively so; he belched in the room, and was ready to be sick. When I first came up, he was not on the ground. I am not clear whether the prisoner, after we first met him, had got out of sight, or not; it could not have been above two or three hundred yards.</p>

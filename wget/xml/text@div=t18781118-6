I lodge at the last witness's house—between 3 and 4 on Sunday morning, 3rd November, I was awoke by a noise in the shop, my room is immediately over it—I got up and lifted my window, but could not see anybody—I lighted a candle and came downstairs with a poker—I found that the back and front doors were fastened, I returned upstairs, I was scarcely in my room when I again heard a noise as I thought in the shop, and I heard a small bell ring—I went down again, and as I was going towards the middle door the street door was slammed to, I opened it and looked out but could not see any one—I then observed the broken panel, and some of the clothes were hanging out of it, I then called the police—I had gone to bed about 10.</p>

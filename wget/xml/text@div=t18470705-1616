                  </hi> I am an inmate of the workhouse of St. Leonard, Shoreditch; the prisoner was also an inmate there On Friday, the 11th of June, between twelve and one o'clock in the day, I was standing at the gate, where I am em<lb></lb>ployed to keep the men from the women's ward—I have a box there—an old man belonging to the workhouse was sitting near it, and I saw the prisoner strike that old man on the head—I cannot say whether anything had passed be<lb></lb>tween them before that—I heard nothing pass—I said to the prisoner, "Ikey, don't strike an old man; I must go and fetch the master if you don't keep yourself quiet"—he then said he would serve me the same, and used bad language—he took the chair which I sat in, out of my box, and offered to strike me with it—I put up my arm to stop the blow, and he struck me on the elbow—it hurt my elbow—I feel it now a little—I then went across the yard to get away from him—he followed me, took hold of my clothes, threw me down on my back on the stone, and fell on me with the whole of his weight—the back part of my head struck on the stones—I have the wound now—it was occasioned by his throwing me down and falling on me—it bled—I lost my senses I should say for nearly a minute and a half or two minutes—I felt the blood come down my neck—Buckeredge came to my assistance—I was taken to a surgeon, and my head was dressed—I was also injured in my ribs, but whether it was with his knee, or kicking me, I cannot say—I suffer pain from it now—I have been in the workhouse three years and a half—the prisoner has been there longer—he is very quarrelsome and mischievous, and if two men are talking together he fancies they are talk<lb></lb>ing about him—I have known that happen several times—he has interfered with me before—he once kicked me on the leg when I worked in the oakum shop, without any quarrel or provocation whatever—I have the would on my leg now.</p>

                  </hi>, I am an inmate of Shoreditch workhouse. On the 11th of June I was in my own place, facing where this matter happened—I saw the prosecutor when he was thrown down backwards by the prisoner—he was bleeding profusely—I ran out to assist him—the prisoner was a-top of him—I got him off at last and he went away—I went over to my place</p>

               <p>again, and he came and seized me in the same manner, and threw me back<lb></lb>wards—I am afraid I shall not get the use of my shoulder again—he has been in the habit of doing it before—he did not say a word while he was doing it—it was done in a tremendous spiteful way—I do not think he is altogether right in his mind—he gets into this savage cross disposition—after he had thrown me down, a parcel of boys in the yard came and assisted in getting him off me, and got him away from me—he got away from the boys and escaped over the wall, but the neighbours turned him back again—the doctor and the officers then came up, and finding he was in that tremendous manner they ordered the jacket on him, he was brought in that way before the Magistrate; and even then he plunged a good deal, so that they could not get him along the streets.</p>

                  </hi> I am an inhabitant of Shoreditch workhouse. On sun<lb></lb>day, the 11th of June, I witnessed the whole of what happened to Hill—I observed that his head was wounded—the prisoner did it—I saw the blood while he lay on the ground—I looked at his head afterwards, before it was dressed—there was a cut two different ways, a kind of cross cut—the skin was cut open.</p>

                  </hi> I am a surgeon.

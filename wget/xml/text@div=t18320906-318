The prisoner was in his service for three weeks, till the 24th of August; when in consequence of suspicion, I went with a policeman to his lodgings, and found a glass and different ornaments which are used in our business - they were in a trunk, on the shelf, and in different parts of the room; I had given him into custody at our house, and he gave me that address - he boarded and lodged at our place; we found his wife there - I know the things to be my father's; the prisoner bore a good character before.</p>

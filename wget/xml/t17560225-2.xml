               <p>Henry Blake. The prisoner has an aunt lodges at my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Blake. I live at the corner of Duke's-court, Drury-lane; he came backwards and forwards to visit her some times, two or three times a day for near two months.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he come first?</p>
               <p>Blake. To the best of my knowledge he came first in September last; he behaved himself always very sober and civil.</p>
               <p>Q. What business was he in?</p>
               <p>Blake. I can't say he was in any business. He asked me if I could give him cash for a note; (I believe that was in December) and produced one of 10 l. accordingly I gave him 10 l. upon it, after which I found it to be a bad one.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you find that out?</p>
               <p>Blake. I had taken another note of him after that, which I had some reason to suspect being a bad one.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was it accepted by?</p>
               <p>Blake. By

               <p>Blake. No, I had not. He produced the note.</p>
               <p>Q. Has there been any alteration made in it since he gave it you.</p>
               <p>Blake. No, there has not; only I paid it to a wholesale cheesemonger at Smithfield-bars, who put a figure on it when it became due, on the top of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a warehouseman, and carry on business in Castle-court, and No. 20, Lawrence-lane. The prisoner was from seven to eight years in my service as porter—the latter part of his time his salary has been 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week, and his tea; that was about the last two years—before that time it was rather less—on account of something I heard, I was induced to watch his movements—on 24th Feb. I came home about 2 o'clock in the afternoon; I saw the prisoner with a bag in his hand, coming out of the back warehouse into the passage, which connects it with the front ware-house—I turned my back for scarcely a minute to cross the court to our opposite warehouse, and on my return the prisoner was gone, and the bag was gone—I followed the prisoner down Aldermanbury, where I was informed he had probably gone—I met him; and I proceeded to Mr. Abel's, a marine store dealer, in Aldermanbury, where I found the bag with some lengths of rope in it, some travellers' patterns, and some canvass—I am able to identify the bag as the one I had seen before, from the peculiar make of it—I identify it as my property—I identify the travellers' patterns; they have a private mark on them; I could not identify the rope—this is the bag; it is differently sewn at the bottom to what it is at the side—these are the travellers patterns; they have different numbers corresponding with what we have at home—this one has a private mark, as the price on it—the others have different numbers—there was in the bag this length of wrapper—here is no mark on it—I called in Malyon, the officer, and gave him charge of the bag and its contents—I returned with the officer, and met the pri<lb></lb>soner—I gave him in charge, and proceeded to the police station in Bow-lane—when I was giving the charge, I said to the prisoner, "You know I saw you, with the bag and its contents in your hand"—he said, "I know you did"—the bag was then open before him, and the wrapper and the patterns were out-—he gave his address at No. 1, Regency-place, Mansion House-street, Kennington—I went with Malyon and Storey, another officer, to that direction, and the officers, in my presence, searched the house—we found there property which I identified to be mine—I found sixteen yards of printed cotton; part of it was made up into a dress, part was in a drawer, and part of it was at a pawnbroker's—I think in the whole there was more than sixteen yards—it was a piece of Hoyle's five-quarter print—he is a clebrated printer, in Manchester—I have every reason to believe it is my property, but there is no mark on it—I had the same article in stock—it is rather common—here is another piece of printed cotton, which is a more particular pattern—this was delivered to me either the last day of Dec, 1853, or the 1st of Jan., 1854—this other one was delivered in the former part of 1853—these twelve yards of sheeting were found locked in a box on the prisoner's premises—it is a make of sheeting we have had by us, which is rather peculiar in the finish and make—we had got the same thing in stock—it is not made up into sheets—we found two yards of damask, I believe, in the same box—I believe it to be a portion of our stock—we had the same pattern and the same manufacture—it is not made up into any<lb></lb>thing—I did not get the key of the box—the policeman broke it open—I found six yards of silk; I cannot identify it precisely, but it is precisely the same as we had—we found this in the front room—we found ten yards of alpaca; it is of a particular pattern, which we had in the spring of 1853—I can identify it by our having the same goods—the pattern and colour are</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185402270059"></xptr>
               <p>rather unusual—I believe we found this in the box—we found two blan<lb></lb>kets—this one has a very remarkable stripe—the ordinary stripe is about one nail wide, and this is about two nails wide, and we are deficient in this particular class of blankets—these blankets were in the back room, the same room the box was in—they were laid on the bed, but were not in use—I found two counterpanes, which I cannot identify; we have the same goods—we found two shirts, which have no mark; I can only say we sell the same goods; they have not been used; they were in the same box—here are two nightcaps; I cannot identify them, but we sell them—here are six cambric handkerchiefs; these I know particularly by the pattern; we had the very same pattern; it is a particular sort of pattern—we found these in the box—five of them have never been used; one has been used, and cut—here are two other handkerchiefs; the colouring of them is rather remark<lb></lb>able; we had them in stock; we sold part of a piece to a customer—they kept the one that was washed, and brought the other two back, because they would not wash—we had two just the same as these; they are a very peculiar colour, and we missed these from stock—here are four pairs of stockings, and four pairs of socks, which I cannot identify—many of these articles I can swear I have not had two years, where there is a pattern to them—the plain goods I cannot tell how long, I may have had them as long as seven years—I saw Mr. Abel when I went there, and saw the bag and its contents.</p>

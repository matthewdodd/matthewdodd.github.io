            . I am wife to the prosecutor; I let the prisoner lie with me in my husband's absence, she went out of my house the 15th of September, and when she was gone I miss'd one of my gowns, it was a blew tabby, the other a cotton, and a common prayer book; they were taken out of a box that was locked. Last thursday I took her myself, and charged her with taking them. She confess'd she took them, and told me where they were; I took her before a justice of the peace, and she confess'd the same there; he committed her, I went and found the things accordingly. (the two gowns and prayer book produced in court, and depos'd to)</p>

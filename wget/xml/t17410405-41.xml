               <p>Mackenny. What I have to say is this: It happened some Time in March, that I was in Company with some Friends, and was disguised in Liquor, and as I was making Home, this here Prisoner picked me up in Holbourn. We took a Linkman with us, and went to Sarah Adams's House, but when I came there, I was so drunk that I was not capable to call for a Bed, and so the Prisoner did; and as soon as I got to Bed I fell asleep, and how it was afterwards I know not, but she took my Goods away.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. If you was so drunk, how can you tell all this?</p>
               <p>Mackenny. Adams came up to me with a Watchman, and desired me to see what I had lost: They waked me, and I put my Hand in my Pocket, and all the Articles belonging to me were gone.</p>

I live with my father-in-law, Thomas Haw<lb></lb>kins, who keeps an hotel in Dover-street—he has a farm at Chiswick—Meed had lived there about twelve months—Davis was employed there occasionally—on Tuesday, the 21st of Nov., I directed a load, consisting of thirty-nine trusses, to be put into a cart, and given to them, and I told them to deliver it to Mr. John Wild, North-end, Fulham—I went next morning to them, and asked what they had done with three trusses—Davis told me to ask Mead, and Mead told me to ask Davis—I asked them two or three times, and got no answer—I went next day to the barn at Acton, and met Davis—he told me it was sold at the Red Cow, and that Jack had sold it, that he asked him to lend him 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., he would not, and he said he would be d—d if he would not make money—I found the straw in a corner of the loft at the Red Cow—it resembles my father's very much, but I cannot swear to it, but the binder could.</p>

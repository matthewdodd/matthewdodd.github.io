               <p>SIR,</p>
               <p>The learned Judge in pronouncing Smith's case to be a gross libel, and then said relief might be had if I could shew you, upon your oath, a deviation from truth. That I shall be able to do so, is unquestionable; you can best explain your motive. I assure you the mode pointed out is one way of shewing. It will be painful to me as affecting you. I have my character at stake, which must prompt me to this step, perhaps at the immediate juncture of making the statement that Smith was drunk you will avail yourself of an opportunity of correcting that, if so, you will find me at Westminster this day Your oath was in direct contradiction to what you have declared to persons of great respectability. All this intimation is given you that you may take an early opportunity to retract, by correcting yourself: or in the other instance, manfully avowing that which you have sworn is correct.</p>

Settree brought it to me; he used to be in the habit of bringing meat to me in the name of Sylvester, it was entered in our books in the name of Barnes. When Settree came for the money there was some person with him, I think it was Tolloway, there were three or four of them in company together; Settree gave me the name of Barnes, he said he lived in Somers Town; I sent for him back, I said to Settree, who is this Barnes, he said master it is all right, I know the man, he lives in Somers Town.</p>

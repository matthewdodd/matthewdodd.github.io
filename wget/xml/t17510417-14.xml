I carried him to the constable at the next door: he was carried before the justice, the justice asked him if he had any money to have paid for the buttons if he had bought them; he said he had lost it a gaming at such a house. I went to that house, he had been there, and had had only a pint of beer. When he was about to be committed, he then said he had dropped the buttons in the constable's coal box, we went and found them behind the box.</p>

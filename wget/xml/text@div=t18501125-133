                  </hi>. I am a linen-draper, at 24, Exmouth-street. The prisoner came to me as a servant on a Tuesday, at eight in the morning; I forget the date—at eleven she went home to change her dress, and get the rest of her things, and did not come back—after she was gone I missed a cloak, which I had seen safe the same morning hanging behind the door in the back drawing-room, and the stockings, which I had seen safe in a box half an hour before she left—I saw her again next day at her mother's, and she was taken into custody—the house was searched, and we found nothing—we went again and searched, and behind the kitchen door, which was jammed to the wall, and which we had not pulled back before, we found the cloak hanging—this is it(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is my property.</p>

                  </hi>. I am searcher at the station. The prisoner was given me to search, and I asked what she was charged with—she said with an old cloak of her master's—I searched her, and said, "You have nothing about you; where is the cloak?"—she said, "It hangs behind my mother's door in Brill-row, Somers-town."</p>

            , the Prosecutor's Boy, was sent with the Pies, without the Change, as supposing he might get Change at the Inn. He went to the Tap-house at the Inn, but found no body there that sent for the Pies. As he was returning, he met Coventry, the other Prisoner, under the Gate-way, My Lad, says Coventry, have ye brought the Pies? Yes, Sir, says the Boy, but I can find no body that wants 'em. O! says Coventry, you went to the wrong Place; they should go to that House (pointing to a House in the Inn-Yard) but have you brought Change? No, says the Boy, I thought I could get Change at the Inn. Then I can't pay for the Pics, says Coventry, for I have been at every House hereabouts for Change, but can't get it, and therefore you must go back again, and fetch some. The Boy went home again, and related what had pass'd between him and Coventry. The Family in the House Coventry pointed to were Customers to the Prosecutor, which gave the less Suspicion, and the Boy was sent again with Change, but with a Caution, however, not to deliver the Change, or Pies, till he had the half Guinea. In returning he met the Prisoner Bird; What, says she, han't ye carried the Pies yet? No, says he, I have been back for Change. Well, says she, give me the Pies, and I'll take care of 'em. He was unwilling to part with 'em, but she got 'em from him, and presently up comes Coventry, and ask'd him for the Change. You shall have it, says the Boy , but give me the half Guinea first; upon which Coventry fumbled in his Pocket a little, and then suddenly gave the Boy a Punch on his Breast, snatch'd the Money out of his Hand, and ran away. The Boy then kept close to the Woman, who led him thro' several Streets, under Pretence of looking for the Man, till thinking she had an Opportunity to escape, she threw down the Pies in Gillspur-street , and said, Now catch me if you can. He cry'd out, Stop Thief! and she was taken. The Jury found them <rs id="t17311208-25-verdict130" type="verdictDescription">

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman M E</hi> 4). On 27th December, about 12 o'clock I saw the prosecutor standing against the shutters of a shop in Black-more Street the worse for drink—the prisoner went up to him and put his hand in his pocket, but I could not see whether he took anything out—he afterwards took him by the collar, pulled him from the shutters, took him by the legs, butted him in the chest, and threw him on the pavement in<lb></lb>sensible—I ran after the prisoner and brought him back to where the prosecutor was lying and told him I should charge him with attempting to rob him—he became very violent and began kicking—he kicked me and I had to send for two other constables, and before we could get him to the station he struck one of them in the eye and bit a finger of the other.</p>

George Stephens. I live at 34, Bermondsey Square—I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner take the prosecutor against the shutters, unbutton his coat, and turn him round and give him a blow which knocked him down, and he lay as if he was dead—I saw the constable take the prisoner—he was so violent that I had to get more constables to get him to the station.</p>

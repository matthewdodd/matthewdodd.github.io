            . On the 12th of July I was going home, a Policeman met me in a cart, and said I had been robbed of my watch - I went to the station-house and saw it there - I had seen it safe at three o'clock in the afternoon, in my bakehouse, and at five or six it was gone - the prisoner's father and mother live near me.</p>

               <p>- I am a Policeman. I was on duty at past six o'clock in the evening; a gentleman said a little boy had offered him a watch for 1s. - I went down, and saw the prisoner with the watch in his hand; he put it inside the rails of Mr. Gray's garden, and sat down by the side; I asked him if he would sell me the watch - he said he had no watch; I said, "yes, I saw you put it away" - he then said he found it on the road; he began crying - I said if he would tell me who the gentleman was, and give it back to him, I would let him go; he would not, and I took him to the station-house - the prosecutor's wife came, and said it was her husband's; he then said he got it from Mr. Eden's.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. A boy gave it me in the Uxbridge-road for some apples.</p>

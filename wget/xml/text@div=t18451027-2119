                  </hi>. I am a grocer and cheesemonger, and live in the Broadway, Hammersmith; the prisoner was my shopman. On the 14th of Oct. two persons came in, and tendered him half-sovereigns—he first asked my son, in my presence, for silver to make up change for a half-sovereign which he said was paid to him, and he gave him 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to make up the change—soon after another half-sovereign came, and he asked my daughter for the change—there ought to have been two half-sovereigns in the till—I examined the till directly after, and neither of the half-sove<lb></lb>reigns were there—if he put them in he could not get them out—the tilt was locked—I should have given him in charge that evening, but he absconded.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM BOUGHTON. I came to London on the 16th of April, late at night, and early the next morning; I was on my way to Cutler-street, and met the prisoner, about half-past two o'clock; I asked if she would tell me of a lodging; she said, "If you will go with me, I will show you one" - I went with her to a house in <placeName id="t18320517-58-crimeloc342">George-street, Wentworth-street</placeName>

               <p>JOHN GREEN (Police-constable H 120). I was in George-street between two and three o'clock in the morning, on the 17th of April; I heard the alarm, and went into the room - I got a light, and found the prosecutor holding the prisoner with his left hand - he charged her with robbing him of 2l.; I took her to the station; I found nothing on her; I went back to the house, and found 1s. on the mantel-piece.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I told you there was a shilling on the mantel-piece, and it was all I had. Witness. No, you did not.</p>

             (Police-serjeant H 18). I found this purse on the bottom of the window, over the balustrade of the stairs.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The prosecutor gave me the 1s., which the officer found; he said it was all he had - I said I would not stay with him for that; he then called Watch! and gave charge of me - he had given me a glass of gin at the night-house; I saw no other money nor purse - he said he had been served so two or three times, and he called Watch!</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BOUGHTON. I was not five minutes with her, and was making my way out - I did not give her the 1s., nor any gin; I did not mean to pass the night with her; I wanted a private lodging - I live at Gravesend; I know London very well, but did not know the streets exactly - I am sure there was a light when I went to the room.</p>
               <p>JOHN GREEN. There was no light there - there was a candle and candlestick; I got a light at Kate-street; there was a very poor bed in the room - I do not think any person could be in the room while there was a light, without the prosecutor seeing them - there was only one door to the room, but that was open; there was a cupboard with two shelves in it - it was on the second floor; the prosecutor was sober.</p>

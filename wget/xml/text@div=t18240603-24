            . I am a furrier, and live in Skinner-street. On the 10th of May, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I was called into my shop, and found the prisoner offering a muff and tippet for sale. I asked him who it belonged to; he said, to Mrs. Fergusson, of Dover-street, Piccadilly; that it had been bought at my house, but she was taken ill, and had no further occasion for it, and he was desired to bring it to me for sale. I asked his name; he said it was

            , and that he was servant to the lady; and on examining them, I found the muff was very valuable, and the tippet inferior. I said I was certain that he had come improperly by them; he appeared confused, and said what he had told me was false; that they belonged to his mother, and he had stolen them from her. I asked where she lived, he said she was barmaid at the King's Head public-house, Finchley, and that she was sister to the landlady. I said I should detain him; he still insisted that it was his mother's; that she had bought it about twelve months ago, when in better circumstances. I said it was a fresh made article. I sent for an officer, and while he was being searched, he said if I would let him go he would tell the whole truth; that on going through some street at the west end of the town, he saw a gentleman's door open, went in, and ran away with them. Mrs. Schneider at last claimed them.</p>

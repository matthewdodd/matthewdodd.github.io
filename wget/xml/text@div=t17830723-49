I knew him for some time, I kept him, he was an orphan, we were coming away, and he said he would see me home, I went through Change-alley, and the prisoner was with me, and in Change-alley he whipped my watch out of my pocket and took to his heels, he came of the right hand side of me and snatched it out, I perceived him at the time, the prisoner was apprehended and the watch was brought to me by the constable.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Were not we both in liquor? - I might drink a little drop but so as to get home, and know what I was about, I know the prisoner robbed me, I cried Stop thief! directly.</p>

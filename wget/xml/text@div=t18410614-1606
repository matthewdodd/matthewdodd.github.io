                  </hi>. I am an attorney. I know the prisoner—I first be<lb></lb>came acquainted with him in 1827 or 1828—he told me he was a tailor and draper—I discounted bills for him—I received the bill in question, on Mr. Poulton, from him in February last—he had repeatedly given me bills drawn by Mr. Poulton before, which I discounted—in 1838, when he brought the first bill, he represented Poulton to be a gentleman out of business, of independent property, residing at Staines-row, Hounslow—he produced Mr. Poulton's card to me in 1838—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>, "<hi rend="italic">Mr. Ben-jamin Wheeler Poulton, Stames-row, Hounslow</hi>")—I desired him to make inquiry about Poulton, as to whether the bill he brought me was in Mr. Poulton's hand-writing—that was the first bill—he was to go to Staines<lb></lb>row to inquire—he promised to go—he returned, and brought me this card with the writing on the back of it—he was absent too short a time to go there, and I told him he had been too short a time to go to Staines-row—he said it was too short a time, but he met the gentleman at Morley's Hotel Charing-cross—I discounted that bill and others, and the one in question—I have had them repeatedly since that—I discounted this 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill on the faith of that—the other bills were paid, I do not know who by—I have some which are not paid, but a number of them were paid—in the course of our transactions, he said he received the bills from John Fletcher, who was a man of considerable property, and had a considerable connexion among tailors at the west end of the town—I requested to be introduced to Fletcher, and have his address—he objected to that, saying, "If you and him come together you will do your business without me, and I</p>

               <p>shall lose my commission"—I acquiesced in that objection—this bill was not paid—he once told me Fletcher lived at No. 22, Old Burlington-street—I have made inquiry there, and cannot find him—my clerk was present when he mentioned Fletcher's address to me.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Your clerk and somebody else were present? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—that was not by arrangement—the conversation about Fletcher was in 1838, on the first of these bills coming to me, I can-not say in what month—I think it was in May or April—(the other person who was present at the conversation is not here—he was obliged to go out of town)—I never forgot the conversation—it has always been the subject of conversation—the conversation about Fletcher had reference to all the bills—I was before the Magistrate respecting two other bills on which I have indicted the prisoner—this is the first time I ever swore any thing about Fletcher—my acquaintance with the prisoner originated in being employed by him professionally at the time of his bankruptcy—he has a wife and five children—I acted as his attorney, to get his certificate—I do not know what his estate paid—I do not think it paid any thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was he in desperate circumstances at the time you bad transactions with him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had no means of knowing—I believe he was—our deal<lb></lb>ing in bills commenced in 1838—I own some property at Norwood, and contemplated a speculation in building on it in 1838—I did not send to the prisoner in 1888, and desire to have a confidential conversation with him—I do not recollect any thing of the kind—I think I can swear I did not—I will swear it—I believe nothing of the sort passed—certainly not re<lb></lb>specting that property—I do not think I sent to him desiring to have a confidential conversation with him—I should hardly like to swear it at this distance of time, but I have no recollection of any thing of the sort, and do not know of any thing that would lead to it—I have been an attorney thir<lb></lb>teen or fourteen years—the prisoner called on me for the first time about bills in 1838—I have not bad bills from him in the course of two years to the amount of 30,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I should think it was about half that—I think I can swear I have not had 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I will swear it—I have not cast it up—I will swear I have not had 25,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When he came to you, in 1838, did you communicate to him that you had some houses and land at Norwood, and if he could raise any money by way of bills, to enable you to build on it, you thought you could make a good thing of it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, certainly not—I told him I had some property there I wished to sell, if he could raise enough money to purchase it—I do not recollect Very distinctly when this was, but I think it was about 1838—I do not know the month, nor part of the year—it was a mere casual conversation—I told him it was not the sort of property that could answer my purpose—they were small houses, and if he could bor<lb></lb>row any money on them, they might possibly answer his purpose—he made several attempts—I did not tell him he might raise money on billa, I swear that positively—I said nothing about bills in reference to this matter—I never dreamed of such a thing as bills—I did not say I wished to build larger houses—there was not room—I saw him several times in 1838—I was not on the most intimate terms with him—I knew him as a person trying to get his living—he applied to me to endeavour to get him a situ-ation—he was not in desperate circumstances, to my knowledge—I did not know his circumstances were very bad—I did not believe they were good—I thought he was getting his living—he had applied about a year</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184106140046"></xptr>
               <p>before to me, to get him a situation—I wrote to a friend in the North, to use his influence to get him appointed a coal-metre—the proposition I made the prisoner was under consideration some time, and he advertised, I believe—I do not recollect his saying he would consider of it till next morning—the first bill I took of his was about the 20th of February, 1838—(<hi rend="italic">referring to his bill-book</hi>)—I made this entry about that time—before I paid it away—I discounted this bill.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Of all the bills you ever had in your life from him, and which you will not swear amounted to 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., tell me how you discounted any one of them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> By cheques and by cash—the one I now prosecute on, was one of a lot, amounting to 280<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I gave cheques and other bills for it, which would be due at the same time, and the discount.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You gave him cheques, to what amount? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> This was, I think, by bills alone—other bills.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You said some bills, some cheques, and some cash? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, that was the usual way, but from my memorandum I gave him other bills—one on James for 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., one on Banks, for 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., one on Adams, for 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., one on Esther, for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they were all due about that time—this entry in the bill-book was made about that time—I should probably do it immediately after, but I will not swear that I did—there was a bonus of 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to me on the transaction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How do you account for giving him 328<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which appears in this entry for 280<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You will see the balance is carried forward against him to-wards the next transaction—I have no book of our transactions in 1840, except the bill-book—I kept it merely on the bills—James's bill was on just due, and probably not due—I will not swear it was not overdue, nor Banks's—I think they were just about coining due—(<hi rend="italic">referring to his book</hi>)—Jame's was due on the 27th of January—I cannot exactly say the day I gave then to him—I received the bills from him on the 6th of February—I think the bills would be given up about the day they were due—they were not all over due—they were given to him to be presented at the time they became due, as he said very often they were sent down to by the drawers to provide for the bills on a sudden emergency, and it was very convenient to his employer, Mr. Fletcher, to have the bills to present—I gave him a con<lb></lb>sideration for the bills he brought—generally speaking, it must have been cheques, not over-due bills—I gave him the bills for the 280<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., either the day or before they were due—they were not all due the same day—the transaction was in February, but I did not receive these bills in return at the time the others were given up—I gave him the bills I have mentioned for the 280<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bills—I gave them to him in January—when that bill became due, in January, I gave it to him—when I gave him up a bill, I put it down—it sometimes went on for several weeks, before I got any others back for what I had given him up—he said it was the same to them as cash.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You stated you had discounted that bill; on your oath, is there a syllable of truth in that? Did you pay a single farthing for it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> gave him bills previously—I did not give him a farthing at that time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not long before that, agree to allow him a commission of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per cent, on any thing he could bring you, on which you could raise money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, not that I could raise money on—I paid him a commis<lb></lb>sion for his trouble—he said he got another commission from his employer—I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184106140047"></xptr>
               <p>paid him about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per cent.—it varied—I did not at the commence-ment agree to give him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per cent.—he used to get as much as he could—I sometimes gave him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—nearly the whole of these cheques (<hi rend="italic">pro-ducing some</hi>) are for money he had.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Look at them, and tell the Jury any time you will swear that in discounting hills, you gave him money, and what yon gave him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On the 23rd of May, 1838, I gave him a cheque for 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., for a bill in the name of Mr. Gill, for 55<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not think I had any bills of his then over-due (<hi rend="italic">referring to his book</hi>)—I see on the same day there was a bill for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. due, drawn by John Williams, on Thomas Williams of Dover—that bill laid at my banker's—I do not know who took it up—I did not—I did not give him that cheque to take up that bill, on my oath—I never have done so—he has borrowed cheques of me, but I never dis<lb></lb>counted a bill to enable him to meet others—I never gave him cheques to take to the banker's, to take up bills over-due and unpaid with "no such person," or "not known," or "no such account" written on them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you swear that positively? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not believe I ever did such a thing—I swear I have not done it a hundred times, nor fifty—I think I can swear I have not done it twenty times—he may in several in<lb></lb>stances have borrowed cheques when he said they were pressed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But the question is, whether some of the cheques you gave him were not to take up bills lying at the banker's unpaid? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> may have done so in a few instances.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you swear you have not done it in twenty instances? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think so—I should not like to swear so minutely, nor to twenty-five—I will swear there have not been thirty—not that I have been aware of his using them for any such purposes—I have not done it to my knowledge, for bills laying over-due at bankers—the bankers have not to my knowledge refused to deliver bills up—I know no such thing as bankers refusing to deliver up bills to me, or on my account, with "no account" written on them, when I sent to pay them—I did not tell him in 1838, that if he brought me the bills, I would take care of him—I said nothing of the sort—I did not tell him I was going to build a terrace—I may have shown him the plan of one, as an ornamental piece of work—it was drawn by Mr. Barry, for the person of whom I purchased the land, Mr. Flasket, with whom I have had bill transactions—I should think they were not to the amount of 5000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was not 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I will not swear it was under 5000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I think my last transaction with Flasket was in 1838—I will not swear I have had none since—I think I had none in 1840, but cannot swear it without going through my book—there may have been one or two—I gave him 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the estate, in money, in 1833—he had three of the bills I took from the prisoner, I think in 1838—I may have paid him one or two more—he is a builder—I can scarcely tell the amount of my bill transactions in 1838—it was nothing like 50,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was very small in 1839—I had scarcely any bill transactions, except with the prisoner—I did not engage him for bill transactions at 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per cent—I think, in 1839, my bill transactions were not more than 5000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I swear they were not 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I think they were under 5000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I swear they were not 6000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I think I can swear it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at his book</hi>)—I never sent him in 1839 to the banker's to take up over-due bills—I might know of his going.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Bills over-due and noted? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Noted, probably—I do not recollect</p>

               <p>any of Poulton's—there were not many of Poulton's in 1839, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you swear you do not know of many of Poulton's bills, in 1839, being over-due and unpaid, either drawn, accepted, or supposed to be accepted by Poulton? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Unless it was by arrangement to be renewed, I do not know of their being over-due and unpaid, except by arrange<lb></lb>ment they should be renewed—I have three or four over-due bills of Poul<lb></lb>ton's in my possession—I have none in the hands of a relation, except my brother—he does not hold any of Poulton's—he held, at the time the prisoner absconded, nearly 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether, which I had received of the prisoner, and now has nearly that amount—he does not hold more—I have a great quantity here—(<hi rend="italic">producing forty-seven</hi>)—these are all have, except the three indicted on—there may be perhaps twenty more, not in my possession—I swear there are not fifty—the prisoner did not call to request me to find money to take up any of these bills—he used to call on me to supply him with money, and if I said, "Do you want this to meet such and such bills?" he used to laugh at me, an I say, "No such thing you are always suspecting"—he has borrowed small amounts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he call on you for money to take up bills, and you tell him you had not a fraction in the world, and give him your watch, chain and seals to raise money on? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not to raise money on—I had told him I wished to sell my watch—I think that was this year—I do not think I had over<lb></lb>due bills in my hands at that time—I swear I had not fifty—I several times talked to him about selling my watch—he bid me a price for it—he then pressed for his commission, which had got in arrear—he said he could not live without his commission—I asked if he would like the watch at such a price—I might tell him I was short of money—I do not think I told him I had none—I will not swear it—I will not swear I had no over-due bills at that time—there might be one or two—the prisoner went abroad on the 19th of February—I did not give him money to go—the last cheque I gave him was in exchange for another he brought—that was on the 17th of February—I gave him two cheques, amounting to 76<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. together—I did not at that time give him a letter to Mr. Cooper, of Baldwin's-court—I may have given him one once, as he used to go for me to different persons—I think I sent him, shortly before he went abroad, to Cooper, to know if he could cash me some bills—I did not recollect it before—I had a letter from the prisoner on the day he went abroad—I did not tell him to write it—on the contrary, I was much surprised at receiving it—Mr. Cooper did not come to me, in answer to a letter to come, and give me 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I went down to him; he gave me 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I handed to the prisoner—I did not tell him to pay as much of it as he could into Williams and Co., of Birch in-lane, my bankers, and keep the rest himself—this was on the 12th of February—if you will allow me to read a letter from the prisoner it will account for this—I gave him the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the same account as he had all the rest, for which I was to have bills—he did not tell me of his going abroad, I swear I did not know it—I received a note without any signature, but which I believe to be his writing—the post-mark is the 6th of April—that was the first I heard from him—I saw a letter before that from him to his wife—I think it was on the day I had a person watching at his house—it was in March, I think—the post-mark was "Paris, 25th March."</p>

               <p>because I thought the bills I held were all good, which were all I hold now, except some which have come back to me—the bills I had in hand at the time he went, amounted to nearly 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I believe the body of Mr. Poulton's bill to be in the handwriting of the prisoner—I did not state before the Magistrate I believed the whole of it to be his writing—I did not desire him to get a letter from Fletcher, to produce to the person from whom I got money for the bills, to show there was a prospect of get-ting the money—the body of this bill (<hi rend="italic">looking as one</hi>) is very much like his handwriting—I believe it to be his—he seems to have the facility of varying his handwriting a good deal—I should not like to swear it—the body of several of the forty-seven bills here appear to be his handwriting—I never built the terrace, nor did any body else—I think I was ill with a cold, or something, in the Spring of last year—the prisoner came to me, I think.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You swore you never gave him money to take up bills over-due, to your knowledge? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Except by an arrangement, I said, which was that I was to have other bills from him—that is the mode by which I dealt with him all through—I did not give him money to take up bills in every in<lb></lb>stance, nor in multitudes of instances—not 100—it is difficult to swear, unless I kept an account.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you recollect swearing, the only time you gave him money to take up over-due bills, was, when they were to be renewed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, by this sort of arrangement, if I gave him a cheque, it did not matter whether a bill was due, or would be due shortly, if I put the cheque down to the account—I was to have other bills for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> This was seven days after the bill was due—on your oath, we there not written on that bill "The acceptor not known—no orders"—the bill noted lying in the hands of the banker? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Very likely—he ac-counted for it by saying they were bills drawn by tailors on their custom-ers, many of them fashionable young men, at the West-end of the town, who did not care making bills payable at bankers, though they might not hare an account there—I never in any one instance made inquiry to ascer<lb></lb>tain</p>

               <p>whether there were such persons in existence as the acceptors, nor did I go to the persons themselves—he made inquiries, and always assured me they were perfectly safe—he was in the house of Bed ward and Co,—he said he had been with hills from that house—he knew the parties, and knew them to be safe—I did not go to Bedward and Co.—I depended on his statement—I cannot swear the whole of this page in my bill-book was not written at one time, nor whether the next was not written at the same time as the other—the bills were entered about the time I received them—the entries are in my handwriting—I cannot say it was written on the pre<lb></lb>cise day it bears date—it has been written at different times—I may have entered, perhaps, two pages at once, not more—it is all the same ink—I copied it from the bills—the dates are the dates of the bills—I have not filled up the column headed, "When received"—Mr. Lowry sometime had 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of bills at a time—he held about 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth at the time the prisoner left—Hunt held between 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Cooper held two of 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, which are all over-due now—they were over-due in May last—there are none now which were over-due in 1840—those were either paid or returned to the prisoner before he left—Williams, a wine<lb></lb>merchant, held about 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth—I do not think he had thousands of pounds worth altogether—I do not think Wharton, of St. Katherine's Dock, had so muck as 3000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 4000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there are two now at Williams and Co., my bankers—I have not had any transactions with them since the 17th of February—they have had nothing in their hands but the two over-due bills—I be<lb></lb>lieve there was a cheque sent in on the 18th—the two bills they hold have overdrawn the account by 140<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had lent the prisoner several cheques at the time I stopped the account—there was one of 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which went in on the 18th.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> At the time you discontinued the account, was he in possession of cheques to the amount of 470<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., when you had nothing to pay them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He had borrowed them before, which he repeatedly did, and has brought me back the cheques, or found the money to meet them—he said it made no difference to Mr. Fletcher—he does not hold 470<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of dishonoured cheques now, as one was paid—I paid 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in immediately—an action has been brought against me for the dishonoured cheques—the 470<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of cheques had nothing to do with this bill of Poulton's—they were lent to accommodate him and Mr. Fletcher—I never saw Fletcher—I asked tow him several times on the commencement of the transaction—I always said how should I find Mr. Fletcher, in case of any thing happening to him, in case of illness, death, or any thing—he said, his wife had Mr. Fletchers address, when I wanted it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And you mean to represent having had about 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of bills negotiated by him, when he said his wife had Fletcher's address, you never asked for it till after he absconded? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—the bills were regularly met—I sometimes gave cheques to take them up—if he makes an arrangement with me, if he pays them, he regularly meets them—he said they were to be met for the accommodation of the acceptor, who had made a communication to the drawer, and the drawer to Fletcher, through whom they were discounted—the whole of this cheque-book almost is filled with cheques given him for bills discounted—he denied that they were to take up bills—he always said, "We want money."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How was he getting his living? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I understood he was a good deal engaged by Fletcher—he said he got something from him, and he was buying and selling on his own account, I believe—he never dined with</p>

               <p>me—he has often come to the house I dined at in Moorgate-street to see me about bills and transactions, and sometimes he used to take something—I sometimes paid for it, not always—he only took a little pudding, or something—he came down to my father-in-law's, to me, and had something to eat, but not to dinner—it was in the morning—I was sitting down with him—I do not recollect eating with him—I have given him post-dated cheques, several—I think not a hundred—I should not like to swear minutely—he pressed me for post-dated cheques very much—he was very pressing for money, and if I had none, he would say, "It will make no difference to you, the cheques will lie in the hands of a friend of Fletcher's, who will lend him the money, and before they are due, you shall have the cheque hack," and I got them back—the 470<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. happened to be out at the time he absconded—I have not given him a dozen cheques at a time post-dated, nor six, I should think, but will not swear it—he has had three or four at a time, with different dates—that was a general thing—I know one Maltby by sight, as being in the employ of a person where the prisoner used to frequent—I never employed Maltby to take up over<lb></lb>due bills—I never gave him any, nor ever saw the prisoner give him any hills or cheques by my direction—I think on one occasion I understood he went to take up a bill, but not for me—it was for the prisoner—I think it was at my bankers', but do not very distinctly recollect it—it is some time ago—he did not come back and tell me the bankers would not part with the bill, because they suspected there was something wrong—i be-lieve he got the bill—I will not swear it; as it is some time ago—I do not recollect writing to the bankers and getting the bill.</p>
               <p>Q. You swear he did not go there for you—on your oath did not you furnish him with your own hand-writing to get the bill? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have given the prisoner a note—I will not swear I did not give Maltby one—I was practising as an attorney all this time.</p>
               <p>Q. How long ago is it that you sent Maltby? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About a year ago—I do not recollect now whose bill it was—whether it was Poulton's—I will I not swear it was not—the bankers never sent to complain of my taking a liberty in making use of their names, by making bills payable there—I never heard of it till now—my own bankers, Williams and Deacon, did not do so—I gave the prisoner a note on one or two occasions—I have some indistinct recollection now of sending Maltby with a note—I will not swear I did not afterwards send him with the money to take up a bill—I do not recollect it-actions have been brought against me not he cheques, and on one bill—communicated that to the prisoner's wife—he was abroad, I think—he did not come to my office till May—the action had commenced after he left—he catne to my office about a month after I sent to him, but I have no dates when he came to the office I knew the bills were forged—I felt some difficulty about giving him into custody—I did not like the idea of a pro<lb></lb>secution against a man with five children, and I also thought his evidence might have been useful to me, I did not think it would be useful to the plaintiff—I was taken very much by surprise—I had no idea of his coming, and he promised to come again the following evening—my clerk was not in the room when he first came—he came in a few minutes—I saw him in my private office—I did not shut the door, and desire him to lock it—I knew where his wife lived at the time—he staid about half an hour—I will wear it was not more than an hour—I do not think he staid an hour—I did not send to his wife afterwards to see if he was there—he said he would</p>

               <p>come next day—he wrote to me afterwards, and I wrote to him—I know Hunt, to whom he owed 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mr. Watson is Hunt's attorney—I would not be the attorney—when the prisoner came again, I had got Forresteru officer—there was not a Sheriff's officer in my office—he was in a picture shop opposite—I did not put him there—I knew of his being there—I ranged that he should be waiting there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On your oath, did not you write him a letter to deceive him, to get him to come to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I applied to him to come in order that he might give evidence to clear me in the action—Hunt complained to toe about the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we thought the prisoner must have money, and if arrested first by the Sheriff, he would probably pay him the amount—Hunt was very much annoyed at his obtaining the money as he did previous to his absconding, and when I had made up my mind, under advice of my friend, to forego the evidence in the action, and to prosecute him, that was ar-ranged to get him there—he had called on me on a Monday, and wrote to say he would be there on the Monday afterwards, and was taken—I ap-plied to Forrester to take him without a warrant, but he did not like—he had not borrowed the cheques of me for himself, but for Fletcher—I be-lived he said all.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you the smallest means in the world to take up any of the bins you have negotiated? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I have—I shall have the means of meet<lb></lb>ing them in a little time—I have some freehold land at Norwood, which I purchased in 1832, but must sell it before I can get the money—I have book debts to about 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there are about 2000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out now, including what I hold—I have given my own note for some of them, and in some cases, bills—I have contracted to sell the property at Norwood—there is a mortgage on it—on that, and some land at Holloway, I have had 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—did not give any money for the houses at Norwood—that transaction was also with Flasket—I do not know what is called the Swindlers' List—I do not think I ever saw one—my attention has never been called to it—I have heard of such a list, but not for several years—I do not know whether Flasket's name is on it.</p>

               <p>"April 17th, 1841. Mr. Moss.—Sir, It will he a great expense for any one to come to me—I am in the department of the Voges on the banks of the Moselle, and I do not understand what I am to do, from the paper my wife has sent me. If you will give my wife the amount it will cost me, I will meet any one you may please at Calais or Boulogne, and that will save you double the expense—it will cost me 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; at the same time you instruct me how to act—will you give me time, and I will pay you 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound?—you will then be no loser. I should like to have your word upon this business. How soon do you want my affidavit? I could do business to a great advantage, if I could visit England, but not without, I regret much for the past. I trust I shall be able to repay; indeed if could get my business settled, I am sure I could. You will please to do till you can for me. My wife tells me you say that I am in England—what nonsense! because the paper is not French, I send you now some French paper that has not been made five minutes. I hope you will do something to settle my business; it rests entirely with you. What my poor wife and family will do, I know not.—Sir, yours respectfully, C. <hi rend="smallCaps">SMITH</hi>. "</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I did not know he was gone to France, nor did I furnish him with money to go—he called on the 3rd of May—here is a letter I received on the 6th of May—it is his handwriting—(<hi rend="italic">read.</hi>) "May 6th, 1841. Mr. Moss.—Sir, I must beg most respectfully to have a statement put before me, particularly if any of your friends are to be present at our next meeting to show this and also particu-larly how the sum of money or monies you hold in paper has accumulated, for I presumed neither Mr. Lowry nor the gentleman that was present, nor even Mr. Hickin knows. You must see that the enormous interest you charged makes the amount swell; for instance, take 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month—and you have had more than this—We'll take it for 12 months—here is a profit of 2000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. This is the way I intend to explain, and some of my friends demand of me every particular. I must say, that when I left England, I had not one single sovereign of your money, or was it got in any way by or through your interest. Yours respectully, C, <hi rend="smallCaps">SMITH</hi>. "</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you the gentleman who found yourself at Child's banking-house in December last? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have been at Child's many times—I presented a bill there I think for Moss—I do not know whether it was one of the prisoner's bills.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the clerk at the banking-house tell you it was all nonsense your coming there to present bills, they were forgeries, and you knew it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I do not recollect what he said—if the bill was produced, there would be the answer of the clerk on it—I do not think it was one of Poulton's bills, but will not swear it—he did not suggest it was forged—I think he said they had no account—I was not present above twenty minutes in May, when the prisoner came to Moss—I knew at that time that the bills were forged.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PHILLIPS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did you first know from Mosa that be knew they were forgeries? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should think a very short time after the pri<lb></lb>soner went out of the country—I will swear it was after he left.</p>
               <p>(The bill was here read, dated the 3rd of February, 1841, drawn by B. W. Poulton on G. Edgerton, Orchard-street, Portman-square, accepted payable at Ransom and Co., at four months.)</p>

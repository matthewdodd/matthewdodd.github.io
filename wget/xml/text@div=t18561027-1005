                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Wright, a shoemaker, of No.2, Haverstock-street, Camden-town—he is the master of the young man who is said to be the father of the child—the child died at my house, at half past 4 o'clock in the morning of 11th Sept.—it was with me from the 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—when the prisoner came out of the workhouse, she came to our house, and was with the child's father, and I saw the baby every day, and nursed it, and when it cried and the prisoner was out I suckled it—she suckled it at various times during that week—she did not pay proper attention to it—she was very neglectful of it, and I have seen her shake it and beat it, and she did not keep it clean unless she was told to do so—she smacked it with her hand, and shook it—I have remonstrated with her about it, and asked her if she thought so young an infant could know what she shook and smacked it for—on the Monday, the prisoner's mother came out of the infirmary, and she abused the young man, James Evans, and insisted upon the pri<lb></lb>soner going away with her and leaving him, and she did so, with the chili—Evans lives with his father, but he works with my husband when he is slack—he is no relation of mine, but he calls himself a cousin, because my husband's father married his aunt—during the weeks she was at our house, she would stop out a long while when she went out of an errand, and the child would cry, and I have sometimes suckled it—she had plenty of mill—I continued to see the child occasionally, sometimes two or three times a week, up to July, in her arms—she has brought it to my room and had it there with Evans—I did not notice that there was anything the matter with it, it seemed pretty well—I have taken it and fed it—I did not see any difference in it up to the end of July—she once brought the child to my room, and threw it on the table before Evans, and told him he was to take his child and keep it, for she could not, if he did not allow her pay for it—she did not put it down as an affectionate mother would—her mother abused him very shamefully, indeed—Evans would have married her if it had not been for the mother; he spoke to the missionary, and forgave her all she had done wrong—the child was left with me on that occasion, and he fed it, and took it to his mother to bring it up, that was early in the evening, and about 10 or 11 o'clock that night the prisoner and her mother came and kicked up a bother, and insisted on having the child again—on account of that, I forbade her coming to my place, and I did not see it any more till she brought it on 8th Sept., three days before it died; she then said she had been to the doctor's with it, and she had brought it for the father to see it before it died, for the doctor said it was dying for want of proper nourishment, and he had ordered it port wine and beef tea—I asked her to bring it up stairs—she at first refused, but afterwards came up with it, and I made it some sago, with a little port wine in it, and fed it—I then asked her what she intended to do with it—she said she did not know—she left it with me that night—it appeared exhausted and sinking from want—the child had no notion at all of sucking when it came to me then—I could not say whether the prisoner had a proper supply of milk then, I did not see her breasts—she said she had an order to take it into the infirmary—I said that was the best thing she could do with it—she said she did not see why she should bury her days in the infirmary for the sake of the child—Evans said she should either leave it with him or take it to the infirm<lb></lb>ary—I said I would go with him to see about her not dragging it about the streets any longer, and then she cried, and said she would leave it</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you not endorse on the order that the child wag in a state of exhaustion in consequence of the want of breast milk on the part of the mother? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was some slight mistake made in the copying of these depositions—I stated that the mother was suffering from a want of breast milk, and that it was stated her circumstances were such as to prevent her from suckling it—a want of breast milk would be induced by poor living, anything that depresses the powers of life—I found some food in the child's stomach, and traces of food throughout the whole of the stomach and bowels—children of that age are excessively tender, they frequently die from their breathing being obstructed in bed—children that are greatly exhausted would be more liable to that than others.</p>

             Esq. sworn.</p>
               <p>On Wednesday the 7th of this month, I had the honour of commanding the gentlemen of the London association; in the evenning about ten o'clock, after repeated sollicitations from the inhabitants of Broad-street, informing us that the Excise-office and Pay-office would certainly be laid in ashes, the gentlemen of the London Association marched down Broad-street with Mr. Sheriff Pugh; as soon as the gentlemen came in sight of the fire, which wa s kindled and consuming the goods of Mr. Donavan, I halted them; I left the gentlemen about a hundred yards from the mob; I advanced about thirty or forty yards in front of them, and exhorted the mob to disperse. I endeavoured to convince them of the danger they were in. I told them I had the sheriff's order to fire upon them; that we were loaded with ball and should certainly fire upon them if they did not immediately disperse. The mob seemed rather more riotous after my speaking to them; and seeing my admonition had no effect, I returned to the gentlemen of the Association and marched them within forty yards, as I guessed, of the mob; from that second position I advanced a little way farther and again exhorted the mob to disperse, the mob however, paid no attention to what I said, and continued demolishing the furniture of Mr. Donavan's house with more fury that they seemed to have done before; after having desired those whom I thought were only spectators to disperse, which however, like what I had said before, seemed to have no effect, I ordered the gentlemen to fire from the right by files, thinking that if two or three shots would have dispersed the mob, it would have been more pleasing to us than firing more. The mob being armed with bludgeons and other weapons, and seeming to become more furious from the little effect of these two or three shots, I ordered the gentlemen to continue their file firing; as near as I can recollect, about twenty shots were fired before the mob dispersed. As soon as the mob were dispersed, I ordered the gentlemen to advance, and form a square from the place where the mob had made a fire, which was across the street; I placed a company in each of those avenues securing the house, and went into the house, and two or three gentlemen followed me immediately; on entering the house I saw a stout ill-looking fellow behind the door with a lighted candle in his hand. I put a pistol I had in my pocket to his breast, and told him he was a dead man if he moved or made any resistance. I handed him to a gentleman on my right, who was a little below upon the steps; I then went up stairs and saw that the whole of the furniture was torn to pieces in a shocking manner; the railing of the stair-case on the first flight was torn and broke to pieces; the glasses and sashes in the windows were likewise knocked all to pieces; in short every part of the furniture, except the furniture of the maid servant's room, was demolished, thrown out of the rooms, and broken to pieces. Not finding any person in the house up stairs I went into the lower part of the house, which consists of the kitchen and cellar; at the end of a wine vault were four men; the first that came out called out, as if speaking to some of his comrades, "holloa lads, what are you about, or what is the matter;" not knowing exactly the number which might be in so dark a place; we secured the first man who came out, by presenting our bayonets to his breast, and making him go into a corner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178006280110"></xptr> of the kitchen; in a little time after the rest came out singly; they did not seem sensible of the crime they had committed, they seemed very unwilling to be taken prisoners; and seeing but two or three of the association, the tall man, the prisoner Cleeves, being on the right, advanced to me with his hand listed up, in a menacing manner, as if he meant to strike, and seemed to look at the others, as if he was expecting their assistance; as he was advancing in that position I placed the point of my bayonet against his side under his arm, but as he seemed a little in liquor and the bottom of the kitchen, he stood upon, being entirely covered with broken glass bottles, I recollected myself and thought it possible he might advance upon me, even in that danger, and conceiving that a wound in that position would be mortal, I changed the point of my bayonet and just pricked him in the fleshy part of his breast, that seemed to have the effect I wished. The man was sensible of his danger and begged we would not kill him. I told him it was not our wish to kill him, but if he would submit himself quietly he should be well treated; with the assistance that had then come down into the cellar, they were tied two and two; I sent them back under a guard of twenty gentlemen, by whom I am informed they were lodged in the Poultry-Compter.</p>

               <p>Did you afterwards go into the house for the purpose of seeing what these men had been doing? - Yes, we did; every part of the furniture in the kitchen, and every place as far we went, we saw they had been either breaking the bottles or demolishing every thing they could lay their hands upon. We found a vast quantity of broken bottles upon the kitchen floor, and in the vault, which was on the same floor; the jack in the kitchen was torn down, the pewter upon the shelves was demolished, and every thing was in the utmost confusion, the balustrades of the staircase, the sashes, and every window, were torn down.</p>
               <p>Was it the frames or only the sashes of the window? - The wooden part of the sashes of the windows were torn down.</p>
               <p>Were the four prisoners the men secured by you, or which do you recollect? - I can swear positively to the tallest man being in the kitchen in the predicament I described; I cannot swear to the other men, but I believe them to be the men; I have every recollection short of being positive.</p>
               <p>When they were first secured did they offer any apology for themselves? - They seemed to think they had done no harm, no property being found upon them; the language of many of them was, You cannot say you found any thing upon us. They did not deny the breaking the furniture; part of the furniture having been demolished that seemed to be too obvious to be disputed.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>If I understand you rightly these men were followed into a wine-vault? - They were in the vault, we followed them into it as they were coming out.</p>
               <p>Then you did not see them do any act at all? - No, we did not.</p>
               <p>As to what you spoke of furniture being broken that might be by other people before you came there? - I can say nothing to who the persons were who broke the house, we found the prisoners at the bottom of the house when we came there.</p>
               <p>They seemed to think themselves innocent? - They seemed to think themselves secure because we found none of Mr. Donavan's property upon them.</p>
               <p>What time of night was this? - Between ten and eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Was you present at the examination of these people before mylord Mayor? - I was not.</p>
               <p>Mr. ELLWOOD sworn.</p>
               <p>You are one of the gentlemen of the London Association who were present at the time Mr. Turner has been speaking of? - I was.</p>
               <p>You will please to confine the account you have to give to what passed during the time you was in the house? - Mr. Turner has given a very correct account of the business, except in two or three instances; one of which is, which I dare say he has forgot, we fired upon them in Wormwood-street.</p>
               <p>Please to confine the account you have to give to what passed within the house of Mr. Donavan? - As soon as the mob dispersed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178006280111"></xptr> Mr. Turner, Mr. Adams, myself, and one or two more, went into the house. Mr. Turner was first; he found a man behind the door with a candle in his hand; he seised him and gave him to me; I delivered him to the city-marshal. We then went into every room in the house, which we found in the exact situation Mr. Turner has described; from thence we went into the cellar, there we found these four men; I know them perfectly well; I was employed a quarter of an hour, I dare say, in tying their hands. I went to see them next day that I might know them again. Mr. Turner mentioned, they said</p>
               <p>"You have found nothing upon us," I did not hear that; all they said was,</p>
               <p>"We hope you will not murder us;" they gave no account how they came there, nor why; the tall man appeared to be in liquor.</p>
               <p>How did you find the vault? - It was filed with broken bottles; every thing was destroyed that was possible in the vault; a great deal of wine was upon the floor, it was shoe deep and the place was covered with broken bottles.</p>
               <p>Were these the only men found in the vaults? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Can you speak positively to these four men? - To every one of them.</p>
               <p>Did you make an observation as to the situation of this house how it had been destroyed or begun to be destroyed? - The greatest part of the furniture was totally destroyed, and the banisters of the first flight of stairs were broken, and almost every sash of the house; some of the doors of the house were broken. The tall man had either been wounded by our firing, or had cut his hand with some of the glass, I cannot tell which; but there were two or three of the doors of Mr. Donavan's house much blooded.</p>
               <p>What number of the rioters do you think were about this house when you first went up? - A great number, I suppose four or five hundred; they were the more violent because of Mr. Turner's requesting them to disperss and go away; they were exceedingly daring.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>You do not know of any act they did only they were in the vault? - No.</p>

               <p>"What is the matter, I hope you are not come to kill us."</p>
               <p>Look at the prisoners, are these the four men who were apprehended? - They are.</p>
               <p>You can speak positively that they are? - They are.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ellwood. There was an inclination in two of them to force their way out but they found the points of our bayonets too sharp.</p>

               <p>What was the condition of the house after the rioters had been there? - It was in a very bad condition; they tore and burnt and stole away almost every thing that was in the house; the banisters of the stairs were torn away, the windows were beat out, most of them not only the glass but the wood.</p>
               <p>Was it in perfect repair on the day previous to this? - It was.</p>

               <p>In the course of the day, near upon ten o'clock, I called upon a friend; I was much in liquor; after that I went up to Aldersgate-street; then I made it my way home to London-wall; I lost my acquaintance in the crowd.</p>

               <p>I was going home to my lodging; I saw the mob at this house; I was at the door and was pushed into the house with the mob and down into the cellar.</p>
               <p>COCKEN's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I had been hard at work all day at the engine at the fire in Moorfields; I got much in liquor there; I returned from thence into Bishopsgate-street, where I live. I stopped there some time, I cannot say positively how long; after that the landlord who keeps the Swan-inn and I came out together; we went to the corner of Houndsditch, the fire was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178006280112"></xptr> burning there. I lent an hand to the coachmen that came by to get their horses past the mob; as we were coming home we happened to see this fire burning at the bottom of Wormwood-street; we ran down together, there was a man and me, we observed the flames. I lost him in the mob; I ran into the gentleman's house, for what reason I cannot tell, I was so much in liquor; I can give no other account.</p>
               <p>KING's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I left off work about two in the afternoon; I am a weaver by trade. I took a measure of the read; I was going into Hog-lane, to the read-maker's; there were a great many people running to see the destruction of Newgate. I thought I would go and look at it on the outside; I staid there till dark, then I went into the city to go home; going past the Compter, there were some of the soldiers would not let any body pass, so I was obliged to go the back way; I kept looking at this fire eight or ten minutes. There was a young man in the passage in the broad place looking at Newgate with me. I took Mr. Cocken to be the man; I followed him and called out,

            . I thought him to be the person; he was not coming up again. I heard some of the gentlemen fire, and make a noise; I was afraid to go out, so I went down again. The gentlemen came down in a short time afterwards and took me. I was the very first who was taken out of the cellar; they took me coming up to the door, they tied my hands behind me, and searched me to see if I had any arms, or any property, I had none about me.</p>

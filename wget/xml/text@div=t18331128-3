               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you present when the dress-maker brought the gown home? A. Yes; there is no mark by which I should be able to speak to it except the print of it - it is a buff and lilac flower - there is no mark on it, no more than the make of it - the-table cloth was on the table at supper the night before - it was marked with an iron mould - that is a very common mark, but I know it was missed that night - there is no other mark to enable me to swear to it - there is no mark on the stair carpet to my knowledge more than the quantity.</p>

I am the wife of John Richard Day; I remember seeing Coverdale on the Saturday before Whit Sunday; to the best of my knowledge it was about four or five o'clock in the morning - I saw him in my apartment<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183311280005"></xptr>- there was a person named Tyrrell in the same room; he occupied the same room with me; he was out of bed at that time -

             followed Coverdale in; Coverdale had a clock and a coat thrown over his arm, with a fur collar, a bundle with a table-cloth about it, a white hat, a black coat, and several other articles - Tebbutt had a clock, and a bottle with the neck of it broken, containing white wine; I tasted the wine - at the time this happened, I had two rooms at No. 8, New-street, Cloth-fair, two doors from Mr. Asher's - I had let one of those rooms to John Coverdale and another person - the street-door of the house I live in, stands on the latch, and is seldom bolted; my bed-room door can be opened by a person from outside; it has no lock to it - it would push open; the bolt is so slight - Tyrrell got up when they came in; he asked Coverdale what he had there - he swore at him, and told him to go about his business - I thought I had seen the clock before - I was a customer of Mr. Asher's; I made an observation about it - Coverdale said, "Hold your tongue, I will go away directly; I only want my basket" - and I said, "That clock has come from next door" - the prisoners were present; they at first said it had not, and that I was foolish; but I insisted on it, and said I should tell the people - Coverdale persuaded me that it was not, but I persisted in it, and Coverdale leant over on the bed and said he would murder me if I said any thing about it, but if I did not he would make me a present of a new gown - I had an old baker's basket belonging to Coverdale in the room - he asked for it, and put into it the things I have described, and one of the clocks, the fur-collared coat, the hat, and other things I have mentioned - I saw something which I found afterwards to be a dress - he took the baker's basket away on his back - Tebbutt was not so harsh as Coverdale, and told me to take a glass of wine out of the bottle; I said I was not fond of white wine, but he pressed it, and out of fear I took it - he left the room with one of the clocks and a sack thrown round it, which had been in Coverdale's baker's basket - Tyrrell came to bed when they left; I had not seen Tebbutt before - we got up at eight o'clock in the morning, and in about an hour Tebbutt came to the room again, and said, with an oath, that he had missed Jack, and asked me to have some gin; I refused, but he wished to have some, and I went to Asher's to get some; Mrs. Asher was crying, and it was said they had been robbed - I brought the gin to the lodging, I merely tasted it - I afterwards saw a Mrs. Childs; she knocked at my door, and asked if a person named Day lived there (Tebbutt heard this); I said, "Yes, my name is Day" - when my door is open you can see all over the room - she said to Tebbutt,"You are the person I want" - she took a little of the gin, and Tebbutt left the room - she said Jack wanted him at her house, for the property was there, and he was to come immediately - she thought he would have been there before - Tebbutt called again the same evening - I saw Coverdale on the Sunday, about one o'clock in the day; it was Whit-Sunday; he called with a little boy - that was on Whit-Sunday; (this happened the day before Whit-Sunday) - on the Monday I was with Tyrrell the greatest part of the day - we called at Mrs. Child's in Brewer-street in the afternoon, and saw her, and took tea there; she showed me a table-cloth and some tea in it, and I observed a paper with a quantity of tobacco in it, and a great coat, and the basket which Coverdale had at my place - after we had had tea, I saw Coverdale and Tebbutt there; while they were together, I said to Coverdale, "You have brought a fine disgrace on me by this business;" that I had always been looked on as honest, and was now looked upon quite different - he said it was all nonsense - I said Asher had offered me 10l. to discover who committed the robbery, and he had told me on Sunday, if the property was brought back, he would give 5l., and it might be sent back any way they pleased, and he would send the 5l.; then Coverdale and Tebbutt began to be very angry and abused me, and told me to mind myself - Tebbutt was more angry than before; Coverdale said the property fetched 2l., and that it could not be got again if 50l. was given for it - they wished to join 1s. each to have refreshment; I said, "I shall not stop," and they went to the adjoining room - I went down stairs; Tyrrell followed me a short time after - Coverdale never came to lodge with me after that - I have seen Coverdale three or four times since that, but never Tebbutt.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Now, on what night was this? A. It was not night, but on the Saturday morning before Whit-Sunday - I cannot tell the day of the month - I am quite certain it was the Saturday before Whit-Sunday; I was in bed that night, not with my husband - he is alive; he was not with me - John Tyrrell was with me; I am a married woman, and I was sleeping with Tyrrell - I believe him to be an honest man; he is now in Newgate on a charge of robbing his master - I had lived with him some length of time - on this night my husband was in another room in the same house - I was never under charge for any dishonesty, that I swear - I was never charged with any felony, never taken in custody by any officer on a charge of felony, nor any charge at all - I had lived with Tyrrell from the 17th of February last.</p>
               <p>Q. And you saw all these different articles - you must have minutely inspected them? A. The bed was so close to the door, and it was day-light - part was in a bundle with a table-cloth; I did not open the table cloth - I speak to the loose things - I did not see the tea in my own room - I had seen the clocks a number of times before, and told them they had been stolen - I had not the least doubt they had been stolen, nor from whom they had been stolen - I was afraid to tell the prosecutor of the robbery when I went for the gin; I did not then tell him that I knew the party - I told the story I have told here to day, at Hatton Garden - I never told of it from the time I saw the clocks till the week before last - my fright had not gone off at all at that time - I always said, if ever Coverdale was in custody, I made a vow in my mind that I would tell of it, and I heard he was in custody, and told - I believe Tyrrell was taken in custody last Tuesday week - I believe Coverdale was taken before.</p>
               <p>Q. Now do you not know that Tyrrell himself was the person who committed the robbery? A. I do not believe that he did commit the robbery - he could not for he was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183311280006"></xptr>in bed with me; and from the way he talked to the prisoner when he came to the door, he could not have been the guilty man - I did not sleep sounder that night than usual - I cannot say how long I had slept - I went to bed very early in the evening - I cannot tell what time, whether it was four, six, eight, or ten o'clock; I went to bed first - I cannot say how long after I went to bed Tyrrell came, but he was in bed before eleven o'clock that night - I was not exactly sober when I went to bed - I was sober when I awoke, quite so - I awoke and found myself sober, between eleven and twelve o'clock - I hear the church clock go every quarter of an hour, when I am in bed - I heard the clock strike twelve; I counted it.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your reason for counting it? A. I asked him what o'clock it was, and he said twelve, and I heard the watchman go twelve, and I could count it - I went to bed very stupid and wished to know the time, and it was before I heard it strike that I asked the time - I heard the clock strike the quarters and I inquired the time - when the quarters went, I said, "What time is it?" and he told me - I went to sleep again - Tyrrell did not leave the bed that night and return early in the morning - I did not awake again till the prisoners came to the door, which was between four and five o'clock - it was daylight, and the Close-gates open at five o'clock - I am certain that Tyrrell did not commit the robbery, on my oath - I drank a little of the gin I got from the prosecutor's; there was such a small quantity - I had never seen Mrs. Childs before; she was an acquaintance of Coverdales's - she made the statement I have told you; - I was offered 10l. to tell of the robbery - the reason I did not tell of it next morning was, because I had been threatened; my reason for telling was, I always said if ever Coverdale was in custody, I would tell of it, and so I did - Coverdale is the only man who threatened me - Tebbutt threatened to knock me down and called me bad names; but Coverdale threatened me more; he threatened my life - I never told the story till Coverdale was locked up - I never heard of any warrant being out against Tyrrell before Coverdale was apprehended - the charge against Tyrrell was for robbing his master; that was the only charge against Tyrrell that I know of.</p>

               <p>Q. How did you get your living while you lived with Tyrrell? A. I am a book-folder and sewer, and got my living by that, I worked with my father, John Horns Baker, a book-binder, 21, Gee-street, Goswell-road; and another gentleman, Mr. Hodson, of Cloth-fair, a bookseller; my father is a binder - when he is not busy, I go out to work - I never had occasion to walk the streets; I do not; I never did in my life; I swear that - I earned sometimes 10s. a week, sometimes 18s. and sometimes 20s. according to the work - I have two rooms of my own which I paid rent for; those were the rooms I was in with Tyrrell - my husband was sleeping with Coverdale at that time - Tyrrell was not placed at the dock at Hatton Garden to my knowledge on this charge; I do not know whether he was or not; I saw him at Hatton Garden alongside the prisoners; I suppose he was placed there on the robbery of his master; on my oath, I do not know that he was placed in the dock on this charge - I was there; I was ordered to be there by a policeman; I was examined as a witness - Tyrrell was in the dock with the prisoners when I was examined on this charge; he was discharged.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was he discharged at that time? A. He was discharged on this, and committed on the other - the magistrate said he was not committed as prisoner at present.</p>

            , and live at No. 14, Brewer-street, Clerkenwell; the prisoner Coverdale, came to my house to lodge on the Saturday before Whit-Sunday - he came to my house from Tyrrell's, between six and seven o'clock in the morning; he lived at Tyrrell's, at that time - he came a little before seven o'clock; he brought a baker's basket with him; I had no reason to know what was in it till I went to Tyrrell's; I did not know what was in it, till Mrs. Tyrrell, who is called Mrs. Day, let me into the robbery; she let me into the fact, that the house had been robbed; she (Mrs. Tyrrell,) produced a tinder box which stood empty in the garden; she used very foul language - I did not oversee the contents of the basket Coverdale brought home - I saw part of the things, but what I saw I cannot state; I saw the table-cloth and some tea in it, some tabacco in a paper, part of a bottle of rum, and one table-cloth; a great coat, with a fur collar, and a buff gown; I went to Tyrrell's lodging that some morning after breakfast, for Coverdale, to tell Tyrrell, (not Coverdale) to come; I found Tebbutt, and Mr. and Mrs. Tyrrell very tipsy - I did not give any message to Tebbutt, further than that Coverdale wanted him; I told Tyrrell, Coverdale wanted him, and Tebbutt went out with him; they both heard what I said; when I got home, the things were taken away - the clock and gown were left, and about half-a-pound of tea - the clock was removed on Monday - I cannot say by whom; the gown was given to me; I pledged it at Walker's, in Goswell-street - I considered it my own; the gown was given to me before I went to Tyrrell's, and heard of the robbery.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you recollect the day of the month you went to Mrs. Day's in the morning? A. It was the day before Whit-Sunday; she was very much in liquor, I could see that - she made use of some foul language - she did not appear at all alarmed when she gave a description of the robbery; when I came to the lodging, I came to enquire on the part of Coverdale, for Tyrrell; (not Tebbutt) I did not say I wanted Tebbutt, nor that Jack wanted him; I was sent for Tyrrell, to say John was waiting in the road, and wanted him - I did not say the property was at my place; I went from Coverdale, to Tyrrell, for him to come into the road to speak to Coverdale, who was waiting; I did not mention where the property was; I returned to my house - I am quite sure I did not carry the message for Tebbutt, to come to my house, nor that the property was at my house; Mrs. Day told me first of the robbery having been committed.</p>

             (policeman G 5). I lodge at No. 55, Whiskin-street, Clerkenwell. I apprehended Tebbutt on the 23rd of November, at No. 13, Paul-street, Finsbury - I afterwards returned to that house, and brought away some stair carpet - I had seen it there when I took him into custody - I afterwards received this clock from Mrs. Denham - Coverdale was taken into custody on the 15th of November in Rosoman-street, Clerkenwell - the prosecutor said it was his - I found Tebbutt in the house; he came down stairs; he told me he lived there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did Tebbutt lend you every assistance to examine the premises? A. His wife did after I took him - there was no difficulty thrown in my way - she opened every door, box, and drawer, about the house - the carpet appeared to be quite worn - it had been on the stairs a long time, and was very much stained - it was nailed down on the stairs - it is quite a common pattern - it exactly fitted the stairs - I should think from the manner in which it was laid down it was done by a person who understood the business; it was properly laid down; there was not the least hesitation made to my taking it away.</p>

            . There is no mark by which I know this carpet; nothing more than the colour, quality, and length - it was taken out of my cupboard, and had never been used nor cut; it is a little more than eight yards - I had bought it to cover my seats about two months before - I know this clock to be mine by the piece of brass broken at the side, and the silk broken down; I propped up the broken brass by two pieces of wood; I seldom take notice of gowns, but I have every reason to believe this is the gown - I have recovered nothing else.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Where did you buy the carpet? A. Of a young man man who visited my house; he is a general dealer; I don't know whether he had any more of it; he might have more of it; he was in a general line of business, there are others of the same pattern no doubt; whether he sold any more to any body else; I cannot tell; I lost two clocks.</p>

            . I keep a Baker's-shop, at No. 29, Lloyd's-row, St. John-street-road. In May and June I was confined by illness; I was totally confined to my bed during those two months - Tebbutt worked for me nearly the whole of those two months as journeyman - I called on him for assistance the first week in May, and he continued to work for me till I got better, which was nearly till the latter end of June - I had no other journeyman; it was necessary for him to be up early in the morning but not late at night; he slept in my house to be ready in the morning; it is usual to commence business about four o'clock in the morning; his wife was also attending me during those months; he slept in the adjoining room to me with my children; one of my children is named Martha; she is twelve years old; the other is Willliam, he is eight years old; it was the habit of his wife to set up with me during the night she laid down occasionally in her clothes, with that exception she attended me night and day; I used generally at four o'clock in the morning to make him hear by knocking at the pannel, provided his wife was asleep, and I did not like to disturb her; the business could not have gone on unless he had been there at that time in the morning; it would be entirely lost; my business was not at all interrupted by his absence till I was able to attend to it myself.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Did you make the bread afterwards? A. It is not exactly bread making; it is in the small way - I bake every day.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember Whit-Sunday? A. Yes; the prisoner slept at my house on the Saturday night before Whit-Sunday; he is hardly ever later home than half-past ten o'clock; generally between half-past nine and ten o'clock - I cannot say whether he was home by ten o'clock on that Saturday night - I think it was after eleven o'clock when he came in - my premises are a mile and a half from Cloth Fair I should consider - I live near Sadler's Wells - he dined with me on Whit-Sunday - I saw him on Sunday at breakfast and dinner; he went out in the afternoon; I remember the Friday before he came home between ten and eleven o'clock on Friday night - he had no room to sit in except the bed-<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183311280008"></xptr>room next to me; I could hear him go to bed; he went to bed on that Friday night a little after eleven o'clock - he had a little bit of supper, and went to bed directly - his wife sat up with me that night; I was very bad that night - I always bake double on Saturday - his wife called him herself that morning, between three and four o'clock; I myself saw him on Friday night; he generally came in to bid me good night, before he went to bed - my business was carried on as usual, and my customers supplied on that Saturday; that could not have been done unless he had attended to the business or found somebody to do it for him - I must have known if he employed anybody to do it for him; I could hear him at work as I laid in bed that morning; I slept in a parlour on one side the shop in which he worked; I had a temporary bedstead put up at the back part of the shop, with a screen for him; he slept in part of the shop; the shop and bedstead, are altogether; there is a screen - he slept in the same bed as the children; the girl of twelve years of age sleeps on one side, and the boy in the middle, he having known them from their infancy; he is a well conducted man; I never heard any harm of him; I employed him several times in my business - he had a home in Paul-street, Finsbury - but my work is very particular early in the morning, and I was fearful of his not coming; I could not employ a journeyman who lived so far off.</p>
               <p>Q. What makes you recollect so many months ago, the hour a man got up? A. My illness made me awake so much; he got up at that time almost every morning; but on Saturday's perhaps half an hour earlier; he came to me the first week in May; I bake muffins; he generally got up between three and four o'clock - I first heard of this offence one day last week; there were lodgers up stairs in the house; none of them are here - I sent for him to No. 13, Paul-street; his wife laid down alongside of me, and the man slept in the bed with the two children; it is a turn-up bedstead with a sort of half-tester; it was only put up temporary; if I had been well the children would have slept with me - the door is open all day; if the lodgers wanted to go out past my hours they take the key of the street-door - I must have heard the door opened if the prisoner had taken the key - my lodgers are all working people and seldom out late; I am certain the prisoner was in my premises between three and four o'clock in the morning of the Saturday before Whit-Sunday, and he had come there at eleven o'clock the night before - I have a recollection of the fact on that particular day; I have not heard it sworn he was elsewhere - he remained at work from between three and four o'clock to a little before dinner, making muffins all that time - we serve several hotels and send them early in the morning; they will have them new; he had his breakfast at his work; he was generally done at dinner, and sit down to dinner - I have lived in the house five years, carrying on the same business - he was never one morning absent from the beginning of May to the end of June - the work was always done; a day never passed without my seeing his face - he came into my bed-room; his wife and the family dined in the room I slept in - I have only two rooms - the muffins were made in the room the prisoner slept in.</p>

            . I know the prisoner Tebbutt and his wife (looking at the carpet) I saw the prisoner purchase some carpet like this, as near as I can recollect, about five months ago, or it may be six months; it was some time in June, I think about the middle - he bought it in Rosemary-lane, of a man; I did not know the man- I had been to Rosemary-lane to buy the bonnet I have now on my head - I was coming back; and on Tower-hill I met the prisoner, and returned with him to Rosemary-lane - he bought two bits of carpet - he gave the man 6s. for the piece which I believe to be this, and 10d. for another piece, which his wife has now got in her possession - I saw the carpet down at his place in Paul-street once; it seemed to me to be the same piece of carpet - I am no relation of his.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What time of the day were you in Rosemary-lane with the prisoner? A. I think about twelve o'clock, or between twelve and one o'clock - I recollect it was on a Wednesday - I don't know Mrs. Bartlett - the prisoner was at work at that time, but I don't know where- I had been to purchase the bonnet and met him; I have known him for years; I had walked very little way with him - the carpet was not bought in a shop, but in the street, of a man who had several pieces on his arm; the prisoner stopped the man - he had told me he was going to buy a carpet - the man was walking along the street, not offering it for sale; it is a place where they sell goods of this sort - I cannot say what time in June this was, but it was on a Wednesday in the beginning of June- I did not go home with him; we parted on Tower-hill, he had got a coat on then - he did not appear clean for the day, he was tidy; he looked clean - he had not a baker's dress on - I think the other piece was a yard and a quarter; the large bit was nearly nine yards; it was not new but very old, the worse for wear - it had been down, for there was the mark of nails in it.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Is it common for persons to sell goods under their arms in Rosemary-lane? A. Yes; it was in June; I am well aware, because there is a fair held where I came from in Northamptonshire, and I went down there on the 24th, and it was a few days before that.</p>

               <p>Q. I am not speaking of the Sunday, but Saturday morning? A. Yes; he dined on that day just before the work was done - we bake on Sunday's.</p>

            , JUN. Not on Whit-Sunday we did not.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What number of lodgers have you at home? A. There is five rooms - the lodgers had an opportunity of seeing the prisoner come from time to time - they generally came in about ten o'clock at night - sometimes they might be out till half-past - there is only one key to the street door - sometimes my mother kept that, and if the lodgers wished to be out she lent it to them - I do not recollect that any lodger had the key between the beginning of May and middle of June - they do not come in at all hours - while mother was ill they generally came in because they would not disturb her - the prisoner had worked for my mother a very little before she was taken ill, (about a month) - we bake every day - he did not leave when he had done work, till between three and four o'clock, because he used to send us round with the muffins to the customers, and used to be home again about five o'clock to tea - I do not know where Rosemary-lane is.</p>
               <p>JURY to MRS. CHILDS. Q. You were sent to New-street, to fetch, a certain party; who was you sent for? A. Tyrrell, not Tebbutt - I was sent between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning - when I went the prisoner Tebbutt was there - it was at eleven o'clock on the Saturday morning - I am positive I saw him there, and they went out together.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did not you state to the question more than once put to you, that when you went to Tyrrell's house for Tebbutt, that Tyrrell and Tebbutt both came out together with you? A. Yes; I sent them to Coverdale - I did not say it was seven o'clock when I went: I said, it was seven o'clock when the things came to my house - it was after breakfast - I was at Mrs. Day's about ten o'clock in the morning - I did not see Tebbutt afterwards with Coverdale - I staid at Mrs. Day's house to hear of the robbery from her - Tyrrell and Tebbutt went out together - I afterwards saw Tebbutt with Coverdale - he drank tea with me and Mrs. Day, and Coverdale, on the Saturday - I heard Mrs. Day make a complaint to the men about only giving Tyrrell 8s. of the money - I heard Mrs. Day in their presence say, she had an offer of money to disclose the robbery - that was in Tebbutt's presence - Tebbutt told her she might do as she pleased, and she said, if it had not been that John was one among them, the Lord help them - Tebbutt flew off rather in a pet, and said he did not wish to have quarrelling - I do not recollect hearing Coverdale saying anything to her in Tebbutt's presence about what Asher had offered respecting the robbery.</p>

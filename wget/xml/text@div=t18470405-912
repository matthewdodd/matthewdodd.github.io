                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">city police-constable,</hi> No. 250.) On the 13th of March, a little after one o'clock in the night, I was passing through Bartlett's-passage, Fetter-lane, I noticed the door at No. 1 open—I sent for Savage—I saw this parcel produced, in a low wall opposite the door—I entered the house, and found the prisoner on the stairs proceeding up to the water-closet door—this carpet-bag laid at his feet—I asked him where he got the property from, meaning the bag and parcel—he said, "From this house"—I asked if he lived there—he said, "Yes"—I aroused the inmates, they came down—I asked them in the prisoner's presence, "If he lived there? "—they said, "No, they knew nothing of him"—I asked, "If they knew anything of the property? "—They said, "NO"—Savage secured the prisoner—I examined the adjoining premises, and at No. 12 I found the owner of the property—a person could pass from the yard-wall of No. 12 to the house No. 1—I found a foot-mark on the white table-cloth, which was close to the bed-room window, on the ground-floor of No. 12—I searched the prisoner at the station—he had two shirts on, white ones, and a flannel one on him, and two waist<lb></lb>coats and apair of white cotton-stockings—he had shoes on his feet—found a pair of shoes at the house No. 1—the prisoner said they were no this, but after<lb></lb>wards owned them—Bawton, one of the inmates, gave me a screw-driver, two skeleton-keys, and a dark-lantern—he is not here—I did not see him find them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Hitchcock—we occupy the houses No. 12 and 13, Bartlett's-buildings. On 12th March, about ten o'clock at night, I went over the house, No. 12, and saw that all the doors and windows were fastened—the staircase window was shut down, but it had no fastening—this brown paper parcel of waistcoating had been brought to the house between seven and eight o'clock that evening, for Mr. Churchill—I re<lb></lb>moved it from one bedroom to another when I went over the house—I saw Mr. Churchill's carpet-bag at that time in a chair at the end of the drawers in the same room that I moved the brown paper parcel into—my husband keeps a lodging-house—the things were in the back parlour—if the window was lifted up a person could not take the things without getting into the room—I put them at the end of the chest of drawers which stand under the window—the constable found the mark on the white table-cloth which was on those drawers</p>

On 12th March I occupied the back parlour of No. 12, Bartlett's-buildings, as a bedroom—I expected a parcel to be forwarded to me there, which was the property of myself and Mr. Smith—I came home about a quarter past twelve that night, and went to bed at a quarter to one—I found the window open—I did not look for the property, not thinking that it would be put in my bedroom—I shut the window down, undressed myself, and went to bed—the parcel produced is our property—I had not seen it on the premises—one shirt, one pair of shoes, stockings, and a waistcoat taken from the prisoner's person, are mine-this is my carpet-bag, I had left it on a chair by the window in the morning—I missed it when I went into the room.</p>

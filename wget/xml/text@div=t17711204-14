I was informed by my apprentice, on the 24th of November, about seven o'clock in the morning, that my house was broke open. I immediately got up; I found my shop was broke open; the door was fastened only with a hasp, which was so slight that it would fall down of itself sometimes by shaking; the shop opens into a back yard, and then there is a wall which a person might get over, by some pantiles that lie there. I found a tinder-box, that usually stood in the kitchen, had been removed from there to the shop, and a rush-light was removed from the shop into the kitchen: my bureau, which stood in the kitchen, was broke open and there were sixteen guineas taken out that were in an iron box in the top of the bureau, and eight shillings was taken out of a little drawer in the bureau; the flap was let down, and there was a tool that I worked with found on the top of the bureau; my great coat, which hung by the side of the bureau, was gone; and the silver spoons were taken out of the beauset, and a table spoon was taken from the cupboard in the kitchen. The window-frame appeared dirty, as if trod upon by some person that got in at the window. I am sure it was fast over night; I was last up in the house over night; I went to bed that night about eleven o'clock.</p>

            . I don't know but it might, the prisoner served his time with me; I suspected him from some circumstances, the tool being found upon the bureau; I had him taken up on Friday in Bishopsgate-street; he was carried to the rotation at White-chapel; he was searched there, and my four spoons were found upon him. ( produced and deposed to by the prosecutor.) I have recovered my great coat again; it was pawned, but the pawnbronot here.</p>

            . On the Friday after this robbery I saw the prisoner in Bishopsgate-street about nine o'clock in the morning; I secured him on suspicion of having committed this fact. I sent for the prosecutor, and he was taken to the rotation office; there he was searched, and these four spoons were found under the knees of his breeches; they were shown to the prosecutor, and he swore they were his property. The justice, after he had examined the prisoner,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177112040009"></xptr> came out and said we shall recover the money and great coat, an officer was sent with the prisoner, which officer returned afterwards and brought an iron box with thirteen guineas.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a miller, and an agent to Mr. William Carpen<lb></lb>ter, who resides at Greenwich. On Thursday afternoon, the 1st of Dec., about three o'clock, I was returning home from collecting orders, and I saw Mr. Carpenter's wagon in the Kent-road—it was standing still opposite the prisoner's house, and the prisoner was standing at his door—Johnson, who was tried here last Session, was the wagoner, and had charge of the wagon—I saw a man whom I did not know, carrying a sack of flour from the wagon to the prisoner's house, and the prisoner was looking on at the time—I saw Johnson beckon with his finger, and the man then crossed the road with the sack of flour—the man went into the house, and Onions followed him, and johnson went in after him—I drove up to the door, and had some conversa<lb></lb>tion with Johnson—in consequence of what passed between him and me, I went down stairs into the bakehouse, and found the flour shot out of the sack into a trough, and the flour that was left by the side—Onions was sweeping it up into the trough—I asked where the ticket was for that sack of flonr—John<lb></lb>son said he had not got one—I said I would not suffer the flour to be left, unless they could produce me the ticket—Johnson said Onions had given an order at the mill for the flour—I said I would have them both into custody, as they could not produce the ticket—Onions said, if I liked to leave the floor, he would pay me for it—I said no, I did not want the money, I would have him—I went up stairs, and sent my boy for a policeman—during that time Onions and Johnson put the flour back into the sack, an I said I would have it pot up again—when I took the wagon back I found in it thirty-two sacks, thirty sacks of flour, and one of meal—a man may make a mistake in the sacks put in, but the person who saw these things put in and checked them is still in our employ—he has not been charged—when a person orders flour, he goes to the counting-house and orders it—if he pays for it he gets a ticket out of the ticket-book—if he does not pay, le has a ticket out of a delivery-book; and when he gets it he signs the other ticket that he has received it—we cut the ticket off at the counting-house, and there is a ticket to ihow what they have—if the ticket is delivered to the wagoner, he takes the proper de<lb></lb>livery-ticket and gets the flour for it, the customer receives it and signs for what he has received—Onions was not at this time a credit customer to Mr. Carpenter—he had been several years ago—the prisoner has been accus<lb></lb>tomed to pay the money at the mill before be has had his goods, and gone to the mill and taken the flour with him in his own cart—Johnson had no autho<lb></lb>rity to deliver flour in this way, which had not been paid for, and, to my knowledge, Onions was perfectly acquainted with this course of business—when a person receives flour, he receives a delivery-ticket, and signs the other part to show that he has received it—Johnson produced, in Onions's presence at Camberwell station, delivery-tickets for thirty sacks of flour and one of meal, as the only tickets he had, except some which had been signed on previous days—when a ready-money customer goes and gives an order at the counting-house, he gets a ticket, and gets the flour, and takes the ticket home with him, and that was what Onions had done—we never allow anything to go without it—this sack had Mr. Carpenter's name on it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say there were property thirty<lb></lb>one sacks in the wagon? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, thirty sacks for one customer, and one sack of meal for Dyer, in the Kent-road—he is a credit customer—the carman assists in loading the wagon—Johnson told me he had brought a sack of flour</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184301020134"></xptr>
               <p>for Mr. Onions—I asked him if he had a ticket—he said yes—in consequence of what he said, I directed him to go into Onions's house—I followed him—if people send us orders, they send the money with their orders, and they send people who belong to them—it is not sent by our carman, unless they send word—if a respectable baker wanted any flour, he would send a post-letter to the mill, and we should give the carman the order to take it, and give him the note with it; but if it were a person to whom we do not give credit, we should send a bill for the amount.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PRENDERGAST</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then, to a respectable person you would credit it, but if you do not give the person credit, you would send a bill for the amount to be paid? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If the prisoner had sent an order, it would not have been sent without the money, unless he had agreed to send the money back by the carman—the prisoner asked me how much it came to, and said he would pay me; and when the policeman came he said he would pay me part of the money, but he had not got quite enough for it all—the carman does occa<lb></lb>sionally receive orders from persons to deliver flour, and receive the money for it—if he meets a man who says, "Send me five sacks of flour, and I will pay you," the carman comes and gives the order at the counting-house, and gets a bill for it and the ticket, and that ticket is delivered to the baker, who pays the money and signs the ticket at his own house when the flour is delivered—the prisoner has not dealt in that way since 1837—our credit business stopped with him at that time.</p>

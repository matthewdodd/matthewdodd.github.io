               <p>Galloway. Q. Did I not come to you, and say, "Is this your petticoat?" and you said "No, mine had a broad hem?" A. No; it was mine she had on at first, but she went and changed it - nothing of mine was found in her room - I have not found any part of the petticoat.</p>

            . On Thursday, the 11th of October, I was cleaning the yard facing the prisoners' door; I live in the same court - the prosecutrix came down stairs, angry, and said, "Look at the front breadth of my petticoat on Galloway;" I turned, and saw she had what appeared a front breadth of a calico petticoat, with a broad hem, and a band, but whose it was I do not know - the prosecutrix went away, leaving the prisoner in her room, and while there she took off the breadth, put on a little bit of plain calico, and said that was the same piece; I said it was not, for the other had a broad hem - she declared it had not, and produced a bit without a hem; I went away till the evening, when the Policeman searched the room, and I searched the prisoner, but nothing was found on her; the prisoners are mother and daughter - I believe the daughter is between thirteen and fourteen years old.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cowkeeper, of No. 7, Oxford Street, Mile End. On Tuesday morning, 7th April, about 3 o'clock, I was on my way home, and met the prisoner, and two other men and a woman, in Thomas Street, Whitechapel; they kept passing and repassing in my path; I asked</p>

               <p>them twice what they wanted, they made no answer, and I called, "Police!" twice—I then felt an arm round my neck—I had seen the man about when he was in front of me, but he had allowed me to pass him—he held me very tight, and the prisoner came and deliberately drew my watch from my pocket, wrenched it from the ring, placed it in his left trowsers pocket, and walked away—I am sure he is the man—I then lost my senses, and when I came to myself I called again for the police, and they came—I had seen the prisoner before about Whitechapel, and was acquainted with his person.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Princes Street, Whitechapel. I was taken into custody, charged with being concerned in this robbery; I was discharged—on 7th April I saw the prisoner come along Whitechapel, and at the cor<lb></lb>ner of Thomas Street, three men laid hold of him; one of them, who I know by sight, put his hands round his neck, and I saw the prisoner stand<lb></lb>ing before him, but could not see what he was doing, or whether he had his hands in Cavalier's pocket, as the prisoner's back was towards me—they ran away, and Cavalier fell down and remained in that state about five minutes; he then got up and called "Police!"—I picked his hat up, and a policeman took me into custody—I told him what I knew about it—I have known the prisoner about three years—he called on me in the House of Detention, when I was remanded, and asked me whether I was going to say anything about it, and I said, "No."</p>

Q.</hi> How long were you kept in custody before you said anything against him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I said at the station house that I should know one of them, and that this was one of them—I was several yards off, with several other young women, when I saw this—I had not seen the prosecutor before on that night; I went up to him after the three had run away; then I picked up the hat, and the prosecutor got up, and hallooed, "Police!"</p>

               <p>five minutes afterwards I heard a cry of "Police!"—I went in the direction, saw the prosecutor, and asked him what was the matter—he told me something, and I followed—as I was returning, I fell in with another constable, who had Hurley and Mr. Cavalier's hat; he took her to the station, and she gave information, which led to the apprehension of the prisoner.</p>

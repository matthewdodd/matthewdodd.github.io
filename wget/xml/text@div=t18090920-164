            . I keep a horse and cart, I attend at the West India docks for the purpose of being employed. On the third of August, Mrs. White applied to me to take up a trunk and different luggage and to carry them in a cart to her house. I received the trunk and luggage from Mrs. White at the Docks into my cart on that day.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know the trunk and luggage belonged to Mr. Robinson - A. He lives with Mrs. White at Poplar, I called at her house and delivered the luggage with another man, he said he believed that was all that belonged to Mrs. White. I drove to another place and unloaded my cart, I found I had a trunk left I did not know who it belonged to, I left the trunk in my cart and went to the docks to enquire. I left the cart in the care of a boy. The prisoner helped me load the cart.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner is an Irishman, did you know him - A. No, he asked me to let him help me load the cart. The prisoner came up to my cart and required of me the payment that Mrs. White had promised him, I took him to the public house and treated him with the share of two pots of beer and bread and cheese, as a reward for his having assisted me. I then came back to my cart, and said, by some means or other I have made a mistake, I have a trunk, I do not know who it belongs to, I got up into the cart threw some hay over the trunk, and then I fell asleep, the trunk was on the side of me and when I awoke I missed the trunk; I received some information, the prisoner came up to me in the course of half an hour, I walked with him up to Mr. Randell, I asked him if that was the person that he saw with the trunk on his shoulder, Randell said yes, the prisoner denied it, I then told the prisoner if he did not tell me where the trunk was or produce it, I would give him in charge of an officer, I sent for an officer he went with the officer and brought back the same trunk that I had in the cart.</p>
               <p>- DAVIS. I am constable, I took charge of the prisoner for stealing a trunk out of Furnish's cart, he denied it, in consequence of my putting him in the watchhouse at last he confessed it, and went with me to a house in the neighbourhood, he went up stairs and fetched the trunk.</p>

            . I belong to the East India docks. On the 3d of August, about ten minutes past four, I saw the prisoner pass me, he had this trunk on his shoulder, when Furnish enquired, I told him what I had seen in the hearing of the prisoner, the prisoner denied it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was employed to carry the trunk, I slipped down, and that is the way the trunk got open, I was told that I should be liberated when the owner of the trunk came and saw there was all the property.</p>

               <p>June, at half-past 1 o'clock in the morning, after midnight, I was coming down Wellington-street, Woolwich, alone—I met the prisoner, she asked me to go home with her—she came in front of me—I told her I was a married man with a large family, and would not have anything at all to say to her—she came in front of me, at the side of me, and I felt a tug at my watch, which was in my waistcoat pocket—she ran away, and I followed her—I kept her in sight but did not come up close to her to catch her—I cried out, "You have got my watch"—she cried out, "Police, murder"—she did not still keep running, she walked pretty quickly—she went through Bedford-street, where I met Elvey—I told him to keep her in chat until I could get a police constable, and I went on for a policeman, and fetched one, and she was given into custody—when I got back to her, Elvey was with her, and she was also in company with three women that she knew—I have never seen my watch since—it was passed when she came up to her companions—that was after leaving her with Elvey.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Was it in Wellington-street? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I met you there first—I was not intoxicated; I had had a few glasses—it is not true that I kept on following you, and that you said if I did not leave off you would call a policeman—I never said that I would say nothing about my watch if you would go to some house with me.</p>

I am a corporal in the military train—I know the pro<lb></lb>secutor—I met him between 1 and 2 o'clock on the night of the 15th, and also the prisoner—I saw them standing together—the prosecutor had hold of the prisoner as if to detain her—he said, "This woman has stolen my watch"—I told him I would detain her while he went after a policeman—I did so; and he went away and came back again in about five minutes with a policeman—no one came up to us while he was gone—there were three females standing within three yards of the prisoner—they were there while the prosecutor was there—they were there when I got up.</p>

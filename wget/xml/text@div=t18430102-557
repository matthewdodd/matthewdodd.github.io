                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable K</hi> 301.) My beat is in the parish of Wan<lb></lb>stead, in Essex. At twelve o'clock, on the night of the 19th of Dec., I heard a dog barking in the direction of South-lane, adjoining Wanstead-park, which belongs to Mr. Boyle—I went there, and stood and listened—I heard a noise in the direction of Blake-hall, which belongs to Mr. Brown, as though some per<lb></lb>sons were bustling in amongst some bushes—I got over the pales, and went on till I came to a wall that runs between the park and Mr. Brown's premises—I could then hear the same noise—I stood by the wall on the park side for half a minute till I heard as though some person was climbing a tree—I jumped on the top of the wall, and saw the prisoner Brooks come within about three yards of me, through some laurel shrubs, on Mr. Brown's premises—he came as though he was on the look-out—he turned his head and saw me, and, went back again through the shrubs—this was at the back front wall of the premises—I then crossed from the first path into the second—(Brooks was then running away from me) and went to a holly-tree, which was amongst some shrubs—I went under the tree, and saw Emmerton on the tree in the act of cutting the holly—(I knew both the prisoners well before)—I found a great many branches cut from the tree—some were tied up in a bundle, pretty nearly as large as a man could carry, and some were loose about under the tree—Emmerton was cutting them either with a knife or a saw—I saw his arm in motion—I said, "Halloo, what do you do here? come down"—he did not speak, but after a time he came down—I caught him by the collar, and we had a long struggle together, for I suppose ten minutes—I said, "It is no use, I know you very well, you had better go with me quietly," and he consented to go to the house with me—I went towards Mr. Brown's house, and when I got him within about twenty yards I met Mr. Brown's servant, who opened a door, and I took Emmerton through the door which led to the gardener's house—when I got him inside I took the handcuffs out, and Em<lb></lb>merton said he would not be handcuffed—I could not do it myself—I charged Mr. Brown's two servants to aid me, and I took him into, custody—</p>

                  </hi>. I am gardener to Mr. William Brown. I was alarmed in the course of that night by the dog barking and the noise of the rattle in the garden—I got up, looked out of the window, and saw the officer with Em<lb></lb>merton in charge—I went down, and let the officer and Emmerton in, and Mr. Brawn's groom—I saw the place where the holly had been cut—it is on the left-hand side of the back front of the house—the tree stands on the border in amongst the plantation—it could be seen from the window of the house—there was as much cut off it as two men could carry—I should say the injury done to the tree would amount to 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it was a large holly tree—it stood about fourteen or fifteen feet high.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long have you been a gardener? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> These last twelve months—I have not had much experience as a gardener—I was a groom before that, but I nad been a gardener before I was a groom—I know about as much of horses as I do of holly—I have not had many hollies to do with in my life—I have planted two or three score—I never bought any.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do not you know, as a gardener, that a holly loses its beauty when it grows up to a height, and is it not straggling and unsightly when it doet not cleave to the ground? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> This tree was in good health—I know the leaves cease to grow at the lower part when a tree grows up high—cutting tree will make it sprout out and become bushy below in the course of time—that is the effect of cutting trees in general—this tree was somewhat cut down—I think the part that remained was damaged to the amount of 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Wanstead. This tree was in my back garden—it was so placed as to be quite exposed to view—the damage done to it is considerable—twenty guineas would not replace it—they have cut down the main stems and main top branches and the leading branches—there were three or four kinds of holly on it—it was from eighteen to twenty feet high—it was a very valuable tree—I believe the prisoners live in the neighbourhood, but I do not know them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I suppose you are speaking as a man of taste as to the value of the tree? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, not its intrinsic value—I could not replace it at any price—the house is my dwelling-house, and is in the middle of the garden—I can walk out of my dining-room to this tree directly, without going through any palings or gate—it belonged to me, and is in my garden—I should say Lord Wellesley has no claim on it whatever—I pay my rent to that family—I have a lease of my premises—I did not plant the tree—I have the use of it, and I suppose I am to leave it to the Wellesley family—I should not feel myself justified in cutting it down—I could not sell it without their consent.</p>

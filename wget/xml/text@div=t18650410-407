                  </hi>. I am a partner in the firm of Board, Son, &amp; Beckwith, distillers, in Bartholomew-close—Parry was in our service as a carman, and Harris was what we call a <hi rend="italic">racker</hi>—he helps to draw off the gin when it is delivered to the customers—he had access to the stock—the pri<lb></lb>soners had no authority to take out goods of any kind without a delivery<lb></lb>note—the delivery-note would show the person to whom the goods were to be delivered—this note (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) relates to goods to be delivered on 21st March—the prisoners were the persons to deliver those, and that was the only parcel of goods they had to deliver—they were for Mr. Brading, of Hoxton—previous to the beginning of the year, we had a customer named Capes—he keeps the Prince of Wales public-house, I think, at Hoxton—</p>

               <p>from information we received, we closed his account—the prisoners had no right to deliver goods to Mr. Capes on 23d March—on that day, the officer Underwood brought Parry and Capes to me—I do not remember the exact words that were used; something to the effect that he had seen Parry take a bottle. into Capes's house—it was a two-gallon bottle, which he then had with him—I asked Parry if he could account for it—he said he did not put the bottle into the van—I said, "But how did you know where to deliver it, "and he made no answer—I have examined the bottle and the contents—there are two gallons of gin in it—the bottle is oars; it bears our brand and seal on it—it is worth 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—we hept half-a-dozen, perhaps, of these bottles filled near the outer warehouse—Harris would have access to them.</p>

On the morning of 23d March, about 10 o'clock, I saw the prisoners at the Sir Robert Peel public-house, at Hoxton; Mr. Brading's—they had delivered a load there; and they then went to the Prince of Wales, Mr. Capes'S, Hyde-place, Hoxton, which is about a quarter of a mile from the other place, and in an opposite direction from Mr. Beckwith's—Parry went into the Prince of Wales, and about a minute afterwards be returned, and Harris handed him a bottle out of the van—he took it into the house, and Harris followed—this is the bottle—I first sent a lad in, who I had with me, and in about two minutes I went in myself—I found Parry talking to the landlord, and Harris standing by; all three together—I asked Parry for the delivery-note and the permit for the bottle that he had just brought in—Parry said, "The landlord has it"—I asked the landlord if that was true—he said he knew nothing of a bottle or a permit; if I had seen one brought in, I had better find it—Parry then went towards the passage at the end of the bar, where the bottle was stand<lb></lb>ing; he attempted to take hold of it, but I prevented him, and took it myself—I then told the prisoners in the landlord's presence that I knew they had no business to deliver a bottle at this house, and that they must go with me to the firm and explain the matter—Parry and the landlord then went with me in a cab to the distillery, and I sent some one else with Harris and the horse and van—after seeing Mr. Beck with, I took them to the station—Capes was not charged at all—I found this order showing that they had delivered the goods at Mr. Brading's; no other delivery-note.</p>

He was to sell and deliver goods to my customers, for me. On my coming to town in July I missed a particular sort of blankets; I could not find them in my warehouse. I enquired of the prisoner where they were; he told me his wife had pawned them; and on my leaving town he gave me a quantity of duplicates. I went home into the country.</p>
               <p>Q. How many duplicates - A. I suppose fifty or sixty. In about three months I came up to town. I continued him in the same situation all the time. I remonstrated with him; he said his wife had pawned them; and after he had promised to put up running shutters to keep his wife out of the warehouse from the blankets I then left town again. These duplicates are all in the wife's name; some

               <p>Q. You do not know whether they were sold or not - A. He told me they were pawned.</p>
               <p>Q. That is the first part. When you came to town did he tell you what had become of the second parcel of blankets - A He wrote that he was obliged to pawn them. I had him taken up. I knew then that he must be accessary to it. I went to the pawnbrokers, and found my blankets; some that were made for the Canada trade.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker, and live in Playhouse-yard, St. Luke's. I received information that some boots and shoes were to be sold at No. 10, Lion and Lamb-court, Playhouse-yard - in consequence of which, I went there on Tuesday night, the 3rd of January, about six o'clock; there are two rooms in the house - I went to the upper room, and found the four prisoners and another man, who was not taken; it is a bed-room - Hambridge was in bed; the others were up, dressed, and having tea<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183202160045"></xptr>- I saw twelve pairs of boots, eight pairs of shoes, and three odd ones on the floor; I told them I had come to look at them for a person they had sent to - I paired them but, and told them they were unsaleable goods, because I had suspicion about them; I said I was placed in an awkward situation, as I was buying for another person - they asked me to bid money for them; I said I would give an answer in five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you speak to, and who spoke to you? A. I cannot name one in particular - they all spoke, the women as well as the men; I cannot say which spoke to me first - Anderson said, "You shall have them at your own price;" the one who is not here said."Not quite at your own price, but you shall have them for very little;" both the women spoke, but what they said I cannot say; I came away, and immediately went to the Police-station, Bunhill-row - they knew nothing of the robbery there, and I went to the Rosamond-street station; I then went to the prosecutor, and received information from him - I immediately went to the house with Busain, the inspector, another Policeman, and the prosecutor's man; the Policeman laid back, and the prosecutor's man knocked at the door - Hambridge came to the door, and asked who was there; I said I had come concerning the boots - she opened the door, and said she believed they were sold; she called Wood down - he said they were not sold; I said I had brought a customer for them - we went into the lower room, and he pulled the boots from under the stairs- the prosecutor's man looked at them; I said, "There were twelve pairs;" Wood said there were but ten pairs, for he had pawned two pairs - I looked them over, and asked the young man if they would do; he hesitated, and then said Yes, they would; I offered Wood 25s. for them(he asked 2l.); he said that was too little, I should have them for 30s. - I immediately went and opened the door; he then said, "Don't keep the door open, you shall have them" - I gave a whistle, and the inspector and officer came in and took Wood, and the boots and shoes; Hambridge was also taken; Anderson and Eaton were not in the house at the time - I had been gone about an hour and a half.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Anderson is not the person with whom you attempted to make the bargain finally? A. No, he was not in the room; I should know the other person if I saw him - he goes by the name of Holley; he has been searched for, and not found - I do not know whether he lived in the house.</p>
               <p>Wood. Q. Was no other man in the house besides what you have named? A. Yes, there was a Jew in the room, looking at the boots and shoes, at the same time when I went up - he lived close by; I knew him well - he was sent for to buy the property, the same as I was; he told me so, in their presence and hearing - nobody fetched me; I received information from my wife that the boots and shoes were to be sold - I offered 1l. for them; Wood said I should have them for 25s. - I had not the money in my possession to offer.</p>

            . I lived servant at this house, which was kept by Humbridge; Anderson lodged there, but nobody else - he had not lodged there a week; I had seen Wood come backwards and forwards, but he did not lodge there - I saw him there almost every day; I do not know whether he slept there - my mistress slept in the lower room; Anderson slept on the first floor - Mrs. Hambridge moved her things up there while her own room was whitewashed, and she slept there at that time; Anderson slept in the same room - I had seen Wood there on Sunday morning and Tuesday; I saw the boots and shoes on the Monday morning, about eight o'clock, in Anderson's room - Wood was in the room at that time, and Anderson and a young man named Holley; he was a friend of Anderson's and Wood's - I only saw him there two or three times.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I believe Hambridge had only come to the house about a week before? A. That was all - I was present when Anderson agreed to pay her 2s. a week for his room; there were two beds in the room - I remember about eight o'clock on Monday morning, going up with Hambridge to light the fire; there were some bundles in the room, which she took notice of; the strange man was in the room at that time - I remember Mrs. Hambridge making a remark about the bundles, but cannot say what it was; to the best of my recollection, she asked what the bundles were.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe the man said they were his, and he was a dealer in Petticoat-lane? A. He might, but I cannot say - Hambridge said she thought they were not honestly come by, and desired they might be moved off her promises instantly.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. She said that to Holley? A. Yes; I never saw any thing in the room till Holley came.</p>

               <p>Anderson's Defence.

I was in the house on Sunday evening, late, and stopped all night, and when the girl came up in the morning, I was in the room; I had not long been out of bed - I had my breakfast between nine and ten o'clock, and left; I returned in the afternoon, between three and four, had tea, and a man came in, who appeared the owner of the boots and shoes - he said he would sell me a pair very cheap; I singled out this pair of boots, and paid him 8s. for them, in their presence - I had my tea, and went out on Monday night, and did not return till Tuesday afternoon; when I came up there were three men in the room, which were Anderson, a man not in custody, and a man who Hardwick calls a Jew; I sat down, had tea, and heard the bargain made with Hardwick; he said he could not deal with him then, but would go out, and give an answer in five minutes, and I believe he sent an answer that he could not deal with them - the man, after some hesitation, got up, went out, and said to me, "If that man should come again, you show him the boots, but do not sell them till I come back;" in about an hour and a half Hardwick returned, and said he thought he had a customer, if I would produce the boots - I produced them- he wanted me to take money for them, and said he would give 1l., but never offered the money, nor do I think he had it in his possession at the time; I told him I would not sell them as they did not belong to me, I would much rather wait till the owner came in - after urging me for five minutes to let him have them for the money, I said I would not, I would rather wait for the owner, who I expected in five or ten minutes; he opened the door, called in a Policeman, and I was taken; while they were searching the house a knock came at the door - I was on the first floor; Busain said to Davey, "Go down, open the door - whoever it is, let them in, and detain them;" he went and opened the door, and the man, seeing an officer, instantly made off, followed by the officer; they could not catch him - he came back, and told Busain a man had been to the door with a green coat and plated buttons, but he could not entice him in; I said the man, most likely, would prove to be the owner of the property - the little girl and Hambridge can prove I paid 8s. for the boots; my own shoes were found in the room, and they were a very old pair - I changed a sovereign to pay for them.</p>
               <p>Hambridge's Defence. I am innocent of knowing they were stolen; Eaton had only come to drink tea at my house.</p>

            . I recollect some bargaining for some boots between Holley and Wood, but I cannot tell what it was about - I heard some conversation about boots, but cannot say what they said.</p>
               <p>Wood. I think it necessary Hardwick's character should be looked into - I understand he is a discharged Policeman.</p>

            . I was nearly two years in the Police - I was not discharged; Busain, my inspector, can speak to my character.</p>
               <p>Wood. Q. Did you not retain money belonging to a witness in the Court? A. Never; nor did I retain a watch belonging to a prisoner.</p>
               <p>Anderson. Hardwick said before the Magistrate that I said, "There they are," not that I might have them at his own price; Heardson said on Saturday, that I said I would not take so much for my bargain, meaning my furs; if you will look at the depositions, that applied to the boots, and not the furs.</p>

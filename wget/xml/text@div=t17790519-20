On the 30th of April I was informed that some lead had been stolen from Mr. Swinton's house, and was at the sign of the Angel; I went and saw it, and knew it to be the lead I had put on the pediment. I measured the pediment and the lead, and compared the screws with which it had been screwed down; I am sure it is Mr. Swinton's property; I saw it on the pediment on the 27th.</p>

               <p>On the 27th of April in the morning, about four o'clock, as I was going my rounds, I met a man with a bag over his shoulder going into his apartment; I asked him what he had there.</p>
               <p>Where is his apartment? - Goswell-street. I asked him what he had there; he said what is that to you. Upon that he threw the bag off his shoulder and ran for it; I pursued and took him. I took the lead to the watch-house and afterwards to Justice Black-borow's;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177905190026"></xptr> and then it was carried to the sign of the Angel where Cockfield saw it. I went and searched the prisoner's apartment and found some more lead.</p>

               <p>On the last Monday was three weeks I went down to Ware in Hertfordshire to see my brother; after I had seen him I came back the same night; coming up between Tottenham High Cross and Stamford Hill Turnpike, I saw a Jack ass and a pair of pads; I went and looked and saw there was nothing in the pads; I went a little farther and saw something that I thought was a man asleep, I went to it and found it was two bags; I kicked it and found it was very heavy; I opened them and found it was lead; I waited a while till a man came up with a team who was going to Dalston; I got him to bring it for me as far as Kingsland turnpike; I then took one bag to my lodging and went and fetched the other, and just as I got home with it this man came and asked me what I had got; I said nothing of any consequence; I supposed it did not belong to him. He opened his coat and pulled out a pistol, which put me in a flurry and I made my escape. He threw his pistol after me and said d - n you. When he took me he called some butchers to assist him, they would not; he pulled his bayonet off and stabbed me three times in the side.</p>
               <p>To Wright. What account did he give of the lead? - He said he found it at Stamford Hill.</p>

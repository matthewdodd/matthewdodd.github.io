On Sunday, the 1st of October, about one o'clock, the prisoner came, and asked if he could have a dinner; he stopped there all the afternoon - he dined with a gentleman named Cornwell, whom I knew - he is a respectable man, and lives in Mary-le-bone-street; they paid the reckoning between them, and Cornwell said if I could accommodate the prisoner with a bed he would tarry all night; he came down before eight o'clock in the morning, and asked for a small bundle, which he had left at the bar - I gave it him, and he took it up-stairs with him - he came down in about a quarter of an hour, and asked what I thought of the morning - I said I thought it would be fine, and went to milk my cows, leaving him at the door; when I returned he was gone; I went after him, in consequence of what my wife stated, but did not overtake him; nobody but him slept in the house, except my wife and child; he had not paid for his bed. I missed my coat, and have not seen it since.</p>

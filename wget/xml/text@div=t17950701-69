               <p>I am a taylor and salesman, in Monmouth-street. This gentleman (the prisoner) I believe it is the same, he came to my house on Saturday as he was taken up with the coat, he told me that a lady had given it to him to sell.</p>
               <p>Q. On what time did he come to your house? - About the middle of the day I think; he asked me a guinea for it, he said that was the price he was to have for it; I told him I would give him seventeen shillings, he was going towards another shop, and I called him back, and told him I would give him eighteen shillings, and if the lady did not like to take eighteen shillings, if he came back again I would return the coat; whether he meant to bring the coat back again with out my calling him I don't know; I did not hear no more of it till Monday; I have got the coat, I gave him eighteen shillings, he left the coat with me; on Monday his wife came, and asked me and one of the servants, whether we had bought such a coat? - I said I had, and she said it was a coat that her husband was intrusted with. (Produced.)</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that is the coat you bought of the man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Frost. It is my property, I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>Palmor. When his wife came she said that she would give me the eighteen shillings to let her have the coat, for the owner had promised that if the coat was brought back she would not hurt him; I said I would not deliver it to her, I would deliver it to the owner myself, and when I took it back to the owner, they said they must not take it in.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That gentlewoman delivered the coat to me to carry over Blackfriars Bridge, and I carried it to the second horse ride ever the bridge, and I delivered it to a gentlewoman that I never see before, nor I never see since; I took it to be a gentlewoman that was maid to the house, or bar-maid, or something; I came back again to Mrs. Munt's, and she paid me a groat for carrying it; about eleven o'clock at night I was going to bed, and the son came and told me that the coat was not delivered; I told him I would go and shew him the place, I went with him at that time of the night, and shewed him the place, and the people were gone to bed, and they took me to the watch-house that night. As to that man (Palmer) I never see him with my eyes to my knowledge, nor this Mr. Frost; I did not sell him no coat, no never; when I was taken to Guildhall the first day, I was remanded back again, thinking I should tell where I had pawned it, or sold it, but I said, I have no other story to tell, nor no other story will I tell.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witness who gave him a good character.</p>

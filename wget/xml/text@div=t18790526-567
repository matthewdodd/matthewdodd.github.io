                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman Y</hi> 197). On the morning of May 12th, at about 12.30, I was on duty at West Hill, Highgate, and went to the back of Mrs. Atkinson's premises, where I saw the prisoner half way in through the back kitchen window—when I got into the area towards the prisoner he withdrew himself from the window and I seized him—we struggled, and he got away and fell down some steps and broke his collar-bone—I pursued him and again seized him, and he resisted—I ultimately secured him and took him to the station—the front gate of Mrs. Atkinson's house I know was locked about 10.15 the previous night—I had some special directions with regard to this matter—I subsequently examined the premises and found a large bar in the garden, and also this hammer (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which belongs to Mrs. Atkinson.</p>

I was cook to Mrs. Atkinson on 12th May—I was the last. person up in the house on the night of the 11th—the house was closed and secured at 10.40—I closed the back kitchen window and fastened the shutters—the bars of the windows were in their places, fastened on the wooden frame of the window—in the morning I found one of the bars taken out—this hammer, I think, was in the greenhouse the night before—I know nothing of the American cloth—it does not belong to us—I never saw the prisoner before I was taken to the station.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. The bars were fastened with screws; I think they were secure—there is a housemaid in the house besides me.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The Prisoner's Defence</hi>. My intention was not to steal, but simply to go in the kitchen. I have seen that lady in the kitchen, and I wanted to go in and eat something. I left Paris only on the 6th April last. I started from Clapham on the morning of the day. I had great difficulty in getting something to eat, because I could not speak to make them understand. I was rather bad off. The little I had was something I had pawned. I certainly did go to the bar, because the bar was rather loose, and presented no difficulty in my pushing it aside.</p>

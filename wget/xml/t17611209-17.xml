The prisoner came to my shop on the 13th of Nov. about five in the evening, and asked to look at some grey and white silk for second mourning. I shewed her some: She said it was for a gentlewoman; and while I was taking directions from her, where to send it, upon my slate, she took a piece under her cardinal, and was got out at the door, and a loose part of the silk fell from under her cloak, and hung down pretty low. I, seeing it, went and brought her back again: There was about a yard of the silk unrolled; she had taken the piece, roller and all. [Produced in court, and deposed to.] She intreated me not to proceed any farther. She could give no account of herself. I took her before justice Fielding, who was very well acquainted with her; there she acknowleged I found the piece upon her. She was committed to New Prison.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the piece to be sent? did she say?</p>
               <p>Holmes. It was to be sent to a gentlewoman at the WhiteBoar, Piccadilly, by 9 or 11 the next morning, for the lady's approbation: She said she had no farther to do than to order it to be sent, and the lady was to pay me for it. [The piece produced in court, and deposed to.]</p>
               <p>Q. How much is there of it?</p>
               <p>Holmes. There is 18 yards of it.</p>

            . I was standing at my own door, opposite Mr. Holmes's, and saw a lady looking at a piece of silk. Presently I saw him standing at the door, taking directions upon a slate; and the lady came out with a piece of silk under her arm, and part of it hung down below her cardinal, and almost touched the ground. I saw Mr. Holmes go and lay hold of the piece of silk and her cardinal, and bring her back into his shop. Then I went over. She begged for mercy; and hoped, as he had not lost any thing, he would not prosecute her, and she would never come into his shop again.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Was the silk unrolled before she took it out?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It was a little way, and was lying on the counter.</p>

               <p>I had some things in a handkerchief, and happened to drink with a friend, and it got into my head, and I was really incapable, and I took it up instead of my handkerchief. I came from Bristol, and have been in town but three weeks. I came to see my husband that is ill, and there is not a friend in the world to do for him but myself: It was not my interest to take it away, but it was a mistake between that and my handkerchief.</p>

               <p>Court. You have got the handkerchief? - Yes; this is my handkerchief (producing it.)</p>
               <p>What is the value? - Ten-pence, or a shilling.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>Did you see him at the time he had got his hand in your pocket? - There was nobody near us but him; I followed him immediately, and called out stop thief; I took him into the Three Tuns Alehouse opposite; I applied to the master of the house to call me a constable, and to his servants; none of them would come to my assistance; upon that a man came in, and said, I saw this man drop the handkerchief, I will call a coach for you if you chuse it. Two coaches came together, and a dispute arose about the coaches just as we had got him to the coach door; I said, I did not mind that, I would pay the expence of both, let the one follow, and the other go with us. Then there came half a dozen men with bludgeons, and cried clear the way, down with him, cut him down; I received several blows, one I feel the effects of now; the first blow fetched me down under the coach wheel; the prisoner got away; I saw him coming up the passage opposite my house, from Guildhall, the Tuesday following, or the Wednesday, as I was standing at my door; I ran up to him, and said, young man you have not reigned long, don't you remember me; he was then in custody of the keeper of a counter for another offence.</p>
               <p>You are sure that was the person you catched? - Yes; I was in company with him to get a constable as much as half an hour; I sat down in the box with him.</p>

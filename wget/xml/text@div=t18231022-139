In consequence of information I went to No. 8, Dock-street, and found her there; I said if she would give me the four sovereigns, I would say nothing about it. She said she had not got a farthing - she threw her pocket at me; there was no money in it. I sent for an officer; they then pressed her to give me my money - she then threw a handkerchief at me, which contained four sovereigns and eight shillings.</p>

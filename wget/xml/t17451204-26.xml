            .) How long have you known the Prisoner at the Bar?</p>
               <p>Sheppard. Ever since the first March that I march'd. I am an <rs id="t17451204-26-viclabel134" type="occupation">Ensign</rs>

               <p>Q. The Man march'd with you in the Train'd-Bands, as a common Man for some House-Keeper?</p>
               <p>Sheppard. On the 10th of October out Militia was out, but before they made their firing, their regular firings, I ask'd them if they were all loaded? There were 36 of them, 12 in a Rank. I ask'd them, if they were loaded? And they said they were not; and then again; and they said they were. I was then almost fronting the Prisoner, but at some Distance from him, I believe six Yards; and a Piece of Paper and Wadding hit against my Coat. With that I examin'd who it was that fir'd: I went down the last Rank, which is the third: I ask'd them all, both Right Hand and Left, if they were loaded? I came up the second Rank, I came up between the Prisoner and this young Man; I ask'd them if they were loaded?</p>
               <p>Q. What is this young Man's Name?</p>
               <p>Sheppard. Stephens. They said they were not loaded. Between the 3d and 4th Time I went to see the rest of my Officers; and then the 4th Time I cry'd, Present and fire, and then I was as you now see me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner, I did not intend any Hurt or Harm to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174512040016"></xptr> Mr. Sheppard. Thing of this Nature has been stold of.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you acquainted with him before; Was there any Quarrel in your Exercise? Did you ever give him any Blows?</p>

               <p>Oak. We made Hat in the Vinegar-Field, and he said, he wish'd that he had taken his Head off, instead of what Hurt he had done to his Eyes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never said such a Word in all my Life.</p>
               <p>Stephens. I stood next to the Prisoner at the Bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he shoot?</p>

               <p>Stephens. I saw him fire, and put his Piece out of the Line. <rs id="t17451204-26-verdict135" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Were you drinking at the Coopers' Arms from eleven o'clock till two? A. No - I was quite sober; Ford's son was not sober - I do not know how the Captain was; I had not been drinking with him - his son fetched me to the Coopers' Arms about eleven o'clock; the Captain was in another room - I was drinking with the son - he did not appear very drunk - he was a little fresh, I and another man drank 4d. worth of gin and water, and part of two pots of beer among three of us - there was a row in the barge - I went to see what it was - I did not know who was in the row - I now understand Mr. Ford's son was in it - I did not know he was on board when I went - the side of the barge is not very high - I was looking over it - I did not spring up - I might have lifted myself up.</p>

               <p>Q. At the time you were there was not the prisoner engaged in fighting with young Ford? A. He was not engaged, for he took my hat off - I did not know Ford was on board then - Captain Ford came on board in a quarter of an hour after I got there - I did not exactly see Bowden's hand take my hat off, but there was nobody there but him, and it was dark in that part of the barge; Bowden was nearest to me - whether he was in the scuffle or not I cannot tell: I seized him by the collar, and was dragged into the barge.</p>
               <p>Q. You would not have been dragged in if you had let go of Bowden? A. No, but if I had let go I should have lost my hat.</p>
               <p>Q. He struggled with you, and after being thrown down on him, blows passed between you? A. Yes, and we were down together again, and I felt I was wounded; the scuffle was done with when I felt I was wounded - it was going on when I felt the first wound, and afterwards; Captain Ford was in the barge when I received the third wound; I do not know where young Ford was - I do not know that I struck the prisoner above once or twice - I will swear I did not strike him ten times - I held him with my left hand, and kept several blows from me with my right; I got the skin chipped off my fingers with stopping his blows; I do not exactly know where I hit him - it might be in the face.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear old Ford say, "Fair play, let me see how my son will fight?" A. No. I went before the Lord Mayor on the Wednesday week following, by myself - I was not able to go before - the prisoner was there when I made my deposition - I was not there when Ford was examined. I never heard the prisoner say, "Oh! Lord, am I to be killed in this manner?" I am quite sure he did not say so.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You had hold of him all the time? A. Yes; if he had said that, it must be so that nobody could hear him.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Was it so dark in the barge that you could not see the persons who were struggling? A. They were not near enough for me to tell who they were - Ford did not take me into custody - he said I must come to the watch-house.</p>

            . My father is commander of a vessel. On the 26th of December, about two o'clock, I went from the Coopers' Arms, with Smith, to go on board our vessel; Smith was sober; I was about half-sens-over; I heard a noise in the barge as I was going down the stairs; I had left Smith behind - he stopped on the stairs for a necessary purpose; I went into the barge to see what was the matter, and as soon as I got in, four or five of them knocked me down; this was inside the barge - when I got up I saw my father come into the barge; I said, "Is that you, father?" he said, Yes; some of them jumped out of the barge - I jumped out, and went to the boat; I cannot say how many persons were in the barge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. If you were not sober, how could you tell whether Smith was so? A. I am certain he was sober - I was neither drunk nor sober; I did not fight any body on board the barge - I struck nobody, I am quite certain.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light enough for you to see your father? A. Yes - I cast my eye up, and saw him; there was not sufficient light to see from one end of the barge to the other - I could see my father, because he came close to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any body else in the barge? A. I saw those who had hold of me - they struck me down, and held me down.</p>
               <p>Q. You never struck anybody yourself? A. I do not know that - I did not strike anybody - I went to the Coopers' Arms about eight o'clock, and had part of four or five pots of beer - I stopped there till my father came, except going out now and then, about ten, to look at the boat - I returned and left for good about two - I had nothing but beer - Smith drank with me part of the time - I did not see him drink with anybody else - I paid for some of the drink - I did not see him pay for any; he had no gin and water in my company; he was not with me till eleven o'clock - I went out between eleven and two - I did not bear my father call for fair play in the barge - he could not have done so while I was in the barge without my hearing him; when the man pulled me to the bottom of the barge I got up again - I never struck him - I collared him - I tried to get away. I went to the barge to see what was the matter.</p>
               <p>MR. QUIN. Q. Was there something going on there<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182801100052"></xptr>before? A. There was scuffling; I was sober enough to know what I was doing; I did nothing before other persons touched me - I could see the persons who held me, but not to know them.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When you use the word "scuffling," do you mean they were contending together, or merely moving about with a little noise? A. No - they did not fight - there was a lark - I cannot say whether the persons on board were men or boys.</p>

            . I am master of the ship Commerce. I left the Coopers' Arms between one and two o'clock on the morning of the 27th of December; I had seen the prosecutor there that evening; I went to the Tower-stairs, to go on board my ship; Captain Allen and I walked down together. I found a barge in the causeway; I went down to my boat before I noticed any thing in the barge; my little boy, being in the boat, said there was a noise in the barge, and I went there; I did not hear the noise till I got there - I heard no cries, but a kind of hustling noise; I tried to get into the barge - I got one leg in first, and got in at last; I first observed two or three people had got hold of my son; as I was getting over the barge he said, "Is that you, father?" I said Yes, and with that all ran out of the barge; my son ran after them. Bowden and Smith were then left in the barge with me - we were the only persons left; I went to take hold of them - they were struggling together, standing up; Bowden with his back against the barge, and Smith before him; I took hold of them, and said I should take them to the watch-house.</p>

               <p>Q. When you said that, did you know what had happened? A. No, I only saw the blood running from Smith's cheek; I took them to the watch-house; I saw Smith's cheek and chin bleeding very much - his clothes were very bloody, all the way down to his feet.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Had you been drinking in company with Smith all the evening? No; there were several masters of vessels in the same parlour - I was not with Smith - I was quite sober when I came out- I had been there from eight o'clock; I had dined there - it was near eight when we had done dinner - it might be five when we began dinner - I did not take particular notice; I was as sober as I am now; Smith and my son went down to the barge first - they were not in my sight - it was a day or two past the full moon, but it was foggy; I did not know Smith was on board the barge until after I got in; my boat was fifteen or sixteen yards off. I was struck by somebody on getting into the barge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you cry out, "Fair play - let me see how my son will fight?" A. I did not, nor any thing of the kind; nothing of the sort was said in my hearing - four of them had got hold of my son - I could not tell whether they were men or boys. I live at Ipswich. I did not hear the prisoner speak till I got hold of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Smith had hold of him, and had got him up by the side? A. Yes; I could not see whether they were striking - they were both standing there; I could see the blood run. Captain Allen had gone on board his own vessel; when I got hold of the prisoner, Smith said, "Will you lend me a hand to hold this man;" I heard Bowden say nothing further, than that he would go with me to the watch-house. I went to the Mansion-house about it that morning; I was brought into the prisoner's presence this day week; the Lord Mayor said my son ought to have been there.</p>

            . I am a constable of Tower Ward. On the night of the 26th of December Ford brought the prisoner and prosecutor to the watch-house, about a quarter-past three o'clock; the prosecutor was completely covered with blood - he said he was cut down in the barge at Tower-stairs: I asked who cut him; he pointed to the prisoner, and said that was the man who cut him, he could take his oath of it; the prisoner's hands were completely covered with blood. I sent for Mr. Hunter, the surgeon, of Mincing-lane; here are the clothes the prosecutor had on.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did the cut on the prosecutor's cheek appear deep? A. It was deep, so that I could almost put my hand into the gash, the lower part of the cheek was so fallen down; the cut on the chin was trifling, and there were several wounds on the back of the head; they appeared to have been made by a sharp instrument; his jacket is cut in two or three places on the breast; it has not been in my possession ever since: but I believe it to be in the same state as when it was brought to the watch-house; there were cuts on the jacket, but I did not take particular notice of them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Whether the cuts had been there for a month you cannot tell? A. I cannot; the front of his jacket was nearly covered with blood; I suppose that was from his face.</p>

            . I am a dresser of St. Thomas' Hospital. Smith was brought there on the morning of the 27th of December; his wounds had then been dressed; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182801100053"></xptr>moved the bandage round his head, saw part of the cut on his cheek, and the wound on the head; that on the cheek was a good deep one, such as a razor would have inflicted - it was done by some very sharp instrument.</p>

            . I am stoker of the York steam-boat, trading from Gravesend to London. I was at the Tower wharf on the night in question; I know the prisoner; he was at the wharf that night, ready to carry the poultry out of the Ostend steam-boat, up to Leadenhall-market; I cannot say whether he was sober; I was not long in the boat - the Ostend did not arrive; and he went on board this barge with more of them; I did not hear them making any noise; I saw Smith and young Mr. Ford come down to the water side; they were intoxicated with liquor - they came there together; I followed them - one of the lads was whistling at the barge, and Ford said to the man who has been cut, "There is somebody on board the barge;" he said, "D - n me, we will go and have a lark;" Ford immediately went into the barge, and when he went in there was a bit of a scuffle; whether they were playing or fighting I cannot say; Smith immediately went into the barge - then the scuffle increased more - whether it was fighting or play I cannot say; I heard nobody cry out that he had lost his hat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Ford's father come down? A. While the other two were in the barge, in about a second, I observed a shortish man come down - how he got into the barge I cannot say, but I observed him in the barge in a short time; I saw him do nothing, but I heard a person cry, "Let him have fair play - I will see whether my son can fight;" I cannot say who said that (I did not see old Ford go into the barge, but I saw him in it); this was said loud enough for any body to hear; there was then a general scuffle altogether; two sea-faring men came on the quay, and entered into the barge, and the scuffle increased still more, and I observed three lads come running up the stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean lads who were in the barge with the prisoner at first? A. Yes; nobody ran after them; I heard the prisoner cry out, "Oh! Lord, am I to be killed?" that was after his companions left the barge - I went down to the barge's gunwale to make peace, but directly I put my hands on the barge, I was struck a violent blow over the eye - I could not see who struck me; I was knocked down and stunned; I got up, put my hand over my eye, and walked home; I afterwards went to Mr. Hobler; my eye was blood-shot with the blow then - it was not black.</p>
               <p>MR. QUIN. Q. Where had you been that evening? A. I was at work down there, at the steam-boat; I had not been in the barge; I had been home to get my meals; I live at No. 2, Blue Anchor-yard, Whitechapel; I was quite sober - I had drank nothing; I was sitting on the waterman's-seat, on the beach, when I first saw Ford and Smith - it is about sixty yards from the river; I had been watching there about an hour, for the arrival of the Ostend boat; they came from Billingsgate way; I saw them come round the post of the plying-place - they were about ten yards from me; I followed them down close, because they were intoxicated; I saw that when they came close to me.</p>
               <p>Q. What induced you to suppose they were intoxicated? A. Because they were reeling about, one up against the other.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to follow them? A. I did not know but they might be going to look for the watchman of the boats; I went to help them, finding him cut - I did not speak to them; I was about two yards from them - they passed quite close - when I went to the barge's gunwale, I saw some one on board the barge; I could see persons all up in one corner, there was Bowden, Cannon, Murgatary, and Kibble on board; I saw them all there; I knew the prisoner before, and knew his voice; I should not know the two sea-faring men if I saw them.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Were Cannon and the others taken before the Lord Mayor? A. Yes, and discharged - I am sure both Ford and the prosecutor were drunk - I saw Smith put his two hands on the gunwale of the barge, and raise his body up, and support his body on his right knee.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any person pull him, or seize him, to compel him to go on board the barge at all? A. No; young Ford jumped up on the gunwale, but how he managed to get in, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you mean to say, they were both equally drunk? A. Yes; they reeled about like drunken men; they were reeling up against one another, both of them - I could see no difference in them - I was eight steps from the barge, when they got into it - I did not see Smith brought out of the barge - I went away directly I was struck.</p>
               <p>MR. HUNTER re-examined. The prosecutor did not appear to me to be intoxicated; if he had been so an hour or two before, I certainly must have observed it; he was reeling about with pain; if I was asked whether he was drunk, I should have said he was not; he did not appear so to me; the intoxication would rather be lessened by the loss of blood. I saw no signs of intoxication.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. At what time in the morning were you called to him? A. The clock struck three, while I was out; he had lost a great deal of blood - I merely looked at his eyes with a candle - I did not smell his breath.</p>
               <p>FRANCIS WARD re-examined. He did not appear to me to have been intoxicated shortly before - I saw him again in the morning; there was no fever, which I should certainly think would have come on, if he had been intoxicated.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Are you a surgeon? A. I am a student in surgery. I have practised for myself; if he had been intoxicated, I should certainly have seen symptoms of it - I first saw him about five o'clock; if a man was in an extreme state of intoxication, he could not have answered me in the correct manner he did - I never knew or read of extreme agitation or suffering bringing a man too in five minutes: fever would certainly have followed the wound if he had been intoxicated.</p>

            . I am the regular watchman of Tower-stairs, and have been so seventeen years, by working for the Newcastle trade. I remember the night this occurence took place - I know the prisoner perfectly well; he and some of his companions, were waiting for the Liverpool steam-packet, to take the poultry out of it to the market.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182801100054"></xptr>Q. Did you that night see Smith and Ford? A. I cannot speak to their persons, but I saw two or three come down, and I was glad to get out of their way, they were kicking up such a riot - I saw them go on board the barge; they had no business there; while they were on board I heard the prisoner call out for help - I heard him say,"Oh! Lord, am I to be killed?" and he said, "What have I done, that I am to be beat in this manner?" there were then three persons beating him on board the barge - I have known the prisoner six or seven years - I do not believe a person can give him a bad character; there might be five or six persons on board the barge.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You knew them all? A. I knew them; there was Cannon, Murgatary, Bowden, one Bull, and Kibble; they were the prisoner's companions, and were waiting for the steam-boat; but two of them act as watermen.</p>

               <p>Q. They must have seen this as well as you? A. They had gone into the barge to sleep - I was not in the barge; I was sitting on the plumber's steps when they passed me; it was a dark morning - I should not know the persons who passed me - I was not eight yards from them; hearing the name of Ford called, I went down to see if I was called; I am sure there were three persons beating the prisoner at the time I left: either two or three went down to the steps; I do not know which; they passed me, but in the riotous way they went by, I was glad to get them past me, because it was not the first time I have been insulted and ill-used at these steps. I did not notice whether there were more than three - I am certain they could not be sober, because they came down in a riotous drunken manner; they were not sober, I am certain.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you go before the Lord Mayor? A. Yes, four times; three of his companions were taken before the Lord Mayor.</p>

            . I am an occasional night-watchman at the Tower-stairs. On the morning this took place, I saw the prisoner and his companions on board the barge; they said they would go there and turn in for a little while.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any thing of the scuffle? A. I was in my watch-box, at the corner of Tower-stairs - I heard a noise, but having sprained my wrist, I was laying down; I heard the cry of "Ford" a number of times, and I thought it was the last witness who was called, or I should have gone out - I went out, and the first thing I saw was, a number of people jumping out of the craft in every direction - I said, "It is a pity, but the police were here, to take charge of you all" - I went to the Tower-dock, and could get no assistance - I then returned, heard a cry of Murder! and different things - I then went and got a light in my lantern - I went to the barge's gunwale, which was as high as my mouth - I locked over, and in the afterpart, was a good deal of straw; a person came to me all in a gore of blood, and said, "For God's sake call the watch; take the man some where, that he may have something done to him;" they had got this poor unfortunate prisoner, and said they would go to the watch-house; he said he would go with them; a tall man, the man who was cut, and another man, stood on the left of me in the barge; they went away altogether to the watch-house, and in a few minutes an officer and patrol came down, and they could find nothing in the barge.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner, and the rest, been quiet and peaceable in the barge? A. They had turned in to sleep there - I have known the prisoner three or four years; he bore a peaceable sober character.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You saw three persons in the barge, one of whom had been cut - did you follow them to the watch-house? A. No - I saw them come out of the barge.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you observe any thing in their conduct, to cause you to believe they were in a great state of intoxication at that time? A. My Lord, they certainly must have been, or they never would have gone over the barge to go to the water - I will not swear they were drunk.</p>
               <p>Q. If they had been reeling about, must you not have observed it? A. No. I should think such a circumstance as that would have brought any man to his senses.</p>

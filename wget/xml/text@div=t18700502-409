                  </hi>. I live at 65, Castle Street East—on the night of 15th April, about 11.20, I was in the act of opening my door, when the prisoner, followed by another man, came up to me and gave me a terrific blow under the jaw, which knocked me down into the doorway—they hustled me up, and stole the key from my watch-chain; I saved my watch and chain—I called "Police!" and they ran away—I followed the prisoner, crying "Stop thief!"—he eventually ran into the constable's arms, in Nassau Street—I have not the slightest doubt about his being the man—I found his hat on my return to the house—he was without a hat when he was brought back—the key was worth 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

On Good Friday evening last, just before 11.30, I was in Union Street—I heard some person shouting "Stop theif!" and saw the prisoner running up Nassau Street—he had no hat on—I stopped him—lie said "All right, I have only given a fellow a punch on the head who hit me"—Hopkins came up without his hat also, and said the prisoner had struck him, and attempted to rob him of his watch—the key was broken off the end of his chain—I took the prisoner to the station, and went back with the prosecutor to 65, Castle Street—I found the pri<lb></lb>soner's hat and the key of the street door about 3ft. from the door.</p>

On the 21st of March, the prisoner and another man came to me and said, he wanted a chaise-cart and harness for the day, to go to Enfield; he was to pay 4s. 6d., for the day, and hired it for that day only, he gave me 3s., and said he had no more change except a 5l. note; I asked him for his direction, he said, his name was Wisden, No. 7, Whitecross-street, St. Luke's, opposite the Two Brewers; he never returned it - I made enquiry at No. 7, Whitecross-street, and could not hear of any such person.

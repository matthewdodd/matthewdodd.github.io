If they should be sold for cash, I shall expect so much of the proceeds, as can be transmitted in Bank of England notes, to be sent in that shape by return of post, and the same rule must apply to any transactions between us. If you should sell the twenty for cash, you may sell the remaining eighty of the hundred for the account; and, on receipt of your letter, advising me of sale, and enclosing remittance for the twenty, I will, by return, forward you scrip certificates for the eighty shares.

                  </hi>. I am the treasurer of the London and South-Western Railway Company. In Nov. last, the Company resolved on the issuing of new scrip, in shares of 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, on which 10 per cent. was to be paid by way of deposit—that was a resolution of the board of directors and of the proprietors—it was in writing—I have one of the genuine new scrip shares here—(<hi rend="italic"> producing it</hi>)—the Company commenced that issue on the 2nd Jan. this year—I cannot say the exact number that have been issued—they are issuing every day—at the time this was discovered, I think the number issued had reached 1021 or 1023—it was just above a thousand—I have seen these eighty scrip, and have had them entered—they are all forgeries—I see the name of "Alfred Morgan, Treasurer," here—it is the course for me, as treasurer, to sign shares issued by the Company—I find the name of Mr. Lacy, and of another director, also forged—none of these scrip bear my genuine signature—the new scrip were required to be signed by two of the directors—there are two directors named, Mr. Charles Lacy, and the Count John Lewis Eyre—he is a count of the Roman empire—I see names on these scrip purporting to be the names of those gentlemen—I do not believe they are the signatures of those directors—they are forgeries—the signing of the new scrip is not confired to any two particular directors—they take it in course—and at that time Mr. Lacy and Count Eyre were the two directors signing—I do not believe these signatures to be theirs—I see there is a decided difference between this water<lb></lb>mark and that on the genuine scrip—it is in the squareness of the letters.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The genuine scrip has a water-mark? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, it consists of the name of "Smith and Ebbs," the printers—I see a very material differ<lb></lb>ence in the shape of the letters—I do not suppose that this is a water-mark—if you will look at the scrip, you will find the letters are straight, in the forged mark, whereas there is a turn in the top of the letters in the genuine water-mark—I have examined the resolution indorsed on the forged scrip, and find that in the word "proportionate, "the letter "o," is omitted—it is spelt correctly in the genuine scrip.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Let us quite understand this; the first thing that issues from the Company is a letter of allotment on an opportunity application for shares? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The first thing is a letter, giving every proprietor an opportunity of applying for his proportion of the new shares about to be created—then comes the letter of allotment which is sent to him in answer to his application—he then goes to the bankers and pays the money, the bankers appending a receipt to his letter—he then goes and signs the deed in London, or elsewhere, and then he brings the letter to the office, with a stamp on it of "D. S.,"meaning "deed signed," and then he has the scrip assigned—that is the process—we call upon the party to exchange the scrip for a certificate of complete registration, im<lb></lb>mediately after the passing of the Act—after the passing of the Act no other document, or security of any kind, is required in exchange for the certificate, except the scrip, nor any other proof of the deposit having been paid—the scrip is never issued till the deposit is paid—Numbers 821 to 870 of genuine scrip had been issued at the time this forgery was discovered, but numbers 1671 to 1680 had not, nor 1701 to 1720—the highest numbers of the forged scrip presented at the office to be examined, had been numbers 821 to 870—if we fail in obtaining the Act of Parliament, we do not require any other document, in order to return the money paid, than the production of the scrip certificate—returning the money would depend on the Act, of course—if the Act was not obtained, I presume we should return the deposits to the pro<lb></lb>prictors, but we have never had a case of the kind—by a proprietor, I mean an owner of scrip—the Company have not determined what shall be done with regard to this scrip, in the event of our not obtaining the Act; because that could not come before them till the Act was rejected.</p>

No. 05,984, dated 7th January, 1847; and a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., No. 26,044, dated 12th January, 1847—the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes were brought into the Bank on the 11th of March—gold was given for the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I cannot say whether it was gold or notes, it merely states here money—it was paid by another clerk, who took the numbers of the notes—it appears in the books as money—a clerk, named Jirningham, paid it—I do not think he is here—he is in the Issue Department—he would not pay the other notes, only the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mr. Haden would pay the 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes—the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes was paid in by Barnett's—the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was brought in on the 11th of March, and the 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the same day—I have no account of how either of the notes were paid—on the front of the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes is written, "Thomas Waddon, Sheffield. Brett's Hotel, Holborn."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">re-examined.</hi> I did not see the prisoner after the discovery of the overpayment till the notes went into the Bank—I then saw him at his office, in Copthall-court—a person named Hartley was not there at the time—I asked the prisoner from whom he had received the four 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes and the seven 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes that were exchanged for the 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes—he mentioned one or two persons names—I asked him who he took them of—he said, rather than he should expose or bring any one into trouble he would give me 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. if I would come to his lodgings—we went out together, to go to his lodgings; as we were going down Moorgate-street, he turned down a pas<lb></lb>sage, and gave me two 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes—he said, that with the two that were detained at the Bank would make the 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—those notes are now in the Bank—they were Nos. 90,316 to 90,320—the two that he gave me were Nos. 90,317 and 90,318, both dated 11th of January—after receiving those two notes, we separated—I saw him again on Monday morning, in the Bank—the Bank clerk asked him how <hi rend="italic">reluctantly</hi> he could give up the other two 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, in the presence of Mr. Hawtley—(with the consent of both of them they</p>

I had overpaid—seven 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes and 5 sovereigns were enclosed in the letter I received on the 16th—I then sent to the prisoner's office, for him to come up—he did not come—Mr. Farmery came—the 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was sent into the Bank—we stopped those notes, and got other notes for them—we kept them both till we could make out who they were to be returned to—on the 22nd of March, I returned 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to the prisoner at the banking-house—he came there—I understood that he was gone into the country for a fortnight or three weeks, to seek for a situation—I told him so, and showed him the letter enclosing the seven 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, and asked him if he knew Mr. Craven—he said no—I said I could not with property give him up the money—he said he would go to his master—he went away, and Farmery and he came there together in about hal-an-hour—I referred him over to Messrs. Stevens, Hansard, and Co.—they went away—then they returned, and Farmery abused me—they walked away—I then sent for West to the office—he came there with another young man, and I gave him a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, with a 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which I had overpaid.</p>

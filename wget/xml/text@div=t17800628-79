               <p>Was you at home on the 7th of June? - I was at home in the afternoon when the mob first assembled; they came three times to my house. The first and second time by the assistance of my neighbours and giving them some money they went off; they came a third time, then they began below and demolished the window frames and wainscoting; then they went up into the one and two pair-of-stairs; they broke down the wainting and the window-frames; and in the second floor they broke up the flooring. They began a little after nine; my neighbours desired me to go off when it began.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am apprentice to Mr. M'Cartney. On the 7th of June, at about half after nine o'clock at night, the prisoner went up into the two-pair-of-stairs room with a piece of staff he had in his hand, he knocked all the windows out, sashes and all; then he knocked out the frames of the windows and pulled down part of the partition and threw it out of the window; he called out as he threw it out, Take care below. Then I came down stairs and left him.</p>
               <p>Was you up stairs with him? - Yes, I followed him up stairs; he went up alone.</p>
               <p>Was he up alone doing all this? - Yes, he was alone. I suppose I was up stairs with him the space of twenty minutes.</p>
               <p>Was there no person there but he and you? - No. And when I came down I left him there.</p>
               <p>Jury. What did you go up stairs for? - I went up to see my master righted, and followed that man up stairs. I had a cockade in my hat, which I wore all day long.</p>
               <p>If you were with him by yourself for twenty minutes, how came you to let him do all this mischief? - I was afraid to speak to him left he should do me a mischief; I do not doubt but if he had thought I was a servant of my master's he would have knocked me down.</p>
               <p>He suffered you to stand and see all he was doing? - Yes, he did not know but I was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178006280189"></xptr> one of the mob, having a cockade in my hat.</p>
               <p>What time did you see him go up? - About half after nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Was there any body else in the house? - Yes, fourteen or fifteen; they were below and in the one-pair-of-stairs, plundering.</p>
               <p>Did Dodd's man go up stairs by himself? - He went in with the mob up one-pair-of-stairs, but he went up to the two-pair-of-stairs by himself.</p>
               <p>Did you know him before? - No, I never saw him before. I saw three or four brewers servants whom I knew very well, but I never saw this man before.</p>
               <p>How soon did you see him afterwards? - I believe I saw him on the Wednesday after in the Artillery-ground. The justices sent for us to see if there were any men there who we knew had pulled down our master's house.</p>
               <p>That was a week after? - Yes, on the 14th of June.</p>
               <p>Did you see the prisoner there? - Yes, there was another person against him at the same time. When I went into the room I said that man was at my master's house.</p>
               <p>Had you heard of any reward at that time for discovering any person? - No, there was no reward offered at that time.</p>
               <p>Yes there was? - I knew nothing of the reward; I do not want any reward, I only wanted to see my master righted. I did it to serve my master.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 13, Charlotte Street, and keep the house—the prisoners were lodgers in that house just upon three months—they had five children, Barbara, the deceased child, was the youngest; Katie, the eldest, is seven years old; Mary Ann, the next, about five years; the next, William, four and a half years; Elizabeth two and a half years; and Barbara about a year—the prisoners used to go out continually of an evening, from 8 or 9 o'clock and return about 1 or 2 in the morning, leaving all the children, and locking them in—I used to hear them cry—I some<lb></lb>times went in—when I did so, I did not see anything in the way of necessaries for them—I saw an empty bottle lying on the bed, and noting else—I never saw the three younger children dressed or clothed, except one night when the female prisoner took the baby out with a hat and cloak—they were not clean, as they lay on the bed they lay in their own soil—on 7th July, the prisoners left home soon after 8 o'clock in the morning and did not return till between 10 and 11 o'clock at night—the witness, Alice Skeltham, fetched me up on that day, and I saw them—there was no food left for them—there were two or three pieces of dry crust, not eatable—I did not see a Mrs. Hyland there that day, no one but Alice Skeltham—she gave the children some food—I did not see them take it—they were in a very emaciated state—they were worse that day than they had been throughout—they had no covering upon them, they laid on the bed naked, no covering at all to speak about—I believe the youngest child had been ill, I heard Mrs. Brooks say so, with measles—I told her she ought to go to the workhouse or hospital, to have necessaries for the children—she said she had been to a hospital, and they would not take them in—on 23rd July, the prisoners left home at 8 o'clock at night and were away all night—Mrs. Brooks came in about 10 o'clock next morning, and Mr. Brooks about 10.13—at that time one of the parish officers had been there, and the police sent for.</p>

               <p>cotton which formed a chemise, and very little covering on the bed, lying in a filthy state; the other two children were crawling about on the floor—I did not perceive that the youngest was lying in its own soil—the room was in confusion, and there were a great many persons going up and down, which might account for the dirt—I called in a policeman, and the children were taken to the workhouse—they were in a starving condition.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What is the extent of the parish? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is a densely populated parish, though not large in area—there are six out-door medical officers, besides the one at the workhouse—if the prisoners had wanted a medical officer sent to them, they would apply to the relieving officer at the workhouse, who immediately grants the order; it is brought to the medical officer, and upon that he visits: if it is a case of urgency it is marked on the order, and he would then visit as soon as possible; if not, ho would visit the same day he received the order, or send his assistant—there is a certain time fixed for the patients to apply for medicine, they would not have long to wait—if they are visited at two they would come about four for the medicine—there has not been so much sickness this summer, it has been rather a favorable one.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 2, Kingsland Road, and am medical officer for the district in which the prisoners lived—I did not receive any instructions to visit them—on 23rd July, between 10 and 11 o'clock in the morning, one of the guardians called upon me and I went to this house, there were several persons in the room—my attention was called particularly to the three youngest children, who were in a very dreadfully filthy and emaciated condition—the youngest was on the bed naked, I think it had a little piece of rag or something or other over it—the prisoners were not there at that time; this was before the constables arrived—I took no further steps, because the parish officers were present, and the children were taken to the workhouse, and would there be under the charge of Mr. Forbes—I examined them, but I could not undertake to say whether there was any internal disease or not—the symptoms of disease were not prominent; it seemed to be chiefly a case of want of food, more especially with the two elder ones—the youngest was in an exceedingly emaciated condition, probably there was disease as well.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am medical officer of the workhouse of St. Leonard, Shoreditch—on 23rd July, the prisoners' five children were brought to the workhouse, and came under my care—the three younger ones were in a very filthy emaciated condition, suffering from measles—the youngest one, a year old, weighed only between 8 and 9 lbs.; the one four and a half years, weighed 11 lbs. 6 ozs.; and the third weighed 12 lbs.—the average weight of a child at birth is 9 or 10 lbs.—they were good sized children, but there was no fat upon them, the bones were protruding from the skin—I attended to the deceased child, and did what I could, but it died on 29th July—I made a post mortem examination—the body was shrunk, and the skin shrivelled, the ribs protruding, the lungs were both inflamed and consolidated—the stomach was small, the intestines thin and opaque, the lower end containing feces—the omentum was shrunk, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186809210020"></xptr>
               <p>there was no fat in the body—the blood was thin and watery, and the brain was slightly congested—the cause of death was inflammation of the lungs and bronchial tubes—deprivation of food, neglect, and filth would accelerate that—judging from the appearance of the body, I came to the conclusion that it did suffer from privation and neglect—I do not attribute the death to measles—the proximate cause of death was inflammation of the lungs, and the want of food accelerated the inflammation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What diet would you recommend for a child suffering from measles? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> New milk for a child of that age, and either flour or bread with it—children of six or seven could take the ordinary diet, meat and nourishing food—these children were scrofulous—that would be in<lb></lb>creased by insufficient food and want of air, and would reduce the condition—none of the children were suffering from rickets; but the child four and a half years old, if left in the same condition in which it was, would certainly have shown that disease very quickly—they had the greatest attention in the workhouse—the present weight of the one of four and a half yean, is 16 lbs., and the one two and a half years, 18 1/4 lbs,—they have had plenty of good nourishing food—they were not suffering from diarrhea; I saw no symptoms of it.</p>

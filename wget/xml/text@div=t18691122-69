                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the service of Mr. John Lloyd, of Upper Thames Street—on Thursday, 21st October, the prisoner Dunn came there with a bundle of silk, similar to this—it was in brown paper—he asked me if he might leave part of it there, and he asked me for a piece of paper to put part of it in—he divided it—I gave him some paper, and he put part of the silk in that, and took the rest away in the brown paper parcel—on the afternoon of Friday, the 22nd, he came again—he asked for what he had left the day before; I gave it to him, and he went away—he came back the same evening about 6 o'clock—a policeman came there, and I heard him tell the policeman that he got it from a man named Wilson.</p>

On the night of the 22nd October I was called to the shop of Mr. Barker, a pawnbroker in High Street, Aldgate—I saw Cole there, and some silk was handed to me by the assistant—I asked Cole how he came in possession of it—he said a man named Dunn gave it to him, and that he was outside the shop—I asked him if he could point him out to me, and he said "Yes"—we went outside, and he said, "Dunn must have stepped it," or words to that effect—he said that Dunn had given it to him to pledge, and he was to earn a shilling by it—that Dunn lived at Hanover Court, Long Acre—that was where they both resided—I took him to the station, and he said that he went with Dunn to Mr. Lloyd's premises, in Upper Thames Street, that afternoon—that he remained outside and Dunn went in and brought the silk out, and asked him to pledge it—I then went to Mr. Lloyd's place and found Dunn there—I asked him if he knew anything about the silk—he said he did—that he had given it to a man to pledge for him, and that it had been given to him by a man named Wilson, who had gone to Dover—I then took him to the station—I showed him the silk, and told him he would be charged with stealing it.</p>

                  </hi> I live in King-street, East-lane, Walworth. On the afternoon of the 19th of Sept. I was in Battersea-fields, in company with George Double and Thomas Ball—I found the prisoner there with a donkey—I bargained with him for a ride for a penny—I had a halfpenny and a half-crown—I gave him the halfpenny into his hand for the half-crown—I took it out of his hand, and gave him the half-crown—he said, "Go on, you shall have your change when you come back, "and he struck the donkey before I got my legs across—he did not follow the donkey—I went a little way down—when I came back, the prisoner was not there, but another man took the donkey—I afterwards saw the prisoner amongst some men and some donkeys—I asked him for my change—he said, "Go on, you d—d liar, you are to have no change; you gave me two halfpence."</p>

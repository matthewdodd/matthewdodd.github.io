               <p>Q. Had he any thing to do in the house? - No; I never see him before. The street door was a jar, and the parlour door stands just by the street door; I was gone across the way, and I saw him as I crossed back again, in the parlour where the watch hung; on that I called out what are you? you have robbed me; he ran out at the door, and I called out to a young man that is in court to stop him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he stopped? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went into the parlour, was the watch there or missing? - It was gone.</p>

               <p>I heard a mob hallooing out stop thief! I went after them to stop the thief; as soon as I got up to him, he threw the watch out of his pocket and knocked it against the wall; I did not pick the watch up, but the woman that lodged with me, gave up the watch to this man that is here, thinking he belonged to the watch.</p>

               <p>I was coming to work about eight o'clock, and I saw Mrs. Lamb, and she told me that a young fellow had robbed her of her watch; so by that I ran after a man that I saw before, and cried out stop thief! before me I came to him, that man, the last witness threw him down; so the prisoner threw the watch away, before<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170105"></xptr>he was down, and there was a woman picked it up, and gave it me; I have got the watch in my pocket.</p>

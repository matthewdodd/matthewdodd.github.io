It appear'd by the Evidence for the King, That the Prisoner being marry'd to the deceased's Sister, while he was at Sea she run him extravagantly in Debt, which he refusing to pay, a Suit of Law commenc'd, and the deceas'd swore the Goods were contracted for by the Prisoner's consent, whereupon a Verdict was obtain'd against him; That thereupon the Prisoner endeavour'd to annul the Marriage, and Process was now depending in Doctors Commons. That on the Day before the Accident happen'd, the Prisoner sent the deceas'd a Letter, wherein he call'd him perjur'd Scoundrel, and threatned to use him as such whenever he met him; That on the 30th of June the deceas'd was standing upon the Steps at <placeName id="t17150713-19-crimeloc90">Doctor Commons</placeName>

This, in substance, was sworn to by several Witnesses. The Prisoner in his Defence said, That he had always taken the greatest care to avoid the deceas'd, and as to the Letter, the Expression of treating him as a perjur'd Scoundrel, had no other reference but to prosecuting him at Law. To prove which, a Witness swore, That the Prisoner had several times sent him to the Commons about his Business, for no other reason but that he did not care to go near where the deceas'd was, who lodg'd by Doctor's Commons ; and that he had often declar'd he would prosecute him for Perjury. There were two Witnesses who swore the deceas'd came to the Prisoner's Lodgings, call'd him very hard Names, and said it was no more sin to kill him than to kill a Dog. Another depos'd, That he heard him say the Prisoner was a Coward, and that he desir'd no better than to try out the Law-Suit by the Sword. A Barber also swore, That the deceas'd said the Prisoner was a Villain to his Wife, and where-ever he met him he'd stab him. As to the Fact, a Witness swore, That the Point of the deceas'd Sword was down but an instant, and he could not say the Wound was not given before. And another depos'd, That he saw the deceas'd laugh in derision at the Prisoner, which he pass'd by with Contempt, but could not tell who struck first. A Third, shew'd how by the position of the Body the Wound might be receiv'd in Defence. There were a great number of Persons of Quality and Honour who gave the Prisoner an extraordinary Character; and the Court suming up the Evidence, the Jury brought him in <rs id="t17150713-19-verdict91" type="verdictDescription">

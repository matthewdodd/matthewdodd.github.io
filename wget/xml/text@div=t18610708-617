I am a boot maker, at 4, Medina-place, and have a shop at 3, Obelisk-buildings—I let the upper part of that house to lodgers—there are servants of mine there, and I sometimes sleep there myself—on the night of the 27th I locked up my shop and saw it quite safe at 11 o'clock—I was called up about 4 next morning—I went to the shop with the officer, and found that the back-parlour window had been broken and opened, an entrance made into the shop, and a quantity of goods taken away—I missed altogether twenty-five pairs of boots—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is one of the pairs; the rest have been delivered up to me, sixteen pairs.</p>

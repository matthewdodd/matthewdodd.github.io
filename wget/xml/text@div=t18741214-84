I live at 29, Charles Street, City Road—on the morning of 19th November I was aroused by a noise—I got up immediately and found the parlour door open, the drawers open and ransacked and things strewed all over the carpet—I missed" some apparel, a little case of shell flowers, and a case with a bird in it; they are my son's property—the street door was open, I think it had been opened by a false key, there was no appearance of violence—I had gone to bed at 10.30 and left the lock quite secure—there is a lamp outside and we draw the blind up to let the light on to the clock, and as I did so I saw two men outside—that was before I went downstairs.</p>

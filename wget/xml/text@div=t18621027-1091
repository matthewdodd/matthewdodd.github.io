                  </hi>. I am a cow-keeper, residing at John-street, Edgeware-road—the prisoner was in my employment—he used to attend to the cows, and a horse or two; he was an odd man about the yard—I had given him notice to leave, a day or two previous to this happening, as he had been very careless in cleaning a set of harness—the day before he was to leave I was at dinner, about a quarter-past 1, and the cowman came and said something to me—I then went into the shed—I noticed that the cow was forward in the stall, lying down—I thought it wanted room to get up—I told the man to untie the chain, and then she could not get up—the hamstring was cut above the hock—we were obliged to have her killed—she was a milch cow; a poor cow, worth about 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,</p>

I suppose there are other men in your employment? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I have a carter—he was out with a team all day—I have also a man who assists in the yard with the prisoner—the cow had not been ailing; it was in good health, and had nothing the matter with it—it could not have slipped down; there was plenty of room behind it—I could not find any sharp instrument—I looke about, but did not see anything—the prisoner had been in my employment about three months—during that time he bore a very good character; I had no fault to find with him—I had a very good character with him, and he was a very good man to work.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in Mr. Bouron's employ, and was so on the day this occurred—I came up that morning to the yard about half-past 3, and remained there till 7—I then left to go to breakfast, and came back about 8—I remained till twenty minutes to 12, and then left—I saw the cow at twenty minutes to 12, and she then had nothing the matter with her—I went to dinner, and returned at twenty minutes to I—when I came back I saw the cow lying on her right side—I went up to her; she got up on her front legs, and blundered on to the top of the manger—I went and called my master, and then came back again—I did not see that she was injured until he came to get her up; then I saw she was cut above the hock with some sharp instrument—she was afterwards killed—the prisoner said, on the 10th, the day before, that he would do the matter an injury before he went away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You say when you went out at twenty minutes to 12 there was nothing the matter with the cow? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I am quite sure of that—it could not have occurred from the cow lying down on some sharp instrument; there was no instrument there—I am quite sure it must have been cut with a knife or some sharp instrument—this occurred on the 11th—I am quite sure that the prisoner said on the 10th that he would do his master an injury before he went away—we were then at work together feeding the cows—we were not talking about anything at the time; only about feeding—I did not say anything about the cow being ill and having a sore place behind—we were talking about feeding the cows and the cattle—it was the business of both of us to be in the shed feeding the cattle—it was between 2 and 3 o'clock—we both fed the cattle—there was only one man in the employment of the prosecutor at that time besides us two.</p>

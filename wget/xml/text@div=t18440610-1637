                  </hi>. I live in Sheffield-street, Clare-market. The pri<lb></lb>soner has been in my employ about eighteen months, to finish learning the business—I sent him for and with bills several times—it was his business to receive money and deliver it to me—this bill of Mrs. Little's is in my writ<lb></lb>ing, and was delivered about twelve months back—I sent the prisoner several times to Mrs. Little's for the money, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he had received, as he told me, 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and brought me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I have received 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of Mrs. Little since he has been taken—1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is still due—this receipt to the bill is in the pri<lb></lb>soner's handwriting.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Abraham Davis, a glass and china<lb></lb>man, in High-street, St. Giles's. The prisoner was his errand-boy for about five weeks. On the 12th of October I watched him while I was shutting up the shop—he was going home, and I saw him about the shop—I went down High-street and watched him, and as I was coming out of a passage he ran up the street—I went to St. Giles's church, came back, and saw him come out of our passage—I said, "You villain, I have caught you now"—he said, "Robert, take them out of my pocket"—I took him back to the house, the constable was sent for, and four salts and a tumbler were found in his pocket—they were my master's property, which had been on the show-board—he had taken them out, and put them in a dust-hole in the passage, and then brought them away—I had missed them before he left—I had found them there, and let him go to it to fetch them—I believe it is his first offence.</p>

               <p>On the 16th of May the prisoner came to work for me, on the 17th at nine o'clock he brought down a pair of shoes he had made, I said, young man this work will not suit me; it being Saturday he desired I would give him one pair more to finish the day, I gave him some other work; after my apprentice came down to dinner, the prisoner came down and asked if his other upper leather was done, and upon that he went up again; about five minutes after that somebody came down stairs, my wife said perhaps it is the young man, sure he has not taken any thing, we went up stairs and missed a pair of sheets, I pursued him, and found upon him a bundle containing two pair of sheets in an apron, two shoemaker's knives, a jacket, waistcoat and handkerchief belonging to the apprentice; he begged I would forgive him, he said it was the first time, I am sure of one of the knives, it was marked, there was no mark on the sheets by which I could know them, I believe the things found upon him to be mine.</p>

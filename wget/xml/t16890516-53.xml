It was further testified also, That Mr. Stoner had no Sword, nor other Weapon. And Mr. Walsingham said before the Surgeon, That if he lived he must pay for the Care; if he died, he must suffer for it, &amp;c. and Mr. Stoner said, That Mr. Walsingham had given him the Wound. The Prisoner said in his defence, That Mr. Stoner and some others persued him in Drury-lane, and gave him very ill Language, calling of him Coward, &amp;c. And that he did not draw his Sword first, and that he pulled him by the hair of the Head, and then fell upon his sword. He called some Evidence, who said that the Deceased was full of Drink, and did not know that he gave him any Affront, only pulled his hair, after Mr. Walsingham had draw his sword in his own Defence. But it further appeared, That he drew upon a Naked Man, which was looked upon by the Court to be a most desperate and wilful Act in the Prisoner, and beneath a Gentleman. So after a distinct Hearing on both sides, the Court directed the Jury to be very careful in their Verdict, and left it to their own Consciences, &amp;c. after which they found him <rs id="t16890516-53-verdict237" type="verdictDescription">

This was confessed by the Prisoner before the King's Coroner, and this was lookt upon to be a grudge between them, because of the precedent Quarrel going to Hide Park. It appeared further, that Mr. Harbin gave the Prisoner very abusive Language, calling him Rogue, and very infamous Titles, and urged him to fight him, This was evidenced by the Witness on the Prisoner's side, how that they quarrelled about the Coach, it was in the Night-time about 10 a clock, and there was wounds on both sides.

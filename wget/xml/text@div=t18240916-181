In consequence of missing money, I marked some sovereigns, half-sovereigns, and silver, amounting to 25 l. and put it into a box on my bed-room table, on the 6th of September, about seven o'clock in the morning. He had no business up stairs. I set Brooks to watch, and about half-past ten o'clock the prisoner was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>HENRY BROOKS. I live next door to Mr. Scott. I concealed myself under his kitchen-stairs to watch about ten o'clock, and about half-past ten o'clock I saw the prisoner come out of the shop, down the kitchen-stairs into the yard, he began whistling very loud; he then came to the back door, and seemed listening; he then pulled off his apron and shoes and made off up stairs, I slipped out of the closet, and stood against the kitchen window. He came down to fetch his shoes from the yard, and I laid hold of him, and fetched an officer who searched him.</p>

            . These sovereigns are mine, and are part of the 25 l., I only missed two. I have a mark on them.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. He had an opportunity of taking them all? - A. Certainly. He was about twelve days in my service.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had he an opportunity of going up stairs twice, and taking a sovereign each time? - A. That is impossible; he came about seven o'clock in the morning; I was in the shop with him all the time, and kept my eye upon him all the morning; he was not out of my sight till he went down stairs, and in five minutes he was taken. My box was not locked.</p>

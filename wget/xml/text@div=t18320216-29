On the 7th of January I had been to Whitechapel hay market, and in consequence of what I heard when I returned, about four o'clock, I went to Allison in my yard, and asked him if he had been to the other stable, and delivered any clover - he said No, he had not been there; I went over to the other stable, and found under the loft door a quantity of clover, which had fallen from the loft, that had not been there before, as he had been delivering out some straw in the morning, and some of that had fallen, and this clover laid on that; I gathered up some of the clover, and went and told him I was convinced there was something wrong, and that I knew the party who had had the clover - he said he knew nothing about it; I sent for an officer, and when he came we sent for Parker out of my tap-room - the officer asked where he got that clover from, which he got out of the yard over the way; he hesitated a few minutes, and then said it was all right, it was a truss of clover he had brought from the watering-house the back-way; there is no back-way to the watering-house - his coat was covered with clover; he said he had carried it to a cart, and put it in Bow-common-lane.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did not Parker offer to show you the cart on which he put it, and tell you he got a draught of porter? A. He said he brought it out for a poor man, and put it on his cart; I did not go with him to see the cart - Allison has been with me eight months; I had a very good opinion of him till latterly - the stable is in a private situation.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You never saw the truss of clover afterwards? A. No - I could not miss one truss from my stock.</p>

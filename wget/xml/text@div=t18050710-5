               <p>Q. Was the chest locked? - A. Yes, and the money was in a bag in that chest; there were thirteen guineas and a half, seventeen dollars, and a great many new shillings and sixpences.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it that you found the chest broke open? - A. Between five and six o'clock on Friday evening, the 24th of May; about three o'clock on that day, she asked me to let her go to her mother's and fetch a bundle; I gave her leave, and told her not to be long gone; while she was gone, I had occasion to go up into that room where she slept: I could not find the key of that room any where; I went into my own room, and I saw her unlock that door with a bundle in her apron; in consequence of information from my niece, I went into the room immediately; I saw the screws of the lock of the chest had been forced; I opened the chest and looked at the bag which contained my money: I found the string put carelessly round the bag, but not tied in the manner which I used to do; as soon as I opened the bag, I knew something had been taken out, I missed ten guineas, two English crowns, two Spanish dollars not stamped, and several shillings and sixpences; I cannot tell how many; I locked the door, and came down stairs, and went after an officer; I came back again and could not get one; as soon as she found that I had discovered the robbery, she went to the front door.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that she discovered it? - A. She seemed very much frightened and was going away without having any tea, and I suspected she was going to her mother, as she put down the pots she was washing of, and went out; I followed her as far as Mr. Whitbread's brewhouse, Chiswell-street; I told her to stop; she asked me what I wanted; I told her, I would tell her when she came back; I told her I had been robbed; she told me, she knew nothing at all about it; at seven o'clock, Mr. Ray, the officer came, he searched her, but found nothing on her that belonged to me; he took her into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Curwood. Q. The box which contained this money was in the prisoner's bed-room? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it locked? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the key kept? - A. In the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any other lodgers in the house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Could not they get the key as well as this girl? - A. If they came into the bar they could; I did not let any of them come into the bar.</p>
               <p>- sworn. - I am assistant to Mr. Ravenhill, linen-draper, Beech-street, Barbican.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoners at the bar? - A. I know them very well by sight; they both came to Mr. Ravenhill's shop, on the 24th of May, in the afternoon, to purchase some check gingham for a gown and a shawl; the younger one paid me for them, she gave me a guinea and I gave her a shilling; they came to twenty shillings exactly.</p>

On the 24th of May, between three and four in the afternoon, they both came in together to take out articles of wearing apparel, which chiefly belonged to the mother, to the amount of about two pounds, the mother gave me a guinea in gold, two Spanish dollars, a seven-shilling piece, and the rest in shillings and sixpences; they tried to pay me without the guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the change that they offered to give you? - A. The mother said she had new shillings and sixpences; there appeared to be four or five new shillings and sixpences together with other silver, but she had not enough.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the articles pledged? - A. A gown, a petticoat, and a shift, which I returned to them.</p>

               <p>Q. How did it appear to have been broken<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180507100009"></xptr>open? - A. By a small chisel, or something of that kind, or a turnscrew.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to have been lately broken open? - A. It did, it appeared quite fresh; I went to the mother's in Golden-lane, in company with the prosecutor and the niece; I searched a box there, and found a number of new articles; I produce them, and a child's bed-gown, which was on a chair-back in the prisoner's room; this turnscrew was delivered to me by the prosecutor, which exactly fitted the mark in the box where it had been wrenched.</p>

               <p>Q. (To the prosecutor.) After they were in custody had you any opportunity of hearing any conversation between them? - A. I had; Mr. Ray took me up to where they were to hearken to their discourse in the Irish language; I understand that language, they could not see me; I saw the mother once; she said to the daughter, I hope you have not owned any thing; the daughter answered, no; that is right, said the mother, stick to what I told you; the daughter said to the mother, have they found any thing upon you; the mother answered, no, they have only found half a crown; if you do not stick to what I told you, they will hang us both; the daughter asked the mother where the rest of the money was; the mother answered, never mind, they have only found half a crown, the rest is safe.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing said about any boy? - A. Yes; the daughter said to the mother, I told you to put those other things away, they will hurt that poor boy; the mother said do not tell where he lives, they cannot hurt him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Curwood. Q. Why all this conversation might have related to any other money as well as your's? - A. It might.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not mean to say that it was your money that they were talking about? - A. I cannot; she was in custody at this time, and it was after her examination.</p>
               <p>Q. (To the prosecutrix.) Look at that bed-gown? - A. It is my little girl's.</p>

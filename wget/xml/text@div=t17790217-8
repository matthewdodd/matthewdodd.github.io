I had occasion to make a purchase for a particular person of a particular sort of stockings. On the 21st of January last I bought two dozen of stockings of Mr. Waller, in the Strand, they were carried by Mr. Waller's servant to my house in Wigmore-street. Having business in the city, I went forward, and these stockings were stolen before I got home.</p>
               <p>Did you make such remarks on them as to know them again? - I know them again very well, I took particular notice of the make and the size. When I came home my servant informed me she had received them into the shop; I saw no more of them till the next day, when I was sent for to Justice Welch's office; they found me out by means of the name of the person I bought them of being written on the wrapper in which they were. I went to the office and saw the stockings, and knew them again. They sent first to Mr. Waller, and one of his apprentices came up to the office and informed them that he had carried them to my house the night before. I bought 24 pair, there were but 22 pair at the office; there had been a pair taken out of each parcel; Justice Cox sealed them up with the office seal, and delivered them to the person who took the prisoners.</p>

               <p>I am one of the patrol in the parish of Bloomsbury. I have 22 pair of stockings; they were sealed up at the office. There had been a burglary committed in the house of Mr. Butcher, in Bloomsbury, I had a suspicion of the prisoner, Dempsey; I went to search his lodging, in the house of a Mr. James, in Dyot-street, between twelve and one in the night; I found all the prisoners in bed, and found the two parcels of stockings in a box under the bed they were in; they said they knew not how the stockings<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177902170006"></xptr> came there; that they were none of their's. When I took them to the magistrate, we found there was a direction on one of the wrappers to the person where the gentleman bought these stockings; the magistrate sent according to the direction, and a gentleman came and said they had been sold to the prosecutor the day before. I went to Mr. Sudlow's, and asked him if he had lost any stockings; he said he had lost two dozen. When he came to the office and saw the stockings, he said, they were the stockings he had bought the day before.</p>
               <p>When you came into this room on another business, on a burglary having been committed in Bloomsbury, and found the prisoners all in bed, did you tell them what you came about? - No; I told Mr. James I wanted to see Dempsey, and Dempsey opened the door.</p>
               <p>Did they appear to be under any apprehensions, or uneasy at your coming? - Yes, they did, I told them they must get up and go along with me.</p>
               <p>Dempsey. After he came in I went out to make water, and came in again; if I had known myself guilty I would not have come in again?</p>
               <p>Atwood. He only went into the shop to make water; the room is on the ground floor. I saw these things under the bed, and followed him and secured him. The shop door was shut, he could not get away; the others were in bed. I ordered them to get up and took them to the watch-house. On the bed I found this black mask (producing it.)</p>
               <p>(The stockings were produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I live at Mr. Sudlow's, who is a hosier and hatter; I serve in the shop when he is out.</p>
               <p>Do you remember any stockings being brought to the shop while he was out? - Yes; on Thursday the 21st of January, between four and five in the afternoon, two dozen of stockings were brought; I put them at the end of the compter; about half an hour after that they were stolen.</p>
               <p>Was you in the shop? - No; I was in the parlour. I had just lit candles in the shop, and went into the parlour, and set a candle on the bureau; I saw the shop door open and a young man came in.</p>
               <p>Was there only one? - Only one.</p>
               <p>What size was the young man that came in? - He was quite a youth; he held up his head as he came in at the door. Woolley was the person; he took the stockings.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen either of the prisoners before this time? - Never.</p>
               <p>You did not know any thing of them? - No.</p>
               <p>How long might this matter be transacting between his opening the door and taking the stockings? - He was not a minute taking the stockings.</p>
               <p>You never saw him but that minute? - No.</p>
               <p>Can you positively swear from seeing him one minute that that person was the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What distance is it from the shop door to the parlour? - About four yards and a half; he had taken up the stockings before I came out of the parlour.</p>
               <p>When you came out of the door and cryed out stop thief! were there any other persons in his company! - Another young man stood at the corner of the shop window; he ran off; Woolley was running when I went to the door; the other seemed to laugh; when I got to the door I cried stop thief! and then they ran.</p>
               <p>Did you make any observation upon that lad to know him again? - Yes; that is the young man in the blue clothes (Dempsey.)</p>
               <p>When did you see him afterwards? - At the office.</p>
               <p>DEMPSEY's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I was employed in turning a wheel for twopence an hour at that time at Mr. Fox's. The room that I lodged in I was to pay twopence a night for, to Mr. James. I came in between eight and nine, and went to bed; this young man was asleep at the time; the key hung up a usual on the outside, in the passage. Between ten and eleven the woman waked me, and asked me to let a young man lie<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177902170007"></xptr> with me, as he was destitute of a lodging; I said, three were too many in a bed, but however he came in. When Mr. Atwood came and knocked at the door; I let him in; he pulled these things out from under the bed; I told him I knew nothing of it; it is a common lodging house, the same as another twopenny lodging house. I never examined what was in the room. I used to go in and outin the morning; I never looked under the bed.</p>
               <p>WOOLLEY's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I never looked under the bed; the door was almost constantly open. It is a common twopenny lodging house. I went to bed of a night directly as I went in; the door was almost always open. Other lads and disorderly women too lay in the house besides me.

               <p>George Rotheram . Last Thursday, as I was going to London, with another Farmer, between Whetstone and Barnet, I was attack'd by two Men. The first that came up I knew: What, Master Thompson, said he, won't you give me the Way! then the Prisoner came up, with a Pistol in his Hand, and said, - What Money you have I will have; so I gave him my Money: You have more, said he; I told him I had no more, and turn'd my Pockets out: Well, you have got a Whip, I'll have that. When they had done with me, I went to the Mitre at Barnet , and sat there an Hour and half; then I was told, that the Prisoner was taken with the Whip upon him. This is the Whip, and 'tis mine.</p>

            . One Mr. Palmer was riding Post, and was attack'd near Mimms-Wash, by two Men. The Post-boy, as he came by, told us Mr. Palmer had been robb'd, and there the two Men went that had robb'd him. I and my Fellow-servant assisted in pursuing them; and on Finchley-Common we saw them, overtook them, and seiz'd them. When I came up to them, the Prisoner pull'd out a Pistol, and said he would shoot me through the Head: I had a long Gun, and told him, If I dy'd, he should die. Upon this he put his Pistol up, and I threw down my Gun, and run in upon the Prisoner, and seiz'd him, and held him till my Assistants come. This Whip he had in his Hand at the same Time.</p>

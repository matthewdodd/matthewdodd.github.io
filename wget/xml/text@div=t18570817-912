I was at the bar of my father's house on 3rd July; I saw the prisoner about a quarter past 11 o'clock in the evening—I served her with a half quartern of gin—which was bad; I broke it, and gave her the pieces back—she gave me another shilling, which was also bad—I called my mother, and gave it her, and she fetched my father, and gave him the shilling he called a constable I had bent the shilling before I gave it to my mother I did not see her give it to my father, but I saw it in my father's hand not a minute afterwards, and he gave it to the constable the constable gave it to me to mark it I found the bend in it when I saw it again I saw a bad shilling taken out of the till that night; it was given to the constable.</p>

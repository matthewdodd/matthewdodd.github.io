The prisoner was employed by me there; I used to leave him to sleep in the house at night - I did so on the night of Thursday the 16th of November, I went away at eleven o'clock at night, and left him in care of the house. I locked the bar, took the key away, and left the articles stated in the indictment in the house. I went there next morning, about ten o'clock, found the house open as usual, but him gone; a person who used to clean the house, slept there, unknown to me, that night; I got in by her means, found the bar open, and missed these things. I found them at Marlborough-street.</p>

            . I am an house agent and appraiser, and live in Bow-street. I was at the prosecutrix's house, on the night of the 16th of November, and left with her, about a quarter past eleven o'clock; the prisoner was left in care of the house. Some wet linen of mine was left there and stolen. I assisted her in closing the house. I returned with her in the morning, and found it robbed. I had closed the bar, and gave 
               <persName id="t18201206-53-person555">Mitchell</persName>
             the key. I gave the prisoner the candle, told him to take care of the house, and rise early in the morning. The prosecutrix had disposed of the house, which was the reason I was there. The prisoner was gone in the morning - the bar was pushed open, and the things in a very different state. I found the looking glass and table at Barnet, in the possession of Thompson.</p>

            . I am an officer of St. Giles's. I got the looking glass, from Thompson at Barnet. I took some persons in charge for the robbery, and on the 17th, the prisoner surrendered himself at the watch-house. On the Monday before I took him to the office, I heard he had written a letter, and asked him for it? he said he had none. Soon after, I heard him tearing something, and snatched the letter out of his hand, directed to Mr. Thompson, Library, Barnet.</p>
               <p>(read.)</p>
               <p>"Sir - I am very sorry this disagreable circumstance has occured. I had paid my fare to Chatham, and was just going off, when I was taken for the things. I have had two private hearings, but they will get nothing out of me, I would sooner be shot! they cannot find that d - d Evans; I am afraid he will tell, where the things are; his wife has been twice to me, and says, that to clear himself, he will tell that you bought them, and to save yourself from any danger, I would send them back to-morrow, by Salmon, and leave them at the Ram, or any where else, so as it is not known where they come from. I have 30 s., which I will give you; only send the table, glass, and blankets, never mind the linen. Do not delay for your own sake; direct to me at St. Giles's watch-house. Hoskins has been, and offered Evans's wife 1 l. to tell where the things are."</p>

            . I was a watchman of High Holborn. The prosecutrix's house is about twenty yards from my beat. I have known the prisoner four years; on the 17th he came to me, as it struck seven o'clock, in the morning, and asked if I knew where there was a coach? he said he wanted to take some things, which his mistress left him in payment of wages - he left me, and returned with a little man, brought these things, and said he was going to take them away. He said,</p>
               <p>"Here is an old cloak, it is of no use to me; I'll make you a present of it." I took it, not thinking that he stole it. About ten o'clock, Gearing's wife called me, and asked if I had not heard of the robbery? I said No, but I saw him with the things, and he gave me a cloak. I saw him again, at nine o'clock that night; he said, he heard there were three taken up on his account, and he was come to clear them - I secured him.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>The prisoner made no defence.</p>

I did not miss the silver mug, but remember I had seen it in my house about three hours before the pawnbroker's man brought it in, and ask'd me if I had lost a mug. I at first said I had not, till he convinced me of it.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Mastern. This was some time in November, I don't justly know the day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Mastern. No, I did not. She was an intire-stranger to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she in your house any time that day?</p>
               <p>Mastern. There was a person much like her, which came in at that time; but I can't swear the prisoner is the same person.</p>

            . This pint mug (producing one) was brought to me to pledge, on or about the 25th of November, by a woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner, do you know her?</p>
               <p>Spires. I do not; I never saw that woman before, and can't say this is she. I stop'd it, and the woman, and charged a constable with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you before the justice with that woman?</p>
               <p>Spires. I was; but it was in the dusk of the evening, and I can't swear this is the person.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is the constable?</p>
               <p>Spires. He is not here.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer of the Customs, and was on board the <hi rend="italic">Mary Ann</hi>, which laid off Union Stairs. On the night of the 10th of Oct. I went to bed in the cabin, and put my watch on the shelf over the bed-place—about half-past one o'clock in the morning I felt something, which I took to be a mouse or rat—I took no further notice of it than just to touch it—it was repeated again, and I did the same—in a quarter of an hour I heard the chain of my watch coming over the sharp edge of the shelf—it was repeated again—I turned round, and grasped the hand of the prisoner, with the watch and chain in it—he instantly dropped it—I immediately called the mate of the vessel—I kept hold of the prisoner till the mate came, and shut the cabin door—(he was sleeping in the steerage, which is between the cabin door and the hold)—the mate brought a light in, and I found the prisoner in the cabin, leaning on his right hand, pre<lb></lb>tending to be asleep, with his cap over his eyes—I came on deck, and called the police.</p>

I went into the cabin, and laid down to sleep; I did not awake till the witness came and took hold of me; he put his hand up to, the bed-place, and took the watch from there. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>.

                  </hi>. I am Inspector of the Thames police. About two o'clock in the morning of the 16th of Oct. there was a call for the police—I found the prisoner in the cabin, in charge of the prosecutor—I found on him a pouch with four lucifer matches, some song-books, and a knife—I asked how he came on board the vessel—he said he got there in a ship's boat—I asked where he was living—he said in the Highway, (meaning Ratcliff-highway)—I asked what part—he said he could not tell me—I produce the watch.</p>

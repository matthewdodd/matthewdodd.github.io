                  </hi>. I am an engineer, and live in Queen-street, Haymarket. I was in Newgate-market on the evening of the 6th of Feb.—I felt a slight shuffling at my pocket—I put my hand into my pocket, and missed my handkerchief, but wheter it was on the ground or not, I can<lb></lb>not tell—I did not miss it till I felt the shuffling—I followed the prisoner, who passed by me at the moment—he was the only one I took notice of—the policeman afterwards showed me my handkerchief—this is it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Do you recollect using your handkerchief previous to missing it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say—I might have used it two or three times in the market—on Saturday night there is a great crowd, but I was out of the crowd—I had suspicion of you because you were passing just at the time, and by your appearance, it struck me you had got it—I did not actually see it in your hand—I saw you pulling your own handkerchief out of your pocket, and wiping your nose with it—I cannot say whether I put my handkerchief into my pocket, or whether it was on the ground, but I missed it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City police-constable</hi>, No. 220.) I saw the prisoner in New<lb></lb>gate-street—he was given into my charge—I told him he was given in charge on suspicion of stealing a handkerchief, and asked him what he had got in his pocket—he said, nothing but his own handkerchief—he put his hand into his right-hand pocket and drew out his own handkerchief—I put my hand into his left pocket, and drew out the handkerchief belonging to the prosecutor—I took the prisoner to the station—I found on him a note in imitation of a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank-note, drawn on the "Bank of Elegance."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did I use any violence? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not the least—you did not give up this handkerchief—you denied having any handkerchief but your own.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I trod on something soft; I stooped, and found it was a handkerchief; I passed through the market with it, and then put it into my pocket; I had not proceeded above a dozen paces when I was accused; I then gave it up.</p>

I received information—I went to the Swan, at Bromley, and found the prisoner standing at the bar—I asked what money he had got—he said, one fourpence, and another he had just laid down to pay for half a pint of beer—I said, "Is that all the money you have got?"—he said, "Yes"—I took him to the station, and found four shillings in a small box in his waistcoat pocket—I then asked him again whether he had got any more money—he said, "No"—I found a half-crown in one of his shoes, and inside his other stocking I found another half-crown—I then asked him whether he knew anything of this medal—he said, no, he never saw it before in his life.</p>

I was called to assist inclearing Cambridge-street—there were about thirty persons assembled oneach side of the road—I saw the prisoner there—I ordered him to move on—he refused to do so, but he did not say anything—he would not move—Itold him again he must move, and I placed my hand on him to induce himto move—some one in the mob called out to him to <hi rend="italic">pitch</hi> into me, and hetamed round and kicked me in the groin—I then struck him with my staff—I felt the effects of the kick for two or three days.</p>

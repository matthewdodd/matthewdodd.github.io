In the same drawer I had two or three steel chains which I had not thought of, I shewed him them; he looked at this chain, (producing a steel one) and asked the price; I told him 18 d. said he, I tell you what, as I did not beat you down in the price of the watch you shall give me the chain in, and besides I shall buy one for my brother, I may be a better customer to you; said I, I will not stand with you for that, you shall have it; said he, I tell you what, put the watch by for me, I did not think of buying a watch when I came out, so have forgot to put some money in my pocket; I took the watch and chain out of his hand, and laid the chain on the board and the watch by it, it had only a catgut string to it; there they lay for some space; he did not speak nor I did not speak; I wanted to go about my business up stairs, I was ashamed to bid him go away, as he said he would come again, I thinking him a customer; he stood close to my elbow; I turned round to go away, thinking he would follow me then to be sure; he did follow me out of my watch-maker's shop into my kitchen, in a little space where I stopped to let him pass by me to go out; at going out he said, Mr. More, be sure you keep the watch for me; yes, yes, said I, you may be sure of it; I then went up stairs, and was gone up I believe about ten minutes; my daughter was cutting bread and butter for tea; when he went out, she rang the bell for me to come down to tea; I came down and stepped into my watch-maker's shop again, there lay the chain upon the board as before, and the watch was gone; I said to my daughter, this rogue has stole the watch; no body had been in the shop but myself and he, and he was the last person out.</p>

               <p>More. That was on the 13th, he came first on the 11th of August; on the 13th he went by the door in another dress; I was in the kitchen, I saw the side of his face, I ran out to see if it was the same man; I said, young man, pray come back, I want to speak with you; said I, you stole the watch, he denied it.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he not name the name of the person where he lived?</p>
               <p>More. No, he did not, I never asked him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say who he worked for?</p>
               <p>More. No, he said it was a dyer that recommended him.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was you up stairs before you came down?</p>
               <p>More. I believe I might be up stairs about ten minutes, much about that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your house-door open?</p>
               <p>More. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you advertise the watch, before or after he was taken?</p>
               <p>More. After he was taken; as he denied having it I thought I might meet with it at some pawnbroker's.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he a watch in his pocket when you stopped him?</p>
               <p>More. He had, which he said he had bargained for with some shop-made.</p>

            . I live with Mr. More, I am his daughter-in-law, my mother keeps a chandler's shop, and I attend it when she is not in the way; I was in the chandler's shop, the prisoner came in and asked me if I sold watches, this was on Thursday the 11th of August; I said, yes, Sir; I rang the bell for my father; the prisoner asked me what my master's name was, I said More; when my father came down the prisoner said, your servant, Mr. More, do you make watches or sell watches; my father went into his shop and said, yes; he came out and asked the prisoner to step backwards with him in the work-shop; my father went in first and he followed him, and I went into the kitchen to cut bread and butter for tea; the shop lies on one side of the kitchen, we go through the kitchen into the shop, I sat opposite the shop-door; I saw my father come out and the prisoner follow him, and went away; my father went up stairs, and came down again in five or ten minutes, it may be more or less I cannot say, I had rang the bell for him to come to tea; I never removed from my seat till I rang the bell, and nobody was in the kitchen but myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether any body could be in the workshop between the time of your father and the prisoner coming out of it, and the time of your father coming down stairs again upon your ringing the bell?</p>
               <p>S. Cope. No, Sir; when my father came down he went into the work-shop as he always does; he came out again, and said the man had stole the watch; I said, I wondered he should come out and leave the man to follow him; he said he could not bid the man go out.</p>

               <p>Q. Is not Mr. More's name over his door?</p>
               <p>S. Cope. There is a board describing his trade, but there is not his name upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. How is the chandler's shop situated?</p>
               <p>S. Cope. That is at the corner of Crown-alley, Moorfields, and no body can go out of the chandler's shop to the shop where the watches are kept without coming through the kitchen, and I sat with my face to the watchmaker's shop-door; they are two different shops, two different houses, the door that goes into the watchmaker's shop is very seldom open, it is generally bolted and locked.</p>

             on the second examination, on the Wednesday after; Mr. More said upon his oath he could not say he stole the watch; Mr. More owned there the young man did tell him where he lived, and that it was at an oil-shop, when he first went to cheapen the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did Mr. More say he said the oil-shop was?</p>
               <p>Resback. He said at an oil shop in Cheapside.</p>
               <p>Edmonds. Mr. More acknowledged the young man told him he worked with Mr. Debarty in Spitalfields.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. More mention what time it was he told him that?</p>
               <p>Edmonds. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Resback. When the young man came home on the Thursday night the 11th about five o'clock, he told me he had been to Mr. More to cheapen a watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say where Mr. More lived?</p>
               <p>Resback. He had asked me whether I had any objection to his going to Mr. More to buy a watch; I asked him how he came to know Mr. More; he said there were golden letters over the door; I said I had no objection, I did not know Mr. More.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you to do about his buying a watch?</p>
               <p>Resback. Because he had a great necessity to buy one; he asked me the name first; I said, I believed the name was More, his name upon a sign, but not in golden letters.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Resback. This was on the Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you say his name was there, or did he tell you so?</p>
               <p>Resback. He did not tell me, I knew it was there; the prisoner was just recovered from a fever, and the apothecary and his friends desired him to take a walk out into Moorfields, and he took a walk frequently two or three times a day.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his character?</p>
               <p>Resback. He has a very deserving character as any man in the world, I never saw the fellow to him, he is a very diligent man; when he came in at the door he said, now I discharge you of calling me up in a morning, for I have bought a watch; I asked him if he had left any earnest for it; he said, no, but he had left word where he lodged.</p>

               <p>Man. No; he came to me on the Saturday and told me how she went, and said he had got money, or at least a line from his father for a watch; I told him he might keep her eight or ten days, and if he liked her we should agree for her; the price I told him was 35 s.

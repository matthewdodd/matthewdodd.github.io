                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman C</hi> 293). I was on duty on Sunday morn<lb></lb>ing the 29th October last in Little Pultney Street, Westminster, when I saw fifteen or twenty persons quarrelling—I requested them to go away—the prisoner was standing close to me, he was one of those quarreling—he turned round to me and said "You b——, I will put a blade into you "—I seized him by the left wrist, feeling the prick of the knife in my left groin—he thrust his left hand against my left groin in this way (<hi rend="italic">describing</hi>)—I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187611200025"></xptr>
               <p>held his hand and took away his knife with the two blades open—he held it very tight and was very violent—I was examined by the surgeon, and was laid up for a week.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner</hi>. You said "You b——, I will put a blade into you," and turned round and deliberately thurst your knife into my groin, through my tunic and great coat. A friend of the prisoner's attempted to rescue him—two more constables came up and his friend was taken to the station and charged with the attempt to rescue him, and was fined 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or a month.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman C</hi> 279). I went to the assistance of the last witness—I saw the knife in the prisoner's hand when the constable took it from him; two blades were open as they are now—I assisted in taking him to the station, he was violent all the way—the last witness said he had a wound through his coat—he had not taken the knife from the prisoner's hand before I came up; he had it in his hand when I came up.</p>

                  </hi>. I am surgeon to the <hi rend="italic">C</hi> division of police—I examined Woodgate on the 25th November and found a wound on the left groin about a quarter of. an inch from the cord of the testicles, not a very deep wound, and after three or four days it healed quite kindly; it was a double incised wound such as might be inflicted by the two blades of that knife produced—there were two holes through the overcoat, tunic, trowsers, and drawers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I didn't intend to stab the constable or make any attempt. It was quite by accident. They twisted my arm behind my back. I did not use violence after they took the knife put of my hand. If they had told me to give up the knife.I should have done. so. I am very sorry for any harm that is done. It is my first offence and I will take care it is my last.</p>

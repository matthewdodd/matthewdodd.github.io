               <p>JAMES ROGERS. I am a pork-butcher, and live at No. 4, Red Lion passage, in the county of Middlesex. On the 5th of last November, between five and six o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to my shop to purchase a lion of pork, which came to 3s. 2d.; he paid me 3s. in silver; before he paid me the 3s., he laid a 1l. note on the counter-while it was on the counter, a neighbour came in, and said he wanted a pound's worth of change, which I gave him, telling him I could spare five or six if he wanted it. During this time, the prisoner took up the 1l. note, and gave me 3s. in silver; he had not produced the 3s. before. After the neighbour was gone, he said<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181712030021"></xptr>his master was a builder, and frequently wanted silver to pay his men. He then went away; in a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes he came again to the shop, in company with another man; Mean, my shopman, was in the shop with me; the prisoner said he had brought some notes, and would thank me for some silver for them, for Mr. Dawson, a builder, in Drake-street. I asked him who it was for, and he said so. Drake-street leads into Red Lion-square. He gave me five 1l. notes - I took and endorsed them, "Dawson, builder, Drake-street; "they appeared clean - I took them, and gave him 5l. worth of silver for them; he put his hand into his pocket, and said,"You may as well give me the other pound," and produced another 1l. note. I endorsed it as before, and gave him the change for it. While he was talking to me, the other man was buying something of my shopman. They then went away; the prisoner was dressed in a flannel jacket. Next morning I discovered that the notes were forged, and informed Mr. Westwood.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards go to a public-house in Field-lane? - A. Yes, to the Thatched House, about eight or ten days after, with Joshua Armstrong, and another officer, and saw the prisoner there with five or six other persons in the same place; I knew him immediately, and pointed him out; he was not dressed then as he is now; (looking at six notes)-these are the notes he paid me-they have my mark on them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was it me or the other man that said he came from Mr. Dawson's - A. I cannot exactly say.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. If that was said by the other person, was it said in the prisoner's presence, so that he must have heard it - A. Yes. The prisoner himself produced the notes, he pulled the first five out of a canvas bag, and the other out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>Mr. REYNOLDS. Q. The first time that the prisoner came he came alone - A. Yes, I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM MEAN. I am shopman to Mr. Rogers. On the 5th of November I remember two persons coming to the shop, I was not there the first time-one of them had on a flannel jacket, and the other a black coat and waistcoat. When they came in, the man in the black coat asked me for some pork, the person in the flannel jacket asked for nothing; he was talking to my master - I saw my master give him some change for some notes, I do not know how much; I heard the man in the flannel jacket ask for another pound, which he had - I saw him lay one note down.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the man who spoke to you say any thing to the other - A. No, they took no notice of each other at all; he said nothing except talking to me about the pork; they both went out together; I have been to Drake-street, Red Lion-square-there is about ten houses in the street, I enquired at three of them, and could not find a Mr. Dawson there.</p>
               <p>BENJAMIN BANKS. I am a tax-gatherer, and live in New Smith-street, Red Lion-square, and have resided in the parish for the last six years; I know every house in Drake-street-there are eleven in all; I know the names of every inhabitant-there is no such person as Dawson living there, there is no builder-there is a Mr. Durston, a blindmaker.</p>

            . I am an officer of Worship-street. On the 18th of November, I went to the Thatched House, in Field-lane, with Gleed and Mr. Rogers; the prisoner was in the tap-room, with other persons; Mr. Rogers pointed him out as the man; I took him into custody, and asked him where he lived, he refused to tell me; I afterwards found that he lived at No. 5, Falcon-court, Shoe-lane, Holborn, opposite St. Andrew's church. In searching his lodgings I found a flannel jacket, which I showed him - I told him where I found it, and asked him if it was his-he said it was - He came willingly with me.</p>
               <p>JAMES ROGERS re-examined. I should think it is the same jacket which he had on - I am sure he mentioned the name of Dawson, it could not be Durston; I asked the question twice, the name was repeated twice.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it repeated each time so that if the prisoner was not the person that spoke he must have heard it-A. It was. I do not recollect the other man speaking to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the other man say any thing to the prisoner-A. Yes, the other man hesitated about taking the other pound's worth of silver, and said he did not think it would be wanted-the prisoner said they might as well have it.</p>

            . I am an inspector of Bank notes in the Bank of England. - (Examining the notes) - They are all six forged; the paper is not bank paper, the plate is not the bank plate, the water-mark is not the bank watermark, nor the signatures the bank signatures; they are all off the same plate-the signatures appear to be of the same hand-writing, though of different names. I went to every house in Drake-street - I could not find any such person having lived there, either as lodger or housekeeper, for a great while before. The names at the bottom of the notes are the names of the signing clerks of the Bank, but not their hand-writing.</p>
               <p>JOSHUA ARMSTRONG re-examined. I searched the prisoner, and found six good notes on him, but no bad ones.</p>
               <p>(Note No. 25,876, dated August 13, 1817, read.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the 5th of November I was in the same public-house that I was taken in; the man whom Rogers describes came in about four o'clock; I had seen him once or twice before at that house - He said he had got a book in Holborn, which had 40l. in it, and said if I would go out with him, and pass the notes, he would put a pound note in my pocket, as he was afraid they would be stopped. I immediately went with him; when we came to the end of Brook-street, he said that was the place where he got the book, for a horse and cart had fallen down; I told him I would change the notes, as I was going to buy a piece of pork; I bought the pork, and gave 3s. for it; I heard the gentleman say he had plenty of change, and I came out and told the man of it; I said I would not go in without him - We went in, he gave me the notes, and said if they asked him where he lived, he shoul say his name was Dawson, and that he lived in Drake-street; when I came out I gave him the silver - I did not know they were forged, but thought they were stolen.</p>

               <p>Q. Your house is much frequented by soldiers? - A. I had two quartered upon me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the articles between ten and eleven, and half past seven? - A. No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner one of the soldiers quartered upon you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When he was taken, was he drunk or sober? - A. I cannot say.</p>

            About-seven, and returned about six in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that he was not very much in liquor? - A. I will not swear any such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear he was perfectly sober? - A. No, I will not.</p>
               <p>Q. You found him up stairs? - A. Yes; he went up to go to bed; it might be about seven o'clock; there is a door that comes out the back way into a stable yard, and he let himself out, I suppose; the tap-room goes out into it.</p>
               <p>Q. He came down again through the tap-room? - A. No, into the tap-room.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons might there be in that tap-room? - A. Only one, the servant.</p>
               <p>Q. Is she here? - A. No; but there is a witness here that was at the bar door when he came down, and saw it.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I was in the bar about half past seven, talking to Mrs. Dargue, the landlady of the house: I was talking with her about half an hour, and the maid came in and said the soldier had got her shawl hanging out of his pocket, and she begged me to go with her, which I did; and I said to him, soldier, have you got any thing belonging to Mr. Dargue about you, and he said, no; Mrs. Dargue told him what a villain he was to rob her; we took him into the top-room, and found the shawl in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing else? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nothing but the shawl? - A. And a coat tucked in the skirt, some how, of his solder's frock.</p>
               <p>Q. What coloured coat was it? - A. A black cloth coat; we sent for an officer, and Mr. Dargue held him till the officer came.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Was the coat and shawl in such situation, in the skirts of his cloaths, that they might be seen by any body? - A. The shawl was, and that made the girl observe it; I was in the yard, I did not see him go through the tap-room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he drunk or sober? - A. I think he was rather more in liquor than he was sober, I must say.</p>
               <p>PATRICK MACMANUS sworn.</p>
               <p>The last witness came to Bow-street for me; I went to the prosecutor's house, and this soldier was in the tap-room, with this bundle in his pocket, sticking out that any body might see it; I don't know whether they had altered it, but it was very visible to be seen.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You say this was visible for any body to see when you went into the tap-room? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner in a drunken situation? - A. He was not sober at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he very drunk? - A. He said very little, but he was certainly in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. You have apprehended many thieves in your time, you know; did it not occur to you that it was strange it should hang out in this visible manner? - A. I said he was a very bad thief indeed.</p>
               <p>Dargue. The coat I will swear to; the shawl I cannot swear to.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. How are you able to swear to the coat? - A. I have had it about half a year.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know you are liable to be mistaken? - A. It has a velvet collar, and I can swear to it by the fringing of the lining: the ends of it are jagged out.</p>
               <p>Q. Another man may have a coat with the ends of the lining jagged out? - A. There were things in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179601130134"></xptr>the pocket that I took out at Bow-street, as Mr. Macmanns knows.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you any doubt that it is your's? - A. None in the world; I am certain sure of it.(It was stated by several persons in Court, that Serjeant Holloway had been attending to give him a character, but was not there at the time of the trial.)</p>

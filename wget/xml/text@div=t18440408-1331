                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable N</hi> 82.) On the night of the 8th of April I was on duty in a booth at Greenwich fair, about eleven o'clock—I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner in company with another man—I saw them try several pockets—the mob was so great I could not get hold of them at the time—I saw them arm<lb></lb>in-arm—I saw the other man pick a gentleman's pocket of this white hand<lb></lb>kerckief—they were both together—the prisoner could see what he did—I saw the other give the handkerchief to the prisoner who put it into his pocket—I secured him, and took it out of his pocket—I found three pairs of gentlemen's gloves on him, two tobacco-boxes, two latch-keys, one door-key, and some money.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Why not take the other man? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I could not, the mob was so great—I could not get to the gentleman—it is a lawn handkerchief, marked "T. F."—I was obliged to have five or six policemen to keep the prisoner—there was about 500 people there, and 50 policemen clearing them out—we could hardly get them out at all—I had my stock torn off my neck.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I have come from Gloucester to look for work; the police<lb></lb>man thrust his hand into my pocket, and pulled out the handkerchief; who put it there I cannot say, I was not aware that it was there; almost every one in the booth were arm-in-arm, resisting the policemen clearing the booth.</p>

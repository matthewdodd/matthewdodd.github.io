               <p>the 7th October, I was in High Street, Bloomsbury, where I met a man whose name I afterwards discovered to be Denney—he made a communica-tion to me, in consequence of which I went after the two prisoners, they were standing at the corner of New Compton Street, against a lamp post—Dacey had, hold of an old man's wrists and was shoving him against the post—he said to Yates "Now then, I am ready, have him "—Yates then went up to him and put his hand in his trouser's pocket—the old man said "If you touch me again I will call' Police'—he put his hands up his waist<lb></lb>coat, and he called "Police "—I took hold of them, and we all struggled together—Riley, 358 came up, and I told them they were charged with an assault—Dacey said "I have not assaulted anyone"—Yates said "Nor have I"—Dacey said "No, nor tried to pick anyone's pocket," and Dacey said "Nor have I"—he had not mentioned about pocket-picking at the time—the other constable took hold of Dacey, who was very violent—I held Yates, but constable 120 came up, and we took them to the station—I am quite sure I saw Yates put his hand in his pocket—Dacey said at the time he had no money, so had not robbed anyone—he was searched, and 6 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was found on him; nothing was found on Yates—in answer to the charge at the station, they said they knew nothing about it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have not seen the man unknown since, he was drunk—one of the prisoners at the police-court asked whether the man would be. called as a witness—he was not told that he could not be called, because he was too drunk—the inspector told him they could not compel a man to come as a witness; we could not find him—the prisoner did not say if a man robbed or struck another he should run away, and he was standing still at the spot—Yates might have been drinking, but was not drunk—his breath smelt of rum—the other prisoner was violent—the man was not hugging the lamp-post, his back was to it.</p>

In consequence of something told me I went to the corner of St. Andrew's Street, High Street, Bloomsbury, where I found the last witness holding the prisoners—they were struggling, and Dacey said he should not go to the station; he had picked no pockets—nothing had been mentioned about picking pockets—the other constable, 320, is not here.</p>

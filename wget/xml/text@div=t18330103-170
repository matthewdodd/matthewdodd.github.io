On the 1st of January I was going down stairs from the shop - my attention was called to an iron-roller, which I had seen safe a few minutes before; it was then about half-past seven o'clock - I went out towards St. Giles's, and overtook the prisoner drawing the roller after him, two or three hundred yards from my masters'; I stopped him, and said I must have it - he said, "Stop a bit, and hear me speak;" I asked what he had to say - he then said a man ordered him to draw it to the top of Tottenham-court-road, and said he would give him 4d.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You never saw the prisoner near your premises? A. No; he refused to give me the roller till the Policeman came up - I did not go to the top of the road to see for the man; the roller had been tied to the railings outside our house.</p>

             (Police-constable E 45). I saw the prisoner and the witness holding the roller - the prisoner said a man told him to take it to the top of Tottenham-court-road; I asked him if he knew the man - he said No, but he had a long coat on.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was he going in the direction of Tottenham-court-road? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>JOHN DALADY. I stopped him by Rathbone-place - he said a man told him to take it from the corner of our shop, which is at the corner of Perry's-place.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was there any thing to prevent him from putting it down, and running off? A. Yes; I would not let him - the officer came up in about five minutes.</p>

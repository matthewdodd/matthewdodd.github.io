                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Hartley, who keeps the Ship tavern, in Upper Mary-le-bone-street. On the 22nd of June, the prisoner came there and called for half a pint of porter—I served her—she put down a shilling—I picked it up and perceived it was bad—I took a pair of pin<lb></lb>cers and broke a small piece off it—she snatched up the other piece and swallowed it—I have the small piece here—(<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—on the 3rd of July she came again—a man came in just before her, and called for half a pint of porter—he then said, "I have got no money, I suppose you will not trust me, will you?"—I said, "No"—he said, "What must I do?"—I said, "I must take the porter back again"—he then gave me a penny—the prisoner then called for three half-penny worth of rum—she put her hand into her pocket and threw down a shilling on the counter—I picked it up and saw it was a bad one—I said to my master, "This woman has come with another bad shilling"—he went for a policeman, and while he was gone the man said to the prisoner, "Go out," and she went out—my master and the policeman came—I told them the prisoner had gone round the first turning—the man still stood there, and he put something into his mouth and swallowed it—this is the shilling which the prisoner gave for the rum—(<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>.)</p>

                  </hi> I am a widow, and live in Wellington-street, Wool<lb></lb>wich. About six o'clock on the evening of the 19th of June, the prisoner came into my shop and asked for change for a half-sovereign—he kept the half-sovereign in his hand till I put the change down, a half-crown, seven shillings, one groat, and two pence; and at the moment he took the change he gave me this token in my hand and went quickly out of the shop—I knocked at the window, but he took no notice; he must have heard me, for he was just opposite the pane—I ran round to go after him, but he had disappeared—I went to the door, and a young man said he was in a closet in a yard—I went and called him to give me the change—he made no answer.</p>

                  </hi> On the 19th of June I was in the kitchen—a man called me up, and said there was something the matter—I went up into the yard, and saw Mrs. Watts asking some one who was in the water-closet to come out and give her her change—I tried the door, it was bolted—I sent for a police<lb></lb>man—the prisoner then reached his band up and said, "Here is the money"—I took it from his hand, and it was the changes Mrs. Watts had given him—he then wanted to come out, but I put my foot against the door, and said, "You would not come out when I wanted you, you shall not now"—the policeman came and took him</p>

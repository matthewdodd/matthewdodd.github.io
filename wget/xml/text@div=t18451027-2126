                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, and have charge of the Temple mills at Lay ton—they are the property of the East London Water Works Company—on Tuesday evening, the 14th Oct., I closed the premises about eleven o'clock—the lead was secure then—about half-past one o'clock in the morning I was called up by Henderson, and, in consequence of what he said, I went to the mill—the front of it abuts on the high road to Hackney—there is a door at each corner, then the mill-house, some cottages, and next to that a stable—on the other side of the mill-house is the river Lea—there is a private road leading to the cottages, but no thoroughfare—at the back of the mill there is a small lean-to, and a window-shutter to it—I unlocked the stable-door on being alarmed, went through the back door of the stable into the back part of the mill, leading to a palisade-fence, and found the shutter at the back of the mill broken open—I saw several pieces of lead lying about in different places—I afterwards found one piece of lead leaning against the palisade-fence—the lead had been taken off the gutter of the mill and mill-house—when it became light I examined the roof with the officers—the lead found appeared to be recently cut—it has since been compared with the roof and it corresponds with what is lost—it supplies the whole quantity taken—I observed that the top of the palisade, about six pales next the corner of the stable, had the tenter-hooks drawn out where the lead laid—the north door of the mill was unbolted—I had left it bolted—the shutters had been removed for the parties to escape down the marsh—the gutter is at the back part of the mill—there were footmarks all about.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman N</hi> 140.) I am stationed at Waltham-stow—the palisade-fence and the mill is in my beat—between one and two o'clock on the morning of the 15th Oct. I was on the high road and</p>

               <p>saw the prisoner three yards inside the fence, which is about six feet high, with tenter-hooks at the top—I went towards the place—he came over the fence immediately, and I took him into custody—I asked what he had been doing there—he said he was only easing himself—I found no appearance of that—I called Bird up, and then went to the mill—Bird found the lead about the place—one piece was within three yards of where I found the prisoner—I saw nobody on the premises but him—there were eleven pieces of lead found—he came over the fence, but not at the place where the hooks were moved.</p>

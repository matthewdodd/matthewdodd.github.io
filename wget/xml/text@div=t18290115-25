On the 30th of December the prisoner came and asked to look at some boots; I went out, and left my wife to serve - I returned in ten minutes; she had bought one pair, and was paying for them - I saw her take a pair from the back of a chair; I let her go out and then followed, and took them from under her cloak - she said she took them by mistake; another person had come in with her, and was sitting by her at the time - I understand the prisoner made the purchase; it was about seven o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Who else was in the shop? A. A shopman cleaning a pair of boots; my wife was about a yard and a half from her - she had a bundle; the boots hung over her arm under her cloak -she was about four yards from my door when I took her; she might be looking at some things in the window - the officer took both pairs of boots from her; the 5s. which she had paid were not returned.</p>
               <p>BENJAMIN WEBB. I am an officer. I produce the boots; I found 13s. on the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The gentleman came in - I laid down a bundle, and took up the shoes with the bundle; my sister was with me - she was in a great deal of trouble; when I got out I stood at his window - he came and said"You have a pair of shoes more than you ought to have?" I said "I have not," but I looked down, and said "Yes, I have;" I went back and begged his pardon - I had no intention of robbing him.</p>

Yes; I chose the pattern sometime about the the 14th of September; I ordered sarsnet and persian for a pelisse; I bought it of Mr. Walker, and paid him for it; I think I paid him about three pounds seven shillings. This is it; this is the persian, and that is the sarsnet.</p>

               <p>Q. The prisoner was with you last December - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that silk which Mrs. Chase has produced, and tell us whether that is part of your property - A. I will swear that I bought this of Mr. Lesuse, of Spital fields; I am satisfied that is part of my property; the persian I am not certain of; the sarsnet is mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner entrusted to sell goods and to receive the money for the house - A. Certainly, and to bring it to account.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he brought to account three pounds seven shillings, or any other sum for that article - A. I believe not; I have examined the books with very great care; the cash book I have brought here, in that book it should have been entered; it was his duty to bring it to account, and saw it so done.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Might it not happen that a person might bring the money into your till, nevertheless omit to make the entry in your book - A. He might so, but that would be found out and corrected at the end of the week; the cash book is settled every week.</p>
               <p>Q. That is provided there was no error in casting up the accounts - A. That is almost impracticable, if you were to see the books.</p>
               <p>Q. Have they not been found frequently to disagree - A. They have.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you state upon your oath, that the sarsnet of the pelisse, that that is what you had in your possession - A I cannot swear it, but I have no doubt it is mine.</p>

               <p>Q. Can you positively say that remnant was in your house, December 1807 - A. I can, I have no doubt I had it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lesuse. I have looked at the pelisse; I have no doubt that the pelisse was made of part of that which Mr. Plowman has produced, is the remainder; it has a particular selvage; it might be imitated, but I could discover it.</p>

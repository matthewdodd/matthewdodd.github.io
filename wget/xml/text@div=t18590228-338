                  </hi>. I am porter to Messrs. Den and Co., of 146, Cheapside—Mr. Charles Weatherley, one of the partners, occupies the house—in February last, about half-past 7 in the morning, I saw the prisoner at the top of the kitchen stairs with a bundle under his arm, done up in a pocket handkerchief—(the kitchen is on the first floor)—I caught hold of him, and said, "What do you do here?"—he replied in a foreign language which I could not understand, dropped the bundle and ran away—I followed him into Wood-street—a man stopped him, and a policeman took</p>

               <p>him in custody and brought him back to the house—the policeman picked up the spoons and forks on the stairs, in a bundle, which was untied—we were taking in coals; the door had been left open for that purpose—I have no doubt about the prisoner being the man—these are the spoons, I know them by the "W" on them—the handkerchief does not belong to anybody in the house.</p>

               <p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. Did you ever say one word about that before to-day? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I said so to the Lord Mayor—I have never said that I was pretty sore, but that there might be a mistake—I have seen that person (<hi rend="italic">A French woman brought forward</hi>)—she came to my master's place with her friends, and told me that it was her husband who was in custody, and that she was a respectable honest woman—she named some Mends who knew her, that I might satisfy myself that he was a decent man and no thief—I did not say, "Well, I am sure I thought he was the man, but I must be mistaken."</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. THOMPSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did she come to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> One day last week—I did not speak to her much, but a young man who was with her spoke French—I have a perfect recollection of what passed.</p>

On 14th February, between 7 and 8 o'clock in the morning, I was in Cheapside—heard a cry of "Stop thief!" and saw the prisoner running down Gutter-lane, followed by Baker—I ran after him—he was stopped by somebody in Wood-street, when Baker was three or four yards from him—I could not understand what he said, he spoke in a foreign language, French I think—my brother officer picked up the bundle, and I took the prisoner back to Mr. Weatherley's—and then to the station—I searched him—he had no handkerchief—he refused his address, but I found by his pocket-book, that it was 35, First-street, Soho.</p>

                  </hi>. I am London manager to Barnard, Bishop, and Barnard, of <hi rend="italic">95</hi>, Queen Victoria Street—on 25th May the prisoner called and said "I am well known to the firm; I know Mr. Alfred Barnard, and I want to take some goods to show to a lady at the West End on approbation"—he said he had known the firm at Norwich, and had done</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187806240064"></xptr>
               <p>thousands with them—he selected a pair of brass dogs, some fire-irons, and a brass fire-guard, value about 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and said that he was sending a case of wine to the lady, and would send the cart for them—he was either to return them or pay for them—on the following Monday he called again and said that the goods were rather light, and the lady required something heavier—he selected some heavier ones, and a pair of fine brasses, and a pair of rests, value about 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which he took away in a cab after signing a receipt for them on appro<lb></lb>bation—next morning I received a telegram from him from South Kensington, and he afterwards called a third time, and said that he had sent the telegram, that he was going to keep the goods, and wanted to select some more—(on the same day that I had the telegram I received a communication from Norwich)—I said that he must return the goods he had taken or pay for them—he said,"Why, I sent you a telegram to say that I would keep them"—I was then standing between him and the door—he attempted to go out and said that he wanted to speak to a friend outside—I said "No friend outside, you had better settle the matter here"—I gave him in custody—this is the order he sent Messrs. Barnard: "Please deliver goods to my boy. Yours truly, E. Belding." <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. If he had paid for the goods I should have entered them in our books and given him a receipt—I did not give him in cus<lb></lb>tody because he had not brought the money, but because I had received a telegram from Norwich that they thought it was a swindle—it is not uncommon for people to have goods on approbation, and if we know them they are entered on credit—our firm is known all over the world—the prisoner left his card, which was attached to the order—it corresponds with the address on the order.</p>

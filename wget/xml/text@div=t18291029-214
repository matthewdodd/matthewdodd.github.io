            . The prisoner had a room on the same floor as me. On the 12th of September my wife was out nursing, and I had to make my own bed - I went out, and put the key under the mat in case my wife should come home; when I came home I saw the bed clothes pulled about, and missed the blanket - there is no mark on this, but I had a pair of them, and this is the same as the other.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. That man has sworn false - I came home, took my own blanket, and pawned it for 2s.; he has owed me a great animosity for some time, because I said he brought in women of a night.</p>

             re-examined. Q. Did she complain of you for bringing women to the house? A. No; I never had any one there but my wife; I have lived with Mr. Burgin eleven years - the man she lives with is not her husband; she came up to me for a light when they came there, and I said to my wife, "I don't like these people, for I heard him beat her, and she threatened to hang him;" I never spoke to her but once in anger, when she was coming up- I told her to keep her distance; I am sure my blanket was gone.</p>

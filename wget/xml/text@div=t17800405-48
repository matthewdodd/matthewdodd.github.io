On Monday the 27th of March, in the morning, about nine o'clock, the prisoners came into our shop, and asked to look at some silk; I showed them a vast number of silks, and they bought one gown of me, which was forty-shillings; the prisoners gave me two guineas; I had not silver in my pocket to give them change; they were in the back shop; I went into the front shop for two shillings for change. When I had given them the change they said they wanted to buy another gown; I shewed them several more; we could not agree about another gown, and the prisoners went out of the shop. As soon as they were gone, I went to wait upon another customer, about fifty yards from our house; I was absent about twelve or thirteen minutes; when I returned, I missed this piece of silk. I left

When I missed the silk I looked all round the shop to see if I could find it, but to no purpose. I sent round to the pawnbrokers to desire them to stop them if they came to pawn it. I heard nothing of it. On Tuesday last I met the prisoner Prothero, in St. Giles's; I followed her and saw her go into a publick-house.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen the prisoners before the morning they came into the shop? - Not to my recollection. They were about twenty minutes in the shop. I took so much notice of them, that I could not be mistaken in their persons. I went into the publick-house. There was

She was examined at the Rotation-office, but continued to deny knowing any thing of me. I described the other prisoner as being with child, and shorter than the other. The officer said he thought he knew where to find her. I went with him, and we took her in Portpool-lane, Gray's-Inn-lane. She likewise denied knowing any thing of me, and did so when she was examined before the magistrate. The silk has never been found.</p>
               <p>Can you at this distance of time from the time the prisoners were in your shop, having never seen them before, positively swear these are the very persons? - I can.

               <p>I am apprentice to Mr. Berry. On Easter Monday two young women came to our shop, about nine in the morning, and asked to look at some silks; I shewed them into the back shop, and called Forrester, and left him with them. They staid about twenty minutes, and then went out of the shop. Then Forrester went out to wait on a customer; he returned in about ten minutes, and then missed the silk. There was no one in the shop while he was gone, only one man, who bought a yard of pink sattin; he was not in the shop above a minute, he only staid while I cut it off.</p>

               <p>I took both the prisoners and found nothing upon them. When I went to Cook's lodgings, I was informed she was very ill in bed. Forrester staid in the passage, and I went in; I was afraid to force her to get up till I knew whether she could get up safely; they told me the midwife was coming. I said to Forrester, you had better be certain whether it is her. He said he could not without he saw her with her clothes on. She sat up in the bed, and put her gown on; then he said he thought she was the person. He described the gown she had on in the shop. I found a dirty gown of that pattern in the box. Then he said he thought she was the person. Till he saw the gown he was not certain. We talked between ourselves six or seven times about it.</p>
               <p>Did not he express some doubt then about her? - Yes he did.</p>

               <p>I know the prisoner; I knew nothing till the pawnbroker's lad brought the handkerchief to the Rotation office, I saw it once before, but I did not pawn it; the pawnbroker said the prisoner pawned it. I know nothing about the taking of them, Sir, the prisoner told me he was distressed for a guinea, to take some things out of pawn that were lent him by a woman, I borrowed a guinea and took them out, that was three days before he was taken up, and they were put into different pawnbrokers to receive more money on them: the prisoner paid me the guinea, and took the remainder of the money; they were all at one pawnbroker's. There was a marcella petticoat flounced, a silk handkerchief and hood, six muslin aprons, five shifts, one shut, some pocket handkerchiefs, but I cannot recollect the number, and a pair of silk stockings, these things were pawned at other pawnbrokers; I pawned them all but the shirts.</p>
               <p>Court. Were all the things that you pawned at the other pawnbrokers taken out at the desire of the prisoner? - Yes, Sir; from the first pawnbroker's they were taken out by his desire, he said that a country woman gave them him to pledge for her, and he wished to take them out, and pawn them at other pawnbrokers, for more.</p>
               <p>After he was taken up you went with them, and shewed them where the things were pawned? - I did.</p>
               <p>Did you see any thing of the prisoner after that? - At the Rotation office I saw him; the pawnbroker's name was Love.</p>

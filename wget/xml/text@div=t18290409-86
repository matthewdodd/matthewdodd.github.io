               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was there not an immense crowd of people? A. No - I suppose round the steps there were not fifty; in the circumference of this Court there might be one hundred people; I saw a military man on a horse, with a drawn sword.

The prisoner was bailed, and has surrendered.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When you came out of the church was there a considerable pressure about you? A. No; the females were adjusting their dress - there was nothing to confine me; I was on the steps when I was knocked down- I got up the first time, and a gentleman said, "That fellow is waylaying you;" he then came up and made the assault - I struck at him, or attempted it, with my umbrella, when I saw him coming to me.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. I knew the prisoner before this; there were three or four more persons with him; I had remonstrated with them several times before the people came out of church - when the prosecutor and the ladies came out, a person said,"They are going it there nicely;" six or seven of them pushed up and knocked them down; Mr. Byard got up, and the prisoner rushed up to him - he put up his umbrella, but did not strike the prisoner: I think the prisoner and his party intended to knock Mr. Byard down.</p>


               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were they well known to you? A. I have seen them about with dog-fighters and others, at three o'clock in the morning; this was about twenty minutes before five o'clock; I had observed the prisoner for about half an hour before - there were no horse-guards there then; they had moved on to St. James' about ten minutes before - there might be forty or fifty persons round the steps; the crowd had gone off.</p>

            . I was at St. Martin's church; I observed Mr. Byard and two or three ladies on the steps, and all at once they were pushed down; Mr. Byard got up - the prisoner went up to him, and I saw the umbrella up; I got Mr. Byard up, and wiped the blood from his face; there were several other bad characters about.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going down the Strand, and saw a crowd at the church; the Welch children were going to walk, and I staid to look at them - after they came out the gentlefolks came out; the horse soldier rode on the pavement, and I suppose a hundred people fell down; I fell on the top of Mr. Byard and his wife - he got up, and said, "You rascal, what did you do that for?" I said I could not help it; I got up, and went to ask what he meant by it - he struck at me several times; the officer came and pulled me off him - he struck me several times, and some persons said, "Hit him, Hit him!" several times- the officer came and took me to Bow-street.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker, and live at No. 8, Church-lane, St. Martin's. I was near the steps - after the children went on, the people came out; there were two gentlemen on horseback, clearing the people; one of them brought his horse on the bottom step, which caused a rush of the people backwards - I turned, and saw an arm let fly at the prisoner's head two or three times, and the last stroke that was made at him was warded off by an officer; I went up to the prisoner, and said, "Was that a constable struck you?" he said, "No, it was that gentleman;" he went to him, and said, "What did you strike me for?" the gentleman said, "Go along; you scoundrel; you want to pick my pocket;" he said, "You poor looking object, I have more money than you;" a female attempted to strike him, and then the gentleman struck him with an umbrella; the officer came and took him - I cannot say whether the prisoner was hit in the face or not; I suppose there were two or three hundred people about the steps; the constables and patrols were clearing them away- I went to the watch-house, and the gate was slapped in my face.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you know the prisoner before? A. No.</p>

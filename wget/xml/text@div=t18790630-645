               <p>record of delivery of 28 sacks linseed to Tripp's cart on or about 21st March, 1879—this order has been lodged at the chief office—it is an order by Starkey, March 14th, 1879, for delivering 28 bags linseed to order of 6. and A. R. Barnett, ex Royal Alice, endorsed as delivered 15th March, 1879; also 25th March, 1879; further delivery signed "G. Gair" of 44 bags linseed to Wynn's van in two stacks—the endorsement by Starkey, "Weigh over and hold to my order, Royal Alice," is not the way it should be endorsed if he desired to use it to get the goods out of dock; there should, in addition to the prime order, have been a sub-order directing delivery to a certain conveyance—you cannot use the prime order to get delivery unless the instructions are clear to deliver; it gives authority merely for the goods to be weighed over and restowed—the endorsement of Gair indicates a delivery on March 25th, 1879, of those sacks—I examined the ledger subsequently on 1st April, after certain inquiries had been made, and found no entries of delivery of these goods—there is no entry of that delivery in Bodley's day-book—there is an entry on the 25th in the day-book—I have found no pass with reference to the 21st or 25th, and no sub-orders—I find these two prime orders (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) were lodged at the docks on or about 22nd March for goods ex Mabel and ex Gilbert Thompson. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Please weigh and deliver to the order of Mr. G. A. R. Barnett, ex Mabel, of Calcutta. Charges to him from 31st March, 1879. Lot 5, about 2 cwt 2 qrs., linseed sweepings; Lot 6, about 2 cwt 2 qrs., same ditto; Lot 7, 2 cwt. 3 qrs., linseed sweepings, ditto. <hi rend="italic">Signed</hi>, "per pro George Soames, Son, and Co.

I also find on the same date that these two sub-orders were left at the docks (<hi rend="italic">both dated March</hi> 20th, 1879), "Please weigh and deliver to R. C. Wynn's van the undermentioned goods, ship Mabel, Captain—from Calcutta. Lot 5," &amp;c. "Order lodged. H. Starkey." Also, "To Wynn's van the undermentioned goods, ship Gilbert Thompson, Captain—, Calcutta. Lot 17," &amp;c. "Order lodged. H. Starkey." Endorsed, "Deliver Wynn's van charges," <hi rend="italic">account struck through</hi>, "A. O'Dwyer.") That pass signed by O'Dwyer I find amongst the passes—it is his signature. (Read: "Depart<lb></lb>ment B, 27th March, 1879. To the Dock-master or Gatekeeper. Permit Wynn's van to pass with 30 sacks linseed and a quantity of bags. Ships' names Gilbert Thompson and Mabel. Signed, A. O'Dwyer.") The goods contained in the two sub-orders, ex Mabel and Gilbert Thompson, have not been marked off in the ledger—I find ex Royal Alice that Starkey had only one lot of 44 sacks standing to his order, and had no other goods except the Gilbert Thompson and Mabel—I find no record of the delivery on the 27th except the pass—there is no endorsement on the back of the two sub-orders—up to the time I gathered information about this matter there were no means of tracing the delivery on the 27th in any books or documents of the company—I have gone through the delivery of all goods to Starkey</p>

               <p>from 25th February to the end of March, and have taken the tonnage, &amp;c.—I find by the ledger the whole tonnage is about 16 1/2 tons—that includes a delivery to Starkey of 132 bags ex Mabel, which has nothing to do with the delivery ex Mabel we are now dealing with—after certain matters had been gone into on or about 1st April, I received these two sub-orders; they were presented on the 7th April. (<hi rend="italic">Dated April</hi> 5<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, 1879, "Please deliver to T. Lee's van ex the Mabel" (Lots 5, 6, and 7), order lodged for H.

They are, except the vans, identically a copy of the two sub-orders which have been produced dated March 20th—I had made certain discoveries on Saturday, 29th March, and refused delivery—the weight of the 30 sacks of linseed would be about 2 1/2 tons—the weight of goods Starkey was entitled to on 27th March ex Mabel and Gilbert Thompson was about 26 cwt. 1 qr.—I have not seen Bodley at the docks since about 1st April—O'Dwyer came on 1st April, but not since—Bodley has not been found.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GEOGHEGAN</hi>. The weighing of the Dock Company is conclusive as between buyer and seller—the seller would invoice the goods from our weights—a cart note should be sent with each delivery, and it is generally done—it is a duty connected with the outdoor department—I am not aware of 7 cwt. of rape seed having been delivered from the ship Marian on 28th May, 1879, without any description whatever—I have no personal knowledge of goods being delivered without a cart note—132 bags of linseed would be about 194 cwt. or 9 3/4 tons—I think it would be three loads—a prime order might be a good delivery order if endorsed for delivery to the conveyance—it would then be treated as a sub-order and cover the full extent of the order—it would be returned to the carman—in reference to the delivery of the 28 sacks (44 bags), 28th March, I find no record in any of the books—if there had been in that case a prime order endorsed as a sub-order I should expect to find an entry in the warehouse book by the foreman Gair—it would be his duty to enter it—the proprietor of goods may send his conveyances-as he pleases—I did not see the 32 bags or the 132 bags leaving the Dock Company's premises—the books show that the bags left between the 18th and 20th March; but I have no actual knowledge of the delivery—it would be the ledger clerk's duty, one of O'Dwyer's assistants, at the office to enter the 132 bags—the evidence of the delivery I find in the ledger, the day books, and orders endorsed by the foreman and the warehouse receipt book—I have gone over those books and satisfied myself that the entry is made in them and the order is endorsed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am carman to Mr. Wynn, greengrocer—I have known Starkey four or five months by working for Mr. Wynn and taking his orders to the docks and have frequently fetched linseed for Starkey from the Vic<lb></lb>toria Docks, and sometimes from the South West India Docks—there is a private toll at the Victoria Docks and carriers have to take a ticket there and pay 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I did not have to show the tickets to my master—Starkey gave me the money before I started; I put them in my pocket and should give them up if asked for them—I found these toll tickets (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in my pocket; I believe I have lost some—these show that I went for Starkey on 19th March twice to the docks; once on March 20th and between 18th and 27th ten times, all for Starkey, nobody else paid me for the toll—I took no orders or papers—I have been to the south side twice—mine is a two horse van—the horses will draw 3 1/2 tons, but I do not put on so much; I put on a fair load—the first time I had about 2 tons of linseed—I signed a book only once, and that was on the south side—we are supposed to sign always—I got my pass on the other side from the foreman—I had an order from the south side—I got the pass from there, I didn't go to the general office; I went across the ferry to the general office and asked for an order for Mr. Starkey, if they had got one on the south side, and I took it back and got the goods—I did not take the order I had previously got to the general office—I got my pass on the spot and went out of the docks with it—I ought to have taken it to the chief office, but I did not know at the time—I gave up my pass at the gate, they would not let me out without—I took the goods to Starkey's place, Victor Yard—there is room for a pair horse van to go through, it is not a large place—it is a little larger than this Court—on getting there I sometimes carried the goods out of the van and some<lb></lb>times Starkey's men have carried them—the linseed was shot in a heap and weighed on the scales, and they wrote down the weight as it was weighed, that was always done—a cart note is a sub-order—I was sent again to the south side and saw Gair, the same foreman as before—I had no papers with me at all—I got the goods again about the same quantity as before, and took them to Starkey's, where they were weighed and shot—I got a pass for them from the foreman and did not go to the general office at all on that day—I went out of the docks and left my pass at the gate—I remember signing a book once (<hi rend="italic">warehouse book produced</hi>), this is my signature, "Received into Wynn's van, 28 sacks linseed and 44 empty bags, 25th March, 1879, J. Tripp"—that is all I did—on the 27th I re<lb></lb>ceived further instructions from Wynn to go to Starkey—I received no papers from Starkey—I went with the two horse van to B jetty, without going to the chief office, and saw the foreman at No. 5 shed—I got 30 sacks (about 2 1/4 tons) of linseed, and a quantity of empty bags—I got</p>

               <p>this pass from Bodley, the delivery foreman, and-left it at the dock gates without going to the chief office—I signed no receipt book—I ought to have taken an order, but never did so, I only applied for the goods and they were delivered to me—I have never been with a licensed carman—I had been as a carman on jobs to the docks before I went to Wynn's, but was not a regular carman and did not know much about the practice—I got the goods and did not think anything improper was going on—I took them to Starkey's place and they were unloaded, weighed, and shot.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a fruiterer and carman at 29, Roman Road, Old Ford, and have for some time past carried goods for Starkey from the docks to his own place—I gave this book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) to Starkey's son, and it was in their possession from February, 1879, till April—I last saw it there about 4th or 5th April, when I went for the pur<lb></lb>pose of looking at it—it had then pages at the beginning which are not there now—I made a copy of the entries in the book at the time on one of my bill-heads, and found he owed me for carriage from 24th February to April 2nd, 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.

I carry on business with my father, and I manage the business—this is my book—we have a good many other customers, but we do not provide any of them with books—I gave this book to Starkey—it was an exceptional thing to give him the book, but I did so because I could not get the correct weights from the carman—I trusted to Starkey to keep the account, as the carman would not know the weights—I have carried to the docks, but not from there for anybody else—the carman should bring me the weight; I do not know if the Dock Com<lb></lb>pany ought to give him the weights—he should get them from the man who hired him—all the carriage for Starkey was not from the Victoria Docks; a good deal has been to or from other places, the General Steam Navigation Company, the East and West India Dock Company, the West India Dock Company, Atkins's Wharf, and Rooks and Spencer—I gave the book to Henry Starkey in a perfect condition, and he returned it as it is about the end of April—it is a book I had by "me—I will not swear it was perfect—I could not rely on the weights given by the carman for any of the wharves; I could not check the weights.</p>

Everything is not done as it should be at the docks—I have destroyed passes only since January this year, I cannot say how many—sub-orders have passed through my hands—I left on 1st April—I began destroying passes late in February or early in Maich—I am not sure about the time; my memory is not good—I said at the police-court" During the last three or four months I have destroyed passes relating to sweepings going out by Wynn's vans for Starkey," but I was not certain—the solicitor did not say it would be a good thing for me to give evidence—he went to Mr. Humphreys for some particulars, and then asked me whether I would make a statement—I was told not to expect anything for making the statement—I believe I took time to think over it before joining in the frauds—I did not know Bodley for some time—I had not seen Starkey more than two or three times on this matter—I spoke to him near his house, and again at the dock, when I had taken him catalogues—the first time I spoke to him was when I met him at the station, and I gave him a catalogue of a sale on the Monday morning—I saw him in the Grove Road one Saturday evening, and went to his house—O'Dwyer was not with me on that occasion—I did not go in when O'Dwyer was with me—I was acting under O'Dwyer's orders in my regular duties, but documents given to me did not always pass through His hands—I should enter a sub-order if I was signing the book—I never destroyed a sub-order—at the time of my conversation with O'Dwyer about the 44 bags I knew Starkey had 44 bags there belonging to him, and I remember the 132 bags, but not the date—I never saw money pass between Starkey and O'Dwyer; I only know from what O'Dwyer told me, and I am not sure of the amount.</p>

I am a clerk in the examiner's office, Victoria Docks—I compare the passes with the day-book, for which purpose I fetch the passes every morning from the dock police office referring to the previous day—I fetched away a bundle of passes on 28th March and found this pass among them. (27<hi rend="italic">th March</hi>, 30 <hi rend="italic">sacks.</hi>) I found no entry in the day-book of that delivery—I went to O'Dwyer, showed him the pass, and asked him to show me the orders—he said he knew nothing about it, and I was to wait till Gilbert came in—Gilbert came in, but did not give me the order—that gave me no opportunity of comparing that pass with the order.</p>

Your books ought to show that you had received them"—he said "I keep no books; I keep no record whatever of what I receive, and whatever has been delivered for me at the Victoria Docks I dare say I have received"—I said "This, probably, will turn out to be a very serious matter, Mr. Starkey, and it is necessary for you to post yourself up so as to let the Dock Company know why you sent for those goods on this day"—I said "How do you pay the carman, Wynn, for fetching your goods?"—he said "Sometimes I pay him directly he has done the job; at other times I pay him when it is convenient"—I said "Surely you keep some kind of books, Mr. Starkey?"—he said "No, I don't keep any kind of books whatever"—I asked him if he had any papers or receipts whatever which would throw any light upon the matter—he said "No, I have no papers or receipts of any kind".</p>

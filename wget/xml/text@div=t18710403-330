                  </hi>. I saw my brother's dead body at St. George's Hospital, on 1st January—he was a messenger, and sold a temperance newspaper—he was a teetotaller, and had been for four years—I saw him about a month or six weeks before 27th December—he was then in good health—his health was generally good—he was forty-two years of age.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at St. George's Hospital—I was assistant house-surgeon the whole of last year, and have been at the hospital five or six years—I have had a large experience of accidents during that time—on 27th December last the deceased, Edward Read, was brought in between 10.30 and 11.30—I was present at the examination—the man who had charge of the case is dead—I saw the deceased from the time he came in until his death—his right leg was fractured at the lower part—it was a clean break—there was a wound on the other leg, in a line with the other wound—those injuries would fairly be caused by a Hansom cab going over them—he seemed to be going on all right—his nervous system was not affected in any way—the fracture was treated as any other would be, and dressing applied to the wound—it was thought of very little importance—I saw him afterwards from day to day, up to 1st January—he was under my care most of the time—on the 29th he became rather incoherent, and said "Mind your own business," when some one spoke to him—that may have been the result of shook to the system by accident, but it may proceed from other causes—on the 30th he became rather more incoherent, and remained so all day—on 31st ha became comatose, and had a slight squint—that is usually a sign of pressure on the brain; coma was coming on gradually—he died at 6.50, on 1st. January, in the evening—the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination was not made till six days afterwards—we prefer making the examination immediately after death, but we can't do it without the Coroner's order, and we did not touch the body—there was not much indication of decomposition on the 6th day—it was cold weather—I made the examination—the organs were all healthy—there was a slight dampness about the brain, which might have come on after death—congestion of the brain was the cause of death—whether that was caused by shock to the system or not I can't positively say.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I can't account for the congestion in any way—no one that I have spoken to on the subject can go beyond conjecture; they can</p>

               <p>only say "I should think"—neither myself, nor as far as I am able to say, any other medical man, could pledge himself that this running over was the cause of congestion of the brain—we can't trace it to the accident, or to any other cause—I did not notice any peculiarity of the eyes before the squint set in—short-sightedness might indicate weakness of the brain—I have never seen congestion of the brain resulting from violence, without some external or internal marks on the body—I am speaking of the body itself—the legs are not a vital part—it very often occurs after violence to the body—blows on the head, or the neighbourhood of the head, or anything of that sort—the dampness on the brain mostly results from diseased kidneys, which he had not—it might have resulted from the congestion, or from the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem.</hi>

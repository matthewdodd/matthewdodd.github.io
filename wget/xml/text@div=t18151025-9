I saw the prisoner at the bar, in company with another thief; they were following two gentlemen; it was about two o'clock in the day. The prisoner attempted one of the gentleman's pockets; but did not succeed; they followed them on, and then the prisoner pulled the handkerchief a little way out of his pocket; then he made a snatch at it, and stuffed it up between the waisthand of his breeches and his apron. I immediately seized the prisoner, and told the gentleman he was robbed. Here is the handkerchief. The gentleman gave me his card, and said he would attend at Bow-street; I went to his house, which was in Piccadilly, and learned he was an officer in the Army, and was obliged to join his regiment.</p>

I keep the Volunteer beer-shop, Plumstead-road—on Satur<lb></lb>day, 1st July, I saw the prisoners looking over my blind—Williams then came in and asked for a shilling in change for two sixpences, he had nothing to drink—Wagstaff then came in, and called for a glass of ale, and gave me a shilling—I tried it, laid it on the side of the till, gave him the change, and he went out—directly he got outside I found it was bad, and sent a young man to watch them—I went out, and saw them laughing and talking along the road—I followed them, and saw Williams go into the Horse and Groom, Wagstaff waited outside—I told him I wanted him—he said, "What for?"—I said, "You know what for"—he looked up, and said, "I was in your house just this moment, and had a glass of ale"—I said, "Yes, you know what you gave me"—he said, "Yes, I gave you a shilling, if it is bad I will give you a good one for it"—I had said nothing about it being bad—I said, "Your companion is in the next house, and if he has not passed a bad shilling, you may give me a good one and go"—I took him into the Horse and Groom, and asked my waiter in both prisoners' presence what Williams had done—he said that he had passed a shilling—I asked the land<lb></lb>lady to look in the till, which she did, and found a bad shilling—I noticed that Wagstaff was in a corner looking uneasy—I took hold of him, and said, "You have got some bad money in your hand now," and took a florin from his hand—I saw Wagstaff with a brass tobacco box in his hand—the landlord gave them in charge, but the tobacco box was not found—I asked Wagstaff where it was, he said that he had not had one, he had a pouch—I told him I had seen it, and sent a young man back to look for it—it was exactly like this one (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I gave the bad shilling to the police-man—this is it.</p>

I live with my father, at the Horse and Groom, Plumstead—I remember Williams coming in—he ordered a glass of ale, and tendered a lion shilling—I noticed it before I put it into the till—there were about five shillings there, but no lion shilling—he drank his ale, and had got outside, when Mr. Earl and Munden brought him back, and asked me if I had taken any bad money—my mother opened the till and took out the lion shilling, which I recognised—my father came in and bent it, and gave it to Moss—next morning I was cleaning up the bar, and found a brass tobacco box concealed behind some trays—I found eight bad shillings in it, and another on the floor with a lion on it, it is one of William IV.</p>

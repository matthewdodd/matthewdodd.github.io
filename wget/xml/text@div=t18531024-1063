                  </hi>. I am a fishmonger, and live at No. 14, Fox's-buildings, Cole-street, Dover-road. On 4th Oct. I was at work at Mr. Fairburn's shop, in Lime-street, and saw the prisoner in the road, at the corner, by a post—there was a cart standing opposite the premises—I saw the prisoner go to the cart and take a cheese out—there was a small piece taken out of one side of the cheese—when he took the cheese he took it to the opposite side of the way, lifted it on his shoulder, and took it into Philpot-lane, and then threw it down, facing Mr. Croft's, the butter shop—I called a man in the market whom I knew, to watch him while I went to Mr. Brooke's, and fetched his clerk, Miller—he came and took hold of the prisoner—we did not say anything to him—he said he did not take it; that was when Miller took bold of him—I did not hear Miller say anything to him before he said that—at the station-house he was asked his name—he said he was a tradesman; he did not give any name.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Messrs. Brooke, poultry salesmen, of Leadenhall-market. On 4th Oct. Nash came to me—in consequence of what he said I went with him into Philpot-lane, and saw the prisoner with the cheese—I went up to him and said, "Halloo! where did you get this? this belongs to us"—he said, "I did not take it; I was paid 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for carrying it"—the cheese belongs to Messrs. Brooke—I know it by a piece being knocked out of it in a peculiar way, and Mr. Brooke had complained of it in the morning—it appears to have been scooped out with a cheese iron—that enabled roe to recognise it immediately—I sent one of the boys for an officer, and held the prisoner till he came—it was taken from a cart which was in the course of being loaded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What cheese is it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A Cheshire—all the cheeses in the cart were Cheshire cheeses—I could not say exactly how many there were in the cart, but I know how many were sent down—I cannot say now from memory—I know that a cheese was missed from the cart by the information I received from the man—I did not count them myself.</p>

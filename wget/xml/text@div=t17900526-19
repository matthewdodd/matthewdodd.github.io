               <p>I am a patrol. On the 25th of April, about a quarter past three, I was at the corner of Percy-street, Tottenham-court-road: I heard a watchman spring his rattle; I went down Percy-street, and I met the prisoner; and he drew back; I said, are you one of them? he said, no; I stopped him; he had nothing on him; I asked him to go back, and he rather refused, and said he was going to call me; I took him back; the watchman said, are you one of them? he said he was not: there was a piece of lead laying by the chapel door, about four hundred yards off where I took him; I had him to the watch-house, and went back and found four parcels of lead upon the chapel, not put down; and likewise a rope; I took it to the watch-house; and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179005260026"></xptr>I searched him, and found a small knife; his apron was wet through, and his breeches and his hands all black with the lead; he said he lodged in St. Giles's, but could not tell the street; he said he was going to Edgeware; and that he worked there for Mr. King; and afterwards he said with Mr. Dawes.</p>

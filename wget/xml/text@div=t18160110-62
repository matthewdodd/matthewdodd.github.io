On the 18th December last, I and my wife left our house about one o'clock to go out to dinner. About five I returned home to shut the shutters, and see that the house was safe. I shut the shutters and fastened them, struck a light and went up stairs. I washed my face, put on a neckerchief, and went out; every thing was perfectly right and safe in the house.

             lodged there. I went up stairs, and he was there lying on a bed with his clothes on, seemingly asleep. I called to him to wake him, and I proceeded to search the room, and in the room we found this bag and this parasol (producing them). I called to him three or four times before he answered. We found the parasol in a drawer. It was between ten and eleven at night when we made this search. We found a ring, which Mrs. Harris afterwards claimed. We found nothing else in his room. I asked him if he had any thing to say to me about any body else? He said, no; before he would say any thing about any body else he would be hanged. We took him to the watchhouse, and we then proceeded to Phillips's. It was near twelve before we could get in. The daughter was within, as I supposed. We were some time trying to break open the door. I told her I would break it in, and gave her my name. Some person came and opened it; and when we got into the passage, we saw the key on the inside in the door of the room which was locked, and we concluded somebody must be inside. We forced the door, and found the servant sitting by the fire. We found in that room two bags of wearing apparel, and a looking-glass, which I have here. I desired one of my fellow officers to go and bring the other prisoner. He brought him in about a minute. I said how is this, Mr. Nathan? and he said he knew nothing about it. We took him into custody, and locked the property up, and it was sworn to the next day by the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Andrews. We first saw Phillips a few minutes after we got in at nearly 12 o'clock. Cohen was found at the Prince of Wales in Wentworth-street.</p>
               <p>Examined by THE COURT. Somebody shewed me the room in which Cohen was lying on the bed. When I first went to Phillips's house, I found that there was somebody inside, from the circumstance of the key being inside and the door being locked. When Phillips came in, he said he had just come from the Royalty theatre. The robbery was in Whitechapel. Phillips's house is about 150 yards from Harris's, the prosecutor.</p>

I told him he was the man I was looking for; and he said, "What is the matter?" and I told him. We also told him we had a deal of trouble in getting into the house; and he said, that he had desired the people not to open the door at all. The Royalty Theatre is not more than a quarter of a mile from his house. Cohen's room door was unlocked, and he was lying on the bed.</p>

I met Mr. Freeman, the officer, and I believe we had a glass of liquor together, and then I went in again, and never stirred until almost twelve o'clock. When I wet Mr. Dalton, I told him I knew nothing about this business. When they took me into custody, they would not let me speak to my servant.

                  </hi>. I am a carrier—I carry on business at No. 4, Christopher-court, St. Martin's-le-Grand—the prisoner was in my service—I was removing from that place to another, some time ago—I left the prisoner there—I allowed him to lodge in the house, because he had no other place to go to—I left some property in the house—he was in charge of the house, and he had to bring away some packages which I had made up to me in my new office—I went with him to ray new office, and introduced him to my new agent—I told the prisoner to bring those packages there immediately—I went out of town the same day—I had left a chest of drawers, an iron press, a bed and bedding, three coats, two pairs of trowsers, and a package containing thirty-six yards of hair seating—he had no orders to bring away the chest of drawers, or bed and bedding—I allowed him to use them, but the others he was to bring to my new place—I left town on 26th July, and came back on 10th August—I found my old place locked</p>

               <p>up; I could not get in, and could not find the prisoner—I had been to my new place and found the things were not there—I met the prisoner next day. 11th August, Mr. Goodenough was with me—I beckoned the prisoner over to me—I observed his dress; the coat he was wearing was mine—it was one of the coats he should have taken to my place—the waistcoat he had on was mine, and the trowsers and boots likewise—I charged him with having my property on his back, and asked him why he had not taken them to where I told him; he said that his own clothes were very shabby, and he thought mine were better, and he should like to wear them—I said that there was a package containing some horse hair seating, and I wanted to know what he had done with that; he said he had sold it to some upholsterer, but he could not say where—I asked what had become of the press; he said he had sold that also to Sharwood, but I found afterwards he had sold it to Mr. Rayner.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was your business to go on in your absence? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was to go on in my new place of business, No. 6, Bull Head-court—I did not tell the prisoner that at the old place there was no business to go on—I allowed him to lodge in the premises, and if any person called or any messages, he was to direct the parties round to the new place—he had never conducted the business for me—he was paid weekly wages, 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a week—the wages were all paid up to my leafing town—I paid him a week in advance, and told him I had no further occasion for his services—I gave him a week's notice, and paid him that week on the day I left London—there were various payments which he had, beside the stipulated sum I paid him—he was to be paid a commission on certain customers which were brought by him to my office—I have my books here—he has been paid the whole of his commission—he was very raggedly dressed—I never complained to him of his being raggedly dressed—I know Mr. Woodrough; he is my agent, in Bull Head-court—I do not remember speaking with the prisoner about his appearance, and making a still larger hole in his coat with my finger—no such occurrence ever took place—I never said, "There is an old coat of mine will make you look a little more decent"—I know Mr. Sargent, a newsman, in St. Martin's-le-Grand; his shop is exactly opposite my late office—I have seen him since the prisoner has been committed—I have said to him that I found the prisoner was trying to injure my business as a parcel-delivery man—I do not recollect saying that I did not care one farthing about the coat—I might have said that my complaint against him was trying to get my business from me; I did not exactly say that—I stated that I found out, since I closed my premises, that he had taken in parcels, and instead of taking them to my new office he took them to another carrier, and he likewise took money for these parcels, and sent them on without the carriage paid—I think I said words to the effect that he had been trying to get away my business connection—I am certain I never asked him to sell the press or the chest of drawers—I had ordered him a pair of boots of a man named Miller—he wanted a pair of boots very badly, and Miller said he would let him have a pair if I would undertake to become security—I did so, and be had a pair of boots made—the place where I met the prisoner was close to where my old office was—while I was away there was a distress put in there for the rent of my house—that was satisfied by selling the remainder of the goods—it is not yet satisfied—an application was made for the rent just before I went in the country—I said I would pay it when I came back—this man removed nearly all the goods, and the landlord, supposing that I was going away, put in a distress—the prisoner was not to remove those things away; some packages of clothing</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185309190044"></xptr>
               <p>and paper he was to remove; the other things he was to leave—I did not tell the landlord I was going away—I never told the prisoner to try to sell any of those goods I charge him with stealing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RYLAND</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I thought you told me that the articles I mentioned were articles you told him to remove to your new place of business? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, the iron press—the hair seating and the articles of clothing were to be removed to my new place of business; I beg pardon, he had no order to remove the iron press—the things he was to remove were made in packages; they were the hair seating and clothes, with orders that he should bring them to my new place of business, and those are what I charge him with stealing—a chest of drawers and the bed and bedding remained on the premises, and he was to make use of them till he could find other employ—I offered him employ in the country, which he declined—there was a chest of drawers, and bed and bedding, an iron press, kitchen utensils, and knives and forks—the rent that was due was 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., for one quarter—besides the things I now charge the prisoner with stealing there was more than enough left on the premises to pay the rent; there were counters and a desk—there has been part of it settled by the distress; I do not know the amount—when the prisoner was left in the house he had three blankets and a quilt—he had no sheet.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at Islington. I was with Mr. Kimpton in Aldersgate-street when he met the prisoner—he said to him, "I understand from my brother that some of my things have been taken away, and I see you have got my coat and my things on; what do you mean by that?"—he said, "I thought I could work them out"—he said he put them on because his own were so shabby—he asked him where the chest of drawers was; he said he had sold it—he asked him where the press was, and the hair seating; he said he had sold them all—he said, "I thought it was best to sell them; I thought you would want me to go down to Liverpool"—he was asked what he had done with the money; he said, "I hare spent it; I must work it out"—Mr. Kimpton said, "I shall give you in charge for robbing me"—he saw a policeman, and did so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am an upholsterer, and live in Aldersgate-street.

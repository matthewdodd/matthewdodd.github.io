                  </hi>. I am a draper's assistant at Swansea—on the 3rd of April, 1877, while going by steamboat from London to Woolwich, I formed the acquaintance of the prisoner on board, and treated him to liquor—on coming ashore he took me to the barracks and had more drink—subsequently I became intoxicated, and remember his putting me to bed—on waking up next morning I found I had nothing left; there was missing my gold watch and chain, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in money, and all my clothing ex<lb></lb>cept my boots and my shirt—the prisoner had deserted—I gave information to the police on the 4th—I saw my watch afterwards on the 18th January—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner</hi>. You were with Bombardier Black on the steamboat—I do not recollect the name of the public-house we went to in town—there were several artillery-men there—no one joined us, no compan<lb></lb>ions of ours—there was some singing, and they were all drinking—I did not sing—I did not say I intended to be a soldier if they would take me—I visited Woolwich for pleasure; to enjoy the evening going down on the boat—I had not been employed as assistant at Bleak and Robinson's drapery establishment—we went from the public-house to the barrack-room before 10 o'clock—no one asked me if I was going to London that night—you ac<lb></lb>companied me to the barracks; no one else—I cannot say what became of your friends—I remember your putting me to bed at the barracks, nothing else—I did not send for beer—I could not say how many men there were, or how many the room would hold—it was a large room—it would hold about 50 men—I do not recollect you asking me for the clothing, or say any<lb></lb>thing about deserting—I am quite sure I would not give you my clothes and go without them myself—I enlisted, and was soon after admitted to the hospital and afterwards discharged—when I went to the police I wore the clothing of a recruit who was in barracks—I never appeared in barracks in your regimentals—they were taken away by the sergeant-major—there were no non-commissioned officers in the room that I am aware of—I had been employed as a draper's assistant in London previously to visiting Woolwich—I had not been discharged that morning; I had given notice—we leave at a moment's notice if we wish.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman</hi>). I am stationed at Woolwich—I saw the prisoner on the 11th January, and asked him to let mo see the watch he had in his possession—he produced it from his pocket, and I found the name and number corresponded with one that had been described for police information—I told him I should take him in custody and charge</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 13 1/2, Shoe-lane, City—about 2 o'clock, on the night of 28th December, or morning of 29th, I had left a friend in the Commercial-road, and was coming home—I had just reached the London end of the Commercial-road, about the sugar bakeries, and was at the corner of a street, when a man suddenly darted at me, and struck me on the mouth, cutting both my lips very severely, both top and bottom, and my tongue after<lb></lb>wards became very sore—his hands were instantly in my left-hand waistcoat pocket, but there was nothing there—I just had power to call "Police," and he was in the constable's arms momentarily—I cannot say that I was exactly sober, but I was not drunk, as my writing on the charge sheet will prove—I walked quite straight—I am sure his hand was in my waistcoat-pocket; but what money I had was in my trousers' pocket.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, H</hi> 115). I was on duty in Backchurch-lane, on the Sunday morning or night in question, about 2 o'clock—I saw the prisoner standing under a dark wall, close to the spot where this happened,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186301050046"></xptr>
               <p>and spoke to him—about half-an-hour afterwards I was new the same spot, and saw him rush out and strike the prosecutor, who had just time to cry out "Police," and I had the prisoner in custody before he knew where he was—I could have seen if the prosecutor had struck him first, and am satisfied that he did not, because I was watching.</p>

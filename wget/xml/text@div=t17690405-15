We walked about twenty or thirty yards together, and after I had stood talking to her some time, I turned my head on one side, and, to make short of it, I miss my watch; after that I spoke to the watchman, and asked him whether or no he knew that woman.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the night was this?</p>
               <p>Wildman. This was about a quarter after one, as nigh as I can guess. The watchman and I went and looked up the passage where it was done, but I never saw her from that time till she was taken up. She must have taken it.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know she had it?</p>
               <p>Wildman. I am positive she must have it. I had it while I was talking to her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find it again?</p>
               <p>Wildman. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Wildman. I am a coppersmith.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you a wife?</p>
               <p>Wildman. I have a wife and children, I had no concern with the prisoner, nor none I wanted. I might, if I had chose it.</p>
               <p>Q. If you are an honest man, what business called you out at that time of the night?</p>
               <p>Wildman. I can give a very good account where I had been.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober?</p>
               <p>Wildman. I was not disguised in liquor at all.</p>

After I had beat the hour, and hung my lanthorn up in my stand, he came and asked me if I knew that woman that had been along with him.

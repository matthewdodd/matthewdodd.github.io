In the morning, when I awoke, she was gone; I examined my breeches, and saw my watch was gone, it was about eight o'clock; I went to the door, and found it was padlocked outside; I was forced to break the under part of the door, and creep out; I then went home to my wife, and brought her to the house, and shewed her the room where I was robbed; I don't know the name of the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the watch? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the woman before? - A. Not to the best of my knowledge.</p>

             sworn. - Q. What do you know of this business? - A. My husband first told me; he then took me to the room, and shewed me where he was robbed; a padlock was on the door. On the Monday following, I lit on the prisoner in the same room in bed, and knew it was her by the way he described her to me; I said to her, where is my husband's watch? she said, I have pawned it.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180402150026"></xptr>Q. Did she tell you where? - A. Says I, where is the ticket? she said, I have burnt the ticket; I said, O Lord, how will that be now? she said, I will go and make my affidavit that I have lost the ticket; she said, pray do not beat me; I said, I will not; she came out with me, and went to the pawnbroker's, and took her affidavit; she went down to the Justice's, and got it signed, and I took it out in my own name.</p>
               <p>- CHARLTON sworn. - Q. Who pawned this watch? - A. The prisoner at the bar; I am confident that she pawned it between eight and nine in the morning, on the 4th of January.</p>
               <p>(The officer produced the watch, which was identified by the prosecutor and pawnbroker.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I met the man in Tothill-street, and he asked me if I would have some drink; I went with him to drink, and then he asked to sleep with me all night; he went home with me; he said he had no money, and asked me to pledge his watch; I said I did not like to do it, but I took it and pledged it, and brought him home the money; this was about three o'clock in the afternoon when I pledged the watch.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Charlton.) What time did you say she pledged this watch? - A. It was pledged at eight o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Corgan.) Is what the prisoner said true, that you gave her the watch to pledge? - A. No.</p>

After I was robbed, as I stated in the last case, I sat down on the coping of Spitalfields Church, as I was nearly exhausted from running, and was lamenting over what I had lost—the prisoner came up and asked me if they had hurt me—I said, "Not very much"—she said that she was an honest woman, and that her husband was a tailor, and if I liked to come and stop at their house for the night I might—I went home with her and went to sleep in my clothes, on a Bed in her house, and she took from me 1/. 1ls., some halfpence, and three duplicates—I missed other property, but I found my knife on the window ledge—I gave a description of her and she was taken in custody. <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I asked you if you had any money to pay for a bed, you said no, you had been robbed; I took compassion on you, and said that it was quite enough to be ill-used and not robbed, and I would give you my bed till I came in the morning. You undressed yourself and went into my bed. When I came in the morning you were gone, and next morning a policeman came and took me. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> It was about 1 o'clock when I went to the house with you, it was about 5 o'clock when I awoke, and twenty-five minutes to 6 when I got to Whitechapel Church—I then went back to the house to see if you had come in, but you had not, and I did not see you again till you were at the station—I counted my money before you, to see what I had lost, and you saw it—you only left me an odd farthing.</p>

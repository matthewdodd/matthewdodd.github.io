            . Aleck Watson and Jemmy Maddox, and I, stole the silver Dish out of the Prosecutor's Window, about 6 at Night. We raised up the Grate, and put a Stick under it to keep it from pinching our Fingers ; and so we drew the Dish out, and I carried it to Mrs. Walker's, a Brandy-shop in Cross-Lane, near Long-Acre, and she kept it for us all Night. Next Day, I and Watson, and Mattox, went with the Dish to James [William] Howard's, and he and Mattox went to sell it at an Ale-house (I think it was the Ship) in the Old-Bailey. I saw them go in with it, and I stood at the Door to watch, for fear they should run away with the Money. They brought me out one Guinea, and then they went in again and fetch'd six Guineas more, and so went to Mr. Rodes's, at the Goat and Leak in White-horse-Alley.</p>
               <p>Howard Where did we go first ?</p>
               <p>Baker. To The King's Head, the Backside of the Old-Bailey, and there we ran up a Score Then we went to the Ship Alehouse. I stay'd at the Old-Bailey -[Sessions house] Gate, leaning against a Post for half an Hour, and then you came out and brought a Guinea. Then we went and bought half a Goos, and carried it to Rodes's, where we stay'd two or three Hours, and drank Cherry-Beer and Brandy; and then went again to the King's-Head, and you and Mattox went to the Ship again, and brought six Guineas more. Then we took Coach and went to Mrs. Walker's in Cross-Lane, who had trusted us with Liquor till the Dish was sold, and she bought two Fowls and Bacon for us: There we divided the Money; we three had two Guineas a-piece, you had about 6 s. out of the odd Guinea, and the rest of it we spent in eating the Goose, and one thing or another. I had eight or nine and twenty Shillings left after I had paid Mrs. Walker. Watson and I lay together in St. Giles's, and we bought some new Clothes, and made a Noise about the Seven Dials, and

               <p>Watson. Where did you meet me in the Morning?</p>
               <p>Baker. At Buck's Brandy shop in St. Giles's, and from thence we went to Walker's in Cross-Lane, and about six at Night we went out a thieing.</p>
               <p>Watson. Who took the Dish?</p>

               <p>Watson. When was this ?</p>
               <p>Baker. I can't write nor read, but as near as I can guess, it was about the 5th of January. When we came to Howard with the Dish, Mrs. Walker lent him her Apron to hide it, but he thought that would not do, and so he went up into hisfs own Room, and brought down a Bag and put it in that, and so he carried it to the Ship.</p>

               <p>Baker. No; we stay'd at Clerkenwell because we had not Money to discharge the Reckoning till they brought the Guinea, and then we went to Rodes's, and from Rodes's they went for the six Guineas, and so to the King's-Head</p>
               <p>Court. You swore you went first to the King's-Head, then to the Old-Bailey, where you stood watching till they brought the Guinea; and you gave this Reason for your watching, that you were afraid they would run away with the Money. And now you swear that you did not watch at the Old-Bailey, but stay'd at Clerkenwell-Green till they brought the Guinea; and you give a Reason for that too, you had no Money to pay the Reckoning.</p>

            . Mattox, Watson and Baker came into my House together towards the Evening, about half a Year ago, and called for Liquor. Mattox had a deep silver Dish under his Arm.</p>
               <p>Court. Baker swore that he carry'd the Dish.</p>
               <p>Walker. When they had run up 8 or 9 s. I asked them for the Money; they said if I would go with them they would pay me, I asked them if they thought I had nothing to do but to tag after their Tails when I was with Child and not well; they said, I should have a Coach, and so a Coach was called, and we drove to the Horn at Clerkenwell-Green. They had no Money to discharge the Coach, and so I paid 1 s. 6 d. for them. Mattox went from the Alehouse and fetch'd a young Man (I think his Name is Howard) who drank once, and then he and Mattox went out together, and when they return'd Mattox chang'd a Guinea, and paid for four Pints of Ale that we had had. They insisted upon my Eating something, and so we went to another House, and had a Quarter of a Goose.</p>

               <p>C. Walker. I can't tell the Hour, but it was at Supper late at Night, and then from thence we all, but Howard, went home in a Coach; they sat me down at my Door, and then they discharged the Coach.</p>
               <p>Howard. Baker swore that we went to the Kings's-Head after we had eat the Goose; did you see me bring the Money, or have the Dish?</p>
               <p>C. Walker. No; Mattox brought the Money, and it was he that brought the Dish to my House.</p>

               <p>Baker. That was only for keeping it all Night.</p>

               <p>Baker. No it was next Morning.</p>

               <p>Howard. How came she to be discharged?</p>
               <p>Baker. Because she own'd the Dish and deliver'd it.</p>

The Butler deposed the Prisoner came and said he had sold the Horse for 5 s. that it lay with its Head against the Door of the Stable so that they could not open it, but were forc'd to hire Men to get him out; that he had sold him to a Collar-maker at Cierkenwell; whereupon his Lady sent him to inquire into the Truth of it. which he did very diligently, but could hear nothing of him; he also deposed the Farrier told him he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="171904080003"></xptr> had bought it for 10 s. five whereof he paid in Hand; but that he calling upon him while he was in Nawgate , he owned to him he had sold him for 4 l. The Prisoner in his Defence said that going with his Lady to Highgate the Horse got a Nail in his Foot and was same , whereupon his Lady ordered him to buy two Penny-worth of Oil of Turpentine and put to it; that he sent for the Farrier, who pull'd off his Shoe and found him in a very bad Condition, and told him it would save her Ladyship 10 l. to knock him on the Head; that his Lady forbid the Farrier dressing him any more and order'd him to sell him for 10.s. that he offered him to Farrier, but he told him he would give no more than for a Horse that was going to the Hounds ; so he bought it himself, but perswaded the Farrier to make as if he has bought it; that he told his Lady it was sold, she demanded the Money, and he give it her Maid, and that his Lady was offer'd the Horse again if she would pay for his Keeping and Cure, which she refused; and that the he told it afterward for 4l. to go in Brick-Cart, it had cost him 3 l.10 s. for his Keeping.

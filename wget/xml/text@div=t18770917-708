                  </hi>. I am potman in the service of Mrs. Spinks—on. Saturday, 25th August, Lewis came to me and asked me to become a third person to attempt to break into the house of Mrs. Spinks—I saw him outside—I said "How is it to be done?"—he said that a certain amount of money was taken during the week, Saturday's and Sunday's takings altogether would amount to between 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that was put in a black bag and was then put in the small bar parlour previous to banking on Monday morn<lb></lb>ing—I asked him "How is this ever to be done?"—he said "We will arrange to get over the wall, you and I, and over the stable and drop into the yard; you must arrange to have the shutter of the window so "as we</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187709170160"></xptr>
               <p>can get in"—I led him to understand I would agree to it, and asked him previous to making any further arrangement, when I should see him again on the subject, and we arranged for the Wednesday following, that would be the 29th August—in the mean time I made a communication to Freeman, Mrs. Spinks, and the barmaid—I saw Lewis again on the Wednesday—I was going to deliver some beer, but previous to my going out with the beer, Lewis, Head, and another came into the parlour—I said "Come outside; Well," I said. "What about this affair you were speaking to me on Saturday night about?"—"Oh," Lewis said, "that is all right;" and putting his hands up so to his face in a thinking mood, he said "I have been thinking, we won't do it the way I was telling you about on Saturday, there is another way to do it which will be better"—I asked him which way it was—he said "You know the window at the comer in Clarence Road! Do you know that window don't fasten right up to the top?"—I said "No"—"Well," he said next Sunday morning when you are about to leave, I shall want you to pull that window down a little more, and a day or two before we commence operations I want you to break a globe in the window, so that it will not cause any suspicion afterwards, because the globe will be in our way in getting in"—of course I promised to break that, but I merely removed it—I was to leave the door open as well, the near parlour door leading to the bar—then I asked him "What about this third person, who is he? it is not the boy," meaning Head—he said "No, another person"—I went into the bar and saw the manager and told him what had happen<lb></lb>ed, and I pointed out the one who was to make the third party, to the bar<lb></lb>man—he is not here—the day was fixed for Monday morning, at 12.30 Sunday night—I met Lewis with Head—we went from there across Hackney Downs up a passage, till we got into Kingsland Road—I took them to a coffee stall and we had some coffee together—we came back by Hachney Downs, and we got to a blank wall, and he said "You meet me at the Pool," and we separated—we met again at the Pool, Clapton Road, and he gave me one tool and put the other in his pocket—this is the one he gave me (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>) and this other he left behind on account of the policeman coming up—we met at the Duke of Clarence; Lewis and I went up to the window; Lewis pulled the window down first, Head was round the corner—after Lewis pulled down the window we stepped into the middle of the road; we went back again to the window; he put his hand against the window, and when we pulled it down, out came the detective, and Lewis ran away—I did not see whether Head ran away; he was round the corner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was close to the window when Lewis pulled it down; I cannot say whether it was partially open then, I am almost sure it was shut—it was when it was pulled down a second time that it came right down with a bang—head had nothing to do with the tools—none of the conversation I have related took place in Head's presence.</p>

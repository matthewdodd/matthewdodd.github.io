                  </hi>. I am a detective-officer of the City—on Saturday morning, 10th July, I went to the accountant-general's office in the Court of Bankruptcy—I saw Mr. Dover—he marked two florins, three shillings, one half-crown, and one sixpence, in my presence—they were put into a bag, which Mr. Dover put into a drawer in my presence—this was between 11</p>

               <p>and 12 o'clock—I remained about the building, and about half-put 4 I observed the prisoner leave the court—he went into the Bell public-house which is nearly opposite—Larkin and I went to the office, where the bag had been placed—we missed from it one shilling and one sixpence—I them went to the public-house and found the prisoner—I asked the barmaid what money she took from him—she said first it was 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and after<lb></lb>wards she said he gave her a sixpence—the money was taken out of the till and placed upon the counter; I examined it, and found a marked six<lb></lb>pence; it was the one that I had seen placed in the bag—I took the prisoner into the Bankruptcy Court, and told him to place the money he had about him on the table, and he placed down a shilling and 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in coppers—the shilling was marked—I took the prisoner to the station—he gave his correct address—I went to his place, and found nine 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes and thirty three sovereigns.</p>

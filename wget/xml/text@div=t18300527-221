On the 12th of May I had some ribbons from Flower and Moss to be watered; they were measured in my presence, and were eighteen yards each - I had had complaints of their goods being short before; I saw these watered on the 13th of May, and gave them to the prisoner to spindle up, and left the work-shop to give him an opportunity of cutting them - I went in, and asked how they looked; I then saw one was cut - I measured them, and found each of the four half pieces, one yard short; I called in a friend, and while I was doing that the prisoner ran down stairs- in about a quarter of an hour the odd yards were found in the dust-hole; he was taken, and denied having cut them.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Had you charged him with cutting them before you called the person? A. No; I had seen these ribbons measured, and marked at each end; they were measured by being turned on a reel- there were eighteen yards each, and are now a yard short; they sometimes are a quarter of a yard or half a yard short - they were in my possession from the 12th to the 13th; I have three persons in my employ; I did not give them to the prisoner till the 13th - I was not absent from him above ten minutes; I had not measured them on the 13th, but I saw the mark at each end, when they passed through the machine; they do not shrink in watering, that I am aware of.</p>

            . I measured these four half pieces of ribbon on the evening of the 12th; three were a little over, and one a little short of the eighteen yards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. A. Are they not sometimes half a yard shorter or longer? A. Yes, but three of them were over, and one was a trifle short - we marked them at each end.</p>

            . I was sent for; I found nothing on the prisoner - we went down to the cellar, and found nothing; we went up stairs again; the prosecutor then went down into the cellar by himself, with a piece of iron, and called out,</p>
               <p>"Here is something in a paper;" I went, and took up this.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were there many persons in the house? A. Yes; I should think it cannot be done without three persons; the premises are three or four stories- no one had been out but a lad for some small beer.</p>

             re-examined. I locked them up on the 12th, and at twelve o'clock, on the 13th, they were taken out and watered; I left them for the prisoner to spindle- I went into the cellar first with the officer; but from my certainly that they must be somewhere I went down again with a candle, and found them; there was a footstep on the dust.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long did you leave the prisoner? A. About ten minutes; I went to the window, and he left the shop - I could hear him distinctly go to the bottom of the stairs; he said he went out, but if he had I must have seen him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. They were given to me to spindle which I did, and left them on the table; it might be as likely for my master to cut them - he has a bad character, so has his father.</p>
               <p>JURY to DANIEL FORRESTER. Q. Did you search the dust-hole? A. I looked in, and saw some papers and rubbish- this ribbon might have been there; I cannot say whether it had been under the dust - he called me down, and said,</p>
               <p>"Here is a paper, I wish you would pick it up," there might be a little dust in the paper; I do not think he was down there two minutes.</p>
               <p>JOHN WADE re-examined. I did not put it there - the officer did not search so much as he ought to have done.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Had you had any complaints before this? A. Yes, and we had detected a person two months before - the prisoner was not with us then; he had the best of characters, and a respectable house was going to take him as a blocker.</p>

I live in the mews over the stable. On my going home four or five men rushed upon me and knocked me down; they struck me and tripped me up and all.</p>
               <p>Q. Before this happened had you any watch about you - A. Yes, I am certain I had my watch, and I felt them draw my watch out of my pocket. They took it away from me when I was upon the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any light in any of the shops when you were knocked down - A. No, the shops were shut up.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a night was it, dark or light - A. It was not very dark nor yet very light, there was the light of the lamps.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you notice the face of any of the persons - A. Yes, I did notice the faces when I was laying upon my back. When they took the watch from me I noticed some of them so that I thought I should know them again. They ran off immediately they had got my watch. It was a silver watch with the name of Burton upon it.</p>

               <p>Q. When they had got your watch and was running away did you give any alarm - A. I called out watch, but no watch came. By the fall I was very much hurt; my head was very much cut behind.</p>
               <p>Q. That was by the fall, not by any blow upon your head - A. No, by the fall.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not struck by any weapon, were you - A. No, by the fist only.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after this that any person was stopped on this charge - A. On the Monday evening. I went home, I was so badly hurt. I went and gave information the next morning at Hatton Garden, that was the Sunday. Then on the Monday evening there were three taken up. I saw the three persons.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they the three persons that are now in custody - A. No, not that night. One of them was set at liberty; two of the prisoners were part of those three that were taken up, their names are

               <p>Q. When did you see Williams - A. On the Wednesday evening I saw him in Brook's Market, him and a girl of the town along with him; I saw him with the officer, Cook was with me at the time; I had said to Cook I could know this man, he being taller than the others I thought I should know him if I saw him. When I saw him in Brooks Market, without any hint from Cook I said he was one of the party. I am quite sure as to him.</p>
               <p>Q. You now upon your oath declare that he was one of the party that robbed you this evening - A. I do. I cannot say who took the watch away from me, I speak with positive certainty that he was one of the party.</p>

            . I am an officer of Hatton Garden office. On Sunday the 27th of October, in the morning part, I received information from the prosecutor that he had been robbed; he described the persons to the best of his recollection.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he able to describe their dress at all - A. The jacket of one; he said one had a jacket on; he did not describe the colour of the jacket; he said there were two or three short ones, but one was much taller than any of the rest. In consequence of that I went up Holborn, on the Monday night, on my going up Holborn, I saw Parker and Brooks, and a chap of the name of Hindes, all in company together about eight o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known the persons of Parker and Brooks before - A. Yes. I took all three to the office, I informed them afterwards what I took them for; they said they knew nothing of it. The third man was discharged.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prosecutor say when he first saw these two men - A. He said he thought they were two of the party which were concerned in the robbery; those are his exact words.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search them - A. I did; I found nothing upon Brooks, upon Parker a little knife, but no money upon either of them. I apprehended Williams the tall man about twelve o'clock at night on the Wednesday following, I was in company with the prosecutor; we were going through Brook's Market into Holborn, we met the prisoner Williams and the girl.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner Williams's person - A. When I got him in the public-house I did, not before; the prosecutor knew his person, and when I got him to the light I knew his person.</p>
               <p>Q. On meeting him did you say anything to the prosecutor - A. No, I did not. The prosecutor said that is the man that knocked me down and took my watch away, upon which I took hold of him immediately, and the girl too.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner hear the prosecutor say this is the man that knocked me down - A. There is no doubt but he might have heard it; the prisoner said he was wrong, for he was not in Holborn at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prosecutor mention then what time - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the night of the Saturday preceding the Wednesday - A. Yes; it was not very light. I took the prisoner Williams to the watch-house and searched him, I found two old silk handkerchiefs upon him. I have never been able to trace the watch. When I got him to the watchhouse I let the woman go upon her own word to appear again. In the morning I went to the watchhouse to take out the prisoner, and when I came there he had broken out of the watchhouse and made his escape; he broke open both the watchhouse doors. I found that by the watchhouse-keeper, and I saw the marks of violence upon the doors.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him again - A. About twelve o'clock on the Thursday night in Brook's-street; I first had taken the girl that did not come according to her word; I saw him in Brook's-street with three or four girls, one of the girls said, here is that bloody trap; I went round the corner and took him immediately; I said you shall not run away again. Read, my brother officer was just by me then; I took him to the new watchhouse, and he was afterwards committed.</p>
               <p>Williams. There was an Irishman in the watch-house, he broke out.</p>
               <p>Cook. The Irishman was taken up for being tipsey<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181112040047"></xptr>to be there till the morning till he could sober himself, he was very much intoxicated. I did not see him, they told me he was very much intoxicated, he was put backwards in the hold.</p>
               <p>Brooks I will ask the prosecutor whether he did not say at Hatton Garden that he could not swear to either of us two, Parker and me - COURT. He said now he is not certain.</p>
               <p>Brooks. He said the first day he did not think we were the men, but on the Monday he said he thought we were.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I said I believed they were two of the party; I said, I could not swear positively to them, but I believed them to be two of the party. I never went so far as to say they were not of the party.</p>

            . I am an officer of Hatton Garden office. I was with Cook on the Thursday night when he apprehended Williams the second time; I asked Williams how he came to break out of the watchhouse; he told me there was a man there, he persuaded him to break open the place and make his escape out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the state of the watchhouse - A. No, I did not. I questioned Williams a little further, he said he could bring people forward to prove he was elsewhere at the time the robbery was committed, that he was at a public-house; I told him he had better do it. He never did at the office.</p>
               <p>Q. to Fox. What was the value of this watch - A. It cost me five pounds; it was a very good one; I would not have taken seven pound for it.</p>
               <p>Williams' Defence. I was not out in Holborn at that time I was in Brook's Market at the Compasses drinking with my shopmates until one o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>COURT, Q. to Fox. What time was it when you got home - A. I think it was a little before twelve o'clock when I got home.</p>
               <p>Parker's Defence. I can take my oath I never saw the prosecutor nor yet Williams that night.</p>
               <p>Brook's Defence. I have nothing more to say.</p>
               <p>COURT. What do you mean by nothing more - A. No more than what I have said.</p>
               <p>Q. You have said nothing, do you mean to say you have nothing more to say than you are innocent of the charge - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Williams called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

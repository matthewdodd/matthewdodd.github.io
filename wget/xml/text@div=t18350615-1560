                  </hi> Dow. I am a paper-hanger, and live in Prospect-place, Lewisham-road. On the 10th of June, I was in Greenwich Park, from nine to a quarter before eleven in the morning—I had a companion with me—I was quite sober—the sun was very hot—I sat down, and went to sleep—when I awoke I had lost my hat and two handkerchiefs, which had been in it, and the silk handkerchief from off my neck—I had not seen</p>

               <p>the prisoner before I went to sleep; but when I awoke, I saw him a little lower down—he saw me walking about without my hat, and asked me if I had lost it—I said, "Yes, and my handkerchief as well"—he said, "I picked up a hat and gave it to the man opposite"—pointing to a man not far off—I went over, and saw the hat he had given him; but it was not mine—I went to the Park-gate to see if I could get any intelligence of it, but I could not—I then came back, and the prisoner asked me if I had found it"—I said, "No"—I then, by the advice of the person who was with me, went to several pawnbrokers—I found my hat at Mr. Seaward's; it had been pawned by Haynes, who is out on his own recognizance, to find the man that gave it to him—I then went to Mr. Sharp's, a pawnbroker, where I found the prisoner offering the handkerchief in pledge—the man behind the counter knew me, and when I stated it was mine, he said to me "You had better take your handkerchief, Charles"—the prisoner snatched it out of the man's hand, and said, "The handkerchief belongs to me; I bought it in town some time ago"—he walked out of the shop—I followed and gave him in charge of a policeman opposite the shop where I had bought the handkerchief on the Saturday previous.</p>

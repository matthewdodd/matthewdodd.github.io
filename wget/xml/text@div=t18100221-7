               <p>Q. Did you see him. - A. Yes, I did, I was placing a lamp in the window. I pursued him about three hundred yards, I never missed sight of him; he dropped the sheeting about three or four yards from the door. He was stopped, I gave the alarm, stop thief. He dropped the sheeting in consequence of my holloeing out, what do you want with it, when he came and took it away.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabout was the sheeting laying. - A. It was placed near the door, within the door. This is the sheeting, the person that picked it up in the street has brought it here; it has Mr. Richards private mark, it is his property, it is valued at seven pounds. I am sure the prisoner is the person that took it out of the shop. He was stopped and taken to Marlborough-street office.

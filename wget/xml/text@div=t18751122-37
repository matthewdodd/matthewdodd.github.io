Gel. a week—Jones had three other children besides the infant, and Mrs. Emmings had four—she went to work sometimes, when she could get it, at a laundry—I saw the child two or three times after I gave it up, but I go out nursing and am not much at home—Emily Jones used to bring it over to me; it was in a dirty condition sometimes when it had not been washed; Emily had the washing of it; it had on sufficient clothes, if they had been clean—it was in very bad health when I took it to Mr. Godrich about six weeks ago, that was the time I showed it to Mrs. Aldworth; it looked very ill indeed, as if it was sinking—I have many a time given food to Emily to give to it; I did not see it eat it.</p>

I will get milk for that"—I don't remember seeing the child after that; I had seen it many times before; it was generally dirty and poorly clad, and always very ravenous for food I have given it bread and batter and milk—I once heard her say that she had received 27<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Jones; I can't say where it was; it was on a Saturday; it may have been two months before the child's death, and she said she would have been able to have done very well but she had to pay 65. to go and see her boy put away in a reformatory—soon after Mrs. Aldworth brought the child back I told Jones it looked very bad; I thought it was going back—he said "Oh, if it can't eat what there is, it must put up with it."</p>

Let the parish keep them"—the charge was after<lb></lb>wards taken later in the day—I asked him to tell me where the woman lived, and he gave me an address, and at that time said she lived with him in every way as his wife—he said he had taken them all he could and done all he could—<hi rend="italic">if the</hi> child had not had it it was not his fault—ho was charged about 3 o'clock in the morning, and I read the charge over to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He was first taken to the station at about 4 o'clock in the afternoon—he was kept there till 3 o'clock the next morning before the charge was preferred against him—he merely asked what he was detained for—he was to all appearances sober when he used the language stated—he might have been angry—he did not say anything about the parish prosecuting, in my hearing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the daughter of Frederick Jones—I recollect Emmings coming home to live with us about four months before my little sister died—I used to attend to the children—I sometimes had food to give the baby and sometimes not—there was not enough for the baby—I did not ask anyone for food—sometimes went without it and sometimes Mrs. Barton, a neighbour, would give me some—Mrs. Emmiuga went out to work and I had charge of the child—I had not enough food to cat—I sometimes said something about it to my father—he used not to say anything—the child seemed ill—my father saw it—he used to say it looked very bad.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There was generally food in the house most days—it was only occasionally that we were short of food—sometimes Mrs. Em<lb></lb>mings and sometimes my father brought food to the house—we had</p>

               <p>that was brought in—sometimes they brought enough sugar to last the week—sometimes there was plenty of bread in the house—I don't. know how much a week was paid for bread—I fed the baby myself when there was food and Mrs. Emmings fed the baby—my father was sometimes kind <hi rend="italic">to the baby</hi> and <hi rend="italic">fed it</hi>—he seemed <hi rend="italic">sorry</hi> at its looking so ill.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Emmings.</hi> I used to leave money with the little girl three times a day to get milk for the baby. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> Sometimes she gave me a penny; not as much as three times a day—some times at dinner time, sometimes at tea time—I bought the milk and gave it to the baby—my father used to go out to work—when he was in work there would sometimes be food in the house—I don't know-how it was—sometimes there would not be food in the house although he was at work—sometimes he would be at work and sometimes not—he was most always—when there was food in the house Mrs. Emmings used to give it to us always—she was kind to us—she would sometimes bring home her own earnings and buy food with them and give it to my sister—when she was not at work she attended to the children and look after them and washed them and feed them and give them clothes, and when she went to work she would leave me to do that, and if there was food in the house I would give it them, and if there was not I could not—she was kind and attentive to us during the time I was there—I have been to the union, and this is the union dress I have on."</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">DR. GODRICH</hi>. I practice at Fulham—I attended Jones' wife after her confinement last November—she died of consumption—I forget when—I saw the child at that time—I didn't take much notice of it—there was nothing to draw my attention to the fact that it was ailing—I believe I saw it some days after it was born—it was an ordinary child—I made. 1 <hi rend="italic">post-mortem on</hi> Saturday the 6th November—I found the child attenuated to the last degree—there was not a particle of fatty matter over the chest or" abdomen—the Organisation generally was healthy—I examined the lungs particularly for traces of phthisis or consumption, which were absent—there was no trace of disease of the lungs—I also examined the mesenteric glands, in which phthisis generally takes place in children; they were shrunken, hut healthy; no sign of consumption—there were some old standing Adhesions, showing that there had at the same time been chronic inflammation of the <hi rend="italic">peritonaeum</hi>—the peritonaeum itself was completely devoid of fat—is a rule, it is very fatty—the cause of death was improper and insufficient food—I do not think I could say starvation—not enough; I am quite open to race the cause of death to that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The children had an attack of scarlet fever after the mother's death—I drew the attention of the relieving officer to the children, that they were not having sufficient" nourishment—the mother naturally affords the best food for a young child—there is great difficulty in rearing a young child that has lost its mother; it requires its mother's breast for eight or nine months, often for a year or more—children are lost in being reared without their mother unless great care be used—you may fail in trying in a most careful way a number of preparations to provide the necessary nourishment—even in the same family one kind of food may answer for one child and not another—most children take the breast freely if in good health—the adhesions of the peritonaeum showed there had been at some time chronic diarrhea or something of that sort—I found the stomach perfectly empty, and not more than two ounces of semi-digested food in the</p>

               <p>whole alimentary canal—more like bread than milk—I should expect a pint or two pints at the very least—if a child had been sick shortly before it died it might account for an empty stomach, but not for the appearance of the alimentary canal—I saw the child about a month before it died; it looked worse then than it did after death—it was pinched, dirty, and in a most deplorable condition—I only saw its face when it was brought to me; it was washed when I saw it after death—I have no recollection whatever of the grandmother bringing the child to me—I don't think I said before the Magistrate that I had some recollection of the grandmother bringing the Child, but was not positive—I said the woman who brought me the child was Mrs. Newland.</p>

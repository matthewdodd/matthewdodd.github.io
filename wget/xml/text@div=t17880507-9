               <p>You saw no more of the boy at that time? - No, not till last Saturday, I saw him go into Mr. Meredith's shop again, and I followed him in.</p>
               <p>That is all that you know of it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner did not say any thing in his defence; but called one witness, who said, that his father had some time ago sent him to Harrow, to keep him out of the way of bad company; but that he had run away, and behaved very bad.</p>

            . On the 29th of July, about a quarter past nine o'clock in the evening I was <placeName id="t18190915-93-crimeloc501">crossing the water in a boat, to Execution Dock</placeName>

When we were about half way over the water, I felt the prisoner's hand tremble against my side - I felt it a second and a third time. When the boat got ashore, he attempted to get up off the seat, and on getting up fell across my knees - when he moved I put my hand down and missed my watch; I instantly caught him by the arm, and desired he would give it to me - he made no answer. I asked him again, and then called my brother to take hold of him. He desired me to feel in my pocket, which I did - it was not there. He took hold of the prisoner - it was afterward found.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Could you have dropped it - A. No - it hung at my side. He was a stranger.</p>

            . I am the prosecutrix's brother. When the boat was put ashore I saw him fall across her lap. She laid hold of him, and asked me to take hold of him, for he had taken her watch. I caught hold of him - he was still leaning on her. He put his hand over the side of the boat, told me not to use him like a blackguard, and told my sister to feel in her pocket. She said she had not got it, but found a piece of the chain left. He fell across the waterman's seat; I could not find it on him; one of the Police boats was near, and my sister gave him in charge. We got a candle, went to the waterside, and the waterman found the watch in the water.</p>

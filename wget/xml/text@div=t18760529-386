                  </hi>. I live at 14, St. Ann Street, Westminster—I am on the town—on Tuesday, the 10th of this month, between 8 and 9 o'clock, I was at the Elms public-house with a soldier named Mitchell, the prisoner came in and paid for two pots of beer—we all three left and went to the White Horse and had something to drink there—the prisoner called me outside and wanted me to take him home—I said I could not—he struck me across the side of the jaw with his cane, also on my hand, and knocked me down, I got up and said "I have a good mind to go to the barracks and report you"—he said "What do you say?" and used language which I cannot explain in Court—he then knocked" me down again and stabbed me in the lip with a knife that he had before that in the evening cleaned his pipe with—it bled—he then ran away—I detained Mitchell by his. belt and a constable and a sentry came up—on the Thursday morning I was taken to the barracks, the men were paraded before me, and I picked the prisoner out directly—I am quite positive he is the man that gave toe the blow—I had never seen him before.</p>

I am house-surgeon at the Westminster hospital—I saw the prosecutrix there on the 10th at 11.15 at night—she was bleeding from an incised wound over the left eye, about half an inch long, extending to the bone, such as would be produced by this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I did not notice her lip.</p>

I am a private in the 3rd Batalion of Grenadier Guards—I was at the White Horse public-house on the evening of 9th May with the prisoner—the prosecutrix was not there with us; there were several prostitutes there—after we left the public-house a woman came and caught hold of my belt and gave me in charge to the police for assaulting her—she was bleeding from a wound above the left eye—the military police came and took me to the barracks—I don't know who the woman was—I never saw the prosecutrix that evening.</p>

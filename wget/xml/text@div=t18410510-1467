                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Frith, and keep a shop in Taylor's buildings. On Tuesday night, the 11th of May, I went out a little before eight o'clock, leaving nobody in the house—I fastened the shop door after me, and tried it—the shop-door is in the passage—the street-door stands open in the day-time—after shutting the door, I went next door to leave my key—I stood talking for a few minutes by the next window, and heard a dreadful crash, which sounded as if it came from our house—I immediately went to the shop-door, and saw the prisoner in the passage—I asked him if he had been knocking at the door, and if he wanted anything—he said no, he had not been knocking at the door, neither did he want anything—I then returned to the same window again, and left him standing in the passage—in about five or ten minutes after heard the shop-door open—I immediately went back again to the door—the prisoner was then inside the passage, not inside the shop—I did not speak to him then—he went by me, and came out—I then pushed the door to see whether it would open or not, and it went open—I immediately ran after the prisoner, overtook him, and said, "Young man, you have been to my shop"—he said, "No, I have not"—I said, "Then you must come back, and satisfy me that you have not been in;" and he came back with me—I kept him standing in the shop till some one fetched a policeman—he made no resistance—when the policeman came, he asked what was the matter—I told him a man had broken open the door—he asked what I had lost—I said I did not know—he told me to look—I went to the till, and missed from a cup in the till two shillings and two sixpences, which I had seen there before I went out, and two weights—I was present when the prisoner was searched at the station—one shilling, and 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper, and the two weights, were found on him—I knew the weights again—I have had them a long time—they were my mother's—I am confident they are what I lost—I</p>

               <p>have never seen any like them—when I returned back again, I observed that the lock of the shop-door was strained.</p>

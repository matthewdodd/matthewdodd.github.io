                  </hi>. I am a hairdresser, of 4, Cow Cross Street—on 16th April, about 12.45 a.m., I was in the Strand going home and a drunken woman asked me to give her some soda-water, which I refused, and walked on—I saw the prisoner standing at the corner of Surrey Street—he asked me why I did not do so—I said that the woman had nothing to do with me—he called out to two others and then threw me down, made a pluck at my chain, and kicked me on my head and eye—my watch was pinned to my waistcoat.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. The woman fell up against me and I pushed her off—I was quite sober—I was not excited till I was kicked on the head.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Hansom cab driver, No. 9918—on 16th April, about 12.45 a.m., I was with my cab in the Strand and saw Allen on the pavement—a woman was there, who looked as if she had had a little drop too much drink—the first words I heard were "I cannot get a bottle of soda-water"—the prisoner came across the road and said "You are trying to take liberties with the lady because she has had a glass to drink," and tripped him up from behind by kicking his feet, and he kicked him as he fell—I saw nothing improper—she was dressed respectably—I saw a scuffle going on, and he got up and the prisoner tripped him up in the same way a second time.</p>

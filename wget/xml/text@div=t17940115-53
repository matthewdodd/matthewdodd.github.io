               <p>I went with the prisoner on the 3d of January, to Mr. Scarlet's house, as we were in Liquorpond-street, we turned down Laystall-street, which was out of our road, and he went to some house in Laystall street, and fetched a basket and cloth, and he drove on the cart on a little further, and took some sat out, and went down the next turning with it. Mrs. Ambridge sent me with him, to help him in with the fat.</p>

               <p>Q. Was you his fellow servant? - I was not, I was at Mrs. Ambridge's that day, and she asked me to go with him, and told me when I came back. I should have a bit of dinner.</p>

             to go with the prisoner? - Because I had lost so much, and I suspected him, and so I desired him, and when he came back I gave him a bit of dinner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My mistress sent me with the boy with the fat, we went along pretty fast, and some jumped out of the cart, it was piled very high on the basket, and we saw some at the bottom of the basket as we were going along in the cart, and the boy picked up some and put it into the cart again; he has been taken up himself this afternoon, and taken to Bow-street, him and two more were handcussed together.</p>
               <p>Harrigan. You are a liar, I have not been taken up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mrs. Ambridge can give me a character, she knows that I never was guilty of any such thing before; there was once to be sure four pounds short, which was some fell in the dirt, and I took the top off, and threw it away.</p>

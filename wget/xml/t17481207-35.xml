               <p>Roberts. I took some of the money and watch upon her: we miss'd the money about four or five o'clock in the afternoon; the maid and she were gone together, and I have not seen the maid since; I found the Prisoner at the bar, at the Swan in Holborn; she had took coach for Bath; I ask'd her if she knew any thing of my money; she said, she had got some of it, and gave me the purse with some of the money in it, and my watch: I had not miss'd that before; she said, the maid gave it her, and bid her make the best of her way, or they should both be hang'd : the watch and bag I can swear to, and there were some pieces of money which I put in; there was no more in the purse when I took her, than five pounds.</p>

            , wife to the above. My servant maid said the Prisoner was her first cousin; she being out of place, and coming to see our maid, I ask'd her if she could iron, and I took her three times into my house; I approved of her work very well: on the 23 d about four o'clock in the afternoon, I went to see how the Prisoner went on with her work; there was a candle burning and a great fire, but no body there; my maid being in the yard, washing dishes; I ask'd her, where was Catherine ? Madam, says she, she is above stairs; I took the candle, and went up and found the drawers open, and the purse and money was gone; the watch I did not miss, although it lay just by the money before.</p>
               <p>Q. What money was in the purse?</p>
               <p>M. Roberts. There was 10 l. 15 s. I should not have suspected her, had she staid and done her work, and took her money.</p>

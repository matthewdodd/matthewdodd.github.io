               <p>I am one of the moniers of the Mint, there are ten more; the bullion comes to the office from the Bank, we are the moniers employed by Government, to convert bullion into specie; we have missed a quantity of gold for a considerable time, and in consequence of an information these men were apprehended.</p>

               <p>In whose custody is this gold? - In the custody of the moniers.</p>

               <p>Who is answerable for it? - We are.</p>

               <p>What are these prisoners? - Labourers, employed by us.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. In what way are the moniers appointed? - By serving an apprenticeship.</p>

               <p>Are they appointed by any written appointment?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110131"></xptr> - I cannot speak as to that, we are registered in the office as moniers, having served seven years.</p>

               <p>Does that instantly constitute you a monier, or have you an appointment? - That instantly constitutes us; I have been a monier four years.</p>

               <p>Are you answerable for the bullion that is brought into your individual hands, or in partnership? - In partnership.</p>

               <p>From whence does this money of which you suppose you have lost some, come to you? - It comes to us in bars from the Mint-office, before it comes to us, it is in the custody of the principal officers, they are not moniers, nor are they the Bank of England; it is delivered to us by weight.</p>

               <p>Mr. Silvester. What is delivered to you in bars, and the siftings, you are answerable for? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Do you remember buying any gold dust in December last? - Some grains I did, not dust.</p>

               <p>Who off? - I bought it of the prisoner Knight; there was another man came into the shop with him, and another stood at the door, whom they called in, but I cannot speak to their persons, Knight was the acting man, and received the money; here is part of it, and part the assay master had.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Have you much occa- to melt much gold yourself? - No, Sir.</p>

               <p>Have you at all been employed in that trade? - Never.</p>

               <p>Do the siftings of a common jeweller's shop, and the breaking of their crucibles have the appearance of these? - They would have quite the appearance, if the gold was the same quality.</p>

               <p>The present external appearance does not describe the quality of gold? - No.</p>

               <p>Judging only from the external appearance, other gold would appear the same? - Yes, I delivered the rest of the gold to Mr. Alcock.</p>

               <p>- ALCOCK sworn.</p>

               <p>I am assay-master in the Mint, I received this gold from Mr. Prior; I found it to be about three per cent worse than the standard of guineas.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do they make use of gold in the process described? - Never so fine, I believe, as what we make use of at the Bank; but I must own at the same time, I think it is possible that such grains might be collected, if they should melt gold of that standard.</p>

               <p>Which is not absolutely impossible? - No.</p>

               <p>Was this written confession read over to him? - Yes, it was.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. I observe this is a joint confession? - Yes.</p>

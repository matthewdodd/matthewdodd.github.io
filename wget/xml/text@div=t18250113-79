The prisoner came in on the evening of the 24th of December; I did not see him till he was in the shop - there was a man standing behind him. The prisoner asked to look at a handkerchief in the window; I showed it to him; he took it, and turned his back to the middle of the shop to look at it; the man behind him snatched it out of his hand, and ran out of the shop. I detained the prisoner, because he was the person I gave it to.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Can you swear the other young man was along with me? A. No: I cannot say they were together.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had 6 d. in my pocket. I had looked at the handkerchief, and was about to leave the 6 d. for it: I laid it down for a moment, and then it was taken from the counter. I could have ran away if I had been disposed.</p>
               <p>PROSECUTRIX. There was a number of persons round the door. A butcher's man stopped the prisoner at the door.</p>

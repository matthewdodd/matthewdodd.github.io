I got up, struck one, and lighted a match; my mother stood by the side of our bed - the prisoner was sitting up in his bed - my mother appeared then to have slept herself sober. I asked the prisoner to be kind enough to hand me a piece of candle off the table - he made no answer; my mother told me to get up, and get it myself. I had the lighted match in my hand - my mother hit me, and put it out; she pushed me on the back of my head. I then got out of bed, and there was no light wanted, as my mother was in such a passion. She sat down on the side of her own bed to undress - some words arose between the prisoner and her; he called her a d - d dirty old b - h, because she was making a noise. She called him a d - d dirty thief - he said, if she repeated those words, he would make her a d - d dirty mouth; she repeated them. He immediately got out of bed - and I heard him hit her violently with something - it was quite dark. I ran between them, and begged him not to hit her again. I held his hand which he had a board in; I afterwards found it was the bed-board; he said he would hit her again. I ran to the window, called a watchman; I heard him hit her several times again. I never heard her speak after the first blow - I told him he had murdered my mother; he said, he had not, for the first blow he had given her with the board, could not have killed her. I struck a light, and ran to the bed where she was laying - he went with me - she lay across the bed on her back. I saw a large cut on the side of her<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182510270025"></xptr>right eye, a large bruise on her forehead, and another on the back of her neck, and there was a piece cut out of the bridge of her nose - a little blood came from the cut on her eye. I told him he had killed her - he said he had - he began to dress. I saw a piece of board laying on our bed, it appeared to have been recently broken - it was the head-board of his bed. I ran down and fetched Brown the watchman. I left the prisoner in the room, and as we came in, met him coming out; the watchman told him to go back, and followed him up stairs to the room where my mother lay. I then found her laying strait on the bed. I had left the prisoner in the room and another man who came from above stairs. On the road to the watch-house the prisoner told me to go back - I refused. I heard him tell the watchman that he had murdered my mother, and I must have justice done.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you struck your mother that night? A. I had not. His bed is not quite two yards from our's, it is nearer to our's than M'Mullen's, and is on my mother's side.</p>
               <p>Q. When you lighted the match, if your mother had received an injury on the head, must you not have seen it? A. Yes. She had no injury then.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not tell the Magistrate, that your mother, another woman and you, had three pints of gin? A. No. I said when she came home she went into the landlady's room to pay her rent, and three or four half pints of gin were sent for, there were four of us in the room - I had part of it; I cannot say I was quite sober, but was more so than my mother. The Magistrate said, at the second examination, I had not said the same as before - but he did not give me time to say what I meant - and if he had it in his power, he would dismiss the prisoner.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What was your mother? A. She sold a few pincushions in the street - I do the same.</p>
               <p>MARY M'MULLEN. I lodge at this house, and sleep in the same room as the prisoner did; he was in bed at ten o'clock when I came into the room - nobody else was then in the room. Mrs. Hunt and her daughter came up in about three minutes - Mrs. Hunt began to quarrel with me for not keeping the fire together - they were both quite drunk; the daughter told her to hold her noise, and not scold me, for I had nothing to do with it; they then began to fall out about her scolding me - she went and pushed her mother on one side, till she fell down in her chair with her head against the wall; she pushed her down chair and all - the back of her head came against the wall - whether it hurt her I cannot tell. She did not complain, but got up and walked down stairs; the daughter remained in the room - this happened between ten and eleven o'clock. I went to bed directly - the daughter was sitting up feeding her child - she is not married. I remained awake all the time - the daughter remained up until the mother came back - there was a light in the room all the time - I had not gone to sleep. Mrs. Hunt came back about half-past twelve o'clock. The daughter was then up - I asked her to give me a sip of water - the mother said, she would be d - d before she would let her give me water. I got out of bed, put on my gown to go down and fetch some, and was taking the pitcher off the table - the mother said, she would see me d - d before I should have it. I went down without it - she called me a w - e, a b - h, and other bad names. I went down, returned directly - she still called me names; they were both up, and there was a light in the room - the daughter begged her mother to go to bed, (it was half-past twelve o'clock, when she first came in); the daughter went to bed with her child, and fell asleep, and the mother fell asleep on her chair. I stopped awake, being fearful of the house being on fire; the light was still burning, and in a short time the mother fell off her chair, across the fire-side - her left side was towards the fire, she fell sideways. I heard her head strike against the wall, she made no noise - but I heard her snoring all along - she was still asleep. I called the daughter, she did not answer me, she was so drunk or sleepy; the mother laid on the floor, still snoring. I remained awake - the candle went out between one and two o'clock. I remained in bed - I was afraid to assist her. After the watchman called three o'clock, I heard her rising up again, and going towards the prisoner's bed. I heard the prisoner ask, who was putting their hands on his face. She then began to curse and swear, saying she thought she was going to her own bed; she crossed the room to her own bed, and awoke her daughter, telling her to strike a light, saying she had been to the young man's bed, and thought it was her own; the daughter struck a light without getting out of bed - the mother began to drag her, and tear her clothes, and knocked the lighted match out of her hand. It was only lighted a moment, I could not see whether the daughter was dressed or not; she and her mother were quarrelling a good bit, and then the prisoner said he had put up with this work a good while, and would put up with it no longer; the mother asked what he said; he would not speak at first, but at last he said so again. She called him several bad names - scamp, a rogue, and thief; her daughter and the prisoner begged her to hold her noise and go to bed; she got worse, and worse. I heard her walk across the room, and go to his bed-side - he jumped up. I heard him making a noise, as if he was putting his clothes on, and heard Mrs. Hunt making a noise, as if he was pushing her from his own bed - she jumped up and said, she would be d - d before she would take that from him, and went as if across the room, and then I heard a blow; I thought it was her striking him. I then heard a blow, as if from him. I heard two blows struck with their hands, and heard the board breaking just at the time, as if they were trampling on it, or throwing one another on the top of it. The daughter cried out to him to give over, or he would murder her mother - all was quiet after that. The daughter jumped out of bed - went to the window, and called a watchman - she then struck a light. I was in bed, and saw Mrs. Hunt lying across the bed on her back - the prisoner stood by his own bed-side. I cannot tell whether he was dressed, I was so fatigued. I could see she was done when I was in bed - I mean she was dead. I could see a little blood on her forehead - I did not go near her. The daughter said, "You have murdered my mother - do not run away" - he said he was not going, he would stop until the watchman came; he did not leave the room until the watchman came.</p>
               <p>Q. Then Brown took him out of the room where the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182510270026"></xptr>deceased lay? A. Yes; I am sure of that. I was so frightened I did not examine the deceased - she was removed next morning. I was quite sober, the deceased was more drunk when she came in a second time than before.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the morning of the 4th of September, about one o'clock, the daughter came to me. I went to No. 28, George-yard, and saw the prisoner standing on the first floor landing-place - he was merely outside the door of the room, in which the deceased lay. The daughter said that man had almost killed her mother - I did not hear him reply; he was dressed. I told him to go back into the room - he did so - there was a light in the room, the deceased lay on the bed on her back - her hand felt cold and hard, but her head quite warm - she appeared to have died very recently. I asked how it happened - the daughter said, he had struck her mother with the head-board of the bed; he said I had better send for a doctor. I said I must take care of him first; he made no resistance. I saw one piece of the board on his bed, and the other on the ground by the head of the deceased's bed, and a third piece was found under his bedstead afterwards - here are the three pieces. There was no head-board to the prisoner's bedstead - I did not fit this one to it; as I took him to the watch-house, the daughter was behind us - I asked him how he came to commit such a deed; he said he did it, that he was sorry for it, and ready to give himself up to the laws of his country. I asked him how he came to hit her with the head-board, saying, he must have hit her more than once; he said he did, and he hoped God would forgive him - that she had been abusing him all night, and he could get no rest for her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Do you recollect the daughter being noisy in the street? A. Yes; I told her she had better go back, and see what she could do for her mother.</p>
               <p>MR. JOHN CURTIS. I am a surgeon, and examined the body of the deceased, at Whitechapel work-house - I think it was on Wednesday; I found a considerable tumour over the angle of the right eye, a bruise on the right temple, and a small scratch on the nose. I removed the skull-cap, found a considerable effusion of blood on the surface of the brain (two or three ounces.) I dissected the brain, and all the appearances denoted acts of considerable external violence having been inflicted on the head; a coagulum of blood filled up one of the ventricles of the brain. I have no doubt of these circumstances being the cause of her death - it would be the immediate consequences of such injury. There was a fracture of the skull bone; on the opposite side, which sometimes happens, the external marks accounted for the oppression on the brain; a person intoxicated might be more likely to die from the injury, from the turgid state of the vessels - this board is sufficient to cause the marks, particularly the edge of it - a blow from a fall would produce the same appearances, but I think death would shortly follow - a fall from a chair might produce the same appearances.</p>
               <p>ELRANOR HUNT re-examined. Q. You could not much notice the state of your mother's head while the match was a-light? A. Yes; I am certain nothing was the matter with it; I am sure I went to bed at ten o'clock; I did not sit up to feed my child; I was asleep when my mother came in; when I awoke the room was in darkness; when I returned with the watchman I met the prisoner coming out of the door; I think he was in the passage leading to the street.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The deceased came home several nights intoxicated, and was very abusive - I had to rise early to my labour, and required rest; I had put up with it a long time - I was not in the habit of swearing, as has been stated; I was struck twice by the deceased previous to returning the blow; she then fell on the bed, but whether my blow caused her death I do not know.</p>

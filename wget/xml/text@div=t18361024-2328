                  </hi>. I live in Sweet-apple-court, Bishopsgate. I am ostler at the Old Catherine Wheel—there was half a barrel of herrings left in the office door, on the 30th of September—the prisoner came, and said he had come after Mr. Brock's half-barrel of herrings—I gave them to him, and he took them away—I do not know what has become of them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carrier. This half-barrel of herrings was mine, I had forgotten them—the prisoner was walking beside me—I sent him back for them, and told him I would give him 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to get them—I told him to bring them to the White Hart, Stone's-end—I waited there an hour and a half—I then went back to the inn, and he had had them away—he appeared to me to sober—I had known him for six or seven years—he was found at Royston, about forty miles from town.</p>

On the 27th of July I went from Denmark-street, Cannon-street-road, to my house in Stepney—I had a watch at my side, annexed to a guard-chain—when I arrived at home it was gone—how it went I cannot tell—I could not have dropped it—the chain was out—this is the watch and guard—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I had a hook, which was taken with it—it must have been unhooked as well as cut.</p>

I remember her coming home without her watch—a person named M'Carthy came to me, and in consequence of what she said, I went with Prout on the 29th to the prisoner Lee's house, in Rosemary-lane, and taw her—we said we bad come about a watch which had been lost, and which we understood was there—she said, "I know nothing about a watch, no watch has come here"—we told her we had evidence that it was there, and it was vain for her to deny it, would she produce it?—she turned pale, immediately went up stairs, and in a very short time brought it down—she said two women had brought it, one of whom had given it to her, and had received 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it, with a pro<lb></lb>mise of more in case the owner should not appear.</p>

I know nothing of any watch"—I said, "It is of no use for you to deny it, because we have evidence that you have bought a watch"—she again denied it very strongly—I again said, in rather a stern tone, "Now it is no use denying it, we have evidence to prove that you have got a watch"—she immediately changed colour, and said, "The women told me that they had found the watch"—I said, "Never mind what they told you, the watch is stolen, and you must produce it"—she then went up stairs, and brought it down—she said she gave 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—her hus<lb></lb>band keeps the house—he came in some time afterwards.</p>

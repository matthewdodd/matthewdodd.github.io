The prisoner came to me on Monday night, the 9th of December, and asked if 1 bought wax pieces—I said I did—she said they were not exactly wax pieces, they were small wax candles, which a woman named Evans, in Earl's-court, had as a present made to her from a brother, who was a wax-chandler, for the children—she showed them to me—I said I</p>

               <p>could not buy them, unless she would convince me that they were come properly by, and would the allow my shopman to go and see?—she went out with my shopman—they soon after returned, and inconsequence of what my shopman told me I gave her in charge—she had said, "If you do not like to buy them, give them to me again," but I detained them.</p>

The prisoner was em<lb></lb>ployed there as char-woman occasionally—she was there on the 9th of December, and left about six o'clock in the evening—I believe these candles to be Mr. Child's—he makes such, and keeps a quantity in the counting-house cupboard—the prisoner had to scour the counting-house, but had no business at the cupboard—I found some candles at her lodgings, wrapped in paperwhich corresponds with the paper round the candles in the cupboard.</p>

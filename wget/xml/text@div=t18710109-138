I am the prisoner's sister, and live at 25, Emery Place, King Street, Old Kent Road—four weeks ago this morning I was in bed about 1.30 or 1.40—my brother came into the room—he went to the corner of the table, and took up the match-box—he rattled it about—he then left the room—he came back again twenty minutes after—he appeared as if he had been running, and his coat collar was up—I asked him what he had been doing with the candle and, matches—he said "Nothing"—he went up stairs, and I heard the unlocking of a box—shortly after that a knock came to the door—I opened it and saw a man there—I said "What do you want here at this time of night"—I heard the window open up stairs, and my brother said "Mister, do you want me?"—the man said "Yes"—my brother then left the house with the man—when he came down stain I said "What have you been doing, Alfred; you have been housebreaking, I suppose; I shall give information to the police"—my brother made no reply—I saw him again the next morning, Thursday—I went up stairs about 7 o'clock in the morning, and opened the box, and found ten silk pocket handkerchiefs, a shawl, and a pair of socks—they had not been there before, as I know of—I then went to where my brother worked—he was not there, and I gave information to the police—I went with the constable to Webber Street, in the New Cut, and there found my brother—the constable took him for stealing the things—they said they would charge me if I did not give the information.</p>

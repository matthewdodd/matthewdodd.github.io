                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Dodd, and live at 18, Liverpool Street, Walworth—on the 19th June my husband went out—I was in the back parlour—I heard a noise about 4 o'clock—I opened the folding-doors, and saw the prisoner in the front room—the window was open—when he saw me he got out of the window—I tried to hold him but could not—I had fastened up the window when my husband went out—I called out "Police!"as loud as I could—there was a gentleman passing and he ran after the prisoner—he was brought back by a constable a few minutes after—there was a thermometer in the room, on the sideboard, when I went to bed—I next saw it lying at the end of the table—it had been moved—there was also a flower-pot moved from the window—the prisoner was the man who was in the room.</p>

I was on duty about 4.15 on the morning of the 9th June, in Little Liverpool Street—I saw the prisoner running from the direction of Liverpool Street, followed by a gentleman—I saw the prisoner turn the corner, and heard the cry of a female voice—the gentleman spoke to me, and I took the prisoner in custody—I went back to the house of the prosecutrix—she said, "That is the man who has been in my parlour"—the prisoner said nothing—I found marks on the window-sill and marks on the window—the prisoner took a knife from his pocket, and said, "You will find nothing on me except this knife, and it will not fit the window, I know"—I tried the knife to the window, and it exactly corre<lb></lb>sponded with the marks on the window-frame, and it opened the catch—I found a box of lucifer matches and an old rope on the prisoner.</p>

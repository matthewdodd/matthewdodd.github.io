                  </hi>. I have three partners—we are stone-merchants, and have a wharf at Rotherhithe, and a countinghouse in Southwark-square—about the 20th Sept., the prisoner Johnson called on me—he inquired the price of stone, which I told him—he inquired the terms, I told him one month account, and three months on approved bills, making four months cre<lb></lb>dit—he approved of the terms, and said he would call on Mr. Hodgson, and name to him the circumstance, and obtain his sanction and guarantee—he called again on the 2nd or 3rd Oct., and said he had seen Mr. Hodgson on the previous evening, and he had consented to become his guarantee and secu<lb></lb>rity—he gave me Hodgson's address, at Kingsland—I called there about eleven o'clock the next morning—I saw him, and said, I was instructed by Mr. Johnson to call on him relative to the purchase of some stone, and I believed he was the uncle of Mr. Johnson—he said, "Yes I am, and a very good lad he is, I have assisted him on some previous occasion, he has always been punctual in his engagements, and I shall be willing to assist him in this case"—I said the amount would be about 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said as a young beginner he should not advise me to trust him in this transaction to a greater amount than 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I told him I would do so, I would be governed by his re<lb></lb>commendation—he then stated in general conversation that he was induced to do all the good he could, and he was then engaged in getting a youth into the Bluecoat-school, the son of a Mrs. Hutchings', at Rotherhitbe—there were several letters lying on the table, one of which he handed to me as being from the Hon. Fox Maule—I returned to my counting-house—I saw Cooper, the foreman, in the after part of the day—I directed him to deliver the stone, with one qualification—I requested him to make inquiries relative to Mrs. Hutchins', as to the character of Mr. Hodgson, as it was in reference to his responsibility the stone was to be delivered.</p>

J." upon them—he said he wanted them as soon as possible—I sent them by the carman the next day.</p>

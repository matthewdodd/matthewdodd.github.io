            . I am a labourer, and live at Northolt, the prisoner lived nine or ten weeks at my house. On a Sunday, after they had had their dinner (I think it was two or three months ago) at my house, the prisoner asked his brother for a little money, Stephen said he had none at present, but would sell him some ewes or wethers if he liked. They agreed for seven ewes, at 12 s. each - they came to four guineas; the prisoner then said if he would give him 16 s., it would make the sum he owed him, which was 5 l.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see any money paid - A. Yes, 16 s. I heard them say they fetched the sheep from Harrow on the Hill. I saw them six or seven weeks ago at Northolt, in the field.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us when you saw them last - A. I cannot say exactly - it was a month or five weeks ago the outside; they were then in the possession of Stephen - it was after the bargain was made.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever know them sell each other sheep before - A. No. I cannot say they were the sheep which Watson had.</p>

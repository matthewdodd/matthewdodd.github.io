               <p>ELIZABETH JONES. In the beginning of November the prisoner took a one pair of stairs furnished room of me at five shillings a week. She staid with me until the 21st; she stopped away a week, and then she came one morning and said she should come home in the afternoon. I never saw her from that time, and when the door was opened I found all the things gone. I next saw the prisoner as I was going along Cripplegate-buildings. I brought her home to my house, and sent for the officer. He took her. She said she was very sorry for it. She was a quiet, civil woman, at the time she was in my house.</p>

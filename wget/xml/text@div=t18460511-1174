                  </hi>. I live at No. 22, Upper Thames-street—on Sunday, the 3rd of May, I was on the pier at Geeenwich—in consequence of information from the policeman, I searched my pocket, and missed two purses—one of them had four coins in it, a groat, a three-penny, a two-penny, and a penny-piece—the other purse was empty—the prisoner gave up the steel purse when he was charged—the officer then asked him for the other purse—he put his left hand in his pocket and drew it out.</p>

I was on the floating-pier, at Greenwich—I saw the prisoner in company with a boy—they were very busy in the crowd—I watched them—I saw them close up behind the prosecutrix and another female—they then went and sat on a seat at the further end of the pier—I spoke to the prosecutrix, and then spoke to the prisoner—he gave up one purse, and pulled the other out of his pocket—the coins have not been found—I had seen the prisoner and the boy three-quarters of an hour before in Greenwich College.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a <hi rend="italic">ruche</hi> manufacturer, which is a kind of fancy trimming; I live at No. 11, Elder-street, Finsbury. The prisoner was partially in my service three hours a day to take orders and sell goods for me, but he had no authority to receive money for me—I always sent the goods by my boy; the prisoner only went with samples to obtain orders—I collect myself—I know the prisoner's receipt; this receipt (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is in his writing—he had no authority to sign it, or to receive the money—he received it after he had left my service for the day—he was in my service from 9 to 12 o'clock, after which he was at liberty to work for any other person—he has never accounted to me for this money; it is 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—Sugden, Bores, and Co. owed me that amount—the prisoner told me on the Saturday after he left me that he got into bad company and spent the money.</p>

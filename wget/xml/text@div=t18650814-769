                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joseph Webbly, a painter, of Drury-lane—on Thursday evening, 13th July, I was in the Fountain public-house, Clare-street, between five and six o'clock—some people were quarrelling—a woman was biting my sister and I tried to pull her away—the prisoner was sitting on a seat—she rose, took up a knife and said, "one woman to another," and stabbed me in the eye—I did not see the knife—I bled very much—she went out, I followed her and gave her into custody—when I caught her she pushed me and said she would serve me the same on the other side—when she saw the policeman she took a piece of cloth, and wiped the blood off my face, and then threw it away—I was taken to the hospital and had the wound dressed—I had not had any quarrel then nor on any previous occasion.</p>

               <p>Did you taste them? - Yes, before I made the seizure. After I opened the door I found some Rum, Gin and Brandy; I took part of them across the way to the house of Jones, the publican, for security, as I had no boat to carry them away: I had seized the whole 60 anchors.</p>
               <p>What happened? - There was a large mob surrounded the door, and made a line for our people to come through, across from Jones's house to Prouse's, where I was: I stood at the door putting the broad arrow on them, and handing the casks to our people, to carry them across to Jones's; the prisoner at the bar was among the mob standing at the door; he was using a good deal of ill language; he said hold of one of the casks and was carrying it off. I am positive he is the man. I secured the keg and took it from him again; I presented a pistol to him, and told him if he did not put the keg down I would shoot him; he let it drop to stave it, I caught it by the slings to save the fall, and it was not staved; I then told him not to meddle with any more, for if he did I should shoot him. He did not attempt any thing more then till all the kegs were out of the cellar. When they were all out, one of my people called to me to come in to see that they were all out of the cellar: I went in to the passage, and left my assistant,

            , as a guard to them: I went in and saw they were all gone, and I heard Felton call me by name; I ran out and found Felton gone, and the three casks gone; I came out in the street and found the mob had dispersed two different ways, one up the hill and the other down: I found the mob had got hold of Felton, and was carrying off these three kegs, and I mustered all the men I could to rescue them; I found him at the top of a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178810220112"></xptr>hill, with a vast number of people stoning him, and heaving glass bottles at him, and many people trying to lay hold of him, and he presenting his pistol to defend himself as well as he could: they have stones at us, as well as at him: we rescued him and carried him away to the house of Jones. The stones were five or six pounds weight, some more and some less. We secured him in a small parlour; then the mob came and demanded him of me: they desired me to turn him out that they might kill him; they called him an informing rascal; I told them they could not expect any such thing while I was alive; and they said they would have him dead or alive. I was kept in that situation 4 hours. When they found they could not get him by fair means from me they knocked all the windows, front and back, in upon us: I saw the prisoner then at the window; when I could look round I could see him in the mob with the rest of them.</p>
               <p>What distance was he from the window? - Sometimes five or 6 foot, sometimes close: I did not see him heave any thing then, my attention was chiefly taken up at the door: I did not hear him say any thing; I was guarding the door. They kept us in that situation till I got help from the Custom-house, then we sallied out and carried him on board a vessel; I searched the other houses the next day: I could not search them then because my people that I had left to guard them houses were obliged to come down to join him.</p>
               <p>Then you could not execute the duty you came about? - No Sir, by no means.</p>
               <p>Did Felton receive any blow that you know of? - He certainly must, because I know his leg was bruised, and he could not walk some time afterwards: I received a blow with a large stone: I believe that was principally the object that was meant, to obstruct us while they carried off the goods.</p>
               <p>Court. You say you saw the prisoner taking one of the anchors, and afterwards about five or six feet from the window: did you see him at any other time? - I saw him when I came out of the house among the mob.</p>

               <p>I am in the service of Mr. Bradley: on the 31st of January I went with him to the house of Proose; I assisted: he made a seizure there of sixty anchors: three of these anchors were left under my care. I know the prisoner, his name is Edward Trough; I saw him at that time; he stood in the mob some time, then he took hold of one of the kegs that was in my custody, and was going away with it, and Mr. Bradley told him to lay down the kegs or else he would shoot him: he was going to heave it down, Bradley caught, hold of it to save it from staving, and he let go: and when Mr. Bradley caught the keg he opened his bosom, and said d - n you, you b - r, fire now: he continued abusing all the time.</p>
               <p>Were there any other persons assembling about him? - Yes, a great number; there might be a hundred or more, collecting all round as a mob: the man called down to Bradley to see that there was no more kegs in the cellar: he went down: I was still inside, with one keg between my legs: and these two kegs were without the door; the prisoner took one off Mr. Bradley's shoulders and put on

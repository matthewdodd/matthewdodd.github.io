                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. Gaball. The prisoner came there for a collar—I cannot say the date—he paid for it, put it on, and ordered six shirts, six collars, and a pair of braces—he gave his address No 45, Grove-street, Brompton, and I was to take the goods there on Saturday, which I did, and found him there—I showed him the goods—he expressed himself satisfied, and said that his friend had gone to change a cheque for him—he advanced along the road to overtake him, but could not do so—I asked him if fee was not going to pay me for the goods—he said that he could not that evening, unless his friend came back, but he expected him back every minute—I told him that it was against the rules of the house to leave things with a stranger, without a reference or the money—he told me that he was in the East India House, and that if I would leave them till Monday, he would call and pay me—believing his representation that he was in the India House, I trusted him till Monday morning, and left them with him—I should not have done so if he had not said that he was in the India House—I have had no payment for them—he called on the Monday, and ordered mother dozen of shirts to be made, and that he would pay me for those and the others in advance, that he was going to business, and would call in the afternoon—he made out a bill himself—this was the last time I saw him till he was at Marlborough-street—I have had two of the shirts back from the police.</p>

Q.</hi> What day was it that I called upon you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe it was 15th Aug.—it was not a book transaction, it was ready money—I was an hour with you on the Saturday—you told me what your father paid for your admission to the India House, but I "did not take particular notice—I took away an umbrella of yours—I did not ask for it as security for the goods, you very kindly lent it to me as it came on to rain, and I returned it to you on Monday, expecting to have the money—you sent me a letter on the following day, stating that you had gone to Southend, I do not know where it is—after that I called at your place, and they said that you were off, they did not know where—I called on you again on the Wednesday morning for the money, and when you refused to pay, I asked if you would give us security—the umbrella was worth 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I went to your house many times, and found you out—the last time I met yon, I told you I wanted the money for the goods—I did not call at the East India House to inquire about you.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the civil and military pay department of the East India House—I know the persons that receive pay of the Company—the prisoner was not employed in the East India House on 15th Aug.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did the prosecutor ever call upon you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He did not—I have seen you before with a man who represented himself to be your grandfather, some years ago, who stated that he had brought you to this country—you went to the East Indies with a person who receives a pension from the Company.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I ordered the goods, and when he called, I told him that I would pay him if he would wait an hour or two till a friend of mine returned from the City; he said that he could not; there was a new umbrella lying on my table, and he said, "I shall accept of that as security;" he took it away, and I called on Monday, and said that I could not pay him, as I had not got the money, but would pay him on my return from the City; he gave me a bill for the whole amount, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which was taken</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Edbrook—we live in Queen's Gardens, Brompton—I am a laundress—the prisoner worked for me, off and on, for seven or eight years. I missed two handkerchiefs that were entrusted to me to wash—I spoke of the loss of them in the prisoner's presence—she said she knew nothing about, them—I spoke to her again, and she told me, if I would not hurt Mary Hinds, she would tell me who stole them—I took an oath that I would not hurt her—Mary Hinds had left me on the 19th of Nov.—I went and found her, and brought her to my house, and there the prisoner charged her with having taken the things—Hinds denied it—I gave the prisoner in charge of the police—I have seen the handkerchiefs since.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sheriff's officer, and live at 12, Pea Row, Kilburn—on 1st August, about ten o'clock in the morning, I went to 1, Dock Street, Wapping, to arrest the prisoner—I saw him at the end of the room, went up to him, and said, "Mr. Bugby, I have a warrant to arrest you, at the suit of Mr. Green," opening the warrant and reading the name and the amount it was for—he said, "I suppose you want the money?"—I said, "No, I do not; my warrant is to arrest you"—he said that he would kill any man who attempted to take him out of the house—I said, "It is no use your talking like that; you will have to go with me, and you might as well go quietly," on which he struck me in the face two or three times, and also struck my assistant Milsom, who was with me—we both took hold of him and pulled him half-way along the shop—he called out for a knife, and called on a sailor, who was there, to assist him—Milsom went out for a policeman, while I struggled with the prisoner for ten minutes—he repeatedly struck me, and I struck him several times in self-defence—he called out again, "Give me a knife, and I will have the b—heart out of him"—we still kept struggling together till we got to the end of the room, where there were some knives on a table—he caught up the carving-knife, which was the longest, in his left-hand, raised it in this manner, and said, "Now I will have your b—heart out"—he made a strike at me, with the point of it towards my chest—I let go of his collar, raised my left arm, put my hand up, and caught the knife in the centre of my hand—he made a second strike at me, which I caught between my forefinger and thumb—I wrenched it out of his hand, and threw it on the floor—he ran out at the back-door into the yard and tried to fasten the door against me, but I got between the door and the door-post—he then struck me on the head with a scrubbing-brush and afterwards with a shovel—he continued in the yard a quarter of an hour, and then made a rush into the house—Milsom came back with a constable, and I gave the prisoner in custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did not he ask you to show your authority, and did not you say, "I shall not show you any authority; you must come with me?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I had the warrant open in my hand—this was in the coffee-room—a sailor and two females were present—it was not I who took the knife up—the sailor is here—the prisoner's wife did not succeed in getting the knife from both of us—very likely the prisoner's hand was cut—the surgeon wished to attend to it at the station, but the prisoner would not allow him.</p>

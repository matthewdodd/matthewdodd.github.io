                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Clark, of Salisbury Cottage, Chiswick. On the 5th of December, I was in the kitchen cleaning the plate—I began about two o'clock, and about half-past two saw the female prisoner come in at the large gate, and come round to the kitchen, where I was cleaning the plate, with a petition—the kitchen door was open—she brought the petition to the door, and wished me to take it to my mistress, but I would not—she stood about twenty minutes begging me to take it—when I had finished the plate I took it into the parlour adjoining the kitchen—my fellow-servant came to me and said the window was open, and directly I went into the parlour I missed the plate—the prisoner had left me in the meantime—I found the parlour window open in front of the house—she could see the parlour window as she went out—I missed the articles stated—I looked on the ground, and saw footmarks coming to the window, principally of one person—when the prisoner was in the kitchen, she put up her shoes to show me how bad they were, and I particularly noticed that one, which was a man's boot, was nailed with double rows of nails round, and the other was a woman's Adelaide boot, but the man's was all leather—the parlour-window is about two feet from the ground—the footmarks appeared to be such as the shoes I had noticed would make.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a marine-store dealer, at Brentford. The male prisoner came to me on Thursday, the 3rd of December, to ask if I was a purchaser of old silver—I said I was—he said he knew where there was a quantity to be got, and wanted to know what I would give for it—I said it depended on the quality—he said there was a great quantity to be got, and if I would tell him the price I would give, he would bring it to me either Friday or Saturday—before he quitted my shop, he asked me again the price I would give—I said from 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. an ounce—he said if he got it he would bring it on Friday or Saturday evening—I saw no more of him till Sunday morning, when I met him between my residence and Drum-lane—he said I did not offer him enough for the old silver—I said I did not know what I could give him unless I saw it—he then put his hand into his right-hand pocket, and pulled out a nut-cracker—I told him I thought it was plated—he then put his hand into his left-hand coat</p>

               <p>pocket, and showed me the handle part of a large table-spoon—I said that was silver—I saw part of another spoon—he said he had sold the best part the night before at Brentford, and made 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. an ounce, and he had been cheated of five or six ounces, and if I would give him 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. an ounce he would bring it on the Friday following—I said I would give him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. an ounce, as it was not fit to be sold as old silver—I saw no more of him till I gave information to the policeman.</p>

I did not see the woman open the gates, but they had been left on the latch—no one came into the kitchen or parlour between her leaving me and my missing the plate—I did not see any second person—I was alarmed almost instantly after she left—I put the plate in the parlour at three o'clock, and at ten minutes after three the window was found open and the plate gone—the footmarks were exactly like her shoes—the gravel was very soft, and there were clear impressions of the shoes up to the window, and a mark on the parlour carpet—I saw nobody about who could have taken it but her.</p>

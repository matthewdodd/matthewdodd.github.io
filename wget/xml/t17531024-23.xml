               <p>Q. Did he say any thing to you before he took it ?</p>
               <p>Coultis. No, he did not; he ran away, and I after him to a packthread ground, where he stopp'd and swore he'd not give it me, and that he'd knock me down if I offered to touch it, he had it on his head, and his own in his hand at the time, I saw him put it on his head. Then I went to my friend's house again, and told them I had lost my hat. The prisoner was taken up, and he own'd before the justice where he had sold it for 1 s. 6 d.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he taken up on this account ?</p>
               <p>Coultis. No, he was not; he was taken up last Thursday night, for stealing some beef out of a shop that very night that he took the hat.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any knowledge of the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Coultis. I had seen him but once before.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a moon-light night?</p>
               <p>Coultis. I believe it was not, it was star-light, a very light night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not endeavour to take him up in that time ?</p>
               <p>Coultis. I could not, he had made an information against me, so I was forc'd to keep out of the way.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to know he had made an information against you?</p>
               <p>Coultis. Mr. Ward told me that he had against me and three more for, stealing this beef, and there was a warrant granted against us.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were the three persons?</p>

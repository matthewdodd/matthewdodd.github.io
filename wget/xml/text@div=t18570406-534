                  </hi>. I am the wife of Seth Snoswell, of 155, Eveling Street, Deptford—he is in the store keeper's department of Deptford Dock-yard—on Ash Wednesday, between 3 and 4 o'clock, a knock came to the street door; my little girl went to open it, and I stepped into the passage and saw the prisoner—he came in at the front door and I met him half way up the pas<lb></lb>sage—he said, "My fowl, Ma'am, has got over your back yard, I want to go and look for it"—I said, "Well, you can go and see if it is there"—as we were walking out together into the garden, I said, "Where do you live, that you think it has got over here?"—he said, "Just over there, Ma'am," pointing to the houses in Grove Lane—we looked about but there was no fowl—we stood there for a minute or more, and, turning towards the house, my little boy came out and said, "Mother, a man has taken a watch"—I said, "You don't say</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185704060124"></xptr>
               <p>so"—I ran in but saw no man—the prisoner was behind me and said, "Let me go"—I said to my niece, who was standing at the front door, "Shut the door and call the police"—he turned round, I put my hand to catch hold of his coat, but he was too quick for me and ran out into the garden—I followed and called out for assistance—when he got to the bottom of the garden, he climbed over the fence into Mr. Bowles' yard, and I saw Mr. Bowles's man catch him—he was brought round to the street door, and I gave him into custody—I had seen the watch hanging in the room two or three minutes before the prisoner knocked—it was silver and had a gold chain—it belonged to my nephew, Thomas Freeman—anybody could see it from outside.</p>

On Ash Wednesday, when my mother and the prisoner had gone to the back yard, I heard a noise in the front parlour, and saw a tall man coming out shutting the door—a piece of the gold chain of my uncle's watch was hanging between his fingers—he said, "All right, my little man, I will run round the back way and help look for the fowl"—he went out at the front door, and I ran and told my mother that the watch was gone, and the prisoner said, "I will go and help to catch the man"—my mother said, "No you will not"—he tried to run to the front, but my mother told my cousin to shut the door—he got over the fence, and Mr. Bowles's man stopped him.</p>

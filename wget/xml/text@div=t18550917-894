                  </hi>. I am master of the <hi rend="italic">Mary</hi> schooner, lying at Pickle Herring-wharf, Tooley-street. On Saturday night, 8th Sept., I was standing on the shore, waiting for the men to put the ladder down the side of the ship—it was a little before 8 o'clock—the prisoner came up to me—I had not seen him before—he said it was a very fine night, and talked about different affairs, and asked if the ship was finished—he seized my watch, took it out of my pocket, and broke the chain—I seized him, and be got hold of me and held me down on the ground—I held him till my mate nearly got to us, but he got away, and left his cap.</p>

I was on board the ship on Saturday night, 8th Sept—I saw this man snatch the watch from my master, and they both fell together—I was standing in the vessel at the time about ten yards from them—I got down the vessel's side, and went up to them, but a man tot me up again—I went to where they were struggling on the ground, but the prisoner got away before I could get down—I did not run after him—I was about ten yards from him—I had an opportunity of seeing this man—I saw his face while he was getting the watch away from my master—they were nine or ten yards from the gas light—I am sure the prisoner is the man.</p>

On Sunday morning, 9th Sept, I apprehended the prisoner at No. 5, Vine-street, Tooley-street—he was in bed—I told him the charge—he said he knew nothing about it—after Knight gave his evidence, he went out of the Court, and when we looked he was gone—the depositions were not taken for three or four hours after he gave his evidence—I searched the prisoner's room—there was a cap in it—a cap was brought to the station, but I forgot to bring it here.</p>

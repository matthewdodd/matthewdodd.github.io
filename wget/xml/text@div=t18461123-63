                  </hi>. I am a frame-maker, and live in Pear Tree-court, Clerkenwell. Gear was my apprentice and Carr my journeyman—Wilkinson had been in my employ previously—on Monday, the 2nd of Nov., I missed some mahogany boards—I went to Wilkinson's lodging, in Wingrove-place, Corporation-lane—I went to his shop again on the Thursday, and saw five mahogany boards there belonging to me—I went up to him and asked him if he knew any person in my line, who was out of employment—he said if I would step down stairs, he would tell me—I said, "No, you seem to have plenty of work and plenty of wood—I wish you to tell me where you pur<lb></lb>chased it"—he said, "If you come down, I will tell you"—I said, No, I knew enough that they were my property, and I should give him in charge—he fell on his knees and begged I would not, for the sake of his friends and his family—I told him he did not consider my family, that he had been rob<lb></lb>bing me through thick and thin—he told me he bought the boards of <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Jem</hi>, (meaning my apprentice and journeyman,) and at the station he said he thought they were their property—I gave him in charge for having that property, knowing it to be stolen—I took a policeman, and went imme<lb></lb>diately back to my shop—I found Gear down in the court—he was going to cut up some boards—when he saw the policeman, he ran into the shop—the policeman and I followed him—when we got into the shop, Gear was coming towards me, and Carr following him—I told them I was satisfied they had been robbing me, and I had found out where the stuff was—I gave them in charge—a key was found on Gear—the policeman asked him if it belonged to me, and he said it did—I thought it was my street-door key, but it was not—it will open my shop—I am certain these five boards found at Wilkinson's are mine—I know them by the grain of the wood, and the shape of the log—I have part of it now on my premises.</p>

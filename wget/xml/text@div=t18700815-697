                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's servant—on 30th June Selfe came to nurse my mistress, who was ill—she, nursed her for a fortnight—she died on 12th July—Selfe left on the 13th—on the 14th I examined my late mistress's wardrobe, and missed a number of articles, jewellery and other things—these things (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are my mistress's—amongst them is a night dress which Selfe asked me to give her for the purpose of laying Mrs. Simmons out—when Selfe came on Tuesday, I asked her where the night dress was—she said "It is somewhere about;" but never mentioned it as having been given to her.</p>

On Thursday, 21st July, I went after Mrs. Selfe, at No. 12, Bouverie Street, Paddington—she was at home with Greene—I told her the charge—she said "I never had any of the jewellery, and what wearing apparel you find has been given to me"—she said that Greene was her laundress—I found a box in her room, searched it in her presence, and found the articles produced—I found these ear-drops at the bottom of the box—she jumped up and said "Take it and put it in your pocket, and say nothing about it; I trust to your honour"—I found a number of things had been pawned by Greene, at Smith's, in the Edgware Road.</p>

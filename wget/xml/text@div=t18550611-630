                  </hi>. I live at Sussex-villas, Gunter's-grove; it is my dwelling house. On Saturday night, 26th May, I slept at home—I examined the doors and windows about half past 10 o'clock, but did not go to bed till half past 12—the scullery window was fastened with a bolt and two iron bars—I was alarmed by a policeman, and missed a large clock off the drawing room mantel piece, and another clock which had been safe before; an old driving coat which I had left in the passage; my purse, which I had left on the drawing room table; a shilling, which was by the clock; and some pence off the kitchen mantel piece, among which were two marked pennies; one was marked T, this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—I afterwards found my purse empty in the front garden.</p>

On the morning of 27th May I was on duty, passing the end of Gunter's-road, and saw the prisoners stooping down—Clarke asked me what time it was—I said, 'Half past 2'—he said, 'It is more than that'—I walked by the side of him, met another policeman, and told him to seize one of them—I seized Barnash—he wrenched from me—I called 'Stop thief!' and he was stopped in a field—I searched both the prisoners at the station, and found 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and some coppers on Barnash, and this coat on Clarke (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I went to No. 3, Sussex-villas, called up Miss Robarts, and found that some one had broken in by the scullery window—I found this small timepiece behind a heap of dirt where I saw them stooping down.</p>

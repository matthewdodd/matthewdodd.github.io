               <p>Mr. Knapp. Gentlemen of the Jury, you have been informed by the Officer of the Court what is the nature of the offence which upon the inquisition you are now charged to try, and you find, that that inquisition imputes to the gentleman at the Bar the charge of killing and slaying with a pistol a gentleman of the name of Montgomery. Gentlemen, in the course of the few observations, accompanying the facts of this case, which I shall have the honour to address to you upon the present occasion, I shall carefully abstain from making any observations that may be thought by any body to create any prejudice against the gentleman at the bar. Gentlemen, I feel that all cases when they come into a Court of Justice to be tried, are to be tried by a Jury of the country upon the evidence that is given before them, and upon that evidence only. Gentlemen, I feel in this case that which we all in our turn often feel upon others, that much prejudice has been excited by the daily public prints with respect to the case which is now brought before you for enquiry. You can but feel with me the impropriety of making observations upon a case which is afterwards to be enquired of by a Jury of the country, both as they may tend on the part of the prosecution to detail evidence that shall be given against the party accused, and as they may tend, perhaps, more materially for the interest of the prisoner, to prejudice the minds of those who are to pass upon him in judgment afterwards. Gentlemen, in the course of this Session, I have the good fortune to state, that I am sure no such observations, through the medium of public prints, or in any other way that may have come to your knowledge, can possibly work upon your minds in the consideration of this case, because I have seen, in the course of this Sessions, that you will attend to the oath you have taken, and decide according to the circumstances as they are stated before you in evidence.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, the charge before you upon this inqui<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180304200012"></xptr>sition is that of Manslaughter only, and you full well know (which must give every body satisfaction) that that charge does not affect the life of the prisoner at the bar; but it is a charge of a very great, of a very important nature, as it respects the interests of society, and the peace of the public; and in proportion as the charge is of importance, in proportion as it creates anxiety in those who hear, and those who are to judge of it, so in proportion does it deserve, and I am sure it will have, your serious attention.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I am not aware, and if I was aware of any law that could be stated upon the subject, I should not feel it necessary, in a Court constituted as this is, to venture any ideas of the law upon the subject, as it respects manslaughter, because in such a Court you will have it better stated to you. I might probably make some mistake, which might affect the prisoner in a way in which it ought not; but I am not aware of any question of law. The only question is, whether the gentleman who is charged to have been killed, lost his life by the hands of the prisoner at the bar, in a rencontre which took place between them at Primrose-hill; and if you are of opinion he was the cause of the death of that gentleman by a pistol, having previously agreed to go out to determine a dispute, there can be no question in any body's mind with respect to the law upon the subject, but that it is properly described upon this inquisition to be Manslaughter.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, the prisoner at the bar, Captain 
               <persName id="t18030420-2-person65">Macnamara</persName>
            , is a gentleman very respectably connected; a gentleman who is highly praised for his magnanimity, and every thing that a gentleman in any situation could desire to have spoken of him. The deceased was also a gentleman of a character equally deserving attention from every body with whom he was connected, deserving the affection and regard of every body equally with the gentleman at the bar.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, the facts of this case lie in a very narrow compass, and I am the only feeble instrument, on the part of the family of the deceased, in conveying to you the facts of the evidence which I shall have the honour of laying before you, neither wishing nor being instructed to say any thing that should work a prejudice against the gentleman at the bar, at the same time taking care to discharge my duty to the public, by laying before you the whole of the evidence.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, Colonel Montgomery was in Hyde. Park, riding up and down between the bridge and the bar, where the horsemen come in. There were two large Newsoundland dogs, one belonging to Colonel Montgomery, the other belonging to the prisoner at the bar. The dogs attacked each other; they fought a battle. Col. Montgomery, seeing his dog had the worst of it, got off his horse, and asked "whose dog it was?" The prisoner, Capt. Macnamara, said, "it was his." Col. Montgomery said, "if you do not call your dog off, I shall knock him down." The defendant said, "have you the arrogance to say you will knock my dog down? How is it possible to prevent the fighting of dogs in an open field?" This word Arrogance, I understand, was made use of several times by the defendant. The defendant said, "he was a Captain (as was true, and a most respectable one) in the Royal Navy." After this nothing more passed that I am aware of, excepting that they pursued their different courses, and went towards Piccadilly; when they arrived in Piccadilly, some circumstances transpired, which I shall not state, because it is not evidence; but in consequence of that, I believe you will find that an appointment was made to meet within two hours at Primrose-hill. The persons who met at Primrose-hill you will find beyond all question to be Colonel Montgomery, the unfortunate gentleman at the bar, a Major Keir, or some such name, a Capt. Barry, and a gentleman very respectable in his line, Mr. Heaviside. When they are there, the ground is taken, a duel takes place, pistols are presented both by Col. Montgomery, who is dead, and the prisoner at the bar. Col. Montgomery fell. The prisoner received a desperate wound, under which he now labours. Col. Montgomery very speedily after died, and I shall be able to prove, beyond all doubt, that he died in consequence of the wound he received from the pistol; I shall be able to prove it by a gentleman who happened to be upon the spot, who knew nothing of the parties, who saw the pistols fired, and who stood about fifty yards off; he will be able to identify the persons of both the Gentlemen; he will prove to you that both of them were wounded in consequence of the firing; that Col. Montgomery was taken off the field, and died very soon after, and that Captain 
               <persName id="t18030420-2-person66">Macnamara</persName>
             was immediately taken.</p>

               <p>Gentlemen, from a fear of stating more than I ought to do, or with more strength of observation than the circumstances seem to call for, I have abstained from any comment, leaving it to you to draw your conclusions from the evidence, when you shall have heard it.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I believe I have now performed my duty in stating the outline of the case before you. Gentlemen, the prosecutor (and God forbid he should) entertains no with, he feels no anxiety at all about the fate of this trial; he only wishes, through me, to lay this case before you, that you may give that verdict which justice and the peace of society require you to give; and if, through the medium of this trial, such circumstances again taking place should be prevented, it will be, perhaps, one of the most important and one of the most advantageous trials that ever came before a Jury of the country, because it will have the effect of preventing those fatal consequences to which I have been calling your attention.</p>
               <p>Evidence for the prosecution.</p>
               <p>

            , Esq. sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Were you in Hyde-park on Wednesday the 6th of April? - A. Yes, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q.Were you on horseback? - A. Yes, in company with my brother and the deceased, Colonel Montgomery.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you any dogs with you? - A. There was a dog following Col. Montgomery.</p>
               <p>Q. A dog of what nature? - A. A Newfoundland dog, and there was another Newfoundland dog belonging to Capt. Macnamara.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know that gentleman at that time? - A. No; there were several gentlemen with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180304200013"></xptr>Q.Whereabouts was it? - A.Between the bridge and the barrier.</p>
               <p>Q.Did any thing happen between the dogs? - A.They began fighting, they were both Newfoundland dogs. I observed Col. Montgomery turn round, and jump from his horse, in order to separate the dogs; they did separate. I heard Col. Montgomery call out, "whose dog is this?" Capt. Macnamara answered, "that is my dog." Col. Montgomery said, "if you don't call your dog off, I shall knock him down." I do not exactly use his words. Captain 
               <persName id="t18030420-2-person68">Macnamara</persName>
             said,"Have you the arrogance to say, Sir, that you will knock my dog down?" Col. Montgomery said, "I certainly shall knock the dog down if it falls upon mine again." About this time Lord Burghersh joined Col. Montgomery, my brother, and myself; a conversation ensued, and I think I heard the word Arrogance again from Captain Macnamara. Lord Burghersh joined us again about that time, and we proceeded on to Piccadilly.</p>
               <p>Q.All of you? - A. All of us; I heard Col. Montgomery say, "Col. Montgomery," and I heard Capt. Macnamara say, "Captain Macnamara, of the Royal Navy." Col. Montgomery expressed a disinclination to quarrel; he said,"Sir, it is not my intention to quarrel with you, Capt. Macnamara; but if your dog falls upon mine, I shall knock him down," or something of that sort. We had some conversation in Piccadilly; I took leave of Col. Montgomery at the top of St. James's-street, with an intention of going home; I turned round, and saw Capt. Macnamara's party turning back from St. James's church; they had gone forward; I saw them turning back to go to St. James's-street; I had at that time got a little way up Bond-street.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time, where was Col. Montgomery going? - A. I had taken leave of him, and he went down St. James's-street with my brother and Lord Burghersh. I then returned to my friends, and when I got into Jermyn-street, I saw Col. Montgomery going towards St. James's church; I rode after him, and then I saw the prisoner and Colonel Montgomery, and other persons; they were about thirty yards separate, in Jermyn-street, and then some gentleman rode up to Col. Montgomery.</p>
               <p>Q.Whatever was then said, I suppose it was impossible for Capt. Macnamara to hear it? - A. Yes; a gentleman rode up by my side from Capt. Macnamara to Col. Montgomery, whom I have since understood was Capt. Barry.</p>
               <p>Q.Did the same person who went from Capt. Macnamara to Col. Montgomery return to Capt. Macnamara again? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Erskine. Q. You saw the dogs begin to fight? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. They met each other of their own accord? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.There was no reason for supposing the dogs were set on by either of their owners? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Col. Montgomery said, whose dog is this? - A. To the best of my recollection he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Capt. Macnamara said, he is mine? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Capt. Macnamara was dressed as a gentleman, and had the appearance of a gentleman? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And there was no reason to suppose that that gentleman, who was a stranger, had been at all concerned in setting his dog on? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon which Col. Montgomery said, "if you do not call your dog off, I will knock him down? - A. Yes, to that effect.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good as let us know in what way he said that - did he pull off his hat, and say, Sir, be so good as call your dog off? - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q.Instead of that, he said, if your do not call your dog off, I will knock him down? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not say it in a very gentle manner? - A.No, I do not think he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Not in a very conciliating manner? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of that, Capt. Macnamara said, "have you the arrogance to say you will knock my dog down?" - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon which Col. Montgomery again said, he would knock the dog down if he attacked his dog again? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I will remind you of only one expression more- Did he not say to Capt. Macnamara, if he was offended with those expressions, he knew where to find him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this subsequent to telling him he was a Captain in the Royal Navy? - A. I cannot say whether it was before or after.</p>

               <p>Q.With your brother and Col. Montgomery? - A. Col. Montgomery joined us.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Col. Montgomery before? - A. I knew his person, but I did not know him to speak to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember coming to the barrier in Rotten-row? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember Col. Montgomery having a Newfoundland dog with him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember any other person coming up who had also a Newfoundland dog? - A. That was before we came to the barrier; the first I heard was seeing the dogs fighting, and Col. Montgomery seeing his dog undermost, turned round and jumped off his horse to separate the dogs.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time he was endeavouring to separate the dogs, did you see the other gentlemen? - A.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180304200014"></xptr>While he was separating the dogs, the other gentlemen rode up.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were the other gentlemen? - A.Capt. Macnamara was one of them.</p>
               <p>Q. That you are sure of? - A. Yes; when Col. Montgomery jumped off his horse, he made this observation upon going up to the dogs, I will knock that dog down if he commits a violence upon my dog, or words to that effect; Capt. Macnamara then rode up, and said, if you knock my dog down, Sir, you must knock me down afterwards; Col. Montgomery made some observation, which I do not exactly recollect.</p>
               <p>Q.Try to recollect? - A. He said to Captain 
               <persName id="t18030420-2-person70">Macnamara</persName>
            , this public place is not a proper place for the adjustment of the dispute; my name is Col. Montgomery, you may know where to find me. Capt. Macnamara then said, my name is Capt. Macnamara, of the Royal Navy. Colonel Montgomery then observed, that Capt. Macnamara could not suppose he intended any offence, either by desiring him to call off his dog, or by saying he would knock the dog down. Captain Macnamara then observed, very nearly in words to this effect, that he did not feel himself offended by what had passed; but if Col. Montgomery did say any thing that was intended to offend him, he would have taken it up with the greatest eagerness, or words very much to that effect, words that tended exactly to that effect; I cannot recollect the exact words, because a number of persons came up, and asked me what had happened, which took off my attention.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you recollect any thing else that passed? A. I recollect Capt. Macnamara used the word Arrogance several times.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect any thing else? - A. I recollect nothing else; they separated; the parties went along Piccadilly; Col. Montgomery and his party, consisting, I think, of three persons; they were pretty nearly together till they got into Piccadilly; they separated in Piccadilly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go into Piccadilly with them? - A. I went into Piccadilly with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did the parties divide? - A.Almost immediately after they got through the gate.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them together at any time afterwards? - A. We went on, Capt. Macnamara and his friends keeping about fifty yards before us; Capt. Macnamara was first; we went in this way till we got to St. James's-street, at pretty nearly the same distance; when we got into St. James's-street, my brother left us; Lord Burghersh and myself went into Jermyn-street; when we got down Jermyn-street, as far as the church, my brother rode up.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not state any thing that passed in the absence of Capt. Macnamara; did you see any thing of Capt. Macnamara afterwards? - A.My brother rode up, and another person, whom I have understood since to have been Capt. Barry; it was one of the persons who rode with him up Piccadilly.</p>
               <p>Q.You are quite sure he was one of those persons? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. After some conversation, did the same gentleman return to Capt. Macnamara? - A. He did return to Capt. Macnamara, who was about fifteen yards behind.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I believe you know nothing more about it? - A. I know nothing more about it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Garrow. Q. You told us very truly persons asked you questions, which took off your attention; your recollection does not appear to be very accurate; do you recollect his desiring Capt. Macnamara to call his dog off? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the terms in which a gentleman, having the appearance of a gentleman, in the Park, was desired to call off his dog? - A.He said in a hurry, whose dog is it, not appearing to me to know who the dog belonged to.</p>

               <p>Q. Upon asking what dog it was, Captain 
               <persName id="t18030420-2-person71">Macnamara</persName>
             said, it was his dog? - A. I did not hear that.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember this expression, "that must depend upon circumstances, if you knock my dog down, you must knock me down?" - A. No; I think that must have been at the time Mr. Duff rode up to me.</p>
               <p>Q. He said, I am Col. Montgomery, you may know where to find me? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Lord BURGHERSH sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q.Did you join Col. Montgomery and a Mr. Sloane in the Park on Wednesday the 6th of April? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present at any dispute that happened between any Newsoundland dogs? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You came up afterwards? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time did you come up? - A.When Col. Montgomery, Capt. Macnamara, and other persons were about twenty yards from the upper bar, I was coming from St. James's-park, and met them; the first thing I heard was, Colonel Montgomery said, "very well, Sir, I shall knock your dog down if he attacks mine;" Capt. Macnamara's answer was, "but your desiring me to call off my dog was arrogant language, not language fit to be used by a gentleman, or to a gentleman," I don't recollect which;" Col. Montgomery said, "if you feel yourself injured, you know where to apply;" after that Colonel Montgomery said, "do you feel yourself injured;" Capt. Macnamara, said, "no, Sir, not by any thing which has yet happened; but if you say any thing that shall affront me, I will take it up as soon as any man in England;" Col. Montgomery said, "No, it is not my intention to quarrel with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180304200015"></xptr>you, but I shall adhere to what I originally said, if your dog attacks mine, I shall knock him down." They then separated, and were passing through the Park-gate. Capt. Macnamara said, that he would as soon fight him as any other person; that he would revenge an insult, and would as soon fight with Col. Montgomery as any other person. Capt. Macnamara was at some distance at that time; he was shaking a stick which he had in his hand, but I did not conceive it was any thing more than an involuntary thing, I think it was the act of the moment from the agitation he was in.</p>
               <p>Q. Not intended to insult? - A.Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you go on with the parties? - A. Yes; they had been separated about twenty yards, and we rode on to St. James's-street, having been at a variable distance from twenty to thirty yards; there was some conversation whether the thing was over or not.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not in the hearing of Captain Macnamara? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Your Lordship saw no more of it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Erskine. Q.Did your Lordship hear Capt. Macnamara ask whose dog it was? - A.No, I was not there at that time.</p>

Montgomery, whom I had never seen before, turned back, passed me, got off his horse, and standing over the dog said, I will knock the dog down; he did not strike either of the dogs, they separated themselves. Captain Macnamara then rode up, and said to Col. Montgomery, if you do knock the dog down, you must take the consequences, or knock me down too; Colonel Montgomery then said, why do not you call your dog off; Capt. Macnamara then replied, no, Sir, I do not chuse to call my dog off, and I will not be dictated to by you or any man.</p>
               <p>Q.At this time then, Colonel Montgomery got upon his horse again? - A. He got upon his horse immediately, and then said, well, Sir, if your dog fights mine, I repeat to you, I will knock him down, and you shall be very welcome to know where to find me; as a gentleman you should have called your dog off. Capt. Macnamara then said, no, Sir, I did not chuse to call my dog off, I chose to let him fight; and I tell you again, I will not be dictated to by you or any man; I ought to know now, Sir, where to find you for what you have already said. At this time different gentlemen closed in upon them, that I had not an opportunity of hearing what further passed.</p>

               <p>Q. What was in that case? - A. I don't know; he then told me to drive down Dover-street, as fast as I could drive, I did so; he ordered me to drive to No. 8, I stopped there, and delivered the case out to Captain Barry, and he took it into the house.</p>
               <p>Q.How long after did Captain Barry come out of the house again? - A.About four or five minutes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see anybody else? - A.Directly after, came up a hackney-coach, the gentleman with one arm went to the hackney-coachman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see anybody in the hackney-coach? I did not, nor did not then see anybody get out of it; the gentleman asked the coachman where the company were in the coach, and then a gentleman got out.</p>

               <p>Q. How long a space was there, from the time you all went, and the time you helped to put this person upon the bed? - A. It might be a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the gentleman that you had taken in your chaise again that day? - A. I did so, I saw him come up to the chaise, and instead of getting into my chaise, he got into the Three-King's chaise.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing particular about his person at the time he got into the chaise? - A. They wanted him to have assistance in the chaise, and he wanted to get into the chaise himself, and he did; he was the second that went in, and Mr. Heaviside was the third.</p>

               <p>Q. When you came up to Colonel Montgomery, who did you see? - A. Mr. Heaviside was there, putting a bit of lint to the wound, and one of the gentlemen said, Captain 
               <persName id="t18030420-2-person75">Macnamara</persName>
             is wounded.</p>

               <persName id="t18030420-2-person76">Macnamara</persName>

               <p>Q.Did he appear to be wounded too? - A. Yes; I was with Colonel Montgomery, and a gentleman said to Mr. Heaviside, that Macnamara was wounded; he ordered another gentleman to clap his hand on the lint for him to put on the wound, and then he went to Captain 
               <persName id="t18030420-2-person77">Macnamara</persName>
            , and put a bit of lint on him.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time, when both these gentlemen had this lint, where were the pistols, did you see them? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they both fall? - A. No, only Colonel Montgomery.</p>
               <p>Q.How long did you stay in the field? - A. I cannot say; I dare say it was twenty minutes; I stopped there while Colonel Montgomery was led by two, while I was ordered to fetch the chaise up, which I did, and I lifted Captain 
               <persName id="t18030420-2-person78">Macnamara</persName>
             into<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180304200017"></xptr>the chaise, and brought him down to Chalk-farm, and then a hackney-coach was sent up for Colonel Montgomery.</p>
               <p>Q.Before you parted with Colonel Montgomery, had he died? - A. He was not dead; I helped to carry him up stairs afterwards, he was not dead then.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Colonel Montgomery after he was dead at any time? - A. No, I was going up stairs after the gentlemen -</p>

               <p>Q. What o'clock was it? - A. I think, about half-past six; I went up and stood upon the hill, at about fifty yards distance from them, I saw them conversing together.</p>

            , and I think Mr. Heaviside, then I saw them preparing pistols.</p>
               <p>Q. Who preparing pistols? - A. I don't positively know; one pistol was discharged, as it struck me, to ascertain whether it was in good condition.</p>
               <p>Q. By whom, do you recollect? - A. I don't know, the parties then separated and fired.</p>

               <p>Q. How did he appear to be? - A. He was groaning, and his eyes fixed.</p>
               <p>Q. He had the appearance of a dying man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know, of your own knowledge, that he died? - A. I saw the corpse afterwards, on a bed in the house.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. My Lord, that is the case on the part of the prosecution.</p>
               <p>The prisoner, on being asked if he had any thing to say in his defence, rose up, and begged permission to read to the Gentlemen of the Jury, and the Court, a written defence, which he had prepared. This he was allowed to do, and to keep his seat, on account of his being still very weak, from his wound. It was as follows:</p>
               <p>Gentlemen of the Jury.</p>
               <p>I appear before you, with the consolation that my character has already been delivered, by the verdict of a Grand Jury, from the shocking Imputation of murder; and that although the evidence against me was laid before them, without any explanation or evidence of the sensations which brought me into my present unhappy situation, they made their own impression; and no charge of criminal homicide was found against me. I was delivered at once from the whole effect of the indictment. I therefore now stand before you, upon the inquisition only, taken before the Coronor, upon the view of the body, under circumstances extremely affecting to the mind of those who were to deliberate on the transaction, and without the opportunity; which the benignity of the law affords me at this moment, of repelling that inference of even sudden resentment against the deceased, which is the foundation of this inquest of manslaughter.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180304200018"></xptr>The origin of the difference, as you see it in the evidence, was insignisicant: - The heat of two persons, each desending an animal under his protection; was natural, and could not have led to any serious consequences. It was not the deceased's defending his own dog, or his threatening to destroy mine, that led to the fatal catastrophe: It was the defiance alone, which most unhappily accompanied what was said; words receive their interpretation from the avowed intention of the speaker. The offence was forced upon me by the declaration, that he invited me to be offended, and challenged me to vindicate the offence by calling upon him for satisfaction."If you are offended with what is past, you know where to find me." These words, unfortunately repeated and reiterated, have over and over again been considered by Criminal Courts of Justice as sufficient to support an indictment for a challenge. These Judgments of Courts are founded upon the universal understandings and feelings of mankind, and common candour must admit that an Officer, however desirous to avoid a quarrel, cannot refuse to understand what even the grave Judges of the Law must interpret as a provocation and a desiance. I declare, therefore, most solemnly, that I went into the field from no resentment against the deceased, nothing, indeed, but infanity could have led me to expose my own life to such imminent peril, under the impulse of passion, from so inadequate a cause as the evidence before you exhibits, when separated from the desiance which was the fatal source of mischief, and I could well have overlooked that too, if the world, in its present state, could have overlooked it also. I went into the field, therefore, with no determination or desire to take the life of my opponent, or to expose my own. I went there in hopes of receiving some soothing satisfaction, for what would otherwise have exposed me, in the general feelings and opinions of the world. The deceased was a man of popular manners, as I have heard, and with a very general acquaintance. I, on the other hand, was in a manner, a stranger in this great town, having been devoted, from my infancy, to the duties of my prosession in distant seas. If, under these circumstances, words which the deceased intended so offensive, and which he repeatedly invited to be resented, had been passed by and submitted to, they would have passed from mouth to mouth, have been even exaggerated at every repetition, and my honour must have been lost.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I am a Captain of the British Navy. My character you can only hear from others; but to maintain any character, in that station, I must be respected. When called upon to lead others into honourable danger, I must not be supposed to be a man who had sought safety by submitting to what custom has taught others to consider as a disgrace. I am not presuming to urge any thing against the laws of God, or of this land. I know that, in the eye of religion and reason, obedience to the law, though against the general feelings of the world, is the first duty, and ought to be the rule of action: but, in putting a construction upon my motives, so as to ascertain the quality of my actions, you will make allowances for my situation. It is impossible to desine in terms, the proper feelings of a gentleman; but their existence have supported this happy country for many ages, and she might perish if they were lost, Gentlemen, I will detain you no longer: I will bring before you many honourable persons, who will speak what they know of me in my profession, and in private life, which will the better enable you to judge whether what I have offered in my defence may safely be received by you as truth. Gentlemen, I submit myself entirely to your judgments. I hope to obtain my liberty, through your verdict; and to employ it with honour in the defence of the liberties of my country.</p>
               <p>Evidence for the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Q.In what regiment? - A. The first life guards.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present at the time these dogs began to fight? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you continue to be present while Capt. Macnamara and Col. Montgomery were in the Park? - A. When they came out of the Park.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you near enough to hear all that passed to the time of their separating? - A. No; they went through the gate together, and I returned into the Park.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you near enough to hear what passed? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And do you recollect it well? - A. I recollect some of the circumstances.</p>
               <p>Q.Be so good as tell us how it began? - A. The dogs met and sought; Col. Montgomery got off his horse, and said, if that dog fights mine, I will knock him down.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Capt. Macnamara present at this time? - A.He was near enough to hear it; he was going the other way down the Park; I believe Col. Montgomery repeated, if that dog fights mine, I will knock him down; to which Capt. Macuamara replied, if you knock him down, you must knock me down first; they rode up the Park a little way together, and I believe they exchanged their addresses, but that I cannot speak positively to; I heard Col. Montgomery say to Capt. Macnamara, why do not you take your dog off.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say that as you would speak to a gentleman, whose dog was attacking your's, or did he say it in a rude manner? - A.He was evidently heated; Capt. Macnamara said, you are not to dictate to me, Sir, and then I left them; I heard Col. Montgomery say, it is very well, Sir, if you have any thing to say to me, you know where to find me.</p>
               <p>Lord HOOD sworn. - Examined by Mr. Erskine.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your Lordship acquainted with the prisoner at the bar, Capt. Macnamara? - A.Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has your Lordship known him? - A. I have known him eight or ten years; I had the good fortune to promote him in the year 1794.)</p>
               <p>Q. I need hardly ask your Lordship, after having used the expression you had the good fortune<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180304200019"></xptr>to promote him in the year 1794, whether he was an officer of merit? -</p>
               <p>Court. That is not the question; I will not have that question answered.</p>
               <p>Mr. Erskine. Q.Will your Lordship tell us what has been his general demeanour; has he always conducted himself properly? - A. I never heard any thing to the contrary.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he a man of good temper? - A.He was a man of great moderation; he served under my command, when I had an opportunity of knowing him; it was on account of the high situation that he held in my opinion that I promoted him as an officer and a gentleman.</p>
               <p>Lord NELSON sworn. - Examined by Mr. Garrow. Q.Be so good as inform the Court how long you have known Captain 
               <persName id="t18030420-2-person84">Macnamara</persName>
            ? - A. I have known Capt. Macnamara about nine years; he has been at various times under my command; during my long acquaintance with him, I have not only had the highest respect for him as an officer, but although I have always believed Capt. Macnamara a gentleman that would not take an affront from any man, yet, as I stand here before God and my country, I must add, that I never knew or heard that he ever gave an offence to man, woman, or child, during the nine years I have had the pleasure of knowing him.</p>
               <p>Lord HOTHAM sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. How long have you known Capt. Macnamara? - A.Ever since the year 1764.</p>
               <p>Q. That is the greatest part of his life? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.During all that time, what has been the Captain's character for good temper? - A. I had an opportunity of seeing a great deal of him; I always found him a gentleman in every respect, always behaved properly and civilly in company; he is a very good-tempered man.</p>
               <p>Lord MINTO sworn. - I have had the honour of knowing Capt. Macnamara ever since 1783, and from that time to the beginning of the year 1797, I had occasion to be very frequently on board the fleet; I had the honour of seeing him on board the ship he commanded; I have had occasion to see him at my own house several times.</p>
               <p>Q. What character does this gentleman bear as to temper and behaviour? - A. In private life, with the opportunity I had of knowing his manners, I always thought him a lively, chearful, good-humoured companion, and never heard that he had occasion to be in any disputation or quarrel in my life; I believe his disposition is exactly the reverse.</p>
               <p>Sir HYDE PARKER sworn. - Examined by Mr. Garrow. Q. How long have you known Captain Macnamara? - A.Ever since the year 1790.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good as state to the Jury what his estimation has been, as far as it has come to your knowledge, from your observation, and the opinions of others, as to his temper and disposition? - A. I am more able to speak to that than any body; his temper was moderate, and far from being quarrelsome; I have frequently heard, that he was that sort of man who would not receive an insult from another, but I never heard of his being quarrelsome; nor do I know, among all the little things that happen on board ship, any quarrel on his part; his character is that of a very honours able and respectable man in every point of view.</p>
               <p>Sir THOMAS TROWBRIDGE sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You are one of the Lords of the Admiralty? - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q.How long have you known Captain 
               <persName id="t18030420-2-person85">Macnamara</persName>
            ? - A.Eight or ten years.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you been in habits of intimacy with him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What have you observed of his character for good nature and humanity? - A. I never saw him quarrel; I have been in habits of intimacy with him a long time; he is a good tempered man, I never saw in him a disposition to quarrel.</p>
               <p>General CHURCHILL sworn. - Examined by Mr. Erskine. Q.How long have you known Captain Macnamara? - A.Two years; I knew him first in the West Indies; I was introduced to him by a friend, and I thought myself indebted to that friend for his introducing to my acquaintance a gentleman of such known good character. I failed, with him from Jamaica, and lived in his cabin; I considered him a man of the strictest honour, and a good-humoured, lively companion; I know from a particular circumstance that occurred during our acquaintance, that he is far from being a quarrelsome man.</p>
               <p>The prisoner also called Capt. George Martin, Mr. Phillips, Capt. Towley, Dr. Bain, Mr. Charles Wright, Capt. Liddiard, Capt. Waller, Capt. Graham Moore, and Capt. Fellows, who gave him a similar character.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, James Macnamara, the prisoner at the bar, stands charged with the crime of manslaughter, in feloniously discharging a pistol loaded with ball, and giving a mortal wound to Robert Montgomery, of which he died. Your province, Gentlemen, will be very limited indeed on this occasion, because that fact has not only been proved by witnesses, but acknowledged by the prisoner himself in the defence he has made. The crime of manslaughter consists in slaying a man under sudden provocation. Fortunately for the prisoner in this case - very fortunately for the prisoner, we are not to examine the extent of that provocation. Though true it is there was a sudden quarrel between the parties, yet a very considerable time intervened between that quarrel and the time of fighting the duel; and if the inquisition had found the prisoner guilty of murder, then you would have had the most painful<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180304200020"></xptr>task to enquire whether there was time for the passions to cool (for the law is a stranger to all those nice sentiments of honour) and if there was, it would have amounted to murder. Gentlemen, a great deal of evidence has been gone into; it is not necessary for me to state to you particularly what that evidence is; it is fresh in your memory; and it appears, that afterwards, in consequence of this sudden quarrel, they parted from each other; they afterwards met - how they met, and by what appointment they met, does not appear; but it does appear they met at Chalk-farm, which is a considerable distance from the place of quarrel (a considerable space of time having elapsed) and decided their quarrel in the manner you have heard; and, as it now appears in evidence, the deceased died in consequence of a shot discharged from a pistol by the prisoner. The prisoner has acknowledged the fact, which appears also upon the evidence, and, therefore, however high his character may stand upon the evidence he has called, that ought not to influence your verdict. The only question for you to try is, whether, in a quarrel under a sudden provocation like this, and as this must now be taken to be, the deceased did not fall in the manner I have stated, by the hand and act of the prisoner. That appears to me most clear, both upon the evidence given, and upon the prisoner's own acknowledgement. Consider of your verdict, Gentlemen.</p>

            . My husband's name is James Smith. On the 3rd of December last, the prisoner met me at the corner of Park-lane, the Oxford-street end; it was between eleven and twelve when he accosted me; he accosted me after the same manner as if I was an unfortunate woman; he said, if I chused to go and have any concern with him, he would give me a shilling; I told him I wanted nothing to do with him, to go about his business; he would find enough to answer his purpose. I then walked away from him. He crossed over the way. I saw nothing more of him for near half an hour afterwards, then I was going down Park-lane when he met me again.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be so long in the street there - A. I was waiting for my husband. He then asked me if I was in the same mind; I told him, I was, certainly. He told me it would be better for me to comply. He walked away, and I walked away; I walked towards Oxford-street. He walked the other way. I walked down <placeName id="t18141026-9-crimeloc43">Park-street</placeName>

He there met me, he there told me I had better comply; I told him, I should not. He told me it should be worse for me, not to give him any more of my impudence, or he would not leave me an eye to look out of, nor should I be able to tell who hurt me; that he spoke to me. I then went to turn myself sideways from him, he gave me a blow on the side of my head, which knocked me down to the ground; I cried out murder, and endeavoured to rise, and before I got up he repeated his blow, and knocked me down again; he then kicked between my shoulders, and my neck, and at the same time I felt a violent pull at my side, which tore off my pocket, and the front of my petticoat. What passed afterwards I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see whose hand did that - A. It was him that did it; I am sure of it; there was no one near. What passed afterwards, I know not. The blow entirely deprived me of my senses.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you come to yourself - A. I did not come to myself until the latter end of the week following; I was without my senses until the surgeon opened my head, and took the bruised blood out.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you in your pocket - A. I had an eighteen-penny piece, a shilling, a sixpence, and eighteen pennyworth of copper, I do not know whether it was in halfpence or penny-pieces; I think I had two farthings. That is all I know that passed between him and me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not I give you any money - A. No, you did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not you in a public-house in Oxford-street with me - A. I never went into that public-house with you; I never went a yard of ground with you.</p>
               <p>JEREMIEH ABEL. I am a watchman. On the night of the 3rd of September, I was in North-row; I heard the prosecuterix

In going to her, I met the prisoner runing from her; he was very nigh one hundred yards off her, when I met him, he was runing, as fast as he could; he was in North-row. He got past me; I called out stop him; the patrol stopped him. He<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181410260012"></xptr>dropped the pocket and the piece of petticoat when the patrol stopped him. The night constable examined what was in the pocket; I did not. I left the prisoner with the patrol. I went to the woman; I found her bleeding very much, and laying speechless; she was quite senseless when I picked her up.</p>
               <p>JOHN BESTWIELS. I am the patrol, I was in North-street on the night of the 3rd of September; I heard the shrik of the woman; the watchman called out stop him. I stopped the prisoner; he was running as fast as he could. I took him to the watch-house; I saw the pocket down at our feet; I did not see the prisoner drop it. I had hold of the prisoner, scuffling with him to stop him. The prisoner acknowledged that he tore the pocket from the woman; the prisoner was taken to the watch-house by Jeremieh Abel, the watchman. I was present when it was examined; there where in it an eightteen penny piece; a shilling, a sixpence, and eightteen penny worth of copper. The prisoner was present when it was examined. The night constable took possession of the pocket and the money, to produce it at Malborough Street office.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not I tell you that I gave some money to this girl - A. You said something about it she contradicted you, therefore I took little notice of what you said.</p>

             was brought into the watch-house at the same time; she was in a fainting state and covered with blood; it was some minutes before she could speak to me. When she could speak, she said, she had been knocked down, and robbed of her pocket. The prisoner was nearer to me than the prosecutor. After she gave me the charge, the prisoner said he gave her an eighteen penny-piece for her to accommodate him, and afterwards she refused to accommodate him; she refused to give him the eighteen penny-piece back again. He told me he wanted to get the eightteen penny-piece back again; she tumbled down and that is the way the blood came. I examined the pocket.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met this girl at the corner of Duke-street, Oxford-street; I made my bargain with her, to stroke her for eighteen pence, I had no more about me only three pence and a pound note. I went to Mr.

             the publican in Oxford-road; she was with me. I asked him for change of the pound note; he said, he had no change. I asked him to lend me eighteen pence, and I would leave the pound note with him. I asked him for liquor; he would not give me any, I went out with this girl. I gave her the eighteen penny piece; I went with her as far as Park street, then she unbuttoned my breeches, and took two pence out of my pocket, and put it in her own pocket; she strove to get out of my hands; I kept hold of her until her petticoat broke; she fell down, I saw the watchman by the side of me; I passed the watchman, and dropped the pocket out of my hand. I have two witnesses but they are not here to day; I hope your honour and the Gentleman of the jury, will give me liberty to have my witnesses to morrow.</p>

On Monday night, there was an overdriven ox in the street; I went to the door to prevent the people breaking the window, the prisoner, with several others, came up to the door, saying,</p>
               <p>"Take care, here he comes;" the ox was coming. I received a blow on my shoulder, and immediately felt my watch being drawn from my fob. I put my hand down to protect it, it had not got out of my fob; I caught hold of my watch, the prisoner drew it through my hand, by some means or other. I touched the outer case, which came off, and he made his way through the mob with the watch - it was about six o'clock in the evening; I pursued, and as I passed through the gang, I received a blow on my side, which took my breath away, till I got about six houses off. I then cried Stop thief! I was only a few yards from him, keeping my eye on him, and crying Stop thief! He was turning up Black Horse-yard, and was stopped - I never lost sight of him from the time he took the watch, till he was stopped. At the time he was seized, I received another blow on my head - the watch was picked up in the kennel, a few yards from him, I am certain of him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. How could you swear to me - A. He looked me full in the face before he took it.</p>

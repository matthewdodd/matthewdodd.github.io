               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You never saw him till he was in custody? A. No; this is the Fire-office prosecution; I did not send 10l. up in a letter, nor did any body, to my knowledge - none of my ricks or barns have been burnt down yet; they were all safe when I came away.</p>
               <p>CHARLES CRAKANTHORP. I belong to the General Post-office, in London. This letter bears the post-mark of the 10th of March.</p>
               <p>THOMAS SHEPHERD. I am a deliverer of letters in the country. This letter came to our office at Bicester, and I delivered it at the house of Mr. Parker on the 11th of March.</p>
               <p>THE REV. HALLIFIELD COSGOYNE O'DONNUGHUE. I am a clergyman. The prisoner was employed by me for about three months, to copy manuscripts; I have had frequent opportunities of seeing him write, and know his hand-writing - to the best of my knowledge and belief, this letter is his hand-writing; I have no doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Where do you live? A. I am curate of High Wycomb, Bucks. I have not been in any trouble lately - I was discharged under the Insolvent Debtors' Act, about two years ago; the prisoner was not a creditor of mine at any time, except for his labour from time to time - the last time I had employed him was in June or July last year; I had other persons engaged in copying at the same time - when this letter was first put into my hands I had nothing else put into my hands with it, but I had brought a sheet of his writing with me that as there had been a lapse of some months I might compare it, or I do not think I could have spoken to it, at least I could not have spoken decidedly as to my belief -I had had no dispute with the prisoner about payment till just as I was leaving London, and he had not given me credit for some small sums which I had paid him - there was some dispute about those claims, but I paid him previous to leaving London, about June or July; there is nothing now claimed to be due to him, that I have heard of - his wife washed for me, and the two accounts were mixed up together, and rather than have any dispute I settled the whole; I did not think I owed him so much, and I think so still - I have no unfriendly feeling towards him, and if the Court permitted I could show that I have not, by my subsequent conduct; I do not know how they found me out - I received an application from the solicitor of the fire-office, and I attended; if I had not had the opportunity of making the comparison I spoke of I could not have spoken so positively as I now do, to my belief of his hand-writing- when the letter was first shown to me I said it was not the hand in which he wrote for me, but in a more general scrawling hand, as he had taken pains when he wrote for me; I would not have sworn to its being his hand-writing at that distance of time, but for the comparison which I made.</p>

               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q.What did you do with it when it was shown to you? A. I hesitated a considerable time about it, not from doubt, but looking at the consequence it might be to the prisoner if I gave a rash or hasty answer; the prisoner was not a sufferer by me, or a creditor on my schedule - I never had any difference with him of any nature, sort, or kind, which would induce me to seek to do him any injury.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You have stated that without this comparison you could not have sworn to your belief, but when you saw the paper now produced what was your belief as to the character of the hand-writing? A.Generally speaking I thought it his, but not with the certainty to swear to it - the impression upon my mind when it was produced was, that it was the hand-writing of the prisoner; if I had been asked as to my belief whether it was the hand-writing of the prisoner, or not upon its first production, and none of those important consequences had attached to it which I have spoken of, I should unquestionably have said it was the hand-writing of the prisoner - when I saw the paper now produced I believed it to be the hand-writing of the prisoner, but thinking it a case attended with serious consequences to him I was anxious to compare it with a writing I knew to be his - having now compared them I have no doubt whatever that this paper is the prisoner's writing, and I believe the address to be the same hand-writing as the other part. (Letter read.)</p>
               <p>JOSEPH MARTIN. I am a City-officer. In consequence of information I went to the Bell and Crown, Holborn, to wait for a person who was coming for a parcel - it was on a Monday night, and I think the 14th of March; I inquired for the Kidderminster coach - they said it came to the Bull; I went there, but did not see any person that night - I went to the Bull again on the following morning, and from some information there I went to the Bell and Crown again a little before eleven o'clock; I received information, and went into the street - I saw a woman coming out of the office with a brown paper parcel in her hand; she walked down Holborn, and put it into her right-hand pocket - she walked up Farringdon-street till she got to Farringdon-market; she then took it from her pocket opened it, and put it into a basket she had with her, loose, as she had broken it open, and walked through the market to the further end; I and Herdsfield went up to her, and told her we wanted to speak to her - she told us where she lived; Herdstield took her into custody, and I went, in consequence of what she had said, to No. 32, Kingsgate-street; I knocked four times at the door, and the prisoner himself opened it - I told him I wanted to speak to him; we went up stairs together into his room, which he showed me; I found another person, named Cross there, writing a letter - I addressed myself to both of them, and said, "I am come from a person you sent for a parcel;" the prisoner and Cross both said they did not send any one - I said, "She says so, and you must come with me, and prove you have not sent her;" they came with me, and I left the prisoner at the watch-house while I went with Cross to see what had become of the woman - I found Herdsfield and her waiting at the corner, facing Gray's-Inn lane - I then took Cross and the prisoner to Guildhall, and the prisoner's wife went with Herdsfield; I say his wife, because she acknowledged he was her husband at the watch-house, and he said she was his wife - I do not remember the words she used; I believe she said that was her husband, and they also admitted it on the several examinations - on the first examination the case was not thought to reach the prisoner, and he was remanded till the following Friday - he was afterwards examined and committed.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183104070077"></xptr>Cross-examined. Q.Did you find the prisoner to be a shoemaker, and to live at the place to which his wife directed you? A. Yes; I think they said he had lived there three or four months - he gave a true answer to all the questions I put to him; I do not recollect Herdsfield observing that he behaved like a man - it was on the 15th that he went to the office; I asked him to write his own name, and to write "Swing," which he did - I asked him where Mr. O'Donnughue lived, and he took me to where he had lived; the prisoner remained in custody on the first day for about an hour and a half, and was then allowed to go where he pleased - he was not called on to find sureties; I do not know that he told me he would come when I wanted him, but I left word on the night before for him to come and meet me, and I met him the next day in Holborn - I believe he was coming to meet me; the prosecutor did not say that he knew Cross - the woman went to Farringdon-market; a person going from the Bell to where the prisoner lived would not go through Farringdon-market - it is quite a different road; the prisoner appeared again on the Friday, and then he was kept in custody - Cross had not been discharged till the prisoner came in the second time; he is now upon bail - the prisoner's wife is now in Newgate; the prisoner appeared as though he was regularly engaged in work as a shoe-maker; he seemed as if he had just got up.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You have been asked if the prisoner told you what was true - have you any means of judging whether what he told you was true or not? A. No; he said he had not sent for that parcel - I do not think his wife, in his presence, said any thing on that subject; from what I had heard, I asked the prisoner if he knew such a gentleman as Mr. O'Donnughue; he took me to where he had lodged, and the solicitor afterwards found him; we had not the original letter then.</p>
               <p>THOMAS HERDSFIELD. This is the parcel I took from the woman - it is directed "For A. B., to be left at the Bell and Crown, Holborn, London, till called for;" and on the back "Carriage paid."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You have heard what was stated by Martin, as to the conduct of the prisoner? A. I was only with him once or twice, but during the opportunities I had of seeing the prisoner, his answers were given readily, voluntarily, and truly.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have nothing to say, only that I am quite innocent; every thing that laid in my power, I endeavoured to trace out, for the satisfaction of these gentlemen, and to prove my innocence; according to the witnesses you will find that to be true.</p>

            . I am a sculptor, and live at No. 22, Grafton-street East, Fitzroy-square. I have known the prisoner from two to three years - I have seen him write more than once or twice; I do not believe this letter, or any part of it, to be his hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You are a sculptor - what means have you had of knowing his handwriting? A. I have known his wife's family - I have employed her brother, and I have gone to the house where the prisoner resides, and seen him write upwards of two or three times - I cannot tell what he wrote, but I have seen him write, and I have some of his writing in my pocket now; I have seen this letter within the last half-hour - I had heard of this affair, and as I knew the prosecutor and the prisoner, I was solicited to come here and say what I knew - he never was employed by me as a writer but I have seen him in the act of writing at his own lodging.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do you believe that to be his hand-writing? A. I do not.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is that opinion formed on the character of the hand-writing of the prisoner? A. Yes - I think the letters are made differently, particularly the beginning and the ending of the B; I cannot tell whether this is a natural or a disguised hand-writing, but it is a very different hand from what I have seen the prisoner write; not knowing the writer of this letter, I cannot say whether this is the natural undisguised writing of the person who wrote it- I should think it is a natural hand-writing, but that is a mere matter of opinion; I considered I was summoned here to-day, that I might state what I knew of the prisoner's character; I had no intimation that I should be called to speak to his hand-writing - I saw this paper about half an hour ago, for the first time; it appears to me distinct from the prisoner's hand-writing; I should never take it for it - I can trace as little similarity as I can in the features of one person's face and another.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you answer this question fairly and openly; do you trace any similarity, or not? A.Very little - I trace none that would deceive me; there may be a little, but I should not have taken it for his hand-writing - there may be a little similarity, but very remote; I do not trace any.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. You have stated you have seen the prisoner write; have you seen his writing so as to form a judgment of his hand-writing? A. Yes, when I have been in his room he has been writing a large portion of time, and I have over-looked it; I have received superscriptions from him, which I have known to he his hand-writing directly I saw it - I distinctly state that I know the hand-writing of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>ALICIA ERNBLOUNT. I live at No. 7, New Turnstile, Holborn - I keep a chandler's shop, and my husband is a tailor. I know the prisoner - he lodged in my house nearly two years; I saw him write several times, a dozen times at least; on one occasion I got him to write a letter for me to a charity in Portman-place - this letter is not at all like what I have seen him write; I do not believe it to be his writing - it is not at all the style in which he wrote letters for me; it is not the make of the letters.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q.What else did he write for you besides the letter you speak of? A. He wrote bills, and I do not think this to be at all like his hand-writing; I had seen this letter before - a gentleman called on me one Saturday, and showed me this letter and another; I did not tell him this was not at all like his hand-writing- I said I could not say; I did not feel myself obliged to answer.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did that gentleman tell you he came on the part of the prosecution? A. No - I have known the prisoner about three years and a half in all; I have found him a sober, honest, industrious man, and that was the reference I had with him.</p>

               <p>JURY. Q. Can you write yourself? A. Yes; the bills<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183104070078"></xptr>I spoke of were what he made out in his own business for boots and shoes which I gave him to repair.</p>

            BUBB re-examined. Q.You said you did not come here under any expectation of having your attention called to the prisoner's hand-writing, but to his character; how did it happen that you brought any of his writing with you? A. I have had it in my pocket some time -I happened accidentally to feel my pocket-book, and it is in it; a week ago I heard of this, and I looked for a bit of his writing, and put it into my pocket-book.</p>
               <p>Q.Then it was purely accidental that you had that writing about you, owing to your having this dress on? A. Yes - I work in one dress, and put on another.</p>
               <p>Q. But how came you to bring the pocket-book with that bit of writing to-day, if you had no reason to expect it would be wanted? A. I thought I should like to see the letter, and I thought if there were any doubt on my mind I might compare it - my object in putting it in my pocket-book was certainly to compare it, but to-day I did not know I had it in my pocket till I came; I put it into my pocket first of all with an intention of bringing it, but yesterday I came without it, and to-day I had it - I brought it here intentionally.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. How long have you known the prisoner? A.From two to three years - his character for honesty, quietness, and uprightness of disposition has been as good as I have ever known of any man.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker, and live at No. 7, Little Turnstile - the prisoner is a cousin of mine. I have known him these twenty years - he lodged with me three years, and worked for me; he has been strictly honest, industrious, and sober.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Do you know your cousin's hand-writing? A. I have seen him write a great many times; I should not like to swear to his writing, but I believe I know his hand-writing - I do not believe this to be his hand-writing; this is more formal than his general hand - the letters are bolder than his, and they are not made in the same way.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe this other to be his hand-writing? A. No, Sir - I am equally certain about this; I think them both alike (looking at another) - I cannot swear to this; I do not believe it is his - his is a scrawling hand-writing, not like this.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS to J.G. BUBB. Q. Is this paper the prisoner's hand-writing? A. It is a great deal more like the prisoner's hand-writing than the other - I should rather think it is; it is like his hand-writing more than the other - I should take it to be his hand-writing; (looking at another) I think it very likely to be his handwriting - I should give my opinion in the affirmative; I should say Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS to MRS. ERNBLOUNT. Q. Do you believe this paper to be the prisoner's hand-writing?

            . I am a grocer, and live at Langley. On the 19th of October, the prisoner offered me one pound of gunpowder in a canister - he asked me 1s. 6d. for it - I said, I was not in want of it; I had plenty - he said, he had three dozen canisters, which he had bought at a gentleman's sale in London, and I could have what quantity I liked - he came again on the Saturday in the next week, and brought nine other canisters, and some salt herrings, which I had ordered of him - I delivered the canisters of gunpowder to the officer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is it an unusual thing in a small town, for different tradesmen to deal in gunpowder? A. No; I believe the prisoner is a fishmonger - I did not think 1s. 6d. a pound a suspicious price for this; it was more than I was giving - I did not buy it; it was left for me to prove it.</p>

            . I am a butcher. The prisoner offered me three canisters of gunpowder, for 4s. - it was on a Wednesday; I do not know what day of the month it was - he said, he had them of a boat-man, to whom he gave a ride.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where do you live? A. At Iver; I did live at Watford, in the employ of a butcher, but I did not suit him; he did not accuse me of robbing him - I suspected the prisoner had stolen this powder, as I had seen a printed bill just before.</p>

            . On the 21st of October, I saw the prisoner; he told me, he had got something that would suit me; I asked what it was; he said, a canister of powder which a man had let him have for riding in his cart, and he could let me have it cheap; he asked 1s. 6d. for it - I said, I did not want it, as my master found me in powder and shot, but if he would take 1s. for it, I would have it; he said, if I would stand a pint of beer, I should have it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You know gunpowder? A. Yes when I see it; but I did not see this - I let Ballantine have it at the price I gave for it.</p>

On the 21st of October, the prisoner offered the last witness the powder at the George Inn, where I live; and on the following morning I saw the prisoner again - he asked me if I thought I could sell him half a dozen canisters of powder- I told him I did not know, but there was a shooting match to come off at our house, and very likely I might - he said, I was to get what I could for them, as he had one hundred canisters to sell.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. In whose employ were you last? Mr. Gilbert, a grocer to work in his garden - I was ostler at the George - I should have been thatching with a farmer's man, if I had not been here to-day - no money passed between the prisoner and me; he said, the gunpowder was worth 1s. 6d. a pound - I was to get what I could for it.</p>
               <p>JOHN BIRCH. I am a constable at Uxbridge. I received these ten canisters of powder, of Mr. White, on the 26th of October.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you take the prisoner? A. Yes, on the 25th of October - I told him on what charge - I went several days afterwards in search of a person named Littleboy - he was taken by an officer, and escaped from him - he went through some deep water, and the officer did not follow him.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did the prisoner direct you to any house in London, where he had bought three dozen at a sale? A. No - he said he had this one cannister of a boatman, and the other of Littleboy.</p>

               <p>in the Mercantile Marine Office, established by the Board of Trade in Poplar—the prisoner is a seaman in the Royal Naval Reserve—on 30th September, 1864, the prisoner came to me—I know the date from the document—he came for a quarter's retainer—by the Act of Parliament passed in accord<lb></lb>ance with a Commission which sat for the better manning of the Navy, this force was brought into use—the men were to receive 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. annually, and were required to perform twenty-eight drills in the year—in order to show that they have done their drill they produce a book of this kind—the prisoner produced this book to me (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is a certificate book, and is handed to him when he joins the force—it is on the entries made in that book that he is paid the retainer—on the faith of entries as to drill we make the pay<lb></lb>ment—on the day the prisoner came he presented this book to me—I looked at it to see whether he was entitled to the retainer for which he applied—it appeared by the book that he had then performed twenty-eight days' drill for that year—fourteen at one time and fourteen at another—on the faith of that entry I paid him 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on 17th September—he had been paid at our office before, but not by me—I was not present at the time.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COLLINS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you pay him the money, how does he acknow<lb></lb>ledge the receipt of it? A. By signing a schedule called Schedule 24—there is a receipt for 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. acknowledged by the prisoner—he made no state<lb></lb>ment at all at that time—the next time that I remember seeing him was, I should think, about a month ago—he then stated to me that he had received a letter from the Registrar General of seamen, that he had been to his office, and had seen a gentleman there who had been very saucy to him—I asked him the reason and he said he had accused him of making an alteration in his book—he said he had been accused of altering his book from seven days to fourteen—I said, "Did you make the alteration?"—he said, "It was seven in my book, but it ought to have been ten, and I altered it to fourteen."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Before entering this Royal Naval Reserve, I believe you have to serve a certain number of years as a seaman? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The regula<lb></lb>tions require that a man should be one year at sea as an able seaman, and, I believe, five years as an ordinary seaman, or some such regulations—they must have certificates of character before entering the service—I am not prepared to say in whose writing these figures, "Sept 8th. to 22d" are—I presume the entry would be made by one of the officers on Her Majesty's drill-ship President—I should imagine that the paymaster, or his assistant, would make it—if I had seen nothing more than "Sept. 8th to 22d," I should have paid the money—we never make any calculations whatever—it does not follow that he would perform fourteen days—he may have been absent part of the time—the officer of the drill-ship will tell you in what book entries are made of the days on which the man serves, Mr. Adams, the assistant paymaster—I have no other book to which I refer—the entry of the day's drill would be in the writing of the officers of the drill ships—it may be that the man is drilled at one of the out ports—I can swear this book was produced to me, because there is my entry in it—I have no hesitation in saying that that was in the same state then as it is now—the absentee book relates to the drill-ship <hi rend="italic">President</hi>—that is a matter I have nothing to do with—I am not aware there is an absentee book; but there is a drill book giving the registry of the number of drills—this book shows that the prisoner has performed twenty-eight days' drill, and also that he has received</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186605070045"></xptr>
               <p>four more retainers—a person who receives these retainers is entitled to 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year after fifteen years' service—I do not know whether the prisoner has been discharged from the Naval Reserve—I am not aware whether he would be discharged in the event of a conviction—these accounts are examined by the Registrar General of seamen—I should suppose the accounts of Septem<lb></lb>ber 30th, 1864, would be audited a very few days afterwards—when this 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was obtained, it was a quarter day, and we are then unusually busy; we have from two to three hundred come on that day, which we do not have on other days, otherwise I should have noticed this alteration—I did not detect the alteration—of course our accounts are kept, and we cannot send them for a few days—it may have been a week before the Registrar General would have it—when he got it into his possession, he would have an opportunity of observing—he would have detected that inaccuracy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COLLINS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know, as a fact, that the alteration was dis<lb></lb>covered afterwards? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The error was discovered, in the number of days, that is to say the discrepancy between the returns from Her Majesty's drill<lb></lb>ship, and the returns sent up by us—it does not follow that a Naval Reserve man must come to the same station to be paid each year—he may go where he pleases to any place where there is a Mercantile Marine office, or a Custom House.</p>

                  </hi>. I am chief clerk in the Registry Office of sea<lb></lb>men, in a branch department of the Board of Trade, at Adelaide-place, London Bridge—on 31st March this year, I directed a letter to be written to the prisoner to attend at the office, and bring his book with him—I saw him on 2d April, and asked him if his name was Beer—he said, "Yes"—I had this book in my hand—I held it towards him, and asked if that was his book; he said that it was—I asked him how many day's drill he had done on board the <hi rend="italic">President</hi> in September, 1864—I told him the command<lb></lb>ing officer of the <hi rend="italic">President</hi> had reported that he had only done seven—he said, "I have done more than seven, I did ten"—I told him it could not have been ten, it must either have been seven or fourteen—he then said, "Well, I think it was ten; but I altered the figures to fourteen."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When did it first come to your notice that 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. had been paid for these fourteen days? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Shortly after 30th September, 1864—we then had the name of Horatio Beer at the office registered as a volunteer—the books are issued from every office—we have means of knowing when a man has finished his drill on one ship to what other ship he goes—we next heard where he was on 26th April, 1865—he had finished twenty-one day's drill on board the <hi rend="italic">Eagle</hi> at Liverpool—we knew that he was at Liver<lb></lb>pool—we knew he had been there and drilled—we had the report that he was at Liverpool, on 26th April, 1865—shortly after that we sent to Liver<lb></lb>pool, and he could not be found—we have the return made of a man when he has completed the drill—I know nothing of him till he has completed the drill, let it be seven, fourteen, or eleven—these accounts were audited very shortly after the 24th September—I had not the prisoner's book at that time—he keeps that—we compare with the returns sent to the office—the other book I have not got—the officer of the ship is here with the returns.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LEWIS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where are the returns sent from the ship? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think I have what you require here—this is a return from the drift-ship <hi rend="italic">President</hi>, reporting that Horatio Beer did seven day from the 8th to the 27th—this is the paper I had before me in Oct 1864—it is signed by the then com<lb></lb>manding officer, William Mole—a man gets 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for serving seven days—if he serves ten or eleven days we do not allow that—he is not paid for the odd days—anything short of the seven days is a loss to the man; the labour is given for nothing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COLLINS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If a man serves seven days he gets days 30<hi rend="italic">s.? A. Yes</hi>; and if he does not serve seven days he does not get it—although the prisoner had been drilling at different places We could not tell at the head office where he was until he had drilled—he drilled twice at Liverpool and once at Glasgow, and then the accounts were queried, but I could not catch him until he came back.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LEWIS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was he taken into custody? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I applied for a warrant—I do not know that he surrendered himself at the police-court.</p>

               <p>—<hi rend="smallCaps">ADAMS</hi>. I am assistant-paymaster of Her Majesty's ship <hi rend="italic">President</hi>—I was there in September, 1864—it is part of my duty to enter in this book the number of days' drill performed by the naval volunteers—when I enter it in this book, I also enter it in several books of the men—the prisoner performed, between the 8th and 22d September, 1864, seven and a half days' drill, that counts as seven days—I had his book in my posses<lb></lb>sion—when he came on board to drill he gave me that book—when he went away I gave him that book back—I had made an entry there of seven days—this 14 is not in my writing, the remainder is, the 14 is not—to the best of my belief, where this 14 now is, there was 7 before—I believe the prisoner was one day sick during that time—that does not count as a drill.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What do the full crosses mean? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A whole day's drill, and the half cross a half day—I made these crosses—I cannot tell whether I made that alteration, the scratching out the A. B.—it is very likely the captain of the ship made that—the entries are in my writing—supposing it was my scratching out, I must have made a mistake—I might have put a cross instead of absent—the absentee-book is on board the ship—this book shows nine days' drill, but a man is only allowed one Sunday and one Saturday in a week's drill, in seven days' drill—here there are two Saturdays and two Sundays—the second Sunday does not count for a day at all, and the second Saturday counts for half a day, which makes seven and a half days' drill—we must mark up the Sundays to enable us to count up the weeks' drill, that is the rule they have on board the ship—a man who comes on board the ship comes to me and is entered, and his address is taken—there is no muster-roll—each man is mustered by his instructor every morning—if a man fails to come to me, when he comes on board, he Would not be on drill at all, he would not be entered in the books—they drill in different parts of the ship, at different times, under different gunners, but they must come to me first—it is quite possible a man may be on hoard the ship without being on the books, but he would not be paid, and his drills would not count—it is only to start with that be comes to me to be entered—I make these crosses and half crosses because I know the man is on board—I know it because he has not been reported absent to me—the accuracy of this book depends on the accuracy of the absentee account—I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186605070047"></xptr>
               <p>do not know whether it is accurate or not—in the case of this correction a man must have been reported absent—I must have found it in the absentee list afterwards, and corrected it.</p>

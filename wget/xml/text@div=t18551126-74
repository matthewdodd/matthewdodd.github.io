                  </hi>. On 15th Nov., about 6 o'clock in the evening, I was at New Charlton, in the Manor Way, acting as watchman to Mr. Smith's premises—he is a contractor, and there is timber and wood on his premises—I saw the prisoner coming from the premises, with a plank on his shoulder, and I was going towards them—I knew him before, and he knew that I was the watchman—it was a foggy night, and he could not see me before he came near me—he could not see five yards before him—I said, "Halloo, what have you got there?"—he said, "I am going to Mr. Fuller's, the coal merchant's, and have got 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to take this there"—I followed him some distance—he put it down, and said, "Let us go and have some beer; it does not come from your place"—I refused, and detained it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in Mr. Wardell's employment; he keeps a sawing machine at Woolwich. On 18th Nov., in the afternoon, I saw some deal planks safe on his wharf, at half past 4 o'clock—the pile of planks was near the river, near Charlton pier, eighteen or twenty yards from the shore—I missed one of them next morning—I have seen the plank taken from the prisoner, and believe it to be the one—it had "3" on it, which means third quality—there was no appearance of its having been in the water—it was quite dry.</p>

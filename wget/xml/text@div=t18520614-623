                  </hi>. I am a widow, living at 61, Noble-street, St. Luke's. I have known the prisoner by sight about nine months, as near as I can recollect—one Sunday morning, some time ago, I was taking my dinner to the baker's; he accosted me, and asked me if I had apartments to let—I said I did not know, when did he want them—he said, "To-morrow"—I said I should have to inquire into his character—he said, "Are you a widow?"—I said, "Yes; why?"—he said, "Because I am single, and perhaps we may make a match of it"—I left word, in the evening, that I had no apartments for him—nearly three weeks afterwards he came, under the pretence of having some shirts made; he conducted himself in a very shameful manner; he wished to take improper liberties, and I turned him out myself—he has not been to the house again, but he has annoyed me ever since—on 22nd May, about half past 9 o'clock, when it was nearly dark, I went to take some linen in; as I was paying the money, the prisoner came in, and said, "Now Mrs. Robinson, you have been my ruin; d—you, I will do for you"—he then struck me a violent blow with a hammer on the right side of my head; it cut through my bonnet, and my head bled profusely—he said he was very sorry he had not quite done it—I succeeded in getting the hammer from him, and he was given in charge—I then became insensible for some minutes, and do not remember what took place—I did not feel insensible till he was gone,</p>

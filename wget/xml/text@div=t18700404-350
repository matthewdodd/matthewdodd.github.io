I am a milkman, of 9, Barrington Street, Netting Hill—on 5th January I was with Olden, at Hammersmith Police Court, in the afternoon, and heard him and Lusher having words outside the Court—Olden asked Lusher for his name and address, as Lusher said he was a detective, and he asked the summonsing officer if he knew it—he said that he knew his name but not his address—on the evening of that day I was with Olden at the corner of Silchester and Bramley roads, with Byron and Kersey—the prosecutor and Lusher passed, and Olden asked Lusher if he was in the same mind then as he was in the afternoon at the Police Court—he also said, "You said you could <hi rend="italic">lick</hi> three or four like me in the afternoon"—Lusher said that he did not fight—they had several words, and he then pulled out his life-preserver from his inside pocket, and said "This is what I settle such b——s as you with"—I heard that distinctly—I was in the presence of Olden and Donald as long as they remained at the corner of the road—Olden uttered no threats to Donald during that time—he did not speak to him—if he had said so, I should think I must have heard him, I was standing close to them—I was standing there when the two sergeants came up—Olden asked the officers to get Lusher's name and address, as he had been pulling a life-preserver out—Donald and</p>

               <p>Lusher may have been at the corner of Silchester Road about five minute—I and Byron and Olden went down the road into the Black Bull, and found Lusher and Donald there—Olden and Lusher had a few words there, and something was said about fighting—I cannot exactly say the words, and after that Lusher asked Olden to drink, which Olden refused saying that he only drank with men—I did not hear Olden offer any threats to Donald at the Black Bull—Donald was reading the paper all the time and the prisoner did not speak to him at all—if he had used any threats at the Black Bull, I must have heard him.</p>

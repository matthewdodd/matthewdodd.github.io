                  </hi>. I am an out-pensioner of Chelsea Hospital, and live at No. 8, Kirby-street, Borough. On the evening of the 2nd of Dec., about nine o'clock, 1 was in Gracechurch-street, coming from Whitechapel, towards London-bridge, going home—I saw the prisoner at the end of Gracechurch-street, standing at a gateway or court—he said, "Well, old fellow, are you going to stand any gin?"—he spoke to me first—those were the first words he said to me—I made him no answer, but went on—he followed me, and asked me to give him some gin, or a crown-piece, or he would give me in charge of the police for being a b—and a s----I was still walking on when he said this, and he was following me—I had got four or five perches from where he first accosted me—I was still in Gracechurch-street, going towards London-bridge—he still followed, asking me for the crown, or some gin, or he would give me in charge of the first policeman, but I passed several police<lb></lb>men—I was going towards home, and he still followed me—I turned to the right and to the left, out of my way home, to avoid him, and for a proof to know. if he was following me, as I thought at first he might be going the same way as me—I cannot say what streets I went into—he said the same to me there, and he would follow me until morning—I recollect meeting three policemen in my walk—I passed by them, met them on the same side of the way—when he said he would follow me till morning I went on in a direction for home, down near the Monument—I got in the same direction as I had left, going towards the bridge—I did not see a policeman there—I turned back, up the hill again, and gave him in charge to sergeant Taplin, at the corner of East<lb></lb>cheap—he had followed me up the hill again, and was close by me—when I came up to Taplin, I told him to take that man in charge for fol<lb></lb>lowing me and asking me for money—the prisoner on that said he had seen me in some court in a place of convenience—I had not seen him in any such place—I never saw him at all, to my recollection, before he came from the archway in Gracechurch-street—Taplin took him into custody, and I went to the station and gave him in charge.</p>

               <p>cannot tell whereabouts he mentioned the charge the second time—it was a little further on—he kept walking along by the side of me—he kept within a yard or two of me, sometimes alongside of me, and sometimes a bit in the rear of me—altogether he said about nine or ten times that he would charge me with the police for doing this—it was in the public street—I turned out of my right road, between Gracechurch-street and the Monument—there is a place both right and left—I do not know where I turned down—I have lived here nearly two months, and in England eight months—before that I lived at Dublin—I passed the three policemen in the public streets—I had never seen the prisoner before, to my knowledge—it was at the corner of Eastcheap that I gave him into custody, not far from where I first saw him—after turning to the right, I came back again into Gracechurch-street, and then turned in the other direction—there is an opening out of the street, both right and left—to the best of my opinion it was about half an hour from the time he first spoke, till I gave him in charge—besides being a pensioner, I work at Curling's wharf as a labouring man, and sometimes at the Docks, not in regular employ, but when I am wanted.</p>

On the 2nd of Dec. 1 was standing at the corner of Eastcheap, about half-past nine o'clock—the prosecutor came to me with the prisoner—they were both together—the prosecutor said the prisoner had been following him, and annoying him very much, making use of improper language, and wanting to extort 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from him, having called him a b—and a s----; this was all said before the prisoner, and he told the prisoner to go about his business, or he would give him in charge—the prisoner turned round and told the prosecutor he had more right to give him in charge for indecent conduct while he (the prisoner) was making water at the court in Gracechurch-street—I told them the street was not the place to settle business of that sort, the best way was for both to come to the station with me—the prisoner hearing this, ran away into King William-street, across the road—I succeeded in stopping him—he resisted very much—I was obliged to get the assistance of another constable to take him to the station—the prosecutor did not run after him—he stood at the corner of the street, waiting for the prisoner to be brought back.</p>

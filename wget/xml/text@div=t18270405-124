I went out that morning, about twelve o'clock, and did not return till between seven and eight - they were then gone; these are the reins - I know them to be mine: I can swear they have never been untied; they are tied with a particular sort of cord, used in whip-making; they were buckled to a set of chaise harness.</p>

            . I am a doll-maker. On the afternoon of the 26th of February I saw the prisoner go past my shop once or twice, and look at me - I then saw him go to Mr. Pack's, which is next door - he stopped some time, and I went to see if he could get in; I then saw him go away from the door, putting something under his coat - I called to Thomas Dennis, to tell him his mother had been robbed; we followed, and he dropped the reins on my toes; Thomas Dennis took him.</p>

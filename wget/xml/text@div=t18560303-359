                  </hi>. I am a silk manufacturer, and reside at Grosvenor-house, Walthamstow. About 4 or 5 o'clock on the afternoon of 8th Feb. I was passing down Tyson-street, Bethnal-green—I crossed the road towards Virginia-row, just beyond King-street, when the prisoner Jones jumped at my right arm—he came from my side, jumped at my side, and turned my face to the wall, so that I could not see who was in the road—he made a violent snatch at my chain, and pulled me right round again, and I then saw four persons in the road besides Jones, who had then run—they were at equal distances of three or four feet from each other, so as to allow Jones to go up King-street—they were at the side of me, not surrounding me—I had scarcely got on the payement, I was on the kerb—Jones succeeded in stealing my seals, key, and locket, and ran away—I instantly pursued, and a thief who is not in custody made a blow at my head, intending to knock me down, but I <hi rend="italic">bobbed</hi>, and knocked off my hat—after I escaped from that one, Martin fell on all fours—I instantly jumped over him, and I had not run twenty yards before I caught Jones—we had a desperate encounter—I swang him to the ground, and caught hold of the skirt of his coat, and he went round like a humming top, and kicked out in all directions at my shins, so that I was forced to let him go—I then gave him a good chase for at least three quarters of a mile, and after I had caught him a second time Martin came up to me, and took my attention off Jones, saying, "You have got the wrong man there"—I knew I had not, because I saw my property in his hands—he said, "There runs the man (pointing down Tyson-street) that has got your seals"—Jones then got his handkerchief loose, and got my finger into his mouth, and nearly bit it off—we had half an hour's struggle—Martin was present all that time—Martin then laid hold of Jones's right arm, and seeing that I was getting the better of Jones he made a violent kick—I can show you my trowsers where he kicked me—he kicked me on the legs—I was forced to leave go of Jones on that account, and then Martin, to prevent my following Jones, took'me right round my waist, lifted me off the ground, and said, "Sir, it is no use your following that youth; you will get murdered, man"—what took place then I cannot exactly say, for we were then opposite the Pitt's Head, and Martin says I offered him a glass of ale; very likely I did—I took hold of his arm—I could not hold him till any one came to my assistance, I was forced to get him into the Pitt's Head—I walked in with him, and called on the landlord for his assistance—Martin then attempted to get out—he butted at me, and tried to get out, but with the landlord's assistance he was prevented, and was given into custody.</p>

About 5 or 6 o'clock on the afternoon in ques<lb></lb>tion, Mr. Cluff came into my house together with Martin—I was in my bar parlour at tea—as soon as I came out to the bar Mr. Cluff addressed me, saying, "Pardon me, Sir, but I call on you to assist me to give this man in custody for being concerned, with others, in robbing and ill using me"—I sent for a policeman—if the prisoner made any reply to the charge which the prosecutor made, I paid no attention to it—I do not know that he did, there might have been some words—I said, "Whatever you have got to say you must say it at the station house, for I have nothing at all to do with it"—he made an effort to get away, he and the prosecutor were strug<lb></lb>gling together—I went round the counter and laid hold of him, and turned the mob out from the front of the bar and closed the door, and when the policeman came I gave him into custody.</p>

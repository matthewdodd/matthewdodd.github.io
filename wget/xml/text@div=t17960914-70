               <p>I am a gun-maker; I work for Mr. Reynolds: about an hour after they were missing, between half an hour after seven or near eight in the evening, on the 27th of August, I went to a public house, the sign of the Alderman Parsons, Rosemary-lane, I called for a pot of porter, which the landlord brought me; I told him the shop had been robbed; he asked me of what; I told him of two pair of pistols in the rough; he asked me what kind of pistols they were; I described them as well as I could; he told me if I had been in the house a quarter of an hour before, I might have seen some of my master's property; he advised me to sit down in the tap-room, he thought he might come again in about three quarters of an hour; he came, the landlord asked him if he had disposed of that which he showed him; he told him no, he had not; and drew a pistol from his bosom, and gave it into his hand; the landlord beckoned me to come towards him, which I did, and he put the pistol in my hand, which I knew to be my master's property, and asked me the value of it; I told him I could not tell; I asked him if it was to be disposed of; the prisoner said, yes; I asked him for what; he said half a guinea; I told him that was a deal of money for a rough pistol like that, particularly being an odd one; I told him if there was a pair, I could form a better Judgment of the value; he said how did I know but he had two or three more; I said it was out of my power to tell whether he had or not; but if he had I could make it answer his purpose as well as mine, I had a friend who wanted a pair; he asked if I had money to pay for a pair; I told him I had not at that time, but soon could procure enough for that purpose, or bring a friend; so that the prisoner was going out of the tap-room; I desired him to leave the odd pistol in the bar; he did, and we both went out together; as we were crossing the way, the prisoner says to me,"you will be bottom;" not knowing what he meant, I said I certainly would; he then said he would bring the other three, that I might take my choice; I desired him so to do, as one might please me better than another; so we parted at that time, and he went as I suppose to his lodging; and I went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179609140109"></xptr>and acquainted my master with the circumstance, and brought him to the public-house. He came in about a quarter of an hour, I said, "old gentleman, you have rather tarried," he said, "here they are," and put them down towards the bar; I took them off the stairs, and told him that was an aukward place to do any business, and desired him to go into the other room, where my master was; I took the pistols and carried them in, and he followed me; these are the pistols. (Produces them).</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. These are my property, I know them by several marks upon them, they are stamped with my mark. (Shews the stamp mark).</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I don't know where the man that owns them lives no more than this board; I found them on Tower-hill; I picked them up, and threw them across my arm, and took them to Davis's, the public-house; if I know any thing of the pistols but what I tell you, may I die here; I don't know where the owner lives, if I do, may I be hanged this minute.</p>

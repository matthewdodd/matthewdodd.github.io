The prisoner is my husband—we have four children—I have been obliged to leave him, on account of his cruelty—this is the third time he has been taken up—I live at Battersea—on 27th March, about 4 in the afternoon, I went to my sister-in-law's, at North End, Fulham—while I was there the prisoner came in—I sat in a chair, and he came by my side—he did not speak for a minute, and then he said "Well, Mrs. White, how are you?"—I said "I am quite well, thank you, and I hope you are the same"—he sat for a minute, and I said "I can't think why you follow me about like this; I am afraid to go out to go to work; I think at least you can manage to do for yourself, if I have to work to support the children"—he said "Let me look alt the baby," and put his arms out—I said "No, not with my consent; you have said that the child does not belong to you, but I know that I am the mother and you are the father; I want no more to do with you"—he said "I want you to come and live with me"—I said "Never," for I had suffered so much from, his</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, at Hammersmith—on 27th March, about 7 p.m., I was called to the police-station, and examined Mrs. White—on the left side of the cheek was a scratch about an inch long—on the right side of the neck, just below the ear, another smaller scratch—along the jaw-bone, from the angle of the jaw to the chin, were several small scratches—beginning at the middle of the neck, going down just above the breast bone, and extending down the left side was a scratch, 81/2 inches long—there was a scratch on the left fore arm—the left thumb was cut just below the joint, from side to side, so that it would be about three-quarters of an inch long, having a flap of about half an inch—the top of the forefinger of the left hand was slightly cut—the pulp of the middle finger was cut through from side to side—the right thumb was cut through obliquely to the bone, the whole length of the pulp—and the middle finger was cut through at the root to the bone, two-thirds round the circumference of the finger—there was great loss of blood from the cuts on the middle finger of the right hand and the thumb, but not from the neck, they were only scratches—in my opinion the wounds must have been caused by a knife—I can scarcely conceive that any other thing could have done it—the scratches on the neck might have been done by a pin or anything else—the end of this knife would produce similar scratches—the wounds on the hands were troublesome to heal—she was not under my charge afterwards—she called one day to show them, but I did not pay much attention—I referred her to the parish medical officer.</p>

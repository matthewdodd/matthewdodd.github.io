I live in the Strand, and am a jeweller The prisoner was my porter, and occasionally assisted behind the counter—I had reason to suspect him—I took him, and found some property on him, I went to the residence of a young woman whom he corresponded with and there this brooch and other things were found—this is my brooch—the thimbles I cannot swear to—the boxes are mine.</p>

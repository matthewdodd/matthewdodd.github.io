I stood with my Back to the House, and he with his Back to the Fields, and being taller than I was, I could the better observe his Face by the Lamp. I said, aloud, Take away your Pistol, and you shall have what I have got. No, he swore he would not, and kept punching me with his Pistol. I took out my Watch and gave it him; he took it with his Left Hand, and then had his Accomplices (who I believe to be the Prisoner and this other Person) to search my Pockets, which they did, and took out 4 Shillings, and 2 Sixpences. Says I, If you'll leave the Watch for me at any House, I'll bring the Money for it. They would not agree to that, but Butler bid me make off, or he would send a Ball after me. As I was going, I found my Breeches were cut all down the Side; I gather'd them up as well as I could, and went to a Watchman in Holbourn; I told him my Case, and he came back with me to the middle of Duke-street to look for 'em, but we could not find 'em.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carman, in the employ of the Great Eastern Railway Company—I was in charge of a van, on Friday, 24th November, in Cutler Street, Houndsditch—I had occasion to leave the van for a few minutes, to make a delivery—when I came back to the van I saw that my goods were all right, and I jumped up and drove off—when I had got about half way down Cutler Street, I missed a truss—in consequence of what was said to me I saw Butler carrying the truss in a bag on his back—I pursued him—</p>

               <p>when I got within a few yards of him, I heard a whistle, and three or four men came up—I went and caught hold of Butler and asked him what he had got there—he said "Oh let me go, let me go, you are not going to buckle me with that"—Sherringham came up and said "You have got your truss, let the man go," and he up with his foot and kicked me in the side—I believe him to be the man—when he kicked me, I let go of Butler, but I stuck to the truss and took it back to the van.</p>

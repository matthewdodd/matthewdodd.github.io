                  </hi>. I am constable of the East and West India Dock Company. On the 27th of January, I saw the prisoners at the Export-gate of the East and West India Dock with a truck—Dennis Mahoney gave me a pass for a quantity of old broken wood and hoops, and empty tins, &amp;c.—I examined the truck, and found, under the wood, a barrel of pitch—I asked Jeremiah Mahoney what it was, he said it was an old empty cask—I sounded it, and said it was not empty—Jeremiah Mahoney said, "No, it has got a little bit of pitch in it"—I found it was full of pitch—I said, "How do you account for this? there is no pass for a barrel of pitch"—he said, "No, I can't read, but it is included in the &amp;c."—I said, "They would never give you a pass without including the pitch"—M'Carthy and Donovan said they knew nothing of the circumstance, but they were employed by the two Mahoneys.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">D.

               <p>there were some men, but they were too far off for me to distinguish them—there was a cask of pitch on the quay the day before, about ten yards from the stuff of the <hi rend="italic">William Jardine</hi>—soon after these men were stopped—I went up—the constables said, "Do you know anything of this cask of pitch?"—it was then in the truck—I suppose it was the one that had been on the wharf, as that was gone.</p>

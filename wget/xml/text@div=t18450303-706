                  </hi>. I am a bookseller. On Friday evening, 14th Feb., about half-past eight o'clock, the prisoner came to my shop to sell these four books, which he had wrapped in this paper—I looked at them and said, "How did you get these books?"—he said they belonged to a foreigner, a man of title, but who was very poor, and he was selling them for him—I said, "Don't you live with a bookseller?"—he said, "Why do you askme that question?"—I said, "Never mind,"—he said he was an artist, and lived at No. 23, Newman-street, Oxford-street, and the person the books belonged to lived in the same house—I said he had better write down the person's address and his own—he got very irritable and said, "If you don't like to buy them plenty will"—I said, "No"—he took them away—I pot on my hat and followed him on to the new street at St. Giles's—he saw me and quickened his pace till he got to Hanway-yard—he then set off running—I cried, "Stop, stop," and the more I cried the faster he ran—when I got to Tottenham-court-road a boy followed him, and we took him in a cow-shed—when we got him to Meux's brewhouse he struck the policeman and got away again—I searched the place where we took him, and these books were found there, secreted under the top white coat which he had had on and had taken off there—I had bought books of him before.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Stratford, in Essex, and sell pork. On Satur<lb></lb>day, the 18th of July, I saw the prisoner inside my shop about nine o'clock at night—she inquired the price of pork—she looked out a piece, as I sup<lb></lb>posed, with the intention of having it weighed—she did not buy anything, to my knowledge—I made a motion to my lad to look after her—she left the shop, and in consequence of information I sent for a policeman—she no brought back to my house, and the policeman produced the pork—I knew it by some discolouration on the top of the rind—it was the outside piece, tw had got stained—I told the prisoner she had got into a bad mess, and w offered to pay me for it.</p>

I was with Rierdon - I saw the prisoner and a companion rather less than him, take the handkerchief and gave it to him - he was about half a yard from him; he put it into the left side of his breeches - I followed the gentleman and said, "You have lost your handkerchief;" he turned round, and said, "My God - it is gone." I do not know who he was.</p>

When he took me he said "Mac, let us take him to our old shop - we can do as we like there, and have him fully committed in the morning - let us take him to St. Ann's watch-house, they will take in any charge there;" the next morning McGregor said I took the handkerchief, and the other said, "Mind what you say," and then he said one of the others took it.</p>

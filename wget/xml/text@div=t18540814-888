                  </hi>. I am overlooker of Mrs. Lawrence's farm, at Harrow. Last Tuesday week the prisoner came to work there—he continued there until last Wednesday night—I allowed him to sleep in a cottage of mine—there were sacks in the room—this (<hi rend="italic">produced.</hi>) is one of them; it has my mistress's name on it—I know this pouch—this rubber is used for sharpening a scythe; it is just like the rubber that was in the place—the pouch is the case for the rubber—I saw the prisoner searched by the policeman, and this pouch was in his pocket.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I was sleeping in the room, which he allowed me to do, with a woman that I cohabited with; she and I had words, because I would not give her money for drink; she was a drunken, bad woman; on Monday morning I went out to work at 6 o'clock; she did not come till 11 o'clock; it was hay home; she said she had tied up the things, and she gave me this bundle; I did not know what was in it; the policeman met me, and took me. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> There was a woman with him—this was hay home—the woman came to me, and told me that the prisoner was the man that had taken the brasses off our harness—this was about 9 o'clock—the prisoner came with me, and remained till about half-past 11 o'clock, when the police<lb></lb>man came, and I gave him into custody.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman</hi>). I was sent for to Mrs. Lawrence's farm, about 11 o'clock—I found the prisoner, and a female that he had been cohabiting with, in the yard—Tarley said, "I will give this man into custody for stealing brasses off our harness"—I said, "Where are the brasses?"—he said, "I don't know"—I took him to the station, searched him, and found this rubber pouch in his pocket, with the rubber in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I never had a key turned upon me; I would not take such things, they are not worth 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to me; the woman must have put them in my pocket; when I came from work she said, "I have tied all the things up;" she <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> the bundle out of the window, and made use of a bad expression, and commenced breaking the things; I picked up the bundle,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185408140019"></xptr>
               <p>and tried to get out of the way, as I have done before; I had no hand in it.</p>

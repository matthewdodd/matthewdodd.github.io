               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. How long before, had the other women came in? - While they were chusing the first neckcloth, which the prisoner Taylor bought and paid for.</p>
               <p>Was your father in the shop? - No.</p>
               <p>I believe you gave a signal for your father to come? - I gave no signal at all; he happened to come.</p>
               <p>Did your father desire these two other women to appear before the magistrate? - No, they did not.</p>
               <p>You was before the magistrate that evening? - I was.</p>
               <p>Did you, or not, to any body before the magistrate, express your opinion, that the other two women had taken your property? - No, indeed I did not.</p>
               <p>Recollect yourself? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect speaking to a person of the name of Roberts, belonging to the gaol? - I did not.</p>
               <p>You did not say any thing in his hearing? - Yes, I might.</p>
               <p>You did not, however, say, that you had reason to believe that the other two women stole your cambrick? - I did not.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Taylor bought some cravats? - She bought one, and paid for it.</p>
               <p>Do you remember some papers being picked up on the floor? - There were some papers picked up; it was the papers of cambricks; the papers in which these cambricks were contained.</p>
               <p>I believe you said that was immaterial, these were only waste papers? - I never said so; somebody said it, but I cannot say who.</p>
               <p>But these papers contained the very cambrick that you were in search after? - They did so.</p>
               <p>You know that this indictment imputes a capital offence to each of these prisoners? - I do not know the manner of an indictment at all.</p>
               <p>You did not know, perhaps, that this indictment affected the lives of the prisoners? - I did not; I should be very sorry.</p>
               <p>I verily believe it; there are many reasons why you should be sorry; I believe before the prisoner Taylor had well got to the window, you asked her some such words as these; you asked her to give you the cambricks? - I did not.</p>
               <p>What did you first say to her? - I told her that either one or the other must have taken the cambricks; I never said I will thank you for these cambricks; she said, she had no cambricks.</p>
               <p>In point of fact there was no cambricks in her possession? - There was not.</p>
               <p>Your father has been in very distressed circumstances: on the oath you have taken, is this trade carried on for your sole benefit; or whether it is not for your father's? - It is not; it is for my sole benefit, and my sister's; her name is

               <p>You are in partnership? - Yes, she is in partnership with me, and no other person; my father has no interest in the business at all but what I chuse to give him; it is one thing to assist a father who is in distress, and another to be a partner.</p>
               <p>Did not your father set you up in this business, and has not he a right to demand against you and your sister a certain proportion of the profits of this trade? - It is not so; it never was so; the trade is quite independent of my father; he is not answerable for any thing that goes in, or any thing that goes out.</p>
               <p>How many more persons were in at the time this happened? - Nobody but myself.</p>

               <p>I know very well that you cannot at present legally possess any property; but I ask you, is there not an agreement between you and your daughters, that you are to have a share in the profits of this trade? - There is not, upon my oath, any agreement in no share of the profits, any more than an utter stranger.</p>

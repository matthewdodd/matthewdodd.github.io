                  </hi>. On 29th April, about midnight, I was in Euston Road, and saw the prisoner between two others, and there were two others behind them, who I fancied belonged to them—they came in front of me; two of them caught hold of my arms, and the prisoner said, "Well, old gentleman, how are you? we are old pals; I have not seen you a long time; how are you getting on?"—he tried to unbutton my coat and burst the buttons off, and they took me off my legs and tried to get at my pockets—I sung out "Police!" as hard as I could, but they put something across my mouth, and then threw me in the gutter on my back, and the prisoner jumped on me and fell with his knees right into my bowels and hurt me very badly—I could not work for five days—he tried to get at my pockets—I got my mouth free and called "Police!"—one of them said "Push, the bobbies are on you"—a policeman picked me up and two others ran after the prisoner and fetched him back—I said "I am glad you have brought him, he is the right one, he is the one who ill-used me the most"</p>

I was in Judd Street, heard cries, ran into Euston Road, and saw Greenhill on the ground, and the prisoner on him with his knee on his chest and one hand on his collar—as soon as he saw me he ran away—I ran after him nearly to Somers Town, caught him, and brought him back—he said "What are you running after me for?"—I said "You know very well"—Greenfield said "That is the man." Prisoner's Defence. I am only six weeks out of the hospital; it is only a got-up case, and as to running away, I am utterly unable; I am hardly able to walkx.</p>

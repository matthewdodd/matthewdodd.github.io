                  </hi>. I live at No. 2, Bath-place, Kensington, in the parish of St. Mary Abbots. Ellen Horrigan was in my service; she came about the middle of Oct.—her wages were 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—when she came she had a very scanty supply of clothing and necessaries—shortly after she came some clothing was bought for her—she sent it home, not having paid for it—it was paid for with my money; I advanced the money to pay for it—it was 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and a few pence, and it was afterwords deducted from her wages—I was asked to advance her some money to send to Ireland—I advanced 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; a half sovereign, a few weeks after she came, and that was also deducted—in July last, previously to her entering my service, I had sold out some stock, which realized 274<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I received two notes of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, seven 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, and the rest in gold and silver—I wrapped them up, and put them amongst some clothing in my drawer, which was unlocked—I put them there on the day I brought them home, having ascertained that I brought it home correctly, on 14th July last—it was in an unlocked drawer in my bedroom it continued there a considerable time without my touching it, but I took from it two 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-notes and the silver, and put the rest away—I find that I have lost 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; one note for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and five 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-notes—I went away for a short time; for about ten days—that was previous to Ellen leaving me—that must have been in March—I took the parcel, supposed to contain my money, with me, but without examining it before I took it, or when I brought it back—when I came back I put it in a closet—I again looked at it on the evening of 21st April, to the best of my recollection, and missed one 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note and five 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-notes—one 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note was left there still—from the time I had put the money away in July I had opened it and looked at it once—I cannot say whether it was in July, but I remember I looked at it while it was warm weather—I might have looked at it again, but I did not scrutinize it; I merely looked, as a person might look at any parcel—I know the other prisoner, Julia Horrigan; she is Ellen's sister—she lived at No. 27, Lower Pbillimore-place, which is nearly opposite my house—she was a general servant there—she did the general duties of the house—I saw her very often at my</p>

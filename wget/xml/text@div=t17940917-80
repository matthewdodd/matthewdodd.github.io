               <p>Q. Then you never found any thing but the hat and apron? No. I never found any thing but the apron, she made away with the hat, because the apron would not fetch nothing.</p>

               <p>Q. What reason have you to charge the prisoner with it? - My mother saw the apron on her side, I was out at work while the place was stripped.</p>
               <p>Q. To Upton. Was you present when this woman was taken up? - She was brought to me to my own door; the woman said she had had her door broke open, and lost the keys, and she has found this apron on her sides.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was very distressed one day, and this very apron that is before me I pledged for one shilling, and I went and gave three pence for that apron, and if you please to see if that is not the full value of it; and if I had stole it, I would not have gone and wore it in that place where I did.</p>

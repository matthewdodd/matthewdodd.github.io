                  </hi>. I live at 423, Cable Street—on Thursday evening, 7th August, the prisoner gave me an envelope in the street and said, "Please will you take this to the Coach and Horses?"—I took it there and gave it to the landlady, who handed it to the manager, Mr. Underwood, who after reading it gave me some money—while I had the money in my hand Mr. Roper came in—I went out with them and pointed out the prisoner as the man who had given me the envelope—rl am quite sure about him—he was a stranger to me—he was to wait for me till I came back with the money.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager at the Coach and Horses—the last witness came with an envelope—it was handed to me by Mrs. Page and contained this note, "Will you please to oblige with change? Yours truly, E. Roper."I knew a Mr. Roper and cashed the cheque enclosed in the envelope for 21. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., drawn on Messrs. Dixon and Head to bearer—I gave the lad the money thinking it was for Mr. Roper, and just as I did so Mr. Roper came in, and then after conversation he went out with the boy. Edward Roper. I am a builder, at 163, High Street, Shad well—I know nothing of the prisoner, and he had no authority to send for change in my name this is not my cheque, I know nothing about it—I have deal<lb></lb>ings with Messrs. Dixon and Head, brass merchants, and they pay me by cheque occasionally.</p>

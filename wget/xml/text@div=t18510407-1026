On Saturday morning, 29th March, I was on duty in Green-lane, Dulwich, about half-past two o'clock—I saw the prisoner coming up the lane towards me—he had with him a large bundle—I got within two yards of him, and turned my light on—I saw his face—I had seen him in custody at Camberwell about four months before—he dropped his bundle and ran away—I followed him into the fields, but he got away, and I lost all sight of him—there is a shed there, but I have not been down to it—it is about a mile from Dulwich—there is no house within a quarter of a mile—I picked up the bundle which con<lb></lb>tained six fowls, dead, but quite warm—I showed them to Mr. Coombs at the police-court the same day—he claimed them directly.</p>

In consequence of information from Hilton, about a quarter before seven in the morning, I went down the Green-lane into the shed where the prisoner was lying—it is between Denmark-bill and Red Post-hill, rather better than a quarter of a mile from Denmark-hill, and about five minutes' walk from Dulwich—I looked in the shed, and found the prisoner concealed under the bay—I found these tail-feathers in a corner of the shed, about three yards from him—it is an</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Lordship-lane, about half a mile from Dulwich. On Saturday morning, 29th March, I missed seven fowls—the footway comes right opposite my house, across the fields, from the Green-lane, about three-quarters of a mile off—my fowls were kept in a cow-house close to the house—I saw six dead fowls the same day at the station—I said there was one more missing—I returned home, and found one dead behind a truss of hay—I knew them perfectly well—I had bad some of them more than twelve months—I used to feed them occasionally—I am a licensed victualler—they are always about my premises—I saw them safe the afternoon before—they had not been locked up that sight—these are the heads; they were cut off in my presence.</p>

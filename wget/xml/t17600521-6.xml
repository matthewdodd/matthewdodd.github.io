            . I was constable of the Night; the prisoner own'd before Mr. alderman Gosling she had taken the breeches, and sold them to one Dearing in Rosemary lane; we went there with her, the man said he had not bought any buckskin breeches for 3 months. She said, she ask'd him 6 s. and he would give her but 5, and insisted upon what she said to be truth: he said he did not know her.</p>

               <p>My prosecutor said, if I would own it he would let me free; so I own'd it, that he might let me go out of the compter.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. I said I would make it as easy as possible if she would let me know where my breeches and things were. I lost other things; but I did not say I would not prosecute her.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a chandler's shop in York-road, Batterses On 23rd Jan., the prisoner came—I have no doubt he is the young man, he purchased an ounce of tobacco—it was put in a paper—I have seen part of it since—it is the same sort of paper, and the same sort of tobacco—the price of it was 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he gave me in payment a half crown, I gave him 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out of the till—I had no silver there—I went into the adjoining room where my husband was sitting at tea; I asked him if he had got 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—while he was putting his hand in his pocket, I bit the half crown; I turned to the prisoner and said, "I don't like the look of this half crown; I don't like to change it"—he said, "It is a very good one"; and he put his hand in his pocket, and gave me a good one—I said, "This does not want any looking at"; and I returned him the bad one—when I had given him the 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and was going into the parlour for the two shillings, he was going out of the shop—I said to him, "You have not got all your change w—he said, "All right," and he turned back—I bit the bad half crown, and gave it him—while I was serving him a man came in, and wanted a cigar—I finished serving the tobacco, and then I served the cigar, and he laid down 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he jocularly said something to the prisoner, I do not know what, and left the shop first.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a milliner's shop in Edward-place, York-road. On 23rd Jan., the prisoner came in about 7 o'clock—I had two customers in the shop—the prisoner said, "serve me directly, I am in a hurry"—I left the calico shop and served him—he asked for a pair of socks, and said his feet were wet—they came to 8 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; he gave me a half crown—I gave him 3 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver—I let the half crown lie on the counter, and directly he was gone 1 said, "This is a bad one"—finding it was bad, I went out to go to my brother-in-law, and as I crossed the road, I saw two men going to Mr. Cox's—I went to my brother-in-law—I had the half crown in my hand—I saw a constable passing my brother-in-law's window; I made a communication to him—I went with him to Mr. Cox's; I did not go into the shop, but I passed the window—I saw the prisoner and another man come out of the shop—the constable took the prisoner into custody—I do not know what became of the other man—I sell wool cuffs; I had them in my window that night—the prisoner was taken to my shop first, and then to the station—I followed him, and on the way Burdett gave me the pair of socks which I had sold to the prisoner—I gave the half crown I received from the prisoner to the constable.</p>

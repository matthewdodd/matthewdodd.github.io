Y. on the two fore hoofs, and also the Chase mark, which is a round circle, with the letter H. in it.

            . My gate was shut when the prisoner came between five and six in the morning, and I saw him let in. After that I said to him, Is that horse to be sold? He said, Yes. I said, Where do you bring him from? He said, From the Crosskeys at Edmonton. I said, How old is he? He said, Four years old. I looked in his mouth, and found he was but three. About four o'clock he came into the yard again, when he saw a mare, and said, That is a very pretty mare. Said he, Can you tell me what mine is worth? The horse was brought out. I said, He is put up to be sold to the best bidder. He was put up at 4 l. I looked round, but did not see the prisoner. I said, Will any man give nine guineas for him? After that a gentleman came to me, and said, Book the young man's horse (meaning the prisoner) to me, I have bought him. I said, What did you buy him for? He said he bought him for 4 l. I said, I will not book him, for I think he is stolen: he is worth double the money. The prisoner turned pale. I took him before the Justice, and he was committed to the New Gaol. On the Wednesday he was examined at St. Margaret's Hill; there he said a blacksmith's apprentice brought the horse to him in a lane.</p>

               <p>I have not got my friends by me just now. I am innocent of the affair. I brought this horse to Mr. Galamore, because I had been there before. The horse was brought to me by a young man, a blacksmith's apprentice, named, Ray.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I do not choose to call him. I come from Cumberland, and lodged at the house of Mr. Bell, by the Chase side.</p>
               <p>To his Character.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bell. I knew the prisoner's parents, and I have known him seven or eight years. I never knew any thing of his character, but that of a very good one. He lodged with me. He came from Whippington, near Sir Walter Blacket's; he is a taylor by trade.</p>

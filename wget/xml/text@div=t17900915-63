               <p>Court to Prosecutor. When this woman came up to you, what did she say to you? - She said, my dear, how do you do? and fell a bugging me; and in three minutes she took and robbed me: she snatched out my watch: I endeavoured to prevent her; and then she knocked me backwards: I tried to push her from me, to guard myself: they had got the watch before the blow was struck.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to Brown. Did you see me at the pawnbrokers? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Jupp. They were both at the door together: I think he must have seen the woman.</p>
               <p>Brown. I was not at the pawnbroker's at that time: I was there about eight or nine in the morning: I did not notice any woman at the door.</p>
               <p>Jupp. The constable was not there till night; the prosecutor was there with another constable in the morning, and with this constable at night.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. What do you say to that? - I was there never but once, till the day before yesterday: the first time, I was there with the man where I lodged, and the constable: I was only there at one time.</p>
               <p>Court to Jupp. How often was the coachman there? - I believe he was there twice.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of it? - Yes: he was there twice: first of all he came there with some of Mr. Hyde's officers, from St. Martin's-street, about the watch: he came to my master, and begged leave to look at the watch, upon which he took the watch (that officer is not here) and put it into his pocket: says he, this is my property: my master asked him what he meant to do with it? and he said, to keep it: so my master sent me immediately to Mr. Hyde's, and one of Mr. Hyde's runners went along with me to this court to see for

               <p>Elliott. Brown never went with me; I went by myself.</p>
               <p>Court to Brown. Did you ever go with Elliott to the pawnbroker? - Only once in the morning part; that was between eight and nine in the morning of the 19th.</p>
               <p>Court to Jupp. How is that? - I do not know rightly whether the man did come in the night or in the morning.</p>
               <p>But are you sure whether Brown was there once or twice? - He was there with the runners, on the 18th, in the morning, between eight and nine; and he was there on the 19th, in the evening.</p>
               <p>Was he at your house once or twice? - Twice; I think he was with Elliott on the 19th; and he was there without Elliott.</p>
               <p>Jury. What kind of a woman was Williams? - Rather a broad faced woman.</p>
               <p>Was she such a sort of a woman as this? - A middling sized woman.</p>

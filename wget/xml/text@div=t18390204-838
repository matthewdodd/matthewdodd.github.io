                  </hi>. I am a carpenter. I was employed building a house, at Blackheath-hill, and had some window-weights in the house—I missed them on Monday, the 4th of February—I had seen them at a quarter past six o'clock on Saturday evening the 2nd, these are them—(<hi rend="italic">looking at them.</hi>) <hi rend="smallCaps">JOHN LEDGER</hi>. I am a policeman. I was on duty at Deptford, on Saturday night, between eight and nine o'clock, and met the prisoner, with something on his shoulder—I asked what he had got—he said, some weights—I asked where he brought them from—he said, from Chatham—I said I doubted that—he then said he brought them from Blackheath—I asked where he was going to take them to—he said he did not know—I took him to the station-house, and next morning, as I was taking him to the office, he said he got them from a new house, at the top of Blackheath-hill—I went there, and found the prosecutor.</p>

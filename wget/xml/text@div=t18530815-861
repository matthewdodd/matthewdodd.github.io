                  </hi>. I live in Castle-court, Fulwood's-rents. On the afternoon of 26th July I was on Tower-wharf, looking at the boat race—when the boats were near there was a rush from behind, and I felt a pull at my watch guard—I saw the prisoner withdrawing his hand from my right hand waistcoat pocket, where my watch was, and saw my guard loose—I laid hold of him by the collar, and charged him with taking my watch—he insisted that he had not got it, and desired to be searched—I took him out of the crowd; he tried to wrench from me—I beckoned to an officer, and gave him in charge—it was a hunting watch, with a figure of Napoleon on one side—I have the maker's receipt for it—I did not see my watch or guard in the prisoner's hand—the chain remained round my neck, but the swivel was not broken; there was no ring—I am told that they have some kind of a machine to cut the ring of the watch with.</p>

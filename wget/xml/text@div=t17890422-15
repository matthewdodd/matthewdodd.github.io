               <p>On the 13th of March the two prisoners came to my shop in Leadenhall-street, and enquired if I bought old silver; it was about seven in the evening; I keep a goldsmith's shop; the prisoner Kelly produced the bowls of two silver table-spoons, newly broken; I asked him, how he came by them? he said they were not his property, they belonged to the other prisoner, and he acknowledged them to be his: I asked him where he lived, and he said at Westminster; I asked him, how he came by them? and he said, if you don't chuse to buy them, give me them back again; I told him I should be satisfied about it, and I sent for a constable; and on searching Curtis, the handles of the spoons were found on him; prior to our examining him, he said he had got no more than the bowls, they corresponded, and on the handles were engraved J. Wicks; Curtis then said to the other, damn me what a pretty piece of business you have brought me into; Curtis said, you knew how I came by them; I told you before I came here; in consequence of which they were sent to the Poultry Compter; and on enquiry they were found to be the property of Mr. Wicks, of the Bush Tavern, Bristol.</p>

               <p>On the 13th of March I dined with an acquaintance, and the prisoner dined there too; afterwards he asked me to take a walk, and I did; and he said, I have got some silver to sell which I found on the road coming to London; I saw Mr. Bull's shop, and we went in; I had the bowls, and I told Mr. Bull they were not mine, they were the other man's.</p>
               <p>PRISONER CURTIS's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I found them as I was coming from Bath, and I shewed them to the other prisoner; and he said, he could sell them for me; he took them, and afterwards returned the stems; he said he would sell them at another place.</p>
               <p>To Mrs. Doer. Had any spoons been missed? - We missed three about a fortnight before we heard these were found.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Kelly called one witness to his character.</p>

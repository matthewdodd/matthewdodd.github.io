               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was not be at liberty after you charged him with this? A. No: he was taken on the 17th of July; he remained in custody, but I do not know that he was not at liberty; I saw him again on the Monday week after he was apprehended, at Hatton-garden; there was a man came and asked if there was work for him; but I do not know that the prisoner sent him, but the man said he had; he came to my house - he said he had been dishonest to me; he was sorry for what he had done, and wished me to take him again; I had not got a warrant against him, but I had spoken of it, and said I was about to get a warrant; he certainly had an opportunity of absconding if he liked, and he came back of his own accord.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Let us have the dates - he left you on the 4th of July, that was on a Sunday? A. Yes, and he came again the Friday following; he said he was sorry, and wished me to take him again - I told him what I had heard, as I had sent my son out on Monday with the bills, and found he had received some - I did not detain him then; it was near eleven o'clock at night - he walked quietly away.</p>

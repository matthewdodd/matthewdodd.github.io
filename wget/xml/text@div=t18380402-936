                  </hi>. I am a builder, and live in Manchester-street, Grosvenor-square. About three or four o'clock, on the morning of the 3rd of March, I was coming home—I had been out with a party of friends, and in Oxford-street I was met by the prisoner, who asked me to accompany her to a house; and when we had been there ten minutes she suddenly left the room, which excited my suspicion, and I called to the people down stairs to stop her, which they did—I ran down, and accused her of stealing my watch—she said she had not got it—I asked her three times, and said I would not press the charge against her if she gave it me—she still denied it—the policeman was called in, and while he was searching her the watch and chain fell down, and was found at her feet—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>.)</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. There were several other people in the passage, and there I had been two other women in the room as well as myself. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. There was no one but her in the room—no one could have dropped the watch but her, and two other young women said she had better give the watch to the gentleman.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. He was very tipsy—there were six in the passage—the door was never locked—he gave 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the room, and he had no money to give me, that was the reason I left the room. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. I had 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in my pocket—I would have given her some, but she ran away—the watch was in my waistcoat pocket—I had not undressed myself.</p>

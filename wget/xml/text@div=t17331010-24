            . About nine Months ago, I came from Paris, with a Servant of my Lord Peters - I had been a Month in London, when happening to meet a Friend in the Street, I went to drink with him, at the Muffled-Bear, in Wild-street. The Prisoner, who goes by the Name of Brown, was sitting in the next Box, and call'd to me by my Name ; I told him, I did not know him: No! says he, my Name's

There we found the other Prisoner, who was his Acquaintance, and goes by the Name of Berry, but she told me, that her right Name was

As we turn'd into Drury-lane he gave me a Six-pence, whether good or bad I can't say, and bid me go to a little Shop there and fetch him a Halfpenny worth of Snuff; I went and brought him the Snuff and Five-pence Half-penny in Change, at which he laugh'd; I asked him what he laugh'd at? he would not tell me, but said, Come along.

I gave the Baker's Maid the Six-pence to change; she scrupled it, and carry'd it in to her Master, who came forward and ask'd me if I gave that to the Maid? I said, Yes. And have you got any more such about you? says he. No, says I. And upon that he seiz'd me, and sent the Maid for a Constable; but Conway coming in, call'd for a

I was so daunted that he could not persuade me to change any more that Night, but he past off several himself in our Way to his Lodging, which was in <placeName id="t17331010-24-crimeloc111">Grub-street</placeName>

When we came thither, he bid me call upon him next Morning, and ask for him by the Name of Brown; so we parted, and I went to my own Lodging, which was at my Aunt's in Gardener's-lane, Westminster. Next Morning I call'd at Mr. Brown's Lodging; his Landlady directed me to go up one Pair of Stairs; I did so, and knock'd two or three times, but having no Answer, I went down again; then his Landlady call'd Mr. Brown, upon which he answer'd, and came down with the other Prisoner, who goes for his Wife. We drank two or three Quarters of Gin together, and then he bid me take a Walk in Moorfields, and come again in an Hour; which I did. We went together towards- Piccadilly, and past off several Six- pences that Night; so I used to go to him every Morning, and we used to go out in the Dusk of the Evening. But as I often staid very late, my Aunt as often checked me for keeping such ill Hours. I told the Prisoners of this, and so it was agreed, that I should lye in the same Bed with him and her, which I did for some Time, and I believe their Landlady knew nothing of it, but thought I still came in the Morning. At last I began to be ashamed of lying with a Man and a Woman at the same Time, and then they got me a Blanket, and I laid by their Bedside, and they were very kind to me. Now I'll give an Account of what I have seen them do every Morning that I was with them, except Sundays; he sat down on one side of the Fire, and she on the other; they put a Fire-shovel on the Fire, with some Metal in it like Pewter, and melted it; then he took the Shovel and poured the Metal into something, but I can't say what, for they would not let me see it. Then they put the Shovel on the Fire again; he took out a Six-pence, and threw it into an old Hat behind him, and so they did till they had used all the Metal in the Shovel, and made 20 Sixpences, or more, and I have taken them warm out of the Hat. Then both he and she took a Knife and scraped the Edges round, and nicked the Edges of some of them with a File, and afterwards bent them.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he take out but one Six-pence at a time?</p>
               <p>Macnelly. But one; I asked him to let me see the Thing they made them in, but he would never let me, tho' he promised me that in time he'd let me into the Secret, and learn me how to make them. There was a Table in the Room with Chalk or Whiting, and a flannel Waistcoat, and they set me to rub them upon the Table with the Whiting and Flannel, as hard as I could, which I did. We staid 2 Months in Grub-street, and then removed to Morris's-court in Peter's-street, Soho, where we followed the same Trade; and we always took Care to lock the Door within Side when we were at work.</p>
               <p>Berry. Did you ever know me to put off any bad Money ?</p>
               <p>Macnelly. Yes; many a Time. She had a false Pocket with a private Fob ; I have seen<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173310100020"></xptr> her put 15 or 16 bad Six-pences at a time in one Part, and when I brought her Change she has put that in the other Part.</p>

               <p>Macnelly. Brown and I were sent to the Gatehouse for passing this bad Money, and he told me several times there was no Danger, for it was bailable, and we should soon get our Liberty. At Night he was carried before Sir

            , Constable. I took Brown on a Bench Warrant, for uttering bad Money, and I found in his Pocket a Razor, a Pair of Scissors, and this fine File.</p>
               <p>Macnelly. I believe this is the File that I have seen him use often in nicking the Edges.</p>

            . I live at Mrs. Morris's in St. Anne's-court, ( some call it Morris's court ) in Peter's-street, Soho ; I was going one Sunday Night, about 4 Months ago, to see for the Prisoners, and by Chance I met this blind Man, Macnelly, near the New Church in the Strand, and asked him if he had seen them ? No, says he, not to Night, but I saw them in the Morning ; and, God damn me, but I'll be revenged of them both, for I'll have a better Coat to my Back by this Day s'nnighs.</p>

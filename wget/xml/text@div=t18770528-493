                  </hi>. I am a captain in the Royal Navy and live at Walton House, West Cowes, Isle of Wight—I was introduced to the prisoner three or four years ago, as a stockbroker, by my brother, not personally, but he mentioned his name—prior to February this year I had various transactions with him in stock securities, and during the whole of that time I treated with him as a member of the Stock Exchange—I believe that he was a sworn broker—I had 364 shares in the Richmond Mining Company in the hands of Messrs. Robarts, and in February this year I wrote to the prisoner about selling them—this is the letter I wrote, and I received his reply on 13th February—I also received these other letters. (<hi rend="italic">These letters referred to a law suit in America against the Mining Company, and the possibility of bribery and corruption being practised on the Jury, and advised the prosecutor to sell his shares</hi>.) I afterwards received a telegram from the prisoner which I have destroyed, but the effect of it was that he strongly advised me to sell, and that he was quite sure his advice was sound—on 2nd March I telegraphed to the prisoner "Sell and pay into Robarts'; I will write to them"—on the same day I wrote this letter to Robarts "Cowes, March 2nd, 1871. Dear Sirs,—Will you give the certificate of my Richmond Consolidated Mining Company's Stock to Mr. A. H. Westaway for sale. Yours truly, A. W. Gillett."(<hi rend="italic">On this letter was written</hi> "Received 364 shares".) <hi rend="italic">On the same day I wrote this letter was written</hi> "Received 364 shares".) On the same day I wrote this letter to the prisoner confirming my telegram—on 3rd March I received from the defendant this sale note "Sold by order of Captain A. W. Gillett, R.N., 114 Richmond Consolidated Mining Shares,. 684<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; brokerage, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.: 678<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for 14th March"—that is signed by the prisoner, I know his writing—on 3rd or 4th March I received this further sold note "March 3rd, 1871. Sold by order of Captain A. W. Gillett, R.N., 250 Richmond Mining Shares, 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; brokerage, 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.: 1,487<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—those were both for 14th March—on the 12th prior to the settlement I wrote this letter "Cowes, March 12th, 1877. Dear Sir,—When you receive the money for the Richmonds pay it into my account at Robarts'. Your advice in my affairs has been so uniformly disastrous that I am afraid to take it again; you have nearly ruined me as it is. It was a very bad day for me that I ever consulted you about a revision of my securities, but it has taught me a very bitter lesson. Yours, very truly, A. W. Gillett"—I afterwards received this letter from the prisoner. (<hi rend="italic">This stated:</hi> Egyptain Stock is very strong. I only advise it in consequence of the loss: you have made in Richmonds, &amp;c. Richmonds are weak.") In answer to that I wrote this letter, enclosing the transfer of 87 shares—I then received a further letter from the prisoner advising the buying of Egyptian's—up to "this time I had received no advice from my bankers as to the payment of the money to them—on 23rd March I wrote "Yours to hand. If the Tasmanian Line is likely to advance in price I had better not sell just yet. I am desperately afraid of speculation, I have suffered so much and my means are so limited, but 1 think I will venture 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the Unified and 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the 5 per Cent.

               <p>—on April 5th I wrote this letter to the prisoner "Dear Sir,—When you have got them, place the Egyptian certificates in Robarts' hands, also the balance of the money," &amp;c.; and on the 6th I received this letter from the prisoner "Dear Sir,—The slight delay in the delivery of the New Egyptian Securities is owing to the conversion still going on, but the 10th instant is the last day for doing this, when the conversion will be closed, I will then deposit the bonds and balance with Messrs. Robarts"—I wrote to him again about 24th April, about the Egyptian Bonds and received this reply. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated 26th April</hi>, 1877, <hi rend="italic">from the prisoner, requesting Mr. Gillett to run up to town to see him about the Egyptian clock, and to send a telegram stating at what time he would be there</hi>.) On 27th April I telegraphed to him that I would be there between 3 and 4 o'clock, and I went up to town and saw him—he said, "I am sorry I cannot deliver the Egyptian Stock or the money"—I said "Why not?"—he said that the war and various things prevented him—I said "What has the war got to do with my money! the money was given you for a specific object, buying Egyptian Stock;" and I asked him if he had got the money for the Richmond Shares, he said "Yes, if you will give me three or six months time I will repay it"—I said that I could make no arrangement without taking advice—he said "If anything transpires about it I shall not be able to get back on the Stock Exchange"—I said "Are you not on the Stock Exchange?"—he said "No, I have failed"—I said what business had you to be dealing with me if you are not on the Stock Exchange 1 had I known that you had failed I should not have employed you"—I then left, and on 3rd May I received this letter. (<hi rend="italic">Bead:</hi> "2nd May, 1877. Dear Sir,—Not having heard from you any further in reference to my debt to you of 2,184<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I write this to propose that I should give you my promissory note for this amount at six months' date, which would leave me time to turn round in, and send in my application for re-admission to the Stock Exchange; my other creditors have accepted a similar arrangement, as ray only wish is to pay you all in full, and I will do so if given time, but should the slightest rumour of these outside liabilities of mine get known to anyone not directly interested in the matter, the rumour is certain to get to the Stock Exchange, and then my getting re-admitted would be hindered completely," &amp;c.) I did not reply to that but came up to London and obtained a warrant.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> From the time my brother introduced the prisoner, to the present time, I have employed him as a broker on various occasions in transferring investments from one class of securities to another, and to a con<lb></lb>siderably larger amount than the 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. here involved—some of the securities which I so changed I realised at the commencement of this year, and I have some of them at my bankers—I have stock in my hands which he purchased for me amounting to more than 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I invested in these Richmonds in the summer of 1875, it is a silver mine, they were not paying any dividend then, I have bad two dividends since—I read the prospectus, and I was strongly recommended to buy them by the prisoner—he did not tell me on 5th April, that the Egyptian shares had been delivered, nor did he show me Messrs. Cappers' contract for the purchase of them—I never heard Mr. Capper's name from him, I swear that—I had no advices from Messrs. Robarts, on 2nd March, when I sent the telegram and letter, and until 5th April, the same condition of things existed, and I wrote and told him to pay in the balance which was in his hands—I did not on</p>

I am one of the firm of Capper and Co., stock and share brokers, of Adams Court, Old Broad Street—I have known the prisoner some time—I remember his failure at the beginning of 1875—subsequently to that we received the permission of the committee to deal with him owing to a rule which debarred us from dealing with him without that permission—this book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is kept by a clerk and made up from the contract notes—I do not check it with the original—I did business with the prisoner myself personally, and under his instructions I sold for him on 2nd March, 114, and also seventy Richmond shares for the settle<lb></lb>ment of 14th March, and on 3rd March, 100 Richmond shares for the settle<lb></lb>ment of 28th March, and seventy others at another price, and on the 17th two quantities of twelve and ten for the settlement of 28th March—on 16th March, we received a letter from the prisoner saying "Please let me have cheque for 2,700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," which I sent payable to his order—that was on the current account—there were other accounts between us besides these Richmonds—that cheque was in respect of stock and shares delivered, including the Richmonds—on 19th March, we received another letter from him containing a request for a cheque for 1,300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which we sent him, and on 21st March, he bought Egyptians through us: 2,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Unified 6 per Cent.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> We did not act for him on the Stock Exchange from;. the time of his failure, only from June, 1876, to March, 1877, and in that time we very likely had transactions with him to the extent of 100,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—our practice with him was to have a large number of transactions going on at the same time for him—we sold shares for him and received the money and held it as against shares bought—on the 14th March account there was a balance in his favour of 6,162<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. contingent upon the delivery of stock and shares—we were about to deliver the scrip or the transfers—about ten days is allowed after settlement day for the delivery of transfers—on 28th March he was in the same position, only the amount was reduced to 3,401<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. con<lb></lb>tingent—I did not see the transfer of the Richmond shares or the name of Captain Gillett on them—no shares were delivered to us, but they were paid</p>

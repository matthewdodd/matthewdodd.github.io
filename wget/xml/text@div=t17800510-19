Mr. Ryder having an intention to quit the house applied to me to receive the key of the house, and to shew the house to any person who might be desirous of taking it; I agreed to it; the key was left at my house. There was a considerable quantity of furniture left in it. All the things mentioned in the indictment, except the tea-kettle and lamp; I saw in the house at the time the key was left with me. Upon the 18th of April, a gentleman called on me about five in the evening for the purpose of looking at the house. I tried to open the door, but to no effect. The next day I sent for a smith, and then we found the lock had been broken. We were obliged to open the door by force. I found some brass locks, which had been broke, and some pokers and tongs, and two senders lying on the parlour floor. I then went up to every room in the house. The locks had been broken off most of the chamber doors. I observed that two of the bath stoves had been taken away. When I came down stairs I missed the copper. The cellars were broke open and a quantity of wine was gone. Three pier glasses were taken away, and the glass lantern was gone which had been taken down and placed in an apartment below stairs, and three locks and keys were taken away, and several were lying upon the floor; several more had been attempted which they could not get off.</p>
               <p>What occasion had they to break off those locks if they did not take them away? - They were laid upon the parlour floor ready to be taken off at another opportunity.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of the fact of the prisoners being concerned in it? - No. This was Tuesday the 18th. On Wednesday morning a smith came; we got in; I went to Mr. Ryder's chambers, at Lincoln's Inn, and told him what had happened; I went to Sir

The smith mended the lock and nailed up the door where the wine had been taken out, and bolted and barred the doors as strong as he could; on the Thursday morning I went into the house, and found then by the saw-dust about the floor that they had been at the wine again. There was a piece taken out of the door and a great quantity of wine had been taken out. I went to Sir

               <p>Was there any thing else which you knew there that was your master's property? - Yes; there was a tea-kettle and lamp, I verily believe to have been my master's, and two hat-pins, which are the same pattern as those which are left in my master's house; the tea-kettle and lamp produced I can safely swear is my master's property; it is very old fashioned; it was left to Mrs. Ryder by her grandmother.</p>

               <p>Was that made use of at the tea table service? - I never saw it made use of; but, when I was at the removing of the things out of the house, I remember seeing it upon the back table; I thought it an old fashioned thing of little worth; I hardly thought it worth removing.</p>

On the 20th of April I went to Cross-lane in Parker-street, St. Giles's, to apprehend the prisoners; there having been an information made against them; there was a person, whose name was Clarke, who shewed us where they lodged, they had separate lodgings. In Trubshaw's room I saw three dozen of wine standing by the bed side; in another room there was more. We took the wine away that was in Trubshaw's room, and in the next room, in which Hawkins lodged, we found some more wine, which we likewise took away.</p>
               <p>Was it white or red wine? - There was red wine and white wine of different colours; we took the wine to the Brown-Bear, in Bow-street; the servant saw it there. In searching Trubshaw's clothes we found a tinder-box with tinder in it, matches, flint, steel, and two pieces of candle in his pockets, and between the sacking and the bed I found this dark latern (producing it) and I found these keys (producing about twenty or thirty) and this strong screw turner (producing it) this kettle and lamp came out of the house but who brought it out I cannot say that I recollect.</p>
               <p>Were there any brass screws? - In Trubshaw's room I found these two brass pins (producing them). (It appeared that the screws were the same with those which were left in the room.)</p>

               <p>The three prisoners were up in Trubshaw's room on Monday night upon the 17th of April, I was in company with them<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178005100028"></xptr>there; they asked me if I would get up on Tuesday morning, and go with them. They said they knew of a house which had been empty a long while.</p>
               <p>Where did you lodge at this time? - In the same house Trubshaw did, the corner of Cross-lane; Steward had, in play, cut the hand of a young woman who lived with me; she was going to the hospital. I knew I must be up early in the morning to go with her, therefore I declined going with them; they went by themselves; they were up about four o'clock in the morning; they knocked against my room door; I answered them; they said I should be sorry I had not been with them; they said they had got about four guineas. I asked them in what? They said they had got some looking-glasses, and other thing which would fetch them about four guineas.</p>
               <p>Who said that? - Trubshaw.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the other men where in his company? - Yes. I said, I did not care; the glasses and pewter plates where fetched away before I got up. They then asked me if I would go with them at night to fetch the other things, some coppers, and brass stoves? I accordingly did go with them, on Tuesday night; we fetched two Bath-stoves, a glass lantern, and a copper away; we took them down to Mrs. Mailing's house in Turnmill-street. On Wednesday morning Steward, I, and Million, went again to get some brass locks which were upon the doors. Trubshaw did not go with us then. He said, his head aked so, so he would not get up; we took three or four brass locks off the doors, and a copper, senders, pokers, shovels and tongs, and laid them in the fore parlour, ready to take away; we went down stairs; we saw a door locked; we took the door off the hinges and in that cellar there was a quantity of wine.</p>
               <p>What quantity did you take away of the wine? - A great quantity; we went backwards and forwards different times; we then left the brass locks, sender and shovel, in the parlour. We carried off as much wine on Wednesday morning as we could, till it was almost day light. On Wednesday morning Trubshaw and Million got up and went to fetch away the remainder of the wine; the wine that was fetched then was what was found in his room.</p>
               <p>How do you know they went to fetch more wine, unless you was with them? - Because he called me and I would not get up; and when Sir

               <p>TRUBSHAW's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I lay at home abed above a fortnight; he came into my room and asked me, as I was lying abed with a bad leg, if I would drink some wine? and the woman I inhabit with was with me. I drank some of his wine, and was taken with a fit; and in the fit he brought wine into the room, and threw all over my face, and swore he would strangle me if I could not drink; when I came out of the fit again he asked me to let him leave the wine bottles in my room till night. He said it came out of the country from his relations. I said he might; and these gentlemen came and took the wine out of my room; and the two brass hooks, found in my room, he gave the woman I inhabit with for a chimney line.</p>
               <p>From Steward. To whom did those picklock keys belong which were taken out of my room? - There is a dozen of picklock keys I bought them of Trubshaw and gave him fifteen shillings for; they were not Steward's, but they were found in Steward's room.</p>
               <p>Trubshaw. He made these pick-lock keys with files; he came into my room several times; he said he was a watch-maker by trade; when I went into his room and saw him at work upon them I asked him what he was doing? He said, he was at work in his trade.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Elias Wolf, of Turpin-lane, Greenwich. On the 24th of October the prisoner and another man came to our shop to buy a coat—about five minutes after they were gone I missed a pair of corderoy trowsers, which had been hanging at the door—I had seen the prisoner looking in at the window—these are them—(<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>.)</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Deptford, and sell wood. I saw Mrs. Lane last night, along with a prostitute in the street—she told me that unless the prosecutrix paid her handsomely she would tell a different tale—I treated her to some beer and a drop of gin—she again mentioned Mrs. Wolf's name, called her a d—d old b—, and said she had not given her a drop of beer all day long, and left her without money to pay her coach-hire—I said, "Never mind, I will pay it"—I did, and treated her to some ale and a pipe of tobacco—she was very drunk—she said, "I will alter the case with her to-morrow"—I said, "You may do so if you think proper, it is nothing to me," and she told me the same words down stairs to-day, that she would do all she could to get him off—I never saw her before yesterday—she forced her conversation on me, and I could not get rid of her—I saw she was not able to walk, and paid her coach-hire.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a linen-draper, at Deptford; the pri<lb></lb>soner was in my service. For some reason, on 27th Sept. I marked four sixpences, nine shillings, and two half-crowns, and put them in the till—I went to tea, and the prisoner came to mind the shop, which was part of her duty—I left no one in the shop but her—I went back into the shop in half an hour, and she immediately left—I then went to the till and missed two shillings—I went down-stairs, called the prisoner from the wash-house, and said, "You have taken two shillings out of the till"—she said she had not, and I might search her—I called a policeman, and had her taken in charge—he afterwards produced these two marked shillings to me (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they are two of those I put in the till.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Walthamstow, and am a farmer. Carter was my servant—I directed him, on Friday, the 21st of July, to bring a load of clover and rye-grass hay to Mr. Sweeting, in Whitechapel—he should have brought away thirty-six trusses, and one bundle for the horses, of the same kind and description—I followed him, for some reasons-when I got to Whitechapel the horses were standing in the street, eating clover of this year's growth, instead of what I had allowed him—I then went to the station-house—I had not seen him put in a quantity of clover of last year's growth for the horses, but there ought to have been about forty pounds—I have seen some clover and rye-grass hay of mine, it was new they were eating, it was not like what was on my wagon, but I am certain it was mine.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant V</hi> 5.) I went to White<lb></lb>chapel, and from thence to Ratcliffe-highway—I saw Carter delivering the thirty-six trusses of clover there at a corn-chandler's—he then turned from the shop towards Whitechapel, and in the bottom of the cart was part of a truss of hay tied with one band—he went to Mr. Sweeting, and spoke to him, then went up George-yard, and then to Black-horse-yard with his horses and cart—there he took the two leader horses out, and gave them water—then he took a handful from the old clover in the cart, and gave them a feed—he turned to come out of the yard, and was followed by Tay<lb></lb>lor-when they came to the public-house door, Taylor said, "Am I to have it"-Carter said, "It is worth more than that"-Taylor said, "I will give you that, and stand a pot of half-and-half"-Carter drew up to the Black Horse public-house door, and Taylor took his horse and cart there, close to Carter's cart—they stood on one side of the way, and I heard money pass—I could not see what-Taylor then took the part of the truss from Carter's cart, and put it into his own cart—that was the old clover hay—they called for a pot of half-and-half—I took Taylor.</p>

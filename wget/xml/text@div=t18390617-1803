               <p>Masterman, Peters, and Mildred. On the 29th of May, between twelve and one o'clock in the afternoon, I went to the office of the Van Diemen's Land Company to pay some calls on some shares—I saw the prisoner there, and told him I believed there was a call on some shares, that I had lost the letter announcing such call, and I would be obliged to</p>

               <p>him to check with me the names of the parties, and the amounts of the shares upon which I had to pay—I had to pay for two relatives as well as myself—the amount altogether was 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the prisoner referred to a book, to see that I was correct—on ascertaining the amount, I asked for a piece of paper, not having a blank cheque about me, and he gave; piece of blank paper—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—I wrote a cheque for the me a amount on it, on our house—when I had written it, he said, "Mr. Ewins, the secretary, who signs the receipts, is engaged, and if you will allow me, I will send the receipts to the banking-house;" to which I assented, and said, "Who are your hankers?"—he said, "Currie, and Co."—I then wrote "Currie and Co." across the cheque, for security, as I had no receipt—it appears that I have dated the cheque the 30th of May, but it was on the 29th—I have an account with Masterman and Co.—I made a memorandum on the back of the cheque, of the initials of the parties who owned the shares, and I find it here now—I called the pri<lb></lb>soner's attention to that, and said, "Ten shares, are in the name of Francis Mildred, my brother, ten in my own name, and five, in the name of Emily Pearce, who is now Mrs. Mildred"—I told him that for his guidance in, entering it in the Company's books—that is all that passed between us—next morning I was shown this cheque for 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—at our own banking-house, when I came to business—I think it was Mr. Stafford gave it to me—I perceived that it was forged, though it is very much like my writing—it is a forgery in every Respect—I never wrote it—in consequence of this, I went to the Van Diemen's Land Company's office, and saw the pri<lb></lb>soner and a junior clerk—I said to him, "I paid a cheque here yesterday for 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., have you paid it to your bankers?'"—he appeared confused, and I think said he was not quite sure about it, or something of that sort, but I was a little excited myself—I said, "These must be some mistake," for a larger cheque, had been presented—I then called in Mr. Stafford, who had accompanied me, but not into the room exactly, and asked, him whether the prisoner was the person who had presented the fogged cheque—he said, "Yes, you are the person," which the prisoner did not deny—I think he acknowledged it—he said, "I did," or words to that effect—he appeared very much confused—I said, "Unless you can give some explanation about this cheque, you must consider yourself my prisoner—he then said he had found it on the counter—there in a small sort of counter in the Company's office—the conversation took place in the room where I gave him the cheque—I told Mr. Stafford to get an officer, which he did—I saw some paper in use in the office, but I did not compare it—I have compared the two, cheques together—one paper appears to be thicker than the other—(<hi rend="italic">placing one over the other</hi>)—with the exception of the sum one appears a fac-simile of the other—the distance between the lines is exactly the same—I should think a person would be, able to trace, through so thin a piece of paper as that, the contents of the genuine cheque.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to the Van Diemen's Land Company—the prisoner was clerk to the Company, and Mr. Ewins is the secretary. There is an inner office, which Mr. Ewins usually sits in, and the prisoner's duty was in the outer room with me—saw Mr. Mildred at the office on the 29th of May—the prisoner attended to him—Mr. Ewins left the office about a quarter to five o'clock that afternoon—after Mr. Ewins left, the prisoner remained in the public office, which is the outer room—he went into the court-room before he went out, and after Mr. Ewins left—he staid there from five to ten mi<lb></lb>nutes, I believe—I did not observe the exact time—there is an almanac in the outer office—he came out of the inner room to look at it, and then re<lb></lb>turned into the inner room—I did not observe How long he remained there—he left the office about five o'clock—he desired me to remain till his return—our time for leaving is generally five o'clock—he did not say where he was going—he sometimes left at half-past five o'clock—the office is then entirely left—the time of leaving depends on the business—it is from five to half-past five o'clock—he returned, I think, before half-past five o'clock—he did not tell me where he had been, nor say any thing about a cheque—I left im<lb></lb>mediately on his coming back, and went to the office next morning at half-past nine o'clock—the prisoner was there before me—I remember Mr. Mildred coming about ten o'clock—the prisoner had said nothing to me about the cheque before Mr. Mildred came—Mr. Mildred showed it to me that morning, and the genuine one too—the prisoner was there—I had not seen the forged cheque till then—I have examined the paper on which it is written, and it agrees with the paper we have in the office for foreign correspondence—I have none of it here.</p>

               <p>—<hi rend="smallCaps">STAFFORD</hi>. I am a cashier in Masterman's house.

               <p>said, Curries were their bankers—I asked him why it was not paid into Curries—he said he was in the habit, in the afternoon, after the cheques had been paid in, of taking round to the bankers the cheques which were not crossed, and receiving the money for them—we told him we had a doubt as to the signature being genuine—he said if that was the case, he would leave the cheque with us—we had it in our possession then—I told him if he left the cheque, by way of security to himself, it should not be used for any other purpose; he might as well endorse it with Currie's name, which he did—this is the cheque he so crossed—I gave it to Mr. Mildred next morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I am secretary to the Van Diemen's Land Company. It was the prisoner's duty, when I was engaged with the Directors, to receive money from persons who came to pay on shares—on the 29th of May, about one o'clock, I was in the inner office, engaged with the Governor on important business, and it was the prisoner's duty, if he received a cheque at that time, to keep it till I was disengaged and then hand it over to me—the Governor left about three o'clock, I think, but I was not disengaged till I left, which was about a quarter to five o'clock—I saw the prisoner as I went through the office on leaving—he made no commu<lb></lb>nication to me of having received such a cheque—Curries are the bankers of the Company—it was the general rule that all cheques should be crossed when received from the proprietors—the prisoner may, on one or two particular occasions, which might be explained, go to bankers and pre<lb></lb>sent cheques received for calls, but the general rule of the office is to pay all cheques into Currie's—a proprietor, occasionally, has presented a cheque for more than the amount of his call—those were the occasions on which he presented cheques himself, and then he has done it by my directions—he has been in the service of the Company nearly seven years—this cheque was shown me first by Messrs. Bush and Co.</p>

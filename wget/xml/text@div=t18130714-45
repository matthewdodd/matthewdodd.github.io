On Friday evening, the 9th of July, the prisoner came to my shop; he asked my wife to see some waistcoats. I was at home, and almost as soon as he was in the shop I came forward to speak to a person who was there. He looked at several, and asked the price of several; at last he asked for some cheaper. She asked him five shillings for one, he bid half-a-crown. I told him he ought to be kicked out of the shop for offering half-a-crown; he then reeled out of the shop. About half an hour after he was gone my lad went to look up some clothes that were to go home; he could not find one of the waistcoats; it struck me that the <rs id="t18130714-45-deflabel272" type="occupation">sailor</rs>

I do not think I could speak to his person without the assistance of other circumstances. When I saw him I told the officer that he had stolen the waistcoat that was on him from my shop. This is the waistcoat; it is mine.</p>

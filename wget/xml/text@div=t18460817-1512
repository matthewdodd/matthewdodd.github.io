The prisoner was in my service as pot-boy from Nov. last—it was his duty to receive monies for beer of mine which he supplied, and he was to account to me for the money at the time he received it—he left my service in July—after he was gone I found Mrs. Tuffnel had paid him la. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for beer—he never gave me that money, nor accounted to me for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from Mr. Woodward.</p>

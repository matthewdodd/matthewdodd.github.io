                  </hi>. I am a general dealer, and live in Dorset-street, Spitalfields—I was in Newgate-market on 17th January, between 11 and 12 o'clock—I saw the prisoner standing near a cart with a whip in his hand—I had some coats on my arm—the prisoner and I got into conversa<lb></lb>tion about a coat; he asked me the price—I said 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>—he said he would give me 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said I could not take that—he said he would give me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said I could not take that—he said the cart belonged to his master, and if I would let him have the coat, he would show it to a friend; and when his master came back, he would pay me—he said he would not be many minutes—that was about 11 o'clock—he went away, and did not come back—I went to the Clothes Exchange in Houndsditch, and gave information about it to the person I bought it of—this is my coat—the prisoner never paid me a farthing for it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoners.</hi> I bought it of him, and gave him 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it.</p>

I was in Petticoat-lane on 17th January, about a quarter-before 12 o'clock—I saw the prisoner standing by the side of a Jew, who was looking at this coat—I said to the Jew, "Who does this coat belong to?"—he pointed to the prisoner, and I said to him, "Is this your coat?" he said, "Yes"—I said, "Is it your own?" he said, "Yes, I keep it for my own wear"—the Jew said he wanted 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—I told the prisoner I did not believe his statement, and I should take him into custody, which I did—I asked him his address; he refused to give it—I found the prosecutor soon afterwards.</p>

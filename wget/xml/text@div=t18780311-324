I am the wife of Louis Johns, of 32, Senior Street, Paddington—the prisoner and his wife lived in the house—on Wednesday, 6th February, between 8 and 9 p.m., Mrs. Edmunds called me three times—I went to her and she was bleeding violently from a severe wound on her chin—the prisoner was standing by her side—he said nothing, but ran upstairs and then ran down again and ran out of the house—he came back the next night and was given in custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's cousin, and live at 78, Oxford Terrace—on this Wednesday morning I met him between 10 and 11 a.m.—he was very excited relating to a telegram which he had in his hand—I did not read it—he presumed that it was from a man of whom he felt very jealous and said that he intended to take two or three persons' advice—I advised him not to do anything rash—he came to my house that evening still more excited—he produced a knife and said that he had the instrument he meant to deal with—I took it away from him, and on my giving him a sovereign he left and promised me not to go near his wife, but to go and get work.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. You made a great many statements—I told you in the morning that you were either half drunk or mad, and you threw your hat on the pavement and kicked it—you are peculiar tempered and very violent if anything offends you.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The Prisoner's Statement before the Magistrate</hi>. "What my wife has said is untrue." She did it herself. I said, 'I'll go to Mr. Rayner's and inquire where you've been to all night,' as she told me on the previous day, when she came home in the afternoon, that she was going to take two young ladies to the Kensington Museum and then go to Hengler's in the evening. I helped dress her, put on a clean chemise. She washed herself right down to the bottom, and I rubbed her back per<lb></lb>fectly dry. She said, 'I can never get it done like that unless you're at home.' I said, 'Anything else can I do for you.' She said, 'I wish you would go and fetch a drop of beer.' She gave me some money to get some porter. I fetched the porter and had half a pint myself. I</p>

               <p>went with her as far as the Royal Oak, and she asked me whether I would go in, and I declined and said I could not afford it. I said, 'Very well, what time shall you be home.' She said, 'Nine o'clock to a minute.' She didn't come home at nine, and I was anxiously waiting up all night for her. I laid down on the bed about five o'clock, and got up about seven and cut off a piece of bread and meat and went out with the knife eating it. That's how I came with the knife all day. When I came home at night she was at home. When I took the knife from my pocket she tried to take it from me, and said she did cut herself so that she could give me in charge, as she had heard I had been inquiring where she had been. So she did cut herself, and then called Mrs. Johns.</p>

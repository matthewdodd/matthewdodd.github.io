            . (Police-serjeant D 7). I received the prisoner in charge - I asked what he had in his hat; he said his pocket-handkerchief - I asked if he had any thing else; he said he did not know - I said, "You are accused of having a female's property;" I took it off, and found these articles in it - I put it on his head again, and said he must go to the house with me; in going along, he took off his hat, and threw the articles down - I took them up, and took him to the house; I found the prosecutrix asleep; she missed these articles - she said the prisoner had been there with her an hour and a half before; the prisoner only said he thought some one had put them into his hat.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Were not the things quite at the bottom of my hat? Witness. A. Yes; I did not see any string.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

               <p>I am a distiller. On Tuesday the 20th of June, at about ten in the evening, I overtook the prisoner at the top of Cheapside, and perceiving some bayonets in his hand, I asked him several questions respecting the mode of his obtaining them; but not receiving satisfactory answers, I conveyed him from thence to Aldersgate-church, and there delivered him to the gentlemen who were assembled to patrole the street.</p>
               <p>Did he tell you where he had taken these bayonets from? - He first of all told me he was the maker of them, and said he was carrying them home to his house at Cow-Cross.</p>

               <p>I am a captain in the City militia. I was on duty the 20th of June at Aldersgate-church, when Mr. Ramsbottom brought the prisoner to the guard; he brought him into the vestry with five bayonets. I asked the prisoner where he got them? He said it was no matter. I do not know whether he did not say, We had no business where he had them, that they were his own. I then took one of the bayonets into my hand and said, there was the king's mark on it. He said, suppose there was, they were allowed to take such things to make tools of; that they were useless. I observed that they were dangerous things, though he said they were useless; for if fixed to the end of a broom or mop-stick they might do a deal of mischief. I said, they were cast bayonets. He admitted they were; they were not passed fit to be mustered in the Tower. I said to him, what were you going to fix them upon? He said upon any thing I like; he was sent to the Compter; he was in liquor at the time. I locked the bayonets up in the vestry that night, and delivered them to the constable in the morning.</p>

               <p>I am inspector of the bayonets so see if they are serviceable.</p>
               <p>Look at these bayonets, do you know whose they are? - To the best of my knowledge they are the king's; there is the mark of the viewer and the mark of the contractor upon them. I am clear to the marks.</p>
               <p>These things, I apprehend, are not given away to make tools of? - No; never.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you any doubt whether they are the King's bayonets or not? - Not at all; I have no doubt in the least; I am almost positive they were taken out of a shop where I work; one at least I know.</p>
               <p>Where is that shop? - In the Tower. I saw the prisoner about six o'clock on the Tuesday evening, the day he was taken up, very much in liquor in the tower.</p>
               <p>What reason have you to believe that bayonet was in your shop? - Because it was unfinished.</p>
               <p>What is the value of these bayonets? - Pretty near two shillings, rather under that; they are damaged and not fit for the king's service.</p>
               <p>What is the value of them at a low valuetion? - I think not more than one shilling, as they are damaged.</p>

               <p>I had a hurt in my toe and was discharged, being unable to work, I took them to make me a few tools of; I did not think there was any harm in taking them.</p>

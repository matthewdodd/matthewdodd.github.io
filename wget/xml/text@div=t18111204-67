            . I am a leather-dresser. On Thursday night I saw the prisoner looking in the shop window at the Seven Dials, not this shop; I saw him try to open another shop door. In consequence of that I had suspicion of him; he ran and looked in to Mr. Treasure's shop, he went into the passage, the street door was open, the shop door was in the passage; I saw him go into the shop and take the quartern loaves from the window; I looked through the window, I saw him take one first; he shook his head and laughed, as if he had done it snug without their seeing him, and then he took the other and came into the passage; I met him in the passage and collared him with the loaves in his hand, and then I called out to Mr. Treasure; I asked the prisoner if he did it for want I would let him go; he made no answer. I said, it does not appear that you did it for want, and then I halloaed out.</p>

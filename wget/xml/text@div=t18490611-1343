                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live in Portugal-street, Lincoln's-inn-fields, in the parish of St. Giles-in-the-Fields—it is my dwelling-house, and is about 100 yards from Francis-court. On 28th May, at half-past six o'clock in the morning, I was alarmed—I examined my shop, and missed t roll of cloth, three coats, a hat, and a pair of trowsers—some of them are here.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the sister of Charles Crooks. On the night of 27th May I was the last person up—there is a grating outside the house, which I believe was safe—if anybody lifted that up, they could get down to the kitchen window, which was only shut down; from there a person could get to the shop by breaking open the lock of the shop door—the shop door was locked that night—the street door was fast, and had the bar up—I went to bed at twelve—all was then safe.</p>

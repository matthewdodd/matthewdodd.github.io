                  </hi> I am an upholsterer, of 38, Conduit Street, Bond Street—I was acting as trade assignee for a person named Mitcheson, and Messrs. Lumley were my solicitors in the matter—I know the prisoner as their managing clerk in our department—I received a letter from him, which I have not got, but in consequence of which he called on me next day, and wished for an immediate payment for the Registrar or Messenger of the Court of Bankruptcy, of 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I had heard that there was a claim due from me to Mr. Stubbs, as trade assignee in the bankruptcy—the prisoner asked me to give him an open cheque, as he must take the money, a cheque being of no use, and I drew it to E.J. Stubbs, because I wished to identify it—this is it; it is for 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—it has been returned to me as paid—I believe this letter to be the prisoner's writing.</p>

Lumley, or Mr. Walker, that I should get somebody else to buy Mitcheson's goods, but I did not do so—Mr. Lumley's agent valued the goods—I do not know of my own knowledge whether it was his brother—I believe they are brothers or cousins—I do not know that anything was said about my accepting the valuation price, there is a letter of mine, which explains everything—the goods were received on my premises by Mr. Walker's instructions, and I took charge of them—I have not got them now, a portion of them have been sold, and the other portion were removed to Messrs. Lumley's, the auctioneer's office—nobody bought them on my account, or by my instructions, or on my behalf, I sold them to customers in the regular way of business—when I gave this cheque to Mr. Walker I may have told him that somewhere about 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of the goods were sold, but no money was received for them—my books show all the transactions—I think two applications were made to me before I paid the 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

                  </hi> I am a solicitor, of 15, Old Jewry Chambers, in partnership with my brother, both there and at the West End—the pri<lb></lb>soner was our managing clerk in conveyancing and bankruptcy, and had been there between five and six months—his salary was to be 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week for six months, and if he suited me he was to have 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—he had the charge of the proceedings <hi rend="italic">in re</hi> Mitchison, and I twice or thrice gave him directions to procure a sum of money which was due from the estate to Mr. Stubbs, the messenger—this letter is in the prisoner's writing. (<hi rend="italic">This was from the prisoner to Messrs. Sedley and Co., stating that he would call on them next day "in re Mitcheson."</hi>) He signs that "Lumley and Lumley, "with his initials underneath, we had authorised him to do that—it was his duty on receiving any sum on behalf of the firm to enter it in the out cash-book, and also in his diary—this is his diary: here is the entry "Mitcheson attending," but nothing about money—any clerk who receives money is bound to write it in the out cash-book, and I discharge it—here is no entry in the out cash-book of money from the prisoner on 31st May—he did not pay over the cheque to me or the proceeds of it—I always adopt the course of receiving a cheque from the clerk, and sending a cheque of my own to the person to whom the money is due—the prisoner was under notice to leave, and the month expired on 15th June—after 31st May I received a very pressing letter from the messenger, and a subsequent letter: I think there were four altogether—I constantly said to the prisoner, "What is doing <hi rend="italic">re</hi> Mitcheson? "—he never told me that he had received the money—I had a conversation with Mr. Sedley on 21st Jane, by which I found that he had paid the money, and I instructed my clerk to go to the Bankruptcy Court aud fetch the prisoner—the door was slightly open, and I saw the prisoner come back with my clerk—Mr. Sedley was with me, and I called out to the prisoner, "Walk into the further room"—he left his hat in the large office—he afterwards dis<lb></lb>appeared.</p>

               <p>on the Rolls in that name ever since I was sixteen, and before that, since I was probably two years of age—I was engaged about three minutes before I left to see whether the prisoner was in the further room, I then went into the further room and did not find him—I will swear that I spoke to the prisoner after 31st May about the debt due from Mr. Sedley to the messenger—I have heard of the prisoner going to Mr. Sedley over and over again—several months elapsed after the bankruptcy before this cheque was paid—Mitcheson's goods were valued by my brother in Chancery Lane—it was not agreed that Mr. Sedley himself should take them at the valuation price; it was proposed that the bankruptcy should be annulled and that he should pay 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound—I only saw Mr. Sedley once, and that was at the earlier stage—I do not know that it was proposed that Mr. Sedley was to cover himself, to take the goods at the valuation price, and sell them at a profit—I mean to say that every sum that has passed through the prisoner's hands has found its way into the out cash-book as far as I know—he was with me five months—I remember a small purchase being carried through in the case of Collins—75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was raised by him on my behalf, and he handed over the money to me in bank notes—I do not know the exact date. (<hi rend="italic">The prisoner here stated that it was about a week before he left.</hi>) The prisoner left on Saturday, 15th June, and therefore I suppose it would be the 8th; at that time another clerk was in his place, and the major portion of the entries are in the writing of the new clerk, only a few are in the prisoner's writing—his instructions were to enter every sum he received in the out cash-book, and my memory does not serve me that there has ever been arny exception besides this—he did not give me notice—he did tell me that he was about to apply for a vacant berth at Liverpool, but I did not write a testimonial for him—it was not in consequence of that that he gave me notice—the new clerk came a week before the prisoner left—the prisoner did not at my request remain a week after his time expired, in order that he might explain to the new clerk his duties; he said that he had some leisure time, and he should be happy to give any assistance to Mr. Wilkinson—I said, "I shall be happy to remunerate you; "but he said, "I do not require it"—I think he came every day—there is not a small sum due to him, not that I am aware of; he left on the 15th—I gave him a cheque in settlement on the 17th—it was after he received the cheque that he came to assist the new clerk—he was several days doing that—there is not 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. due to him for money paid that I am aware of—I have balanced no accounts with him—he never paid money, he would receive money—if he did pay anything he would ask the petty cash clerk for the money—if the petty cash clerk was out, and he wished to serve his master, he would pay the money him<lb></lb>self—I had two written references with him.</p>

                  </hi>. I was Miss Chappell—I am since married—at this time. I was single, and living with my mother, Maria Chappell, at 18, Ropewalk, Deptford—I know the prisoner—he lived with his mother down the rope<lb></lb>walk, nearly opposite our house—on Monday night, 28th September, pre<lb></lb>viously to going to bed, I fastened the doors and windows, and left every<lb></lb>thing secure—I went to bed at 10 o'clock, in what we call the middle room—I was awoke, as near as I can judge, about half—past 1—my mother was awake before me—she woke me—I heard some one shutting the street-door—I got up, opened the window, looked out, and saw John Archer coming out—I saw him cross the road, making his way to his mother's house—I hallooed out to him, "All right, <hi rend="italic">Tripey</hi>, I know who you are"—he then ran, and another one joined him close by his mother's house—they both ran through Fishing-smack-alley—I just caught sight of the prisoner's face as he was going from the door—it was a bright, moonlight morning—after this I and my mother went down stairs—I found the parlour window wide open, and the shutters closed—there was a small piece of wood broken off the shutter, near the bolt—I missed this shawl (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I saw it last on the night it was stolen—we left it on the bureau when we went to bed—I called out for the police, and Taver came up—I gave him a description of the prisoner, and how he was dressed.</p>

               <p>I get my living by what is called "penny-bundling"—I have known the prisoner there a long time—he is quite a respectable young man as far as I know—he has lived opposite for some years—I don't know whether he gets his living the same way as I do—I heard he had been at Mr. Davis's, but I never saw him there—Fishing-smack-alley leads into King-street—the prisoner and the other man afterwards came back into the Ruins—I saw them there while I was giving the alarm to the police, and I hallooed to him to stop them—this shawl was found next morning next door to Digby's garden, by a girl; not in it—he was not tried for that—he got three months for being on some premises in the rope-walk—no charge was made against him about this shawl, that I am aware of—Fishing-smack-alley is about five minutes' walk from our house—I saw them run through that way as I was looking out of the window—I did not describe the other man—the prisoner wore a cap—he was running when I hallooed to him—when I went down stairs I missed the shawl—we came up stairs again, looked out of the window, and saw the police in New-street—at that time the two men were in the ruins—I hallooed to the policeman, who was in New-street on duty, to stop him, for I knew the one with the white jacket and he chased him—the prisoner wore a white jacket—I don't know what became of them—the prisoner was taken into custody, I think, the following Wednesday—I had not seen him about his place every day, as I know of—I never saw him at his house—our house was broken into on the Tuesday night or Wednesday morning—I think the prisoner was arrested the Wed<lb></lb>nesday week after that—he was then taken in his bed—I don't know whether I told the policeman it was Archer the same night, or not.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, R</hi> 239). About half-past 1 on Tuesday morning, 22d, in consequence of hearing a cry of "Police!" I went to a place called "The Ruins," facing the last witness's house—I saw her looking out of the bed-room window—she spoke to me—on going to the Ruins I saw two persons there in a back yard, one was dressed in a dark coat, and a cap, and the other in a black jacket—that one got over a wall, and got away—I chased the other, but there being two outlets he got into the street, and also escaped—I returned to the last witness—she told me she knew who they were—I went and got another constable, and she described the men to him.</p>

               <p>and little brothers were in the room—I roused him, and told him I was going to take him across the road to Mrs. Chappell's, as they said he had broken into the house, and I asked him to account where he was at the time—he said he was at Greenwich, and knew nothing of it—I took him to the witness, and she identified him—his dress corresponded with her de<lb></lb>scription—I received the shawl next day—it was found by a little girl in a yard between Digby's mother's house, and the prisoner's mother's yard—I did not see it found.</p>

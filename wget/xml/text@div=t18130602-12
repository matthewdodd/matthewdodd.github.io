I was sitting in my room adjoining Mr. Holman's, with my door shut, between three and four in the afternoon. I heard the door jar; I opened my door, and saw the outer door open; I then looked into the passage; I saw a gentleman going up stairs, and the prisoner on the stairs with something covered up. I went into Mr. Holman's room, and looked into Pump-court; and seeing the prisoner go out of the door, I looked round, and missed this desk off the table. I then suspected it must be her that had got it; I pursued her, and caught the prisoner in Temple-lane Whitefriars, with this aesk covered up in an old great coat. I uncovered it, and discovered it was this desk that I had missed out of the chambers. I then called out for an officer; nobody came. I took the desk from her. I tried to secure her myself; but my having the desk, she got away from me. I am positive she is the woman. This was on Saturday; she was apprehended in the Temple on Monday, for an assault.</p>
               <p>THOMAS SHEPHARD. On Saturday, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I was at No. 6, in Temple-lane. I saw the witness, Harris, and the prisoner coming by the Temple, with this desk. He was trying to take her into custody; he called out for an officer; no officer came. On Monday she came again. I am sure she is the same woman. She was taken on the Monday in the Temple. I told the officer that she was the same woman that stole the desk.</p>

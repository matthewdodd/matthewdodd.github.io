When she came in there she asked the person to go backwards, either into the yard or else any where, where she could speak to her; accordingly the woman said there was no place but the one pair of stairs where they went, and I went up, and I gave a shilling for some gin, and the other woman went out for some, and she drank a little, and I drank a little, and another woman drank; I believe there was but a quartern brought; in the mean time

She said she saw me with six or seven shillings, and she wanted to run her hand into my waistcoat pocket; so at last I said, when I found her resolute, as that I had got but one guinea and a penny in my pocket; says she, let me have the guinea, and I will go and change it, and bring you twenty shillings good. I told her that I would not change it for her nor no other woman in England. I directly puts it into my breeches pocket, my fob as I thought; but instead of putting the guinea into my pocket, I put a halfpenny in, I drawed a halfpenny out of my waistcoat pocket and left the guinea in my pocket; accordingly she puts her hand into my pocket and takes this guinea and a halfpenny out; I thought it had been only a penny that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179407160031"></xptr>she had got. I immediately turns down stairs and goes to the door, and goes about ten yards from the door, and puts my hand into my pocket to see what she had got, and I found it was the guinea along with the halfpenny; I immediately returned into the house again directly; and as soon as I returned into the house I saw her running into the necessary, and I followed her, and pulled her fast by the arm, and said, Mrs. Rogers, you have got the guinea that you took out of my pocket instead of the halfpenny; says I, will you give it me again? She denied having it some time; at last she told me if I would go to a public house and call for half a pint of rum I should find my guinea again. I went out of the house directly to go to this house, but she did not come; as soon as ever I came out of the house she tried to run away up into Rosemary-lane, and there I took her and detained her till I sent for an officer, and I had her taken into custody.</p>

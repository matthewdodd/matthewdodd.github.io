I went up stairs, and my neighbour called out to me - I came down, and immediately missed the watch; it was there when I went up stairs; it was a silver watch, with a gilt chain, seal, and key. I had seen the inside of it; there was a watch paper, and a worked piece of cloth in it, in the form of a flower-pot. I had sewn it on the paper myself.</p>

            . I live next door to Hendley. On Saturday, the 6th of March, about a quarter to two o'clock I saw the prisoners Holloway and Jermaine - Jermaine went down into Hendley's kitchen; Holloway did not go further than the passage leading to the kitchen - Boswell was with them, but he went down the town to a grocer's-shop, ten or twelve yards off, for some cheese. I saw Holloway come out of the passage about a minute before Jermaine. I heard Boswell say when he left them, that he would go and get some cheese, and asked the others were they were going - they said they would go next door and get some onions; this was before they went into the house. Jermaine came to my door; I told him I did not sell onions - that he could get them next door; they did not go into the shop. Jermaine went down into the kitchen I am certain; there is only a thin partition between that and my house, and I heard him go into the kitchen, and seeing him come out without onions I went and called Mrs. Hendley.</p>

            . I live at Acton. In consequence of what I heard from Hendley, I went in pursuit towards Ealing-common, and just as I got on the common I saw the three prisoners walking along; I was walking - they turned round, and seeing me, they turned short to the right, and ran into a lane. I lost sight of them; I got on a butcher's horse, and rode till I got up to them in Ilangerhill-lane, and said,</p>
               <p>"Stop" - Boswell said,</p>
               <p>"What do you want;" I said,</p>
               <p>"You have stolen a watch." Boswell then got over a ditch, and Holloway did the same. I followed them on foot, and as I got over the ditch Boswell dropped the watch papers into the ditch, out of his breeches pocket. I followed them both across two fields, and then collared Boswell; Holloway turned back, as if to shew fight; they wanted to know what I wanted with them; I said they had stolen a watch - Holloway said he had not; I asked what they ran for; he said,</p>
               <p>"I ran, I thought you was after me for stealing turnips." I secured them both, brought them back to the ditch, and picked up the watch papers, which I produce.</p>

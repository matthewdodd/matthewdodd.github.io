            . I live at No. 35, Blue Anchor-alley. I bought a bonnet of the prisoner, and gave it to the policeman; I bought it about five weeks ago; I asked if it was her own; she said, yes it was, and if I did not buy it, somebody else should, for she wanted a pair of shoes; I gave her a pair of shoes and a shilling for it.</p>

             (a prisoner). I lived at No. 4, Three King-court, White-cross-street. The prisoner asked me to go with her to sell the bonnet; I took her to Mrs. Green, and she bought it of her; I dare say this is the bonnet; I cannot swear to it; it has the appearance of the bonnet; I only saw it for about five minutes; Mrs. Green gave her a shilling, and a pair of shoes for it, and asked if it was her own; she said "Yes;" I took a shirt from the prisoner to Mrs. Price's, and brought her a shilling for it; this has the appearance of the shirt, but I never opened it, nor examined it; I gave the prisoner the money when I came back; she said, she did not wish me to have taken it to Mrs. Price's for she had had it from there; that was all she said; when I sold it to Mrs. Price she examined it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). On the 5th of October, when I was returning from my work, I met a person in White-cross-street, and I bought the bonnet and shirt. I wore the bonnet several times in the neighbourhood, and then being short of money, I took the articles to the person who now prosecutes me, and she was not up. I had been in the habit of selling things to her these three years; then meeting the witness Smith, and she told me she knew a person that would buy them of me, and then in three weeks after I was taken into custody for them. The witness Smith is of a very light character, and has been tried twice at Portsmouth, and once at the Old Bailey, and is now for trial here.</p>
               <p>MARY SMITH re-examined. I was never in my life in custody at Portsmouth; and never tried there; I was tried here six years ago; I have been at Portsmouth, but was never in custody there.</p>

               <p>JAMES WANSTALL. I am a Police-constable. On Saturday night, the 30th of April, I saw the prisoner near to No. 19, Canonbury-square, Islington, with a bag in one hand and a fowl in the other - as soon as he saw me, he dropped the bag and the fowl; he ran, and I pursued -I saw him stopped by another officer; I brought him back to where I had seen him at first - I found one fowl on the road, which was dead, but quite warm, and this bag was close to the door with six fowls in it; they were dead, but quite warm - their necks had been broken; I took the prisoner to the station, and took the fowls to the owner.</p>
               <p>THOMAS SHAW. I am a Police-constable. I stopped the prisoner that night - what this witness states is correct.</p>

In consequence of an alarm, I got up on the night of the 30th of April, and found the prisoner in custody; I went to the fowl-house, and missed seven fowls - the fowl-house is close to the garden door; I saw the seven fowls and the bag - I knew the fowls were mine.</p>

               <p>JAMES WANSTALL. He was not giving any alarm - he was attempting to put the fowls into the bag.</p>

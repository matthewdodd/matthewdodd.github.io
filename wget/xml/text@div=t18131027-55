The prisoner lodged in the same house, and slept in the same bed with me. On the 6th of October we went to bed about twelve o'clock. I had a silver watch at that time; the dial plate was broken. When I went to bed I placed it on the chair by the bed side; it was there when I fell asleep. I awoke about six o'clock on the 7th of October; when I awoke I missed the watch off the chair. The prisoner was then gone. He was in bed when I put the watch on the chair on the over night. The prisoner did not return to his lodging. I never saw him until I saw him in custody; I then asked him how he came to do it; he said he had the watch, and he had pawned it over Blackfriars-bridge, and he had sold the duplicate to the man that keeps the Magdalen coffee-house; I value the watch at three guineas; I gave four guineas for it. I have had it for seven or eight years.</p>

            . I bought the ticket of the watch of the prisoner. I am a servant at the Magdalen coffee-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. I cannot say I do know him: I cannot say that he is the person I bought the duplicate of. I purchased the duplicate of a man for my master, Mr. Eastall. After I had purchased the duplicate I went to the pawnbrokers and took the watch out. I brought the watch to my master, and the man was asked whether that was the watch or not; he said it was. I gave the watch to my master.</p>
               <p>Q. Does your master deal in articles of this sort - A. No, never before, or since. The young man, whoever he is, asked me if I would buy the duplicate of a watch. I asked him if it was his own; he said it was. I told him I did not want such a thing, if it was his own I would ask my master. My master came; I shewed him the duplicate, and told him the man asked three shillings for the duplicate. Master gave me the money to buy the duplicate. The watch was pawned for thirty shillings. I went to the pawnbrokers, and took the watch. I then gave it to my master.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 18th of October, the prisoner was delivered into my custody by a City officer. I then had some knowledge of his face; he is a tailor. The prisoner said he knew me; his master had worked for me. I told him what he was in custody for, and asked him how he came to do it. He said he did it through distress; he had pawned the watch for thirty shillings, and sold the duplicate to the publican that kept the Magdalen coffee-house. The landlord produced the watch at the office; the prosecutor swore to it. The watch is very remarkable; the dial plate is broken. The publican is here with the watch.</p>

            . I am the keeper of the Magdalen coffee-house. On the 8th of October, the prisoner was at my house; my waiter brought the watch to me; I took the watch to the prisoner, I asked him if this was the watch that he had pledged; he said, it was. This is the watch: I have had it ever since; it is a remarkable watch, there is a bit of the face broken. The watch was pledged for thirty shillings; the prisoner said he wanted three shillings to make up some money that he had spent the day before, before he could go home; I gave him the three shillings, and told him he might have the watch again any day he pleased. This is the watch.</p>

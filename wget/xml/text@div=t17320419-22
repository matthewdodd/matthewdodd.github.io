               <p>Bryan Ambler. On Saturday Night about 9 a Clock, as I was in a back Room behind my Shop, I heard a noise, and coming forward, I saw my Boy struggling with Scott (the least of the Prisoners) and he told me that Scott had held him, while another ran away with the Hat.</p>

            . While I was behind the Counter, Scott came into the Shop, and ask'd, what was a Clock? and Whitesides was behind him. Scott clapp'd his Hand on the Flap of the Counter, and held it down, that I should not lift it up to come out, and at the same time Whitesides snatch'd a Hat off the Counter, and ran away with it, and Scott went after him, but I stopt Scott before he had got to the next Door, and got him into the Shop again; I think Whitesides is the other Person, but I cannot swear positively to him.</p>

            . I happen'd to be at a Shop where Whitesides came in to sell a Hat, and Hatband, he sold the Band for 3 d. and I heard him tell his Companions, that he took it out of such a Haberdasher's Shop, in Cheapside, upon which I went and gave the Prosecutor notice, and we found the Prisoner next Day at the same Shop, where I had seen him before.</p>

I was at Enfield fair with the prosecutor and John Bird—I saw the prisoner put this hand-kerchief into his pocket—he was then standing at the top of the town, outside the Nag's Head—I do not know how he came by it—it was about four o'clock—I took hold of him, and told him he had got that young man's handkerchief, and asked him to deliver it—he never said a word, but ran away—I ran, and caught him in the Greyhound-yard—I did not lose sight of him—I held him till the policeman came and took him.</p>

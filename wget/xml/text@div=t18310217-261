               <p>Cross-examined by MR. HEATON. Q. Have you always told the same story about this? A. Yes - I never let the prisoner go; I seized his hand - he drew his hand back, but I still held his arm; I am quite sure I caught his hand in my pocket - I had taken out a halfpenny for the balck man, and before I had time to give it, the prisoner put his hand into my pocket; I was not at all in liquor - it was not the prisoner who proposed to send for an officer; it was not more than twenty minutes before the officer came - he tried to get away, and said if I were not a woman he would strike me, but the mob said, "You shall not strike her."</p>

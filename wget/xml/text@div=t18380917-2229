                  </hi>. I am a fanner at Barking, in partnership with my brother. We occupy 500 acres of land there—the prisoner was in our em<lb></lb>ploy, off and on, for eight or nine years. On Tuesday, the 28th of August, I saw him before seven o'clock in the morning—he was going to work, and came for some beer with another man—they were to have gone is work that day in a field-in the afternoon I went to the field, and found they had not done above an hour's work—they were both lying in the field, and his mate was asleep—the prisoner rose his head up, and I spoke to him about it, and told them they had both better go, and not left me see them any more, as they were of no use—I then left him, and I did not see him again that day—on the following morning, about six o'clock, I heard something had happened to one of my calves—I went down to the cow-house with the man who came to give me the information, and found one calf with its throat cut—I found three or four men in the cow-house—I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner there afterwards—I had been told something about a basket, and when I went in I said, "Where is the basket you told me of?"—the pri<lb></lb>soner was behind the men, and said, "It is mine, master"—I said, "How came your basket here?"—he said, "I don't know, <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi> must have brought it"-(he has a brother named William who worked on the farm)—I said, "How could <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi> bring your basket when he is at work in the barn, and you ought to have been mowing in the field; it could not be <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi> "—he said, "Master, you don't suspect I cut the calf?"—I said, "Why, I don't know, <hi rend="italic">Joe</hi>, it looks very suspicious, your basket being in this cow-house"-left the cow-shed and went and spoke to my brother, and in consequence of what passed, went with my brother in search of the prisoner—we found him sitting down in a field in about a quarter of an hour, and his mate with him—I said, "<hi rend="italic">Joe</hi>, you are the man that cut the calf's throat?" he said, "No, master, it <hi rend="italic">aynt</hi> "—I said, "Never mind, get up and let me see"—he got up and I saw blood on his trowsers and on his smock—I said, "Look here, here is blood about you"—he said that was through his</p>

                  </hi>. I am cowman to Messrs. Choat On the Tuesday night before this happened I remember leaving the calf in the cow-yard about nine o'clock—I know the prisoner's brother Bill—he was at work in the barn with me that night—I saw him leave his work about nine o'clock-before I left the cow-shed I shut the barn up, and he went right across the yard into the road—I saw him go off the cow-yard—I did not go into the cow-house myself that night—on the following morning I went to the cow-house about five o'clock—my son had got there before me—he showed me a basket in the cow-house—I noticed that a truss of straw which had been tied up the night before was opened and spread a little, as if somebody had slept there—it was untied—I fetched the cows into the field, and went to the calf-pen to fetch the calves, and found one had its throat cut-as I was leav<lb></lb>ing the cow-house I saw the prisoner walking in the cow-yard, about three or four yards from the door—I asked him what he was after—he said, "Me, I am looking for my brother <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi> "-his brother had not come at that time—it was about half-past five—I do not know whether the prisoner went away or not, but I did not see him again till I saw him in the cow-house—on finding the calf cut, I went to master and brought him down to the cow-house—the prisoner was then there—I had told my son to take care of the basket which was found in the cow-house until I came back, and when I came back I saw the basket on the prisoner's shoulder-master asked him about it—I have heard his evidence—it is correct—the calf was obliged to be killed afterwards.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the son of the witness. I went to the cow-house about five o'clock in the morning, and found a basket in the cow-house up against a post—the calf-pen is about two yards from the cow-house—I noticed a truss of straw untied and littered about a little—that had been tied up the day before—my father came after me, and I told him what I had seen—he left the basket with me and went to fetch his master—the prisoner came into the cow-house with three more men—I told him there was basket—he said, "It is mine"—he took it and kept it till my father came in—the basket was not there the night before.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been a butcher, and live at Dagenham in Essex. On Wednesday morning, the 9th of August, I was called into the prosecutor's cow-house, and found the calf with its throat cut about an inch cross ways, with a blunt or short pointed blade to enter—it was then ripped up about the length of my hand, and jagged and torn up-(<hi rend="italic">looking at the knife found on the prisoner</hi>)—in my opinion this is the sort of knife that would make such a cut—there is no point to it.</p>

               <p>morning I was informed of this by Mr. Choat—I went and examined the calf in the pen—I put my fist into the hole—there was a deal of blood about the pen—I went to the prisoner who was in charge of somebody at the house, and asked him how the blood came on his trowser and said I suspected him of cutting the calf—the blood was on the front part of his trowsers, and on examining further I found blood on his right shoe—these was also some on the right sleeve of his smock-frock—I said to him "Are you a right-handed man or a left?"—he said, "I am right-handed"—the blood on the sleeve appeared fresh—I first discovered the blood on the corner of the smock-frock, and afterwards found it had run up into the gathers—I said to him, "It is impossible this blood could come from the bleeding of your nose, or it would be on the upper part of your smock-frock"—it was quite fresh—there was no appearance of his having a bloody nose—I then said, "Where were you last night? I understood you were not at your lodging; where did you sleep? you were seen to come from the field last night with your victuals basket"—he said, "Yes, I had my basket, and I went to Mr. Gray's field with it; I went to sleep there, and when I awoke it was gone; how it came into the cow-house I can't say, I did not take it there, but it certainly is my basket"—on searching him I found this knife which I have produced—when I saw the blood on his sleeve I considered he must have held the calf, so that the blood would come on the right foot, and I found blood on his right foot—it had been rubbed to get it off the upper leather, but it was left on the sole under the nails—I could not observe any thing on the knife—I said to him, "You have been eating before I saw you this morning"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "What have you been eating?"—he said, "Beef," and the blade of the knife was greasy as if he had been cutting meat—the blood on the smock-frock must have spirted and flown very much.</p>

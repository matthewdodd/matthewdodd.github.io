I live in the same house as the last witness—about 10.30 on Saturday night, I saw the prisoner King and a man named Mackey outside the house—they shook hands and parted. King went towards Dove Row, and Mackey went into his own house which is next door to me—I got a key from Alice Mackey the sister of Mackey, and I went indoors and changed my clothes—I did not notice anything then—I came out again about 10.45 to 11 o'clock, and closed the front door after me—there was no candle on the stairs then—the front door could not be opened without a key—I returned at 12.30 with Mr. Holyoak—we went upstairs and missed the boots—next day, about 6.15, I saw King in Dove Row with another man, King was carrying this bundle—he took it to Hilditch's house—I went and gave information at the station.</p>

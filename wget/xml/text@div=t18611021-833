                  </hi>. I am an omnibus-proprietor, of 74, Horseferry-road—the prisoner has been in my service, as a stableman, for the last four months—on the morning of 1st October I missed a bay gelding, and at the same time I missed the prisoner: he was missing from his work the previous afternoon—he had not given any notice of leaving—he bad no authority whatever to take away any of my horses—I saw the horse again, the same evening, at Winkley's, the horse-slaughterer's.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a licensed horse-slaughterer, of Green-street, Friar-street, Blackfriars—on 30th September, about a quarter to 8 in the evening, the prisoner brought me a brown gelding—he knocked at the gate and said, "I have brought you a horse"—I said,—What do you want for it?"—he said, "2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said, "We have a great many of them, I cannot buy it for that"—he said, "What can you give for it?"—I said, "30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>." he said, "Open the gate, and let me bring him in"—I opened the gate and he came in—I called my horsekeeper and said to him, in the prisoner's presence, "John, take this man down to Mr. Harris, and lot him inspect the</p>

I am inspector of horse-slaughterers of St George's parish—the prisoner came to me with Winkley's man—I asked the prisoner the reason he wanted the horse killed, as I saw it was a good-looking horse and not fit to be killed—he said it was on account of the horse <hi rend="italic">jibbing.</hi>—I went back with him to Mr. Winkley, to know if he knew him or his master—he said, no—I asked the prisoner where his master lived—he said at Notting-hill—I said I must take him there and see if it was true—I had my horse put to, and drove him there—I found that his story was false; no such person as Brown lived there—he would have got away from me, but I called a policeman and gave him in charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a gunner in the Royal Artillery at Woolwich—on Christmas night I was in the Uncle Tom's Cabin, where I had a pint of beer—I met a female named Hockley there, and went home with her to No. 5, Hogg-lane—while we were there the prisoner Porter came in, and muttered something to me, I could not understand what, and then he up with his fist and struck me—I fell on the ground—Bates came in directly afterwards and fell on me—Porter then pulled my two Crimean medals (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from my breast—Bates did not get off me when Porter had taken them from me—I pulled myself away from them at well at I could, and ran out for a policeman—I found one, and took him back to the room—the two prisoners were gone, but the girl was still there—I afterwards saw the pri<lb></lb>soners in the Uncle Tom's Cabin, where I had seen them together that same evening some time before it happened—I gave them in custody—the police<lb></lb>man took them from there—I picked up one of the medals from where Rates had been sitting.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a single woman, living at Woolwich—on Christ<lb></lb>mas night I was drinking with the prosecutor in the Uncle Tom's Cabin—he went home to my lodging afterwards with me—while we were there, Porter came into the room, struck the prosecutor, and knocked him down, and Bates came in and held him down on the floor, and then knocked the candle out, so that I could not see—the prosecutor had both his medals when he came in—I afterwards saw that they were gone—the prisoners ran out of my room directly—I went and showed the policeman where they were, and they struck me as soon as I pointed them out—I saw one of the medals found—it was found on the mantel-piece close to where they knocked Baker down—the other was found afterwards in the Uncle Tom's Cabin by the policeman.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, R</hi> 159). On Christmas night, I went with the prosecutor to 95, Hogg-lane, Woolwich—he com plain ad of being assaulted, and of having lost two medals—he said two knaves had taken them from him, a tall one, and a short one—I found Hockley alone in her room—I found a Crimean medal on the mantle-shelf, behind an ornament—I after<lb></lb>wards went to the Uncle's Tom's Cabin, and the prisoners were pointed out to me as the parties—Porter struck the last witness—I sent for another constable, and stood at the door till he came back—when I was about to search Bates he ran into a water-closet at the end of the house, where I took him in custody—another constable took Porter—when Bates rose from his seat in the public-house the prosecutor called out, "Then lies my medal"—the prisoners denied haying stolen it.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Porters Defence.</hi> On Christmas Eve I went home with the witness Hockley, and stopped with her all night. I got up in the morning and gave her two shillings; we had two or three pots of beer, and then we went to the "Cabin" and stopped there all the afternoon; and in the evening we went there again, and from there to the Star and Carter, where we stopped till about 10 at night. When I went into the room Hockley, Baker, a marine, and an officer's servant were in the room. Hockley assaulted me, I struck her, and Baker got up to take her part, and I struck him.</p>

               <p>The lead was cut across the middle, as it was hanging; it was taken from the Cockloft, the top of the house at the trap-door; I saw it in that situation about six, my girl called for me, and I came into the house; I saw nobody there, the persons were gone, the lead was entirely loose from the house, no part of it remained fixed to the house; I went into the next house, the garret-door was fast; I saw no other place otherwise to get into the top of my house, without coming from there; nobody would open the door; we sent for an officer from Litchfield-street, and broke open the door of the next house to me; we found the prisoner in bed, pretending to be asleep; but I cannot say whether he was or not; all his bed was on the floor, and he was laying at top of it; there were some straw and some rags; nobody else was in the house but himself; the prisoner can come out of the back-garret where he lodges, and go the whole length of the street; I never saw the prisoner before to my knowledge; he said he knew nothing at all about it.</p>

I employed the prisoner to print out of doors, at his own place; in July last, I discovered my loss - I received information, and went to Mr. Christie, of Snow-hill, and found 38lbs. of minion type, which I knew to be mine; I had lost considerably more; I sent for the prisoner to my house, and told him what I had seen, and that I was convinced the type was mine, and that Christie had informed me he had bought it of him - he did not for some time deny it being mine; he seemed confused, and said it was not mine, and he could prove of whom he had bought it; he had no minion for my work - it was kept in my shop in <placeName id="t18281023-55-crimeloc341">Chancery-lane</placeName>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182810230038"></xptr>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was any body present at this conversation? A. No; my son had let the prisoner's father some rooms for a short time in Black Horse-court, Fleet-street; they were under the same roof as my son's business, but not the same rooms; his father was formerly in business, but not the same rooms; his father was formerly in business in the Borough; he left my son's premises in July or August, as near as I can tell - they worked together I believe at the time I got this information; the type found at Christle's is a font, but a very small one - they are regularly-assorted letters - it could not have been in the water; he came when I sent for him - he told me about a fortnight after that Shruhsole had sold it to him; I did not have him taken up; I had lost a great deal more type.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you took him up did he not demand some money as wages? A. No, the account is in my favour - he began to do business for me in January; he might have a job in hand at the time I discovered the type; he once said something was due to him - I said there was not: I took him before Mr. Rogers - he was not inclined to discharge him; I did not say I could produce a boy who had seen him steal it; my son informed me his errand-boy had seen something.</p>
               <p>Q. From July till October you took no proceedings against him? A. I was extremely busy, and out of town- I have a house at Newington-green, and it takes a good deal of time going backwards and forwards, and Mrs. Wilks was ill; I plead guilty to delay, but I was busy - I never proposed to settle it for 15l.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you think it easy to steal an entire font? A. I should think it very difficult, as it is an exact proportion of type; I should think it as easy to swear to sugar, tea, or sand, as to type - I should be very lothe to swear to any taken from my premises.</p>

            . I live in King-street, Snow-hill; Wilks saw some minion type at my house - he said he believed it to be his - it was a complete font; I had purchased it of the prisoner about the beginning of May last, at 2s. 6d. per 1b.; it might have been a little used but not much - being thrown into the river might discolour it a little; this appeared to have been used, and it is always washed with water after being used; I think when Wilks saw it the appearance would be the same if it had fallen into water; I met the prisoner at the corner of Fleet-market after Wilks had seen it, and told him of it; he gave me Shrubsole's card, saying it was bought of him; I think nobody can swear to type - a printer may have the same description of letter from the same font; I could not swear to my type; I appeared before the Magistrate in September.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When type has been used, is it put into water and washed? A. We brush it with pearlash, and then wash it with water; Thames water would make no other effect on it.</p>
               <p>Q. As to its being bought of Shrubsole, did he not say his father was in some circumstances which made him unwilling to tell where he bought it? A. He did afterwards; he sold it to me publicly in my shop, and did not tell me to conceal it; it is as complete a font as the quantity will admit.</p>

            . I called on Mr. Christie in July, we were talking on business when a message came, in consequence of which this type was shewn to me; I immediately told him it was my father's, and was stolen; it is decidedly possible to identify type - I have examined it minutely.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What founder does your father buy from? A. It was part of the materials of the Evening Times newspaper, it came from Pouchee's - I know it by the nicks on it; that is common to all type; he might make type exactly like it for other people; I charged the prisoner with having some of this minion type in April last - he said he had some which he would give me; I said it was my father's - he acknowledged it, and said it was very little; he afterwards gave it to me, it was nearly half a pound; it was no part of this font, but similar to it: his father and I worked in the same place then.</p>
               <p>Mr. WILKS. I can speak positively to this type - it is certainly mine, as far as I am able to judge - there is a peculiarity about it; there is always a nick to direct the compositors to keep it all up one way, but this letter has two nicks; and referring to my type I find it the same - this must he caused by the founder being obliged to mix two fonts to complete the order; he might possibly do so for another printer.</p>
               <p>THOMAS CHRISTIE re-examined. It is very common for type to have two nicks, and I have seen three - part of this has three.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Several witnesses will prove that type cannot be sworn to; my father has had it two years.</p>

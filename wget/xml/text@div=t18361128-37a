               <p>Hackney-road, about eleven o'clock on the night of the 10th of November,—M'Carthy was coming up, and Collings passed—I saw her turn down King's-place, which is a very dark place—I turned on my light, and saw Taylor standing under the wall, with two bags full of something—I said to M'Carthy, "Come on"—I saw Collings join Taylor, who was, I believe, as near as I could see, in the act of throwing the bags on his shoulder, tied with a string—they both walked together down the street—we followed—I laid hold of the bag behind Taylor's back, and said, "What have you got here?"—Taylor made no reply—Collings said, "It is all right"—I said, "I wish to know what you have got"—Collings said, "You seem to make yourself very officious; when you are wanted, you are not here"—I said, "We are here now, and before you go from me I will know what you have got"—Collings said, "Oh, very well, come along, you shall soon know"—I and the constable walked with them down Queen-street, to the door of No. 3—Collings then walked in front—he got the door open and went just inside—Taylor attempted to go, but I would not suffer him—he threw the bags down in the road—I then collared him, and we had a struggle—I said, "Now will you tell me what you have got, and where you got it?"—he said he brought it from the warehouse—Collings at this time was just inside his door, within hearing of what I said—I further questioned Taylor, and he said he was coming down Union-street, Hackney Road, and Collings asked him if he would take it to his house—he did not know what it was, and that was all he knew about it—he had told me before that he brought it from the warehouse—I took the bags, and my brother officer took Taylor—Collings said nothing to this—he was inside his door, not above a yard and a half distance—I did not take him that night—when I got to the station I asked Taylor where he lived—he said, "No. 8, Norfolk Buildings, Curtain Road"—I went there to a house I believed to be No.8, and to another No.8, and up stairs I found some ready manufactured trim<lb></lb>ming, and some silk furniture, in a box, wrapped in a piece of paper—on the following evening, the 11th of November, I went to Collings's house, and I found him at home—I have the bags here.</p>

                  </hi>.

The prisoner and his wife lodged in my house - they came some time in November, and had a ready furnished lodging in the front room, on the first floor - they lodged there about three months - I went into their room in their absence - I missed all the bedding, and the other articles stated - this was on a Wednesday or Thursday, about the 19th or 20th of January - the prisoner did not come home till eleven o'clock that night, and as I am out on my business as a journeyman baker, I did not mention it to him till about twelve o'clock on the Friday - I said, I had reason to believe my property was not safe - he begged me not to do any thing with him, but to go with him to his wife's father, on Kennington-common - I went there, but her father was not to be found - he then asked me not to do any thing, and gave me two letters, which he told me to deliver, but I did not - I afterwards heard something, and gave him into custody.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Have you looked into the box which was left at your house? A. Yes; when I received your letter on Saturday evening, I opened the box, and found in it the pillow-cases which are stated in the indictment - the box had been tied up, and had never been off the premises.</p>

               <p>JAMES HART. I believe I moved the box myself from where we did live to our present residence, and no doubt the pillow-cases were in it.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in the Commercial-road. I had a blanket pawned on the 24th of December, for 2s. 6d., a table-cloth on the same day for 1s. 3d., and a cloak for 7s., on the 18th of February, two sheets on the 9th of December, for 4s., and some other articles, they were all pawned by a female - these are the duplicates I gave.</p>
               <p>MARY ANN HART. I received these duplicates from the prisoner on the Friday night before he was taken - I gave them to the officer.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mrs. Hart and I were sitting in the parlour, and she said, "I have spoken to Hart, and wished him to take the duplicates from you, and to get the things, and if you will give them to me now, I will endeavour to do so.</p>
               <p>MARY ANN HART. I said, "I think it will be the death of me - I will persuade Hart to get the things out, if I can,"- I gave the duplicates to my husband.</p>

               <p>ALEXANDER MOIR. These are the duplicates I gave - perhaps I ought to state that on Monday last a person called on me, and paid the money for these things.</p>
               <p>The prisoner handed in a petition pleading poverty.</p>
               <p>JAMES HART. The woman passed for his wife - she absconded a day or two before this charge - her father was represented as an independent gentleman - Mrs. Hart was going with her to him, and in the way she left her - I believe the prisoner was deceived by her.</p>

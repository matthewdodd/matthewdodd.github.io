               <p>(A)—Sir, The most desperate gang in the metropolis have resolved to obtain possession, by whatever means, of a certain portion of your property. It is composed of starving men, and no efforts will be spared in effecting their firm resolves. If any of their numbers fall in the requirement of sustenance from those they have marked out for prey, the remainder have sworn full revenge. Desperation is in their hearts. Not from design, but accident, I was led into their society. Curiosity (being desirous of contemplating human nature in all degrees of life) caused me to seek initiation into all their secrets; I now rue my act. I had previously to take a solemn oath (which nothing, however, will ever induce me to break) that I would preserve eternal secrecy concern<lb></lb>ing their names and places of abode. Learning their design upon you as one of the proscribed number, and having further a strong consideration for you, I made every effort to dissuade them, at the risk of personal suspicion and consequent danger, to abolish their intentions as respects yourself. Fur<lb></lb>ther than this I dared not go. But intense suffering closes the ear of mercy; to remove that suffering is the only way to give success unto its natural dictates. They, however, mutually agree that if I will give them one hundred pounds in solid gold they will relinquish their designs upon you; nothing less will satisfy. I communicate to you their demand. Personal safety will, I hope, induce compliance. It is hard that you should thus suffer, but I have done my utmost in vain to ward off the inevitable catastrophe. Had I this been an ordinary conspiracy it would have been sufficient for me merely to give you warning to cause you to be on your guard. But so resolute and determined are these men that no vigilance, however acute—no defences, how<lb></lb>ever strong, will shield from their hands. Fearing the inevitable results of their decisions in this case that I have been providentially made aware of, I have almost promised compliance with their demands, satisfied that could I but communicate with you, you would, for obvious reasons, consent. If they receive the sum in question I am firmly convinced you will never have any cause of fear from them, but if not, non-compliance will hereafter be repented of too late. My oath prevents me from detailing their plans, which also, if revealed, would subject me to most imminent danger. I have already stated that I am in no way an accomplice. Though poor, I am honest. If you comply with my recommendation you are safe. If you preserve secrecy, I am safe. But too often the innocent suffer for the guilty. Circumstantial evidence is too much honoured; purity of motive, however generous the deed enacted, uniformly denied. Therefore, as I have consented through the hope of securing good and averting wrong, to be a mediator, I require, to avoid</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184410210043"></xptr>
               <p>treachery, that inviolable secrecy be preserved—that you take a solemn oath that you will make no attempt, through yourself or by others, directly or in<lb></lb>directly, to discover who I am, or cause me in any way to be molested; that on Friday night next, at half-past nine o'clock, you will cause a little boy to be stationed at the base of the Fire Monument (near Lower Thames-st.), who shall have in his possession the sum of one hundred pounds in solid gold, encased by boards, so that he shall not be aware of the contents, and deliver the same to the individual who asks for a parcel; that this boy be alone, and in no communication by sign or word with any other individual whatsoever; that on Friday morning next you cause the following advertisement to appear in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> newspaper,—'C. C. desires to inform T. T. that his request has been fully complied with.' If, notwithstanding this information and offer you should fail to comply with my recommendation, the consequences will be fearful. My oath prevents me from saying more.—Adieu. Yours, T. T."</p>

Coutts, on the 29th Aug., and shown the letter marked A—in consequence of what I was told I proposed to prepare a parcel according to the instructions in the letter—it contained two pieces of clay and half-a-crown in the centre—it was not incased in boards, but in stout paper—I believe it was given to the witness Millard—on the 6th of Sept. I was again at Messrs. Coutts' banking-house, and was shown the letters marked B and C—I arranged to make another parcel, which was given to Charles Stanley—I went with him to a place near Southwark-bridge—I stationed Stanley there, with instructions how to act—I went into a room opposite which commanded a view of where I had stationed him, about half-past nine o'clock, and while I was in the room, I saw the prisoner go up to Stanley—I was not near enough to hear what passed—he appeared to be speaking to Stanley, and I saw him turn round with a parcel in his hand—it appeared such as I had given Stanley—I went out and stopped the prisoner, told him I was an officer, and said, "Who are you? what is your name?"—he said, "I am so confused I don't know what you mean"—Haines, another inspector, came up at the time and took the parcel from the prisoner's pocket—it was the parcel I had given Stanley—the prisoner was taken into a house in the neighbourhood—I asked his name and address—his answer was again, "I feel so confused, I don't know what you mean"—I told him I should take him into custody for attempting to obtain a sum of money from Coutts and Co., bankers, Strand—he said he had been sent for the parcel—I asked him who by—he said by a man named Thornley—I asked if he could tell me who Thornley was, or where I could see or find him—he said he could not, and said, "He sent me for a parcel last week, and I fetched it"—I proceeded to search him, and discovered his lodging, by part of a letter found on him, to be No. 15, Windsor-place, Southwark-bridge-road—I went there that night—a room was pointed ont to me by the landlady as his room—I there found a parcel containing papers, and this American Almanac—there is written on it some names of individuals, and among others Miss Burdett Coutts—I found a seal at his lodgings, and have compared it with the impression on the letter—it appears to be such a seal as would make the impression on the letter C.</p>

               <p>("Important.)</p>
               <p>"<hi rend="smallCaps">SIR</hi>—At the commencement of last week, I wrote you a letter to the fol<lb></lb>lowing effect:—I recapitulate, under the belief, that the letter in question did not reach your hand, notwithstanding its importance. It contained information, that owing to circumstances which the writer could not control, not knowing previously their tendency, that the writer was associated for a period unexpectedly with a set of men who have failed in their efforts to sup<lb></lb>port port themselves by manual labour, and apparently driven half mad by despe<lb></lb>ration, have determined, with a fixedness of resolve that no fear can daunt, to possess themselves of a portion of the property of several individuals in afflu<lb></lb>ent circumstances: not that these persons have in any measure influenced their present wretched situation, as I understand; but that being amidst the largest possessors of wealth, they are held as the least liable to suffer from the contemplated depredation. These men, hoping, probably, that H----, imparted to me the above information, which I consented to learn in the secret hope that I might be enabled to dissuade them therefrom, or at least point out such a course as might remove the necessity of effecting their lawless purposes. Previously, I had taken a solemn oath, from which I can<lb></lb>not be absolved, that I would not betray them; that oath I now reverence. I have learnt further, that five individuals are marked out of this number. I regret, Sir, to say, that you are one, and that the plan, which involves pos<lb></lb>sible danger to yourself, as well as property, has been fully matured. By dint of strong argument and much hazard, I have brought these men to agree, that could they, without resorting to the intended measures, obtain five hundred pounds, so as to enable them to go to America, and there settle, so as to obtain support by honest labour, it would be far preferable. I am convinced of their sincerity; they have been honest men; starvation and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184410210045"></xptr>
               <p>death are hurrying them to crime: in their despair they would hardly listen to my recommendation, considering it absolutely impossible that the sum could otherwise be obtained than by accomplishing their purposes, which, however, if once put into operation, will not stay with the above pittance. There is a restraining power and self-respect in honesty, which, if its moral limits be once overstepped, is for ever lost. Under my assurances that the sum might be obtained, they are now waiting. They firmly rely on my sincerity and earnestness to avert from them, crime. Unfortunately I have not myself the means of satisfying their demands, otherwise I should do so, considering that I would be conferring a general good: not in the belief that crime deserves a premium, but that it is the duty of all good citizens, if possible, to nip it in the bud by removing its cause. I undertake the cause of these people for two reasons: first, that I desire to remove impending ill from their victims, whom I respect; and second, that I have a firm conviction, that they will not further make their present dark designs a means of extorting money, but that, with the sum I have mentioned, will leave for ever this country.</p>
               <p>In my letter of last week I urged you, as you value your comfort and hap-piness, to comply with their demands, so far as one hundred pounds. It is a large sum to be lost; but nothing in comparison with the negative benefit that will ensue. From what I have seen of these men, I am convinced that when able, they will return the whole sum. In view of their present designs, this may hardly be credited, but it must be remembered that they have not yet passed the line of redemption: human hearts are every where nearly the same in their component elements; circumstances form actions. In the letter I refer to, I pointed out a spot to which you might send the money, enjoined secrecy, and further requested, if you agreed in the conditions of good faith, etc., for mine is in this case a delicate position, to signify so by a notice in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> of Friday, which I dictated. The advertisement appeared, the spot specified was resorted to, a parcel was delivered by a little boy, on which he imme<lb></lb>diately diately ran away. About one hour afterwards, it was opened by the indivi<lb></lb>dual who went for it, from whose possession it had not passed since delivery, and was found to contain two rolls of damp clay, so placed as to give the out<lb></lb>ward form to the parcel of inclosed sovereigns. There was also half-a-crown. These were first wrapped in a sheet of police-paper, from which fact I con<lb></lb>cluded, that the parcel did not come from you, and that my letter having fallen into other hands, some party had engaged in frivolous play. This is deeply to be lamented, as it would have been far better not to have been sent at all, as the men in whose presence it was opened, and who from the adver<lb></lb>tisement in the morning were satisfied their demands would be complied with, were deeply enraged, believing that you had received my letter, and that this was the answer. It is possible you may have received the letter, and sent the money, and that the lad entrusted with it has proved a rogue; but there is no alternative, if it be not made good. The passions of these men are like a pent-up torrent, ready at any moment to burst forth. Starvation produces the deepest madness. Reason is forgotten, and stern necessity im<lb></lb>pels to crime. Whatever be the facts in this mysterious case, it is your interest to forward the sum. The hour will otherwise soon come when I shall not be able to make this offer. Delay will be dangerous; the individual who now writes will make known himself to you, when these men shall have left the country. But this I know will not be, unless, so far as you are con<lb></lb>cerned, you forward them the sum in question. If to this you agree, pledge your honour in an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> of Tuesday next, that you will in no way attempt, directly or indirectly, to molest me, or in any manner seek to discover who I am, or enable others so to do; and lastly, that you</p>

               <p>will throw over this transaction a profound secrecy. The advertisement need merely signify your agreement to the above terms, without mentioning them; and on its appearance, I will despatch to you the direction of a house where the sum in question, so encased and sealed as not easily to proclaim its nature, may be left by a trustworthy individual.</p>

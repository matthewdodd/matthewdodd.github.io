                  </hi>. I live at 8, Upper East Smithfield. On Sunday night, 21st April, I went with a young man to a house in Glass House-street—the prisoner came there with a young woman, about half-past one o'clock in the morning—he said to the young man with me, "I am going to stop here," and the young man said he could not, he was there before him—we had a pot of beer on the table, and the prisoner said, "I will help myself," and he took the jug up, and drank it—as he could not stop, he wanted the money he had spent on the young woman; from my companion, who said he would not give it him—the prisoner asked me if I was going to stop there—I said, "No"—I told him I was going to a coffee-shop till four in the morning—he said he would accompany me, and we should be company for each other—we then left, and went towards the coffee-shop—when we had got a short dis<lb></lb>tance, he asked me if it was not a shame a man should spend his money upon a young woman, and not be allowed to sleep with her—I said I had nothing to do with their business—I then had both my hands in my pocket—the prisoner then put his hand into his pocket—I heard the <hi rend="italic">click</hi> of a knife about three inches off, and he ran it into me—it went through my shirt and flannel-shirt into my wrist, through my waistcoat pocket, through six cards I had there, through my trowsers, and into my body—I saw the knife as it came out of my body—the blood began to flow—I held my hand so as to keep it from flowing, and ran after the prisoner, calling "Police!" but the police ran in a wrong direction, and the prisoner was not taken that night—I was taken to the hos<lb></lb>pital</p>

               <p>next day, and remained there ten days—the wound in my belly is not well yet—I have known the prisoner by sight for the last five years, but had not <hi rend="italic">made any freedom</hi> with him till he came home from his last voyage, about a month before this happened—I was in the dock when his vessel arrived—I never had a quarrel with him—I got 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for him when he was taken into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at the London Hospital. The pro<lb></lb>secutor was brought there on 22nd April—I examined his body, and found a wound on his right arm just above the wrist, and a punctured wound on the lower part of the right side of the abdomen, about an inch and a half in length—it was such a wound as a knife would make—it was in a dangerous posi<lb></lb>tion—he has been from under my care since 1st May.</p>

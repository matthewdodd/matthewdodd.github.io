I went into the bar, found the till had been forced open by an instrument, and between 5 l. and 6 l. in money, two brewer's books taken out, and all the silver spoons that were in common use gone.

            . I am a watchman. On Sunday, the 25th of July, about half-past three o'clock in the morning, I saw Mr. Thompson's door open, went in, and saw two panes of the bar-window broken - the till had been broken open. I called Thompson up; he came down, searched the house and missed the property. Nothing was left in the till but a few halfpence. About eight o'clock Thompson said he suspected the prisoner. We got information, took him at his mother's house in Tabernacle-row, and found a key on him; we took him to the prosecutor's, and then to the Compter; I returned to his mother's, but found nothing there. She took us to his lodgings in Windmill-street; we went up stairs, searched his bedroom, and found the key, which he had in his pocket, opened a little box under the bed; we opened it, and found four 1 l. notes, 14 s. in silver, in a purse, seventeen spoons, and a punch-ladle; ten of the spoons and the ladle were broken up.</p>

            . I am a constable. I went to the prosecutor's, he said he suspected the prisoner. I apprehended him, brought him to the watch-house, and found a knife, a key, a tobacco-stopper, and a little silver, on him. I then took him to the prosecutor's, who charged him with robbing him - he strongly denied it. I went into the cellar, and there observed a footmark; I went up stairs, got his shoe, brought it down, and it exactly fitted the mark - there was half an iron on the heel of it, and that mark was in the impression. I went up, told the prosecutor, and took the prisoner to the Compter, returned, searched his mother's lodgings, but found nothing. I asked her if she had a trunk which the key belonged to? she said she had not, but it was at his lodgings. I went there - she showed me his trunk. I opened it, and the first thing I observed, was seven large tea-spoons, and the rest broken up, also a purse with four 1 l. notes, and 14 s. in silver. I took them to the prosecutor, who claimed them. I produce them.</p>

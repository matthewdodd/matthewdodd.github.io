The prisoner, and another girl, much larger than she, came up to me, and asked me to go with them. I desired them to go about their business. As soon as I had said those words, the biggest girl gave me a push upon my stomach, and at the same time the little one took my watch out of my pocket, and gave it to the big girl. I took hold of the little girl.</p>
               <p>Are you sure it is the prisoner? - Yes; I am. She struggled, and got out of my hand. I called the watch to my assistance.</p>
               <p>What time was it? - The clock had struck twelve. In about five or ten minutes after I called Watch! the officer of the night came, and took the girl. When she was in custody of the constable, I left her at the watch-house, and went home about my business.</p>
               <p>What sort of a watch was it? - A gold one, enamelled; the outside case was metal. I have never seen the watch since.</p>
               <p>Was you at all intoxicated with liquor? - No.</p>

               <p>I am a headborough. About twelve at nigh t, I heard the cry of Watch! I went up, and saw this Gentleman. He said he had been robbed of his watch, by a little girl. I went in pursuit of her, and took the prisoner. She was out of my sight, when I came first to the prosecutor. He charged her with taking the watch. She said, she had not got it, but a greater girl than she had got it.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave her a good character.)</p>

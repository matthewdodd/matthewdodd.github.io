On the 17th of October. the prisoner came into my house; I was in the parlour myself. He sat down, and was soon after joined by another person. My little girl said they were the men that where there on Monday, when we lost three pint pots and some glasses. They called for a glass of ale; I was particular what glasses I sent in. A gentleman came in and called for sixpennyworth of gin and water; the gentleman, after he drank the gin and water, went out, and left the glass in the room. I opened the door, and looked in, and saw one of the glasses were gone; one or them went out; I ordered Piall the constable if the prisoner offered to go out, to stop him. I then asked the prisoner if he had got any properly of mine; he said he had not. I told him I missed a glass. Piall came and took the glass out of his pocket; this is the glass; it is mine.</p>

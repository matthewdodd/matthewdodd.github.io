               <p>HENRY WHITTAKER re-examined. Q. Did you see the prisoner? A. Yes: about a quarter before one o'clock, he was looking about - I asked what he was looking for; he said for some things which had been thrown over the wall belonging to him; he did not say how he came possessed of them, but said that if I would go with him to Blackwall, to a shipmate of his, he would redeem the property; in going along, he said it was not his own, but belonged to the Captain of the ship Charles; I then gave him in charge.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. There were twenty-four vessels came in - there was a boat alongside of one, and the Captain, (as I took him to be), said he wished somebody would get into the boat or she would be stowed; I got in and took care of her - I then put all these things that were in her on shore at the stairs - I left them there, and the next morning came down and missed the oars, the boat-hook, and the piece of old mat; I was looking about for them, and the man came and asked what I wanted; I said, "These things which had been in the boat last night."</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the ushers of the Master of the Rolls. On the 26th of February I was on duty in that Court, between twelve and one o'clock—I saw the prisoner, and watched him for some time—I saw him place his hat down in a recess of the window—I looked into the hat before he put it down, so that I should know it again—he then went and stood by the bar of the Queen's Counsel, between the two windows, and was watching about—he then walked towards the other window, looked at a hat once or twice, and came back again; then he went to that</p>

               <p>place again, and went out very quickly—I was on the other side of the Court—I followed him outside the swing-doors—I stopped him, and asked about the hat—he said it was a mistake, he had a hat of his own—there was no resemblance in the quality between his hat and the one he took—they are both here—this is the one he put down, and this the one he stole—(<hi rend="italic">producing them</hi>)—they have the names of the makers in them, but are not the same—I brought him back.</p>

I live in Harley-street, Cavendish-square, I was in the Rolls Court on the 26th of February—I placed my hat on the form between two windows—I afterwards saw the prisoner in custody, and my hat in possession of the usher of the Court—I delivered it up to the constable—it was nearly a new hat—I was engaged in a case there—this is my hat—(<hi rend="italic">looking at one.</hi>)</p>

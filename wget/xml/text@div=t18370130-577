                  </hi>. I live at Shepherd's-bush, in Hammersmith. The prisoner came to my house on the 7th of January for half a pint of ale—he put his hand into his pocket and pulled out three shillings, one of which he threw down upon the form—I took it up and went to the bar, and got sixpence and five pence in halfpence and gave him—I did not look at the shilling at the moment, but in a very short time I received information—I had put the shilling into a tin canister in the bar, in which was no other shilling—I went to look at the shilling immediately, and found it was very bad—I sent for an officer and had the prisoner taken—he was then in the tap-room cooking two eggs—he was there a quarter <hi rend="italic">of</hi> an hour, but I discovered the bad shilling in less than two minutes—I let him eat his eggs while I sent to the station—before the policeman came he went away, and I followed him—on going up the road I met the policeman and gave him in charge.</p>

                  </hi>. My husband is a dairyman—we live in Mary Ann's-row. On the 7th of January the prisoner came and asked if I had any hare<lb></lb>skins or rabbit skins—I said, no—he turned round and said, "How do you sell your eggs?"—I said, "Two for two-pence halfpenny"—he bought two, and put down a shilling—I bent it a little—I was not positive it was a bad one—I gave him change, and he went out—I have not got the shilling—he took it of me again—I said, "This is a had shilling"—he said, "I did not know I had a bad one"—he came hack to the shop and gave me a good one and took the bad one—I bent it in two places not quite back.</p>

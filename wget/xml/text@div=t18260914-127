This wool and these drugs are ours; the wool is part of a parcel of ten bags, and was in our warehouse, in the same state as it is now, on the 25th of August: the keys of the warehouse were in our counting-house the whole day, they were not out at all - but about half-past four o'clock that day, the officers came to me, and said they had stopped a cart with wool; I had my warehouse overhauled a few days afterwards, and then missed the drugs; I have known the prisoner as a carman - he has taken things from our warehouse.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Doyle and Dower, two men who had been foremen to the prosecutors, employed me; I told Mr. Cooper, the same night, that those men had employed me to take the wool; and they had employed me to take the drugs on the Friday before.</p>
               <p>JOHN COOPER. The officer came and told me they had stopped the wool; I said, "Have you stopped the man?" they said, "No," but Mr. Cobbey, the master carman, said he knew where to find him; the prisoner was then brought - he said, "I loaded it from your warehouse this morning - Doyle and Dower gave them to me, and I took a load of drugs for them, last Friday, to an empty house in Bethnal-green, and the man lived within three doors of it;" he said he had booked the load on Friday.</p>

I took the prisoner, with this wool, about three o'clock on the 29th of July, in Brick-lane; I asked him where he was going to unload - he said he did not know - the man who helped him to load them had had gone away; I asked if he knew where to take them - he said, No; I asked if he should know the man again - he said, No; I asked where he had loaded - he said, "In Thames-street;" but after some further conversation, he said in Tower-street - he was stopping when I took him."</p>

                  </hi>. I tm a whitesmith; I live in Windmill-street, Tottenhara-court-road—the prisoner was in my service three or four months. On a Saturday, at the end of November, I missed a stock and a pair of dies from the back shop, which I had seen safe four days or a week before—I spoke to the prisoner the same day about them, but I think he was too drunk to know what I was talking about—on the following Tuesday I went to Mr. Liney's, and there found the stock and dies—these are them(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

I am an ironmonger, in Charles-street, Hampstead-road—the prisoner brought me a pawnbroker's ticket, and asked if I would pur<lb></lb>chase it—I asked what it was of; he said a stock and dies, pledged at Mr. Alders', in Berwick-street—he said they were his own—I gave him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the ticket, and sent my mistress with it next day, and she brought back the stock and dies—the prisoner came on the following Monday, and asked me whether I had taken them out of pawn—I said, "Yes, here they are;" and he said, "It is all right; don't let Mr. Mead see them"—I afterwards sent for Mr. Mead; he saw them, and told Mr. Davie.</p>

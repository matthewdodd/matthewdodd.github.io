               <p>I live in North-Shields, in Northumberland. I am <rs id="t17811017-28-viclabel131" type="occupation">master of a collier</rs>

On Friday last, I was in company with two or three acquaintances, and drank very freely, till between eleven and twelve o'clock. I was then very much in liquor. I was not able to get on board my own vessel, which then lay at Shadwell-dock. I went out to get some lodgings. I went into <placeName id="t17811017-28-crimeloc132">Elbow-lane</placeName>

I said a friend: they asked me again: I told my name: then they let me in. As<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178110170027"></xptr> soon as I came in, they asked me for something to drink. I had two sixpences in my waistcoat pocket. I gave them that to drink: then Mary Plack asked me to go up stairs. I went up with her: then she asked me for some money. Upon which I held up my purse, and said, There is money enough to pay you, in the morning, when I can get it changed. She said, That was very well. We then went to bed: I laid my breeches under my head, and fell fast asleep. At about four in the morning, M'Lane came up, and asked for money to buy purl. I had some loose halfpence, I gave her four-pence. She came up again, and said, they were bad half-pence. She laid them on the mantle-piece. There I found them. I slept till about six. I then got up. I felt for my watch first. I found that: then felt for my purse. Instead of the gold, which I had in my purse overnight, I found five half-pence. I will not swear positively, what I had exactly, but I am sure I had thirteen guineas and an half. I received ten guineas, and had three guineas In my pocket before. I am sure I spent none, because I had silver enough to pay my reckoning; and it was only gold, I had put into my purse. I am sure I never put halfpence into my purse. I am sure I had thirteen guineas and an half, when I was sober, that night. When I complained to

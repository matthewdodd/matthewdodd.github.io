On the 11th of May, about seven o'clock in the evening, a lady in the shop informed me that the prisoner had taken a piece of linen. I looked towards the door, and saw it under her shawl, just by the door. I got over the counter, and brought her back just as she was going out, and asked her to give me the goods - She said it was not our's, but if I would let her go she would settle with me in the morning. I took the linen from her, and gave her in charge.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You did not see the clothes, till you saw them upon this place? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. There was tea scattered upon the ground? - A. I cannot say, there might be.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not complain that somebody had been doing something with his clothes? - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Did you see the clothes moved? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any body take the tea out, and examine them? - A. No.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL VOKINS sworn. - I am a King's officer;(produces the tea;) I took this tea out of the prisoner's breeches, I took him into the accompting-house, and found fourteen ounces of tea concealed in his breeches behind; the constable took him before the Alderman, I was there, and he said it was his first offence, and therefore hoped they would be merciful to him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Was nothing said to induce him to say so? - A. I believe not, I was not close by him at the time.</p>

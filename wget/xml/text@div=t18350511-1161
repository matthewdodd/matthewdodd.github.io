                  </hi>. I am a porter in the employ of Messrs. Pickford, at the City basin. On the 15th of April, the prisoner Gwilliam brought eighteen casks in the morning; and in the evening he came again with Rowley, and brought ten more—I know Gwillim was in the employ of Mr. Holt, who is agent to Messrs. Bass and Ratcliff, ale brewers, at Burton—on-Trent, and I knew Rowley had been in Mr. Holt's employ—the whole twenty-eight casks were the property of Messrs. Bass and Ratcliff—they were to be shipped to go back to Burton—on-Trent—I placed the ten casks which they brought in the evening, by the side of the eighteen, but kept them separate, though Gwillim wished me to mix them—after the casks were out of the cart, the number was taken down, and I went with Gwillim to Mr. Kemp to get his book signed, and left Rowley with the cart—Mr. Kemp signed the book, with the number of the casks—when I came back, the two prisoners were in the cart, going away with it, and were standing before a cask, which was then in the cart—there had been no cask left in the cart, when the ten were delivered—I missed a cask from the yard, and went after them; and when they had got about a hundred yards, I stopped them, and asked what they were going to do with that cask—Gwilliam said, "God bless me, how came it here?"—I said, "One of you must have put it in, and if you do not roll it back again, it will be the worse for you"—I gave information to Mr. Tibbett, and Rowley was taken—he rolled the cask back, and Gwillim went off with the cart.</p>

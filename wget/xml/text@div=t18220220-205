On the 5th of February, between eight and nine o'clock, I was sitting in the parlour, a woman called out that my till was robbed. My daughter and I went into the shop, and found the woman holding the prisoner. he held out his hand with a half-crown and 2 d., which he said a boy had given him, that he had no more, and if we would let him go, he would never come again. I saw three more half-crowns found in his sleeve - he said a boy had given him the 2 d. to come in and rob the till.</p>

            . I am the daughter of the prosecutrix. I looked in the till half an hour before this happened - I had left four half-crowns there, none had been taken out, my mother's account is correct; he said the half-crown was all he had, that he never came before, and would not come again. I said there ought to be three more, and they were shook out of his sleeve.</p>

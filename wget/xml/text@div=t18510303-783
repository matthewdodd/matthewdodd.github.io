                  </hi>. I am the wife of Edward Fletcher, greengrocer and corn-dealer. On 2nd Jan., about half-past eleven o'clock, the prisoner, who I had known a few months, came to our shop—I asked him into my sitting-room, and he sat down there close to the side-board, where I had a purse with a half-sovereign and 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in it—I saw it safe, and counted the money five or ten minutes before he came—he stayed two hours, during which time I was backwards and forwards in the shop—about ten minutes after he was gone, a gentleman came and asked for change for a sovereign—I went to my purse and missed the half-sovereign—no one had been in the parlour—there were customers in the shop, but they could not go into the parlour without my seeing them—once while I was in the shop I heard the <hi rend="italic">jinking</hi> of money, but I thought it was his own.</p>

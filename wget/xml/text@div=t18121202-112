Before I got into the theatre the pit was very crowded. I had been in a few moments before I saw the prisoner. After the play was over a number of people came out, which made room for me to get near the orchestra. The prisoner followed me. Between the play and the entertainment there was a disturbance in the pit. I stood on one of the seats, the first from the orchestra. After I had been standing a little while there I felt something squeeze against my pocket. I thought something was going forward that was not quite right. From the appearance of the prisoners I could not charge them at the time I suspected them, but their genteel appearance prevented me. After I felt something push against my side I got down from the seat. I put my hand in my pocket, and found there was a hole cut through, and my snuff-box gone. After I had got down Morris went out. I went out after him, as soon I could. I told the man at the pit door what had happened. He said he would go and fetch an officer. Lack and Donaldson came. Lack went into the pit with me, and I pointed out Isaacs. Isaacs then had got a seat. I told the officer to look at him, to see whether he was a suspicious character or not, and then I gave charge of him. I described the other, and Donaldson brought him. They were searched in the lobby of the theatre, nothing was found upon either of them. The property has not been found at all.</p>

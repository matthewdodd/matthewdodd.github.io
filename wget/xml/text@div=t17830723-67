               <p>Council for Prosecution. Do you know the prisoner Hudson? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was he at any time in your service? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When did he enter into it? - In August last, I <rs id="t17830723-67-viclabel312" type="occupation">employed him in carrying out paper parcel</rs>

               <p>Did you miss the silk in the indictment, till you had a notice from somebody? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Was you led by any means, again to examine your stock? - I was.</p>
               <p>Did you miss the Persian in question? - I did.</p>
               <p>Did you afterwards see the Persian? - I did, I saw it in the possession of Mr.

               <p>Was Hudson taken up about it? - He was.</p>
               <p>Look at that paper.</p>
               <p>(The confession of the prisoner handed to the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Was you with that poor boy, before the magistrate? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you seen him before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you a long conversation? - No.</p>
               <p>A short one? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You had had a good opinion of the boy, and was kindly disposed to him, to deal kindly by him? - I was.</p>
               <p>You gave him some encouragement? - I promised him no favour.</p>
               <p>What did you say to him? - I asked him, if he knew of any goods that had been lost from my warehouse, and he said, he knew of none.</p>
               <p>Why should you apprehend he would discover to you, unless you would make him some promise that was worth his while.</p>
               <p>Court. The Court and the Jury will judge, whether any confession obtained from the prisoner, was obtained honestly, and fairly.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. I am sure Sir, however you may desire to reach publick justice, yet you will say every thing that is right with respect to the prisoner and yourself, I am sure you came with no wish to convict further than the law allows you to convict; I therefore must ask you again, what did you say to him? - The first thing I said to him, was, telling him I had lost a quantity of black modes and Persians, I asked him, whether he took them, or knew any person that did; no, he did not, and was surprized I should suspect him, that was his answer as near as I can recollect, nothing particular came out that evening.</p>
               <p>Council for the Prosecution. At that time he denied all knowledge? - Yes, Sir, at Guildhall he openly confessed that he had taken at two or three different times.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. But I want the material conversation before he was led into that circumstance? - I before observed that in my own house, nothing passed but only his denying his knowing any thing of the goods, and at Guildhall he confessed.</p>
               <p>He went to prison before he went to the Alderman? - No, Sir, he was satisfied with staying in my own house.</p>
               <p>What did you do with him? - He said he would content himself to stay at my house till the morning.</p>
               <p>What conversation took place between you and him in the house, or between him and any body else? - There was some conversation passed between him and my boy, but I do not know what it was, I had him in my dining-room, I told him he might go down in the warehouse and sleep with the boy.</p>
               <p>Is that boy here? - No.</p>
               <p>I take it for granted that you behaved as well to him as you were called upon from kindness and hospitality to do? - I did.</p>
               <p>Court. Before he came before the magistrate had you any conversation with him in order to prepare his behaviour before the magistrate, to tell him how he was to conduct himself there? - I believe, Sir, I mentioned to him in the Mansion-house that his person was described, and he wanted to know who the person was that described him; I told him, if he knew any thing of the goods being stolen he had better confess it, because the person would be brought that would describe him; I meant that he had better confess it there, before he went, I said nothing more.</p>
               <p>Court to Council for Prosecution. You must not give any confession in evidence after this.</p>
               <p>Council for Prosecution. My Lord, I submit to the Court that here is no promise by<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178307230090"></xptr> the prosecutor, I humbly conceive this does not amount to any promise of favor: In fact, my Lord, the object of the prosecution is to bring the receiver to justice, who is now discovered, therefore if upon a trial the principal should be convicted, I shall take the liberty to recommend him to mercy.</p>
               <p>Court. You need not give yourself any trouble, it strikes me that this must either be a promise or a threat, and I think it is both; if you do confess it shall be the better for you, and which is necessarily implied, if you do not, it shall be the worse for you; therefore I think though the special favor intended to be done, or the special severity intended to be inflicted is not particularized, yet it contains a general promise or threat, and cannot be received.</p>
               <p>Council for the Prosecution. To be sure, my Lord, I cannot proceed any further, we have no evidence to bring this robbery home to the principal but his own confession.</p>

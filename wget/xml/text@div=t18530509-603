                  </hi>. I am a banker, residing in Leadenhall-street. I know the prisoner, I recollect his calling on me about the 20th or 22nd Dec.—he called to inquire whether we could discount some foreign bills of first class, drawn on bankers—I told him the first requirement was to inquire about the parties, and after a knowledge of the bills being on respectable persons we would not object—he left this bill with me to make inquiries about it—he called again in perhaps three or four days afterwards, but in the mean time we had not got sufficient knowledge of the parties; he came two or three times between his first call, and 1st Jan., during which time we had made inquiries—he said he was very much pressed for money; that all his money was run oat, and he wanted at least 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for his private use on account of the bill——he drew a check on my bank, and I paid him 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in sovereigns, in part payment of the bill—we had reason to believe the bill was not in order, and on 5th Jan. I wrote him this note, "Sir, your bill has been returned from Paris; please to call at our bank."—the prisoner spoke broken English—before he came to me I sent to him again, about the 14th or 15th Jan., but I had heard from him—he sent two or three messengers for the balance of the bill—I told them that he must come himself; and on the 15th Jan. I sent a clerk of mine to desire him to call, and I received from him this answer, written in French, which, has no date to it—I can swear I received it about the 15th Jan.—"Sir, I have only received this instant, your card; I regret that indisposition retains me from coming to you; I shall be glad if you will inform me whether you are satisfied with the inquiriesyouhave made, and whether you will be satisfied with a friend calling on my account, that I may authorise somebody to receive for me to avoid myself going out; should, however, my presence be indispensable, I will do my possible to come to you"—I wrote to him again on the 17th—"Sir, the inquiries about Mr. Lamache are satisfactory, but the bill of exchange is not yet negotiated;" the object of my writing was to get him to come—I meant that the bill was not gone out of my possession; Mr. Lamache is a man in good circumstances, and it would have been satisfactory if the bill was not a forgery—the prisoner did not reply to this letter; after the 17th the first that I heard about him afterwards was on the 18th Feb., when he was arrested by Monteaux, the bankers, in Cornhill.</p>

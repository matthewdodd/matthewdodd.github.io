The Prisoner came into the Kitchen, walk'd about, appear'd very uneasy, and mutter'd a great many Curses. Then he began to turn his Discourse to a Porter; and betwixt them some Mention was made of the Deceased. Why, it seems (says I to the Deceased) it's you that my Landlord is so disturb'd about. Yes, I know it, says he; and then went out, to prevent Words, as I thought. The Prisoner follow'd him, curs'd him; and a great many ill Words pass'd betwixt them. They came in again, Supper was ready; the Deceased desired the Prisoner and his Wife to sit down and eat; but the Prisoner turn'd away, and cry'd, Eat the Davil! and then struck his Wife; which the Deceased seeing, got up and stept betwixt them to part them. Then the Prisoner reach'd to the Dresser, and took up something, which I suppose was a Knife, (for I could not see distinctly, because there was no Candle upon the Dresser;) but be it what it would, he stretch'd out his Arm in this manner, and struck the Deceased thus; who thereupon immediately sunk down, and died.</p>
               <p>- Middleton thus deposed: The Prisoner appeared in a very morose and quarrelsome Humour when he first came into the Kitchen. - You're a sorry Dog, says he to the Deceased. And you're another, says the Deceased again. Sirrah, you're a Rogue, says the Prisoner. - Call me Rogue, says the Deceased, and I'll lay you behind the Fire. After that we sat down to Supper; the Prisoner quarrel'd with his Wife, and the Deceased endeavouring to part them, the Prisoner took something from the Dresser, and gave him such a Stroke, that he fell down dead.</p>

Do you mean me? says the Deceased. Yes, you, reply'd the Prisoner. The Prisoner's Wife came in, and desired them to be quiet. He answer'd, Yes, I will be at quiet in my own House; and then gave her a Slap o'the Face. The Deceased said, Are not you a Rogue for that? The Woman was going out, and the Prisoner would have follow'd her; but the Deceased hinder'd him; and presently after fell down, and died.</p>
               <p>The Maid thus deposed: The Prisoner was following my Mistress; but the Deceased stopt him, and told him that he should not strike her in his Presence. I had just before laid this Case-Knife down upon the Dresser. The Prisoner took it up: I did not see him give the Blow; but the Deceased sunk down by the Dresser, and died before we could get a Surgeon. We afterwards found this same Knife, all bloody, upon the Floor.</p>

I am an engineer of 11, Howard-place, Kennington<lb></lb>park-road—on 17th July, I met the defendant—I knew that he was an attorney—I had had one transaction with him before—he was the attorney in a bill transaction—he asked me bow I was getting on—I said, "Pretty well, but I am short of money"—he said, "If you want money, I can find you a little"—I said 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would be of service—he said, "If you will have a bill drawn and accepted, I will get you some money"—a bill was obtained by him—he drew it for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and I accepted it—he took it, and said he should be able to let me have the money in two hours, if I would call at his office, as he had a friend who had some money, and he could get any little amount of that kind—no consideration for his trouble was arranged at that time; but when I saw him at his office he said, "You must pay me 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I called again the next day to know if he had cashed the bill—he said the bill had not been cashed—I called for three weeks, and sometimes three times a day, but could get no tidings of the bill being cashed, or get the money—he said, "I have not got the money for you yet, Mr. Batty; if you look in again, I may have it"—he did not tell me he had parted with the bill—Mr. Bailey afterwards called and pre<lb></lb>sented the bill to my wife, and in consequence of what she said, I called on Mr. Bailey on Monday morning at 8 o'clock, and acknowledged my signature—that was the first I knew of his having the bill—I arranged with him to meet me at Mr. Weekes' office to give up the bill, or pay the money—we met there, and Mr. Weekes had each of us in separate rooms, and discussed the matter separately—I went in first—he said, "I will see what can be done in the matter"—after that, he called in Mr. Bailey; but I left the room first, and he saw Mr. Bailey in the same room—I heard them quarrelling, and rushed in and found them fighting—I did not succeed in getting the bill or the money—Mr. Bailey is sueing me on it now—when I gave it to Weekes, he said, "If I cannot cash it, I will return it."</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186602260024"></xptr>
               <p>but he had received no money by the first post, and sent it back to me by my clerk—that is the only transaction that I had with Mr. Weekes—what<lb></lb>ever my clerk did with him, is unknown to me—it has come to my know<lb></lb>ledge that my clerk has had dealings with Weekes as for me—I have pro<lb></lb>perty at Norwood—Mr. Weekes is not negotiating to raise money on it for me—I have not given him a list of the property—I gave him a rough draft to take a copy from for a Mr. Lanbam—that was for a loan which I was negotiating in a friendly manner with a gentleman in the city—he made a fresh copy, because I wanted it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why did you give it to an attorney to copy, when you had a clerk? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He offered to make it—when I called on him, I said, "I want a copy of that Mr. Weekes, can you oblige me?"—that was in July or August—it was about a week or a few days before that matter occurred, that I asked him to make the copy—I mean to say I did not tell him anything about a loan when I went to him—I only said, "I want a copy of this"—he re<lb></lb>turned the original—I could not get my clerk to do it; I have no clerk—he did not ask me the name of the gentleman who was going to advance the money—I did not pay him for that; he has never made any charge—whenever he pleases, I shall be willing to pay—I have never done other business with him, only in connexion with my clerk—I have speculated very little; my company in the Strand is wound up—I wanted money to carry on my business—I have gone there on Saturday and said, "I must have money at any cost to pay my men to<lb></lb>night," but that is since this bill—I cannot say what agreement there was at the moment, but within half an hour, there was an agreement for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he was to get it discounted—nothing was said about his having anything beyond the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or rendering himself liable—I did not ask him to do it—he asked me—I called at his office from that day up to Saturday, 5th July—he told me there was a gentleman coming that day for the bill—I do not know that Mr. Bailey went on the Saturday—I waited there an hour and a half or two hours for the cash, as Weekes said if I waited, the cash would be brought back in an hour—I do not know that Bailey called there that day—a gentleman called on me that Saturday night, who left the name of Bailey, and no doubt it was Mr. Bailey, the now holder of the bill—I was not at home—my wife told me what she stated to Mr. Bailey—she did not recognise my signature on it, but said that she believed it was it—I called on Mr. Bailey at 8 o'clock on Monday, and assured him that it was my signature—he said that knowing it was my signature, he did not return on Saturday with the cash—I ac<lb></lb>knowledged it as my signature—it was after that, that I heard the scuffling—Bailey is not a strong man; he is a small man—they were fighting about some documents, and some business between them I believe—Weekes said he would send for a policeman, and that he must have the bill back again—I heard nothing of the bill till Bailey sued me on it—my solicitor is Mr. Casen, of Bloomsbury<lb></lb>square—I believe, from what Bailey has said, he has never given a farthing for this bill.</p>

I would have taken it, but not the 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I refused to have anything to do with it, and put it in the hands of my solicitor at once—the prisoner was to have 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for getting it discounted, and 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for Mr. Bailey—I arranged to give him 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

               <p>not to do so—supposing the bill had been genuine, I ought to have paid him 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; but it was not genuine—I called at Batty's house on Saturday night, and he called on me on Monday—he told me not to hand the money to Mr. Weekes—if he had not told me that, I should have handed him over the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. if I had known it was genuine, but it was far from genuine—it was not in consequence of what Batty said that I did not pay Weekes the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for I should not like to give Mr. Weekes any 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of my money, and I would not do it—Batty said that I was to hand it to Mr. Weekes—I do not recollect that Batty asked me to give the bill up to him—I believe there was some document or authority from Weekes to that effect, but I did not do so, because I was advised not by my solicitor—I did not give him the I O U's—I have got them and the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. still, and now I am sueing him—he managed the action of Bailey <hi rend="italic">v</hi>.

Winchamber, and in Bailey <hi rend="italic">v</hi>.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you went to Batty's on the Saturday, did you go straight from the prisoner's office? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I do not know whether he knew where I was going—I rather think he thought I was going to the bank, to cash it at once—I told him I should make inquiries, and see whether Batty's signature was all right—he said, "It is as good as gold—you have no reason to trouble yourself"—I said, "I shall see whether it is good."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">submitted that there was no case for the Jury to consider. It was proved that this was a bill drawn by the defendant for the accommodation of the prosecutor, and that no debt of</hi> 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">was due by Batty to Weekes. In Byles on Bills</hi>, 6<hi rend="italic">th edition, page</hi> 100, <hi rend="italic">the relation of accommodation-drawer, and acceptor was defined, and it was clear that they were joint owners, under<lb></lb>taking</hi>
               </p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186602260027"></xptr>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">mutually to meet the bill, when due, in the proportion in which they received funds from it, when discounted. He contended, therefore, first, that a joint owner could not be a bailee. He could not make a contract of bailment with his co-owner, and whatever agreement they made, must be in the nature of a trust. This accounted for the sections in the Larceny Act, applicable to fraudulent trustees, because, if fraudulent trustees could be treated as bailees, those sections would be perfectly unnecessary. He also contended, secondly, that even assuming that a joint owner could be a bailee, the contract of bailment here had not been broken. A joint owner of goods could not maintain trover against his co-owner in respect of any act of the latter consistent with his ownership</hi> (2 Williams and Saunderson, O. 47), <hi rend="italic">and everything which the defendant had done in this case was consistent with his position as drawer of an accom<lb></lb>modation bill</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi>, <hi rend="italic">on the same side, dwelt on the fact that, if there were any con<lb></lb>tract of bailment at all, it was to turn the bill into money, in order to produce to Batty</hi> 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="italic">There was nothing in that to prevent Weekes getting</hi> 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">from Bailey, and supplying the</hi> 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="italic">out of his own pocket, to make up the full amount. The negotiation between Weekes and Bailey did not result in the bill being discounted. The prosecutor interposed, and forbad Bailey to carry out the arrangement with Weekes. There was never any conversion which would support an action of trover, and, in the Queen</hi> v. <hi rend="italic">Jackson</hi> (9 Cox's Criminal Cases, p. 505), <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BARON MARTIN</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">ruled that the conversion must be analogous to larceny, and that there were many instances of conversion sufficient to maintain an action of trover, which were not sufficient to support a conviction under the statute</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>, <hi rend="italic">for the prosecution, argued that there was abundant evidence for the Jury. The bailment was to return the bill to Batty, or</hi> 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s in cash. The defendant gave it to a creditor, who was pressing him, in payment of a debt, and put it out of his own power to fulfil the contract. There was, therefore, as much a conversion, when Weekes put the bill into the hands of Bailey, as if he had discounted it for</hi> 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">and put the</hi> 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">in his pocket</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">held that a joint owner might be a bailee, and that the defendant had parted with the bill under circumstances which were not in conformity with the arrangement made with the prosecutor. So far the defendant was wrong; but Bailey was bailee for both Batty and Weekes and if Weekes intended to appropriate the</hi> 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">there was no act shewing that intention. The bill was never discounted, and nothing was advanced upon it. Bailey held it wrongfully, and it might be recovered from him by the person who had the right to the pos<lb></lb>session of it. There was no conversion by the defendant analogous so larceny, and therefore no case for the Jury to consider</hi>.</p>

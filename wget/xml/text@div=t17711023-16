            . I was at Guildhall. I observed the prisoner some time; I suspected him and watched him narrowly. I saw the prisoner put his hand into somebody's pocket; he turned away and seemed to be tucking something into his breeches. I went up and asked the gentleman if either of them had lost a handkerchief; the prosecutor felt in his pocket, and said he had; I went and throwed up the prisoner's heels, and I took the handkerchief from under his waistcoat, tucked into the waistband of his breeches.</p>

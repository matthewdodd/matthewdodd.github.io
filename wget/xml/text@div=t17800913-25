On the 1st of August, at about ten minutes before eight o'clock in the morning, as I was on my knees lighting the fire in the parlour adjoining to the shop, I heard a glass case in the shop shut down; I lifted up my head and saw the prisoner in the shop; I kept my eyes upon him, but before I could get upon my legs he got out of the shop and ran towards the Palace. I immediately pursued him, and never lost sight of him; when I came to the Stable-yard, St. James's; he passed a soldier; I called to the soldier to stop that man, that he was a thief; that soldier and another pursued him; he was taken about twenty yards on the other side Penny's gate; I came up immediately; he had thrown the watches over the wall into the garden; there was a man in the Park appeared to be a friend to him.</p>

               <p>On the 1st of August, between eight and nine in the morning, I was coming up St. James's Park from Buckingham-gate; in one of the walks by the side of the mall, just as I came opposite the stable-yard gate I heard somebody call out stop that man! I turned my head and saw the prisoner run; he came out of the stable-yard into the Park, ran a little way down, made a stop, and drew something out of his right-hand breeches knee, and threw it over the wall into Lord Godolphin's garden; I could not distinguish at that distance what it was, but it appeared to be round, and something was hanging to it. I was in the farthest walk but one from the stable yard gate; he was in the coach-way; I saw several people, particularly some soldiers, run towards him; when I came up to them I saw Miss Hatche's servant a good deal confused; I asked what was the matter and what she had lost? She said she did not know justly, but she believed watches. He said I have no watches but one of my own, and pulled one out. Knowing he had thrown something over the wall, I desired the people to take care of him while I got the key to see what he had thrown over.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you see distinctly two round things? - No, only one at that time. Some of the people said the garden belonged to Lord Godolphin; I went to Lord Godolphin's, and one of the servants and I went into the garden to look, and almost opposite the bottom of the garden, where I thought he threw them, we looked about, and his lordship's servant found two watches; I saw him pick them up. The people brought the prisoner round to his lordship's door.</p>

As I was going into the park between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, I heard the cry of stop thief! I ran as well as many others. When I was in the park they cried stop that man with the apron! I having an apron on stopped to see who they meant, and they laid hold of me, and searched me, and took my watch out of my pocket.</p>

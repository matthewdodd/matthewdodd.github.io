             acted as mate.</p>
               <p>Q. What were you - A. I was gunner. Our crew consisted of seven or eight men, besides us three.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you at Gravaileans - A. We laid there a fortnight. We went into the harbour. We laid within line of the batteries. It is a small harbour, and there are jetties. We were within the jetties We laid there a fortnight.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take anything on board - A. Rum, geneva, brandy, and spirits. We took them in half anchors; that is four gallons. We took upwards of a thousand casks, half anchors.</p>
               <p>Q. When you had completed your lading, did you leave Gravaileans - A. Yes, and were bound to the Lands End.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember on what day you left Gravaileans - A. About the 3d of February, 1812. We quitted Gravaileans in the evening, and in the morning we found ourselves off Beechy Head. The prisoner, Denny, was then acting as mate of the vessel, he was then on board.</p>
               <p>Q. He continued to act as mate, and on the morning of the 4th you found yourselves off Beechy Head - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any other vessel near you - A. Yes, three King's brigs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did either of them make a signal to you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your vessel answer the signal - A. We answered the Bergee. That is the signal of the Custom-house<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181302170030"></xptr>cutter. We hoisted a flag with a swallow sail. That was to deceive the King's brig.</p>
               <p>Q. This was in the day. Did you lay a considerable time in calm - A. Yes, all day, until about two or three in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. During all this time the King's brigs had done nothing to you at all - A. No. There were three in the morning; they did not meddle with us. About two or three in the afternoon we found a fourth. She reached in the shore.</p>
               <p>Q. On seeing the man-of-war-brig coming near you in the afternoon, what did you do - A. When we found them drawing near us we got out our sweeps: that is, our long oars. The brig made sail after us, and after some time I heard a gun. After firing a gun, as I supposed to bring us to, they put a boat out after us directly. The captain then ordered me to leave pulling my sweep, and to get the guns loaded. I went and loaded one six-pounder and a blunderbuss. He ordered me down to get the magazine ready.</p>
               <p>Q. That was to get more ammunition for the other guns - A. Yes. I heard the carriage gun and the blunderbuss both fire while I was down below.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went below where did you leave the prisoner, Denny - A. I cannot say where he was exactly. When I came up again I do not know whether it was he or some other person that said they had beaten the boat off.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the boat had been beaten off, and had gone back - A. Yes; she was gone back, and got alongside of her own brig.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you made all the sail you could, did the brig chace you - A. Yes. We got away as quick as we could. We lost her about ten o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>Q. In the course of your chace did you lighten your cargo - A. Yes; we hove five or six hundred half anchors overboard.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had lost sight of the brig that chased you, which way did you go - A. We then kept steering on the southward, to the coast of France, until we came near Lala, and then from there to the Lands End. We there landed the remainder of the cargo.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not make use of any ceremony of going into the harbour of Falmouth, or any Custom-house port - A. No, to the place called the Cow and the Calf, two rocks at the Lands End.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course, without paying any duties - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known the prisoner, Denny - A. Eight or nine years. I understood he was an Irishman. He served his apprenticeship in the sea service at Liverpool, and his family resided at Brighton.</p>

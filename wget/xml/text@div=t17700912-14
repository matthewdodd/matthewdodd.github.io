            . I was informed, between twelve and one in the morning, on the 11th of August, that my wife was in the prisoner's shop. I went to his door, and I heard my wife and him talking how they would get warrants for me, and the like. I knocked at the door, and desired him to let my property come out.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you mean by your property?</p>
               <p>Creighton. I meant my wife. Soon after the prisoner called out watch three times. I said I would keep watch till the watchman came.

             the watchman came. I told him I wanted my property out of the prisoner's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him what kind of property?</p>
               <p>Creighton. Yes; my wife, I asked the prisoner three times to open the door; at last he said, if you attempt to come in here I will blow your brain out. I took hold of the door, to open it, and the door flew open in my face. I had my hand upon the knocker; there are two steps to the house, and the door opens into the street. I stept up the first step, and the prisoner clapt a pistol to my forehead, and snap'd it; the watchman jumpt up and told him if he did not lay the pistol down, he would knock him down; then he laid it down upon the table. When he snap'd the pistol at my forehead, he struck me with it, that the blood ran down my face. I have the fear of it now. The prisoner bid me look if my wife was there or not. The watchman went about the room with his lanthorn; he told me she was behind the bed-stead. I bid her come home. I charged the watch with him, and he charged them with me, so we were both taken to the watch-house. After we had been sometime at the watch-house, the constable discharged us; he ran home directly. I went to drink a pint of purl, then I went to go home, my wife was along side of me then. I was obliged to go by the prisoner's house to go home. I saw the prisoner at his door, with a pistol in his hand; this was about an hour after he left the watch-house. I went on, he snap'd the pistol; he cock'd it again, and snap'd it the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177009120011"></xptr> second time; it missed fire again; the passage is not above two yards wide; his house is opposite the end of the passage; when I got within about thirteen or fourteen yards of him, he directed it at me again, and then it went off. I heard the whistling of the ball or slug go by my ear.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell when a ball passes you?</p>
               <p>Creighton. Yes. I have been in the King's service, and have been among a good many. I saw

When we took the prisoner to the watch-house he said, if the pistol had gone off, it would have blown my brains out, for there were a brace of good slugs in it.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. Did not you turn your wife's goods out of the house into the street?</p>
               <p>Creighton. I ordered the landlord to turn them out; I gave her the goods and every thing.</p>

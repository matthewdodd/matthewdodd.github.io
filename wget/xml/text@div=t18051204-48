               <p>Q. What was the prisoner?</p>
               <p>A. She was a lodger of mine: her husband is a broad-velvet weaver. On the tenth of last month, being Sunday, they were both out. At night, when they came home, it was about ten o'clock. They wanted some porter before they went to bed: accordingly there was some brought to them: it was going on then towards eleven o'clock. I had nobody then in the house but what slept in the house. My wife desired me to shut up: I shut up and went to bed. My wife brought up the young child, and put it to bed to me. She told me<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180512040062"></xptr>she would go below and get the rest up to bed. I had the misfortune about four months ago to lose forty-five pounds out of my wife's pocket; and while I lay there I thought I heard somebody in the room. Not being satisfied, I threw off the clothes; I arose up in bed; I saw the prisoner taking the notes and cash out of my breeches pocket. When she had got them all out, she was on her right knee, she must have crawled on all-fours to have got in the room; and the moment she saw me she rose up, and she appeared quite confused. She had then the property in her hand and did not know where to put it. She exclaimed to me, Cantley, get my husband up to bed. I made no reply: I instantly got out of bed, keeping my eye on the prisoner: she stooped down and put the money in the breeches pocket. Before I went to bed the notes and cash were in separate pockets, and when I got up they were all in one, except two shillings, which were laying on the carpet. By this time she got outside of the door upon the landing-place. Instead of calling her husband as she desired me, I called my wife. I shut to the door, and put the bar down. I went to my breeches, and examined them to see whether every thing was safe.</p>
               <p>Q. You locked her out? A. Yes I found the notes were returned again, but the quantity of silver I cannot say: there was a dollar and some few shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. You found the notes and the money in the breeches was right? A. Yes, except two shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Which pocket had it been removed from? A. The notes were in the right-hand pocket and the silver was in the left. We found the silver and the notes in the right-hand pocket. I saw the notes in her hand.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that; was there a candle in the room? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then she might see you as well as you saw her? A. No, she could not exactly see me: she did not know that I was in bed. The moment that she saw me she was confused enough. She took them both out of my pockets: I saw them in her hand.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the cash was found among your notes: how much silver? A. A dollar and a few shillings: exactly to one or two I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. We will say four? A. Four or five: I cannot say to one or two shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what you found? A. I did not count it.</p>
               <p>Q. You certainly could tell us what you found, if you did not know what you lost? A. I did not count the shillings to see how many there were: there was two shillings on the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. How much silver had you when you went to bed? A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean that there were three or four or five shillings in the whole? A. I cannot say exactly to one.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say you are a publican? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. A married man? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Your wife has got a child too. I suppose your wife is apt to be jealous, is not she? A. I can say she is one of the best women in the world.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath is she not a little jealous of you now and then? A. For what? she has no occasion to be jealous.</p>
               <p>Q. So I might say of my wife if she was jealous of me, that she had no occasion; you say your wife brought up your child to you: you was gone to bed first? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You shut up the house: you was polite enough to leave her up to take up your child? A. She advised me to go to bed as the lodgers were all in: I left them all in the tap-room when I went to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had the poor woman at the bar and her husband lodged in your house? A. Two years and a quarter.</p>
               <p>Q. She knew that you burned a light in your room? A. I dare say she did.</p>
               <p>Q. Before your wife went to bed this woman was in your room (I do not ask you to discover secrets)? Knowing that there was light burning in your room she came in to pick your pocket? A. She came in and did pick it.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath did you ever make any attempt to charge this woman till your wife was half way up stairs, and the woman's husband half way up after her? Not you: not till the morning? A. I did not: I thought I would let the case rest till morning. My wife is a delicate woman, and I would not apprehend her that night, because the least thing in the world puts her in a flurry.</p>
               <p>Q. And she is very apt to be jealous I am told. Did you not drink with that woman's husband and the two soldiers that were quartered at your house? A. I was in bed, with my breeches: my wife came to the bed side: I said to her, they shall go to bed: I will tell you by and by: let it rest till the morning. My wife went out instantly and fetched half a pint of gin, to make all things peaceable. The prisoner insisted upon having some gin. It was not on my request: I told her not.</p>
               <p>Q. This woman is tried for a capital offence: it is no joke: attend to me, sir. Did your wife only bring up one half pint of gin, as you say? Were not two half pints of gin brought<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180512040063"></xptr>into your bed room? and you, to make all things easy and comfortable, drank with them out of the two half pints of gin? A. I said no.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you or did you not drink, for the purpose of accommodating all matters, and to settle that business? A. I did it because she was so urgent, and with a deal of persuasion; to make all things quiet I took a glass for the present time.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What kind of a light did you burn? A. A rush-light stood down on the stove in a tin candlestick.</p>
               <p>Q. What size room is your room? A. It is a good sizeable room. My breeches were close by the fire-place, where the rush-light was burning.</p>
               <p>Q. You leave your breeches on the ground, do you? A. I always do every night, to be handy to put on in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. What notes were there in your breeches pocket? A. A one-pound note and a two-pound note.</p>
               <p>Q. So then in fact you lost nothing? A. She took them out of my pocket and put them in again.</p>
               <p>Q. That is not an answer to my question: your answer should have been, no, I lost nothing? A. I do not know that I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You know that you did not? A. I cannot say what quantity of shillings I had: there is no doubt but what it was returned too likewise.</p>

               <p>Q. How long was this after he was gone to bed? A. About four or five minutes. Soon after she took her child up to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after? A. Four or five minutes. She left her husband in the tap-room. I saw no more of her, only in the landing-place, when my husband called me up.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was that? A. From the first to the last it was no more than a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley.</p>
               <p>Q. Your husband could scarcely have gone to sleep? A. He had gone up to bed, and she went up after him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he quite sober? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>- sworn. I am a taylor. On the 10th of November, Mrs. Tiley, the prisoner at the bar, came into Mrs. Cantley's house: it might be past ten o'clock. We had a pot of beer or two together. Soon after Mr. Cantley shut up the shutters: he went up to bed. Soon after that I went to bed: then I met the prisoner on the stairs; she was coming down stairs. She asked me if I would be a quartern of gin to her quartern? I said yes. We went up stairs. Mrs. Cantley went up stairs afterwards to Mr. Cantley. The prisoner said she would go into their bed-room to drink it, and she did go into Mr. Cantley's room. After that was out, they said they would have another half-pint. Cantley said we should not have any more. We said, Mrs. Cantley we must have another half-pint.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Cantley drink with you? A. He did at last, after having refused. We had another half-pint, but Cantley drank none of that.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Custom-house gate-keeper at St. Ka<lb></lb>tharine's docks. On the 21st of February, between five and half-past five o'clock in the afternoon I stopped the prisoner at the principal entrance gate—I asked what he had got—he made no answer—I put my hand under his jacket, and found a shirt under his arm—Murray came up with the prisoner from the dock, and said it was his shirt—I took the prisoner into the lobby, searched him, and found he had two pair of trowsers on—Murray claimed the pair he had on underneath—he had a small quantity of leaf tobacco in his cap—Murray said he had some similar to that in his chest—the prisoner said it was not Murray's.</p>

On the 21st, she lay in St. Katharine's-dock—the prisoner came on board, and told me he had been cast away—the captain gave him a day's work, and paid him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it. On the 21st of February, he asked me to go ashore with him—I was cleaning myself, and I said I should be ready directly—he then told me to make haste—he asked me to go and have a pint of beer at a public-house, and I went—he took a drop, and told me he wanted to go out—he was absent about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—I then thought he might be gone back to the schooner, and I went as fast as I could—I saw him come over the side of the vessel—I asked him where he had been—he said, to get a shilling which was owing to him—I observed his cap looked bulky, and it was bulky under his jacket—I went after him—the gate-keeper detained him—I took the shirt from under his jacket, and the trowsers and tobacco from him—I had some leaf-tobacco in the chest with my trowsers—I never gave him leave to take them.</p>

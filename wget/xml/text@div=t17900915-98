               <p>I have been a watchman, but was dismissed, being unfit for service: I live in Hill-street, Berkley-square, with Mr. Hill, at the Barley-mow.

               <p>The man you took hold of was the man in whose hand you saw it? - Yes: then he said, I have not got it, and pointed to the other, to whom he had given it.</p>
               <p>Did he struggle to get away? - He struggled first of all, and I thought he would have been rescued by some of this gang; but I cannot say who is a rogue, and who is not; there was a vast crowd; I was pushed into the crowd; I never got any of my property again: I am a poor man, not able to bear expences.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Then you expect some allowance when this is over? - I expect what they please to give me.</p>
               <p>Have you never said you expected to get 40 l. by this? - I never did.</p>
               <p>Have you never had any conversation with one James Hill about such expectations? - I never had.</p>
               <p>Had you ever wore those two pieces of money in your watch-case, in your fob, before that day? - Very seldom.</p>
               <p>Have you ever? - I do not know whether I ever did or no.</p>
               <p>You carried it with the string hanging down, the same as a watch? - Yes, and a couple of iron keys to it; I did not know the men were to stand in the pillory that day.</p>
               <p>The first thing that attracted your notice was a pulling at your watch-string? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Nothing had been said to you before that? - Nothing at all.</p>
               <p>No violence used against your person? - No.</p>
               <p>No threats? - No.</p>

               <p>How long have you been acquainted with Mr. Murray? - Not till I saw him at the justice's.</p>
               <p>Does not he belong to Mr. Reid's office, in Poland-street? - That is more than I know: I met him about three times; he called at Mr. Hill's house; I did not then know that he belonged to Mr. Reid's office; I never heard him say one word about the reward of 40 l. I would not say a wrong thing.</p>

I am one of the patrol employed by the public office at Bow-street, and I was ordered to attend at the execution of the sentence of pillory; I was there at the time, and I saw a great mob going from the street where the persons stood in the pillory; and I saw the prisoner in custody, with several people; the old man in particular had hold of him; he was calling out, and his clothes were very much torn; I desired them immediately not to duck him, but to bring him to the magistrate: I took my staff out; the man turned round, and said, I will go with this man any where: I said, take him to Bow-street: I asked them whether they had searched him; they said they had not, and they would not.</p>

               <p>I keep the Barley-mow; the prosecutor lodges at my house; the day that the robbery was committed, when he came home, I asked him where he had been; he said, into Berkley-square; and he said he had his pocket picked looking at the sight, and was surrounded in half a minute by 14 or 15 people, and lost his watch; but, says he, I have got the thief, I seized him immediately: I said, who did you seize? Why the man that stood before me. Says I, was that the man that took your watch? No, says he, I felt my watch jump out of my pocket that moment, and I seized him directly. Did you see the man with the watch? He said, no, he did not; but he said the man he seized pointed to another man. The old gentleman I do not think he is capable of knowing what he does say, or what he did.</p>
               <p>Have you ever heard him say that he expected any thing? - I did hear him talk, him and another, about 40 l. I cannot tell what it was; I was in the cellar; he was talking to an old gentlemen that is in the workhouse; I asked him; I told him to be very careful about the business; and he told me he should not have done any thing, he would have put up with it, but only Mr. Murray rather put him up to it: it was still talked of; and in a few days he said it was not a watch, it was the case of a watch, and two crown pieces in it.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that for the first day, and some days afterwards, he represented he had lost a watch? - I am sure of that; I asked him how much the value of the watch was, or something of that kind, and he said the watch was but of very little value, but there were two crown-pieces within-side the case; so I asked him what was become of the guts of the watch; says he, they are gone to be mended. He has been a lodger of mine near three years; I never saw him have a watch.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179009150129"></xptr>Court. Nor case? - Nor case; nor the crown-piece. He is a very honest man; he always paid me very honest and just.</p>
               <p>Had he the appearance of a watch? - I have seen a string out.</p>
               <p>Had you the curiosity to ask him where it was that the guts of the watch were gone to be mended? - I did not; I had no doubt about it; I thought he had lost his case, or watch; but I took it to be a watch at first.</p>
               <p>Then you did not suspect the old man? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>You are sure you asked him if he saw the watch in the man's hand? - I did, and he said no: I asked him whether the man made any resistance; he said no; but that the man said, I have not got your watch.</p>
               <p>Did the old man describe to you the manner of the losing his watch? - So far as this: he said there were 16 or 17 all together, and he missed his watch.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. Sir, you have thought fit to leave your case to your counsel; but probably the jury will expect you to give some account of yourself; what are you? - I am a waiter.</p>
               <p>Court to Hill. Did the prosecutor describe how the watch was got from him? - No; he said he missed it in a moment; that it was snatched out.</p>
               <p>Did he mention that the watch was snatched out of his pocket by any person? - He did.</p>
               <p>Did he mention any thing of saying that he felt a digging at the watch before? - No.</p>
               <p>Did he use the particular expression of jump out? - No, I do not think he did; he said that he found the watch jump out, or taken out.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a very good character.</p>
               <p>The Jury withdrew for some time, and returned with a verdict,</p>

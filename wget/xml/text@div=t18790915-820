After the purchase I obtained a search warrant and afterwards went to the defendant's shop—he has a very large business there as a retail newsagent—I saw him and said "I am a police officer; have you seen the warrant or has it been read to you?"—he said "Yes; I am quite willing for you to search my place and take away all that I have"—I searched and found nine quires of Quiz, No. 10, and 13 copies of various numbers, and 30 copies of the London Peepshow, various numbers—this advertisement was in So. 7. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Awfully jolly. A lady's machine Post free.")</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was not with the other officer; he had been to the shop before—the defendant told me that Ayres supplied him with news<lb></lb>papers—there are all kinds of papers there—the Graphic and the Illustrated London News.

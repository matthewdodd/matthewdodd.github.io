                  </hi>, I am clerk to Mr. Evans, a law-stationer, and lodge at No. 25, Porter-street, Newport-market—the street runs out of Castle-street, Leicester-square. On the 19th of April I was returning home about half-past one o'clock in the morning—when I came to porter-street, I met the two prisoners at the corner—they were standing at the corner of the street—I passed up on the left to my lodging, and they followed me up on the right—they did not speak to me when I passed them—when I got as far as Princes-court, the prisoner Ray crossed over, and left Wade on the other side—Ray followed me up to my own door—I was in the</p>

               <p>act of opening the door, having a key in my pocket, when Ray seized me by the throat, and dragged me out into the road into the gutter—he did not pull me down—he held me up by my neck—Wade then crossed over and attempted to draw my watch—he laid hold of my watch-chain, and while he was in the act of drawing it, the chain broke—he got part of the chain—it was made of Mosaic gold, and had a gold key, a gold seal, and a common key attached to it—he got them away, and ran off—Ray then let go of me di<lb></lb>rectly—I followed Wade, who turned up Princes-court, and caught him—I never lost sight of him—when I got up to him, Ray came up and said to Wade, "Hit him," and made use of some word which I cannot say—Wade at<lb></lb>tempted to strike me, but I parried the blow, and Wade got away from my grasp—I collared him again, about twelve yards from where I had him at first—I had Ray in my view all this time—Wade attempted to strike em again—I called out "Police"—a person came out of a house, and both the prisoners then said they were not the persons—that I was mis<lb></lb>taken—I am sure they are the men who did it—I called out "Police"—Assit the policeman came up, and I gave them in charge.</p>

I leave his office at nine o'clock—I had been with two or three friends spending the evening—I had something to drink but was as well then as I am now—I will swear I was perfectly sober—there was nothing to prevent Ray from running away while I was following Wade—he might have run if he thought proper—Wade was going from me at the time I took hold of him, he turned round directly and wanted to fight me—nothing was said about a challenge or a fight—he put him<lb></lb>self in a fighting attitude—that was when Ray said, "Hit him"—the police<lb></lb>man came up in less than three minutes after that—when Ray held me by the throat. I called "Police," but I could not get the words out distincaly as he throttled me—the moment he left me I looked round—my atten<lb></lb>tion was directed to my watch, but I looked at them both.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was called that night—when I went up I saw the prosecutor and Wade struggling—Ray was standing by at the time—I am sure they are the two men—I asked the prosecutor what was amiss, he said, "I have lost my watch, take these two men in charge, they have got my watch"—I did so, and searched them at the sta<lb></lb>tion-house but found nothing on them—on the road to the station-house the prosecutor said, "My watch is not gone, I have got my watch, but my chain, seal, and key, are gone."</p>

Joiner-street, the back of St. Thomas's hospital; I asked him what bridles he had to dispose of, and he shewed me one plated snaffle bridle; I told him my master had bought a young horse, and we wanted to try him, and we had not a snaffle bridle fit for him, and I wanted one; I went away, and the next night I went to his lodgings again, and agreed with him for the same bridle, I did not buy it; he said the price which he was to have was 3 s. 6 d. he said that he had it of a gentleman's servant who owed him 2 s. that he had given him 6 d. which made it half a crown, and that he only wanted a shilling profit; we agreed; and he helped me to fold it up, and put it in my left hand pocket; I took it immediately, and gave it to the prosecutor's servant; I did not pay him for it that night; we had something to drink. I know the bridle by a particular mark I can swear to.</p>

            . He said he took this bridle to Mr. Cowling, but he said he took it over into the Borough to return it again, he said he took it to be repaired.</p>
               <p>Randall. This is the bridle I agreed for with the prisoner; I marked it, here is the mark; I cut it with the edge of my knife at justice Wilmot's office.</p>
               <p>Court. The question is, whether you are sure that that bridle which you had in your hand, is the bridle that the prisoner offered to you? - Yes, I am very sensible of it.</p>
               <p>How do you know that is the bridle? - By a mark I took notice of in the bit, as soon as ever I took it out of the prisoner's hand; there is the letter M under the bit; I took notice of nothing else then, till I marked it at the justices.</p>
               <p>(Shewn to the court.)</p>
               <p>Jury. There may be the letter M, on a thousand bridles similar to that? - I put a mark on it before I went to the justices,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178902250072"></xptr>the same evening that I had it in my own possession; it is the inside of the rein, I marked it with the point of my knife; I made this mark the same day I went to the Justice, the same evening I received it of the prisoner, I made it at a public house.</p>
               <p>What did you mean by saying just now, you made a mark at the Justices? - Not the same day I went to the Justices, I dug a little bit out with the point of my knife.</p>
               <p>Did you make that mark before you delivered it to Mr. Cowling's servant? - Yes, at the time I took it out of my pocket I made it at a public house, before I went to Cowling's servant; I cannot say what house.</p>
               <p>Where was the house? - I cannot say the street, where I was waiting for the ostler, his wife lives there; I believe it was in Princes-street.</p>
               <p>Was it a public house, or a private house? - I cannot particularly say what house it was; one of Mr. Cowling's servants was with me, I believe he is not here.</p>
               <p>What made you go into that house in particular? - On purpose to shew Mr. Cowling's servants the bridle, I was with one of Mr. Cowling's servants, and we went into a house to ask him if he knew it; Mr. Cowling's servant had the bridle, and I took an opportunity of putting the private mark on the bridle.</p>
               <p>Court. Is that man here? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>What was his name? - I do not know; he passed for Mr. Cowling's head ostler; they call him John.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. Was that the man that sent you into the Borough? - The man that applied to me in the Borough, Mr. Cowlings's head ostler, came to me twice, he saw me put the mark.</p>
               <p>Mr. Boad. This is my bridle; there is a bit of the silver plate rubbed off of one of the cheeks.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. At what place did you mark the bridle? - At a private house, before I shewed it to Mr. Cowling's servant.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, I saw him draw out his knife, and mark that rein of the bridle, at Justice Wilmot's office.</p>
               <p>Mr. Butt. I saw the witness mark the bridle on some part of it in the parlour, next Mr. Wilmot's office.</p>
               <p>That was when you attended? - Yes, the bridle had been brought from Mr. Cowling; Mr. Cowling gave it to me at Union Hall.</p>
               <p>Court. Now, where did you mark that bridle? - In the right hand rein.</p>
               <p>But in what place was you when you marked it? - I first marked it in a room in Mr. Wilmot's office; and afterwards I did not think it was sufficient for me to know it, and I marked it again.</p>
               <p>What, after you took it to Mr. Wilmot's office? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then how did you dare to tell the court just now, that you marked it on the night the prisoner shewed it to you? - It was not visible; here is a scratch across it, and I made it plainer.</p>
               <p>But you shewed the gentleman that mark, and said you put it on there, and no where else; how did you dare to say that.</p>
               <p>Jury. We are perfectly satisfied.</p>

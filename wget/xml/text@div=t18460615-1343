Baker's rent, inferring that I have received the same and not paid it to you. Now at present I know nothing of it, having paid you what I received, unless it should have occurred on some morning when you did not return while I was here, (as you. did not always return from the committee at my time of going from the office,) when I must have put the same into my drawer, or in some papers about my desk, as I am rather careless in leaving papers about. I went last night with a friend to see the illuminations, I left with him my pocket-book, and the key of my desk here. I expected to return with him, but as it got late I did not; and as he proposed to go out of town for a day or two, I shall not be able to see him before Saturday, and to obtain my key. I propose not to have the drawer opened until Saturday, when I shall have the key, and hi the mean time for you to send the receipt, and on Saturday you will find she money in my desk, or in some papers which it might have been put into. I never recollect having received money from any one in particular, except the</p>

Yours, truly, T. <hi rend="smallCaps">PRESCOTT</hi>. June 10, 1846. R. M. Burt, Esq."—I saw the prisoner the same evening—I said, "Well, what about this rent? I have had a letter from you about it"—he said, "Well, I don't know, Mr. Burt, anything about it; if I have had the money I must have paid it to you."—I had on the day before communicated with Messrs. Gregory and Faulkner as to what had taken place, and on the 10th I called in some other clerk, immediately after I had this note, and had the prisoner's desk opened—there was no money found in it, or anything relating to this charge.</p>

I was in Regent-street, between the Quadrant and Oxford-street, on the 15th of January, and I saw the three prisoners in company, about a quarter past four o'clock—the female pri<lb></lb>soner was leaning on the arm of John Dixon, and Edwards walking by their side, close to him—I saw them frequently converse together—they were coming down the street together, and they met Mr. Lloyd, just before they got to the Quadrant—as soon as he had passed about a yard, they all three turned round, and followed him—the woman still kept hold of John Dixon's arm, and Edwards was still walking by their side—I was op<lb></lb>posite, on the other side of the way—after they had walked a few yards, I saw Edwards step forwards, and take a purse from Mr. Lloyd's coat-pocket—the other two kept close behind him—I immediately crossed, and when I got close behind, I saw Edwards passing the purse to the female pri<lb></lb>soner, who was still hanging on John Dixon's arm—it was a green purse—I instantly caught hold of the two male prisoners, and Gray, who was with me, took the woman, and she threw the purse about two yards, into some mud—we took them all into a shop—Mr. Lloyd was informed of the</p>

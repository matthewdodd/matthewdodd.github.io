                  </hi>. I am a hosier and glover, in Piccadilly. On the 2nd of January I was shown two black silk handkerchiefs by Pocock, which I recognised as my property—I had missed them on the 31st of December—we generally sell black silk handkerchiefs singly—these were two to<lb></lb>gether—I believe these have been stolen—I have no recollection of having sold them—I do not believe they were ever sold—I have a shopman—I have a slate in the shop on which he puts down all he sells—he might forget it.</p>

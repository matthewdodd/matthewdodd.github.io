The prisoner Edmonds was apprehended at Great Marlow in Buckinghamshire. I found the range at

            . Q. How did you come by that range - A. I bought it of some blacksmiths; my shop is No. 7, Harp alley, Fleet market; I do not know the persons I bought it of; their faces were black and dirty; the range was claimed by Mr. Boteler.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Did you see either of the prisoners at your shop - A. No, only the evidence; he has been my neighbour for five or six years.</p>
               <p>- EDMONDS. I am a carpenter.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been admitted king's evidence - A. Yes. I went with Bird and Griffin, they are smiths, to the prosecutor's shop; I was looking at some music under the window; I saw Griffin take the grate on his shoulder; and when I went from there I saw Bird with it. I did not know that they intended to steal the range.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go to Great Marlow - A. On the report of a warrant being out against me.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the range - A. They went to Harp alley, I was close to the door when it was sold; they sold it for nine shillings and sixpence; they gave me three shillings.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peat. You have already told the jury what sort of a man you are - would you have given this evidence was it not to save yourself - I ask you to give me a plain answer - A. I would do it to a person that would lead me into such a thing.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Jeffrey-street, Camden-town. About nine o'clock, on the night of the 14th of May, I went to fasten the back door, and I heard a noise outside—I opened the gate, and saw three men standing close to Mr. Lindsay's door, handing linen from one to the other—their backs were towards me—there is a space of ground between Lindsay's house and ours, wide enough for a carriage to pass—the men saw me within a couple of seconds after, and ran away together—they threw the linen down—I followed, and called, "Stop thief"—they ran out of the lane, towards Jeffrey-street—I followed, and they separated—two went towards the left, and one to the right, towards town—I cannot say whether the prisoner was one of them—I pur<lb></lb>sued them with the policeman—I lost sight of them once—the policeman took one of them—when we returned the policeman picked up the linen.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable S</hi> 130.) I was on duty in Sussex-terrace, opposite Jeffrey-street—I saw two men running, and Simpson following about fifteen yards from them—they separated—I followed one—I took hold of the prisoner—Simpson came up, and said he had been stealing some linen at the back of Jeffrey-street—he said he had not—I went with Simpson, and found this linen near the garden at the back of Jeffrey-street—there were no other persons running besides the men and Simpson—Mr. and Mrs. Lindsay came out, and said, in the prisoner's presence, that the linen was theirs—the pri<lb></lb>soner begged Mrs. Lindsay's pardon, and cried—he said he was innocent.</p>

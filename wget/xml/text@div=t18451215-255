                  </hi>. I am a baker. The prisoner was my journeyman—he used to go out with loaves—when he came back on the 9th of Dec. he brought me back only one quartern and a half—I told him there was a half-quartern short—he said, "Let me see, I left another half-quartern at Mrs. Cramp's"—I went to Mrs. Cramp's, and found that was not the case—I came back to the prisoner, and then he said, "To tell you the truth, master, I gave the loaf away"—he said it was the first time, or something of that sort.</p>

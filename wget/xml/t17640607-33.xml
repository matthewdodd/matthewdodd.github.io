I went to a ditch hard by, to wash myself, and did not see what passed, till I saw Smith lying dead on the grass, and could not speak a word. I said to Riley, why don't you take up the man? he took hold of him, and pulled his neck; then he could speak a little; they got him into a coach, and brought him home. I went to see him the next day, about 11 o'clock, and asked him how he did? said he, I am well enough, if you be well; and he died that afternoon.</p>

            . I am a chairman. When Sherriden gave up, the prisoner and deceased had high words; they fought, and had a good many blows; they fought a considerable time; and when they were grasping one another, Smith gave a cross-buttock to the prisoner, with intent to throw the prisoner over him: the prisoner was very loath to come down; and Smith, in attempting to do it, threw himself backwards upon his own head: as soon as he was down, I catched hold of the back of his head and his chin, and pulled the joint, and his neck gave a nick; I thought it came an inch and a half when I pulled it; the joint was out; he could not speak till I pulled it, and in a few minutes after he spoke. About a quarter of an hour before he died, I went to his bed-side, and said, How do you find yourself now? he said, I think I am a great deal better, since I lost some blood. I said, where did you receive your hurt? he said, it was not from blows, they did me no hurt: after I got the fall, I could not move hand<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176406070024"></xptr> or foot, or any part of my body, no more than a dead man.</p>

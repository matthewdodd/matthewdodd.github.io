                  </hi>. On Tuesday, 21st Dec., the prisoner brought three orders to me—this is one of them—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"Give bearer two ounces of tea, <hi rend="italic">half</hi> sugar. Cclapp")—I did not give her the goods—I had suspicion—a policeman accidentally came up to the shop-door at the time, and I gave her in charge—I had been to Miss Clapp on the previous evening and asked her if there were any orders out, and she said, "No"—there was nothing in the look of the tickets that excited my suspicion—I do not keep many books—I can write tolerably sometimes, not always—I did not take particular notice of the writing on the few tickets that I received—the pri<lb></lb>soner had often been in the shop before.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman.</hi>) I took the prisoner on Tuesday morning, 21st Dec., at Mr. Bailey's shop—she had the three tickets in her hand when I went in—I heard her ask for the goods as she handed them over—this is one of them.</p>

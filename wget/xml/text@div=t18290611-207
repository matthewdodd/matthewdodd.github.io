            . I am an officer. I was sent for to the Ship about twenty minutes to eight o'clock - the prisoner was not there; I had seen her there about half-past six o'clock, endeavouring to scrape company with the prosecutor - another girl was there, and five or six men in the house: I stopped about five minutes, looking at the prosecutor - he shunned her, and shifted his seat; I went there again about half-past seven o'clock - she was then sitting very near him, in the same box; the other girl was fast asleep - directly I went in, the prisoner got up and left the tap-room, and in about twenty minutes he missed his watch- I went after her, but did not see her again for a month afterwards; I am sure she was there at half-past seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>HEZEKIAH WILMER. I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner, and found nothing on her - she said, "I know what you want me for - it is about the watch;" I was at the Ship at half-past seven o'clock, and saw her leave the house - the prosecutor missed his watch within ten minutes.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Sloane Street, and have a daughter named Elizabeth, who is just 17—in February and March she was assisting me in my shop in Sloane Square—I saw the prisoner come in with a woman—they brought an umbrella to be repaired and bought a dog collar—the woman said to my daughter "Oh, miss, would you like to have an order to see Professor Pepper's Ghost?" she said "Yes," and the woman said "I will send you one"—they left, an order was sent, and my daughter went out that evening—I went out at 10 o'clock—my daughter came home about 12.30—I let her in; she was accompanied by the prisoner and the same woman—I said "You have no right to keep my child out till this hour of the night," and slammed the door in his face—after that my daughter went out on several other evenings, and returned very late; there was quite an alteration in her—on Wednesday, 30th April, I let her go out about 9.30 p. m.—she returned about 12.30 or 12.45 in a perfect state of drunken<lb></lb>ness, with the prisoner—I went into her bedroom next morning and insisted on knowing where she went to—I reprimanded her for going out, and took a cane and hit her over her arm because she would not give me any infor<lb></lb>mation—she went out of the house about 10.30 or 11 o'clock, and did not come back that evening—in consequence of something the errand boy said I went next day to the prisoner's house in Oakley Crescent about 9 o'clock with Mr. Pearce—the prisoner was out; we waited in the hall; he came in with two other men and my daughter—I got hold of her hand and said "Lizzie, what business have you to be in this man's house?"—the prisoner deliberately put the chain on the door and said "I will see you b——before you go out or take her away, because she is over age and you have no jurisdiction over her"—he pushed her into a side room—I said "I will go out and get a policeman"—Pearce went towards the door; the prisoner knocked him down and said "You shall not open my b——door"—Pearce got up and opened the door, and the prisoner took his coat off, turned round to me, and said "Now I will settle you"—he ducked his head into my stomach, took me by the legs, and threw me down like a baby, kicked me on the back of my ear, and the blood shot out like a fountain—I was stunned for a moment—I no sooner got on my legs again than he was forcing his fingers into my throat—he tore my collar off, and tore my cravat to pieces, and a constable came and separated us—I said in the prisoner's hearing "I have not come here to make a disturbance, I want my child out of this house"—he said he would not let me take her away; the policeman said "How old is she?"—I said "Seventeen"—he said "Then I cannot interfere, as she is over age"—she then came out of the ante-room with the woman the prisoner lives with, who took her up into the drawing-room—I told the policeman I would not leave without my child if he killed me—the woman said to her "Come on upstairs," and dragged her upstairs—I went up into the drawing—room with the sergeant—I afterwards left the house, and a summons was taken out against the prisoner.</p>

She left the house about two hours after I caned her, she did not tell me that she was bruised; she was bruised, she was black and blue; when I went to the prisoner's house he did not tell me that my daughter came to him with a mass of bruises and he had taken her to a doctor; he produced a bottle from his pocket—I don't know what it was—when I tried to get to my daughter she did not run behind him for protec<lb></lb>tion—she would have come home no doubt if he had not assaulted me—there were two men outside, but they saw nothing of it because the door was shut—my daughter has not complained to me from time to time that I made her life a misery, we lived on the most happy terms—the prisoner did not say when he brought her home, "Don't be cross with your daughter staying out so late, because if it is anybody's fault it is ours, but we came straight home"—she went upstairs to bed at once—I did not beat her with the handle of the stick, but with the cane—it was not with the butt-end of it—it was a cane my boy had at school, it was not as thick as my finger—I did not go downstairs and fetch another stick, the cane was in her bedroom—I did not take hold of her arm when I was trying to get her out of the prisoner's house, saying, "Now I have got you"——the prisoner did not say, "I have taken your daughter to a doctor to—day, she has a certificate and a lotion for her arm, and if you do it again she will summon you"—I did not then catch him by the neck and throw him on the ground, I never put my fingers upon him—I don't know whether Pearce brought two police—men back with him, as I was inside—on my oath I never put my fingers on the prisoner, all I wanted was my child—I had Information what sort of a character the prisoner was, and I would not leave her there.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 46, King's Road—on Thursday night, 1st May, I accompanied Mr. Green to the prisoner's house in Oakley Crescent; I was inside when he came in with Mr. Green's daughter behind him and two men—Mr. Green collared his daughter by the arm and said, "Lizzie, what business have you here?"—the prisoner said, "You leave her alone, she has got nothing to do with you, she has passed your control, she is in mine now"—Mr. Green would not leave go of her and said, "Pearce, open the door and fetch a policeman"—the prisoner had his back to the door with the chain on; he fastened the chain with his hands behind him—I went up to him to go out and he struck me on the ear, and two or three times on the breast, and knocked me down; I got up; he palled off his coat and said to Mr. Green, "Now you b——I will settle you," rushed at him, caught him by the legs and threw him over, and then kicked him some—where about the upper part of his body—the laughter screamed out, "For God's sake don't kill my father" and caught hold of the prisoner—I rushed to the door, unfastened it, and got out; I returned with Dawson, a police<lb></lb>man, and the prisoner had then got hold of Green, who was bleeding from his ear and mouth, and he was ducking, not standing right up, but half way up; his collar was torn off; he said, "I want my daughter?"—Dawson said "What age is she?"——he said, "Between 16 and 17"—Dawson said, "If she is over 16 you cannot take her"—the daughter was then in the room with</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of 54, Belgrave Road—I examined Mr. Green on 2nd May, and found a very severe bruise in the external ear and the surrounding tissues—there was no appearance of bleeding from the external wound, but there were some drops of blood in the ear—the bruise Lid produced extravasation of blood into the tissues—it was quite black—that must have been the result of considerable violence—it is very unlikely that that injury was produced by a blow from a fist; it would require some<lb></lb>thing much harder—it might be produced by a kick—that is a most dan<lb></lb>gerous part of the head to receive a blow in—he complained of a considerable amount of pain in his ear, and said that he could not sleep—it produced most serious consequences, but I believe he has recovered.</p>

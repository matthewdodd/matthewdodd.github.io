            ; the prisoner was a servant of my father's; I conduct his business; the prisoner was entrusted to receive money, and pay it; he had been so employed I am sure above two years, and I believe near three.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he been in the habit of receiving money in the common course of business? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. For goods sold? - A. Yes; and delivered by him to our customers.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of the delivery of any goods by him to Mrs. Vaughan? - A. No; I know that he made out an account of them: Mrs. Vaughan's servant is here. I did not send him absolutely to receive the money, he went there in the common course of his business; I did not know that he had received this money for some time.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. He was entrusted by your father to receive money for him? - A.Constantly.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he a general authority from your father to receive money from the customers, and account for it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Without any particular order from your father to receive those particular sums? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Had he accounted to you, on the 31st of October, for any sum of money that he had received of Mrs. Vaughan? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. So that if he had received any money of Mrs. Vaughan, he had not brought it to account to you? - A. No. About five o'clock the same afternoon, I saw the prisoner at a public-house in Oxford-street.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before that was it that he had gone from your house? - A. He went away about noon upon business to an inn in Friday-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he return to you again before five o'clock? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mrs. Vaughan a customer of your's? - A. Yes, in Gloucester-place, Portman-square; I went to the Red-lion public-house, in consequence of information from a neighbour; I saw the prisoner there in the tap-room, with a man who went with him from our house at noon; I told the prisoner, that he was intoxicated, and desired him to go home; the other man was sitting in the tap-room, talking to a soldier; he came to me and begged my pardon for staying so long; then each of them took hold of a truck of goods that stood loaded at the door, and began to draw it towards home; I saw them through the window go out towards home; I went home almost immediately, and when I got to my own door, I found the truck there, and the other man with it; the prisoner was not there; I apprehended that he had absconded; I got home, I think, about half past five, as near as I can recollect; I then ran down a street, which I thought it was very likely the prisoner would take; but I did not find him; I came home again, and then went to Westminster, to a man that recommended him to us, and about an hour after that, I found him at a public-house, in Crown-street, Westminster; I asked him why he had staid out all day, and I asked him where the money was, which he had produced at the public-house in Oxford-street, he made no answer; I observed a watch chain hanging from his pocket; I asked him where he had bought that watch; I desired him to come home, and give up his accounts, and from his general conduct, I perceived I was not likely to get any account from him, either as to the watch, the money, or his accounts, and therefore, I immediately charged the watch with him; he was then taken to St. Margaret's watch-house, he then muttered something about, that he was coming home; he was searched, and some Bank notes taken from him, and a watch, apparently quite a new one; he there gave no account how he came by the Bank notes; I think the constable of the night asked him about them, but still he gave no account; I gave charge of him upon suspicion of embezzling property of my father's; I saw no more of him till the next evening, when I saw him at Queen-square.</p>
               <p>Q. Was what the prisoner said taken down in writting? - A. I do not think it was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Do you mean to say, that the clerk was not sitting there, taking down the examination? - A. The magistrate himself took it down; but I do not believe that what was said by the prisoner was taken down.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley contended that it ought not to be received in evidence, but was over-ruled by the Court.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179912040015"></xptr>Mr. Knapp. Q. What account did the prisoner give before the Magistrate? - A. He said, the whole of the property that was found upon him, was the property of my father, and that the money also was the property of my father, and finally begged for mercy; he said, he had bought the watch on the night of the 31st of October, subsequent to my seeing him at the public-house in Oxford-street, with my father's money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give any account where he had received any money? - A. No, not that I recollect at the watch-house; I saw three two pound notes, and three one pound notes, with some silver, and some halfpence.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You are not in partnership with your father? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner hired by you or your father? - A. My father.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good as tell us for what purpose was he hired? - A. To carry a large basket, and deliver goods out to different customers at the West end of the town, and attend occasionally in the shop.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Were you present at the hiring? - A. I cannot take upon myself to say.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Do you mean to say, that this man was in the habit of any thing more that carrying out goods? - A. I do.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, that without a particular direction, he received money from the customers? - A. It depended on the will of the customers, when they chose to pay.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you took him into custody, he was about returning home? - A. He muttered something of that sort.</p>
               <p>Q. How often did he make out his accounts? - A. He ought to have made them up every day.</p>
               <p>Q. In the evening, after his day's business was over? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. But upon this occasion you took him in custody, so that he could not return home that evening? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you happen to know what the watch cost, from any thing that passed from him? - A. He said five pounds.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Q. Did the prisoner produce any thing from his pocket, upon the tap-room table? - A. Yes; two two pound notes, a one pound note, and a five pound note, tore a good deal; he pulled them out, with an observation to the man that was with him, that he would never go home any more; that he would go to sea that evening; that he would give him, the other man, that was with him, twenty pounds to take the truck home, and then he produced the notes; and hearing that he lived with a cheesemonger near me, and hearing him make use of the name of Emerson, I went to Mr. Emerson, and informed him of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. How much was the money that might have been produced? - A. I cannot say; there was one note that he had in his hand, that I did not see.</p>

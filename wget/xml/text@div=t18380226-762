                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the 6th of February I made a search, as I stated in the last case—I found nothing on the prisoner William Taylor—I went to a house which I was informed was his lodging, but I do not know it myself—I am not aware whether any witness can prove it—I found a sheet in a chest of drawers, among other things, in a parlour, at the back of the prisoner Morgan's shop, which is an old clothes shop—I found Georgiana Stevens in bed in a room, and found a box there—I asked the prisoner Georgiana Stevens whose box it was—she in<lb></lb>stantly answered, "My box"—Frances Taylor was in another bed, in the same room—she said nothing there, but at the police-office she said, that part of the property I found in Georgiana Stevens's bed was in her bed, which was not the case—I found nothing in the bed where she was—in the box I found some pieces of ribbons and silk—it seemed the fag-ends of a roll of silk, and on the bed where Georgiana Stevens lay I found an old patch<lb></lb>work quilt—I found nothing else referring to this robbery—this was on the 7th of February—on the night of the 6th, between eleven and twelve o'clock, I went to Oliver's lodging—he was just going to bed—I did not mention this robbery to him, as I was not aware of it at the time.</p>

I am a horse-hair manufacturer, and live at No. 10, Waterloo-street—I use the house as a workshop and a kitchen—it is one house—the upper part is the workshop, and the lower part the kitchen. On Sunday, the 14th of January, I went out between eleven and twelve o'clock in the day—I left nobody in the house—the door was locked, but it was a very bad lock, and out of repair—we left the window down, but to that it could be opened—we came home between nine and ten o'clock in the evening—my mother-in-law had gone into the house before me—I found the window fastened, and the shutter also—I missed four candle<lb></lb>sticks, two blankets, two sheets, and a trunk, with different articles in it; 2nd I missed about llb. of horse-hair, and some ribbons, which belong to my wife—I had seen them about a week before we moved—I had seen the box they were in, but had not seen the ribbons in it on those premises—I had seen the candlesticks when I went out in the morning—I believe the trunk produced to be my wife's—I am certain it is the trunk which I saw in the place when I went out—I cannot swear to it, but I am quite certain it is the trunk—I only know it by its being papered, and by my father-in-law's putting this lock on.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Artichoke, in the New Cut, Lambeth. On Saturday, the 22nd of Nov., the prisoner came for half a pint of beer—he threw down a good half-crown—I took two old shillings, of George the Third's. reign, out of the till, and put them on the counter—I was about to give him 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of halfpence, and he said, "Stop, I have got a penny, give me the half-crown"—he then gave me a penny, and put two shillings on the counter, an old one at top and a new one under it—he went out immediately, and left his beer unfinished—I am sure one of the shillings he put down was not one I gave him—I gave him two old worn shillings, and the top one he put down was an old worn one—the under one was a new one—a bad one—I am sure it was not the one I gave him—on the 29th he came in again, between eleven and twelve o'clock in the forenoon—he called for a glass of gin—my wife served him, but I was present—he took two half-crowns out of his waistcoat pocket, and turned them over—he put one down—I took the half-crown up—I said it was a bad one, and told him I had been looking for him all the week, and he had passed a bad shilling—he said, "I have got a good half-crown," and he threw another down—I kept the bad half-crown and sent for an officer—I marked the half-crown, and gave it him, and the shilling.</p>

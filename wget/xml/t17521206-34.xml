My watch is a silver one, and was hanging up in my room where I work last Saturday; I was told it was missing about eleven in the morning. The prisoner at the bar worked at the needle for me, though at the same time she was gone away: she left the door a-jar, which gave reason to suspect her. I handed some bills amongst the pawnbrokers,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175212060020"></xptr> brokers, and sent my boy to see if he could find her, which he did on the Monday following; she immediately confessed she had taken and pawned the watch to Mr. Gunston in Germain Street. I got a constable, and went with her; she asked for the watch, and it was brought out with the chain and seal on it; I found she had had nothing upon it. Produced in court and deposed to.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gunston. The prisoner brought this watch to me on Saturday last in the morning between nine and ten o'clock. and wanted to borrow three guineas and a half on it; I asked her where she brought it from, and she said from her father in Piccadilly, that he had broke his leg, and if I disputed it she would fetch her mother; she went, but did not return. On the Monday morning I saw an advertisement, but before I could get myself ready to go as directed, the prosecutor came with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>My prosecutor offered me three guineas and a half to lie with me; I asked him for the money on the Friday night, and he said he had none, but bid me take the watch and pledge it for three guineas and a half, so I went and the gentleman stopped it.</p>
               <p>To her Character.</p>
               <p>Mary M'Gennes. I have known the prisoner two years, but never heard any thing of her but what was very honest.</p>

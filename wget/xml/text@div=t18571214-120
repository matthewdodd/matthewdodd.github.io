                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joseph Comber. I never knew Smith till 5th Nov., when he came to our house, No. 9, Manning Place—he asked me whether I would go to Mr. Defries's stable and get a note for him out of a tin in the room adjoining Albert Comber's room, in the room next to the coal cellar—I said, "Yes;" and I went and got the note, and gave it him at my place—he read it—I only saw him once afterwards—he said to my husband, that if my husband <hi rend="italic">opened</hi>, he would deny everything that he had said—he said, on the 5th Nov., that he saw the plate between between the bed and the mattress at <hi rend="italic">Blackey's</hi> lodging.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at Hudson's New Town, West Ham. The prisoner became a lodger of mine a fortnight before Christ<lb></lb>mas, 1853—she slept in my bedroom—I had a box. with an old fashioned watch in it, with a tortoiseshell case; the hands were both broken off—I missed it on 24th Feb.—the prisoner was still living there—she left about July or Aug., I cannot tell which—she heard me speak of my loss, and never said a word about it—a piece was broken out of the edge of the watch.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a watchmaker, living at Stratford. Towards the latter end of June the prisoner came to my shop with a watch, in a tortoiseshell case, to be repaired, to have new hands and a glass—she came to fetch it away, and it was not done—she asked me if I had a silver outside case for it, and about a week afterwards I delivered it to her, in a silver case, and gave her the tortoiseshell case as well—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the same watch in the silver case.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi> (<hi rend="italic">written</hi>). Your petitioner is a friendless orphan, depending entirely upon the labours of her own hands for subsistence, which she obtains by going out daily to iron, and has been able to keep herself respectable by so doing up to within the last two or three months. My case is simply this: I went to lodge with Mrs. Walters about a fort<lb></lb>night before last Christmas, and I remained with her until the last week in July, when I left her, in consequence of which she has been very spiteful to me ever since, and tried every means in her power to do me some injury, and has so far effected her purpose by getting me discharged from my work; and not content with that she has now preferred the present charge against me, of which, heaven is my witness, I am entirely innocent. The sub<lb></lb>stance of the charge is this: At the beginning of Feb. last I entered what is termed a raffle, for a watch, which I was fortunate enough to win; it was out of repair at the time I became possessed of it; I took it, and got it</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185411270125"></xptr>
               <p>repaired, and I thought no more of it, until a week or two after I left Mrs. Walters, when I was taken ill, and having no means of defraying the necessary expenses of my illness, I thought I would dispose of the said watch in the same way as I became possessed of it, namely, by having it raffled for; upon hearing which, Mrs. Walters obtained a description of the watch, first, by sending, and afterwards by going herself to Mrs. Bellam, who is a friend of mine, who, not knowing her motive, described it fully to her. From that description she has described it to the Magistrate, alleging at the same time that it is here, and one which I have a slight recollection of seeing about her house, that the children had to play with, but which, to the best of my recollection, was half as large again as mine. She has also described it as having gold works, and to the value of 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which that alone, upon comparison, will prove it is not hers. I have no one to speak a word for me, being an entire stranger; but I humbly pray of you, my Lord, to look upon me with an eye of pity; and I hope that God, who has promised never to leave me or forsake me, will give me strength to vindicate my own cause when I stand before you.</p>

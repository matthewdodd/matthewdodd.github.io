                  </hi>. I live in Litchfield-street, Soho, and am a harp maker. About twelve o'clock at night, on the 21st of December, I was it company with James Turner—I had a sovereign in my pocket—the pri<lb></lb>Soner came and took hold of me, she put her hand in my right-hand pocket, and took the sovereign from it, and put it in her mouth—I seized her throat—she put it out into her hand, and tried to put it into her shoe—I would not let her do that, and she put it into her mouth again—I sent for the officer, he came and took her.</p>

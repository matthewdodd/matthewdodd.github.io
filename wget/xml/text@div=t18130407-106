            . On the 12th of March I and Dawson were serving in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you serve him - A. No. Between five and six o'clock I was called into the shop, saying, they had detected the same man that had been there before, taking something. They had taken several parcels out of his pocket before I got into the shop. He was stopped at that time. He was in the shop when I first saw him. I saw him take out of his pocket a paper parcel; that paper contained drawer locks. That is all I know of it.</p>

            . Q. You are servant to these gentlemen - A. Yes. I saw the prisoner come into the shop. I knew his face perfectly well, but I did not recollect that he was the man that was stopped before. I was the only person in the shop at that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181304070070"></xptr>time he asked for two sheets of glass paper. I had to kneel down behind the counter to get it. He was exactly in the same place he was before, with his arm upon the pigeon-holes; then he asked for a file handle, for which I had to go round the counter to get it, the glass paper was two pence, and the file handle; one penny. I went round to serve him the handle. I thought he jumped up to the counter very quick, which gave me suspicion. He gave me a shilling to pay for the glass paper, and the file handle, he laid out three pence. I went to the bottom of the shop to call the porter, as I had no halfpence to give change. The prisoner gave me the shilling; the porter went out to get change, and brought it back for a bad one. He gave him an eighteen-penny piece, for which he got change. The prisoner then pulled out a watch; he said the evenings drew in. I gave him the change, when the porter came in, and when the prisoner went out, I observed him stopping about the door; he did not go away. I looked round, and I missed one paper of locks from the pigeon-holes. I ran out of the shop: I saw him about three or for doors further on. I laid hold of his arm: I said, my friend I believe you have some paper parcels in your pocket, belonging to our shop. At the time I was speaking to him the mouth of his pocket was open. I saw the paper parcels in his pocket; he did not speak a word; he came back to the shop again with me, and when he was brought back to the shop he pulled out two paper parcels, and throwed them on the counter. I picked them up directly; they contained box-locks. These paper parcels have my masters private mark upon them; in another minute he pulled out another paper parcel, and after that Mr. Woodward came in, and at that time he pulled out another.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, what did the four parcels contain - A. Box-locks, and desk-locks. They were counted at the office; the watchhouse keeper had them; he is not here; he is so ill he cannot get out of bed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Woodward. The watchhouse keeper had them till Thursday morning, and when I received them of him I received the same paper parcels that were delivered to him. I produce them; there is twenty-seven box-locks.</p>
               <p>Q. What would they cost you - A. Nineteen shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. You have laid them at twelve and sixpence - A. And thirteen drawer-locks; they would cost seven shillings to sell again.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been drinking that day. I was in a state of intoxication. I did not know what I was about.</p>

            . I am a City constable. On the 5th of October, I saw the two prisoners, they were in company with another woman, and a man; I saw them about two o'clock in the afternoon, at the corner of Jewin-street, Aldersgate-street; I followed them to St. Martin's-le-grand; they stopped there,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181310270070"></xptr>and conversed together for five minutes. Easton then left them for five minutes; she returned back again, and joined them again in conversation: then Smith crossed the road, and went to Mr. Roberts's house, an eating-house in <placeName id="t18131027-136-crimeloc804">St. Martin's-le-grand</placeName>

She came out of the house as if she had bought something; she joined the same parties; then Easton crossed the road, and went into Mr. Roberts's shop; she came out with something; then they all joined in conversation together. I then went to Mr. Roberts shop, and made enquiry what they had been doing, that confirmed my suspicion. I went after them; they all four were in conversation together, three women and one man, and what they had purchased they gave to the others who escaped from me; they separated; I went after Easton and Smith; I caught hold of both their hands, and insisted of them keeping their hands out of their pockets. In the mean time Easton dropped two counterfeit sixpences; I picked them up, and I have kept them ever since. I instantly took the two prisoners into a fishmonger's shop in Foster-lane, and searched them. On Easton I found two pence halfpenny in copper; on Smith two good sixpences, and a penny in copper. I received two shillings of Mr. Roberts afterwards.</p>

The two prisoners, both of them, came into my shop on the day they were taken up. Easton came in first; she asked for eight pennyworth of veal; it was a bone. I served her with it; she gave me a shilling; I looked at the shilling; I did not discover it was a bad one; I put it in the till. There was not any other shilling in the till. As soon as she went out, Smith came in; she bought beef, and gave me a shilling. I gave her change. I put the shilling in the till. There was only them two shillings in the till. I delivered them to Barrett.</p>

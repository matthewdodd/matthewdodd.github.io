            . I took the male prisoner at the watch-house; the prosecutor said, "How could you serve me in this way?" he said, "I am very sorry - I did it through distress; if you will have the goodness to wait, I will return it to you;" he said, "What security can I have? I shall take you?" I went outside, and took his wife: she gave the same account of it - there were fourteen duplicates found on her, but none relating to this property.</p>

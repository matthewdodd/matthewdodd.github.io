I have one partner—we carry on business as linen factors, at 3, Star-court, Broad-street, City—about 13th November last, the prisoner called on me—I recollected him when he was introduced to me, I did not know him by sight—he wished to purchase forty-three bolts of sail-canvas, and wanted a month's credit—I asked him to name his reference, he gave me two references; at the same time he produced a letter or certificate from a firm who had been in business in London two or three years before, and for whom he had acted as agent—he called again the same day to ascertain the result of our inquiries—I told him from what I</p>

               <p>had heard, I believed him to be an honest industrious sort of man, but that he was possessed of no means as far as I could ascertain, and that I would sell him the goods only for cash—up to that time he had not mentioned the purpose for which he wanted the canvas—I remarked to him that, supposing his principal could not pay him, he did not seem to be able to pay us—he said there could be no risk in the matter, that he was to be paid for the canvas by an order from the captain of a vessel in the docks upon his owners or brokers—he did not name the vessel at that time—he also added that there would be no risk, that we should have a bill on the vessel for any stores or canvas that might be supplied—after some conversation on the matter, I said that I would sell him the canvas on conditions, first that he would tell me the name of the vessel, and that he would hand the order from the captain on his owners to us for collection, for us to receive the money from the owners and account to him for the balance—he then said that the vessel was the <hi rend="italic">Mary Ann,</hi> Cape of Good Hope, commanded by a Dutchman whose name he did not recollect; and he agreed at once to deliver the order, which he did—I then told him that we were relying in this matter entirely upon the truthfulness of his statement—he said that I might rely upon his honesty and truthfulness—he said the canvas was required for sails for the vessel—I supplied him with canvas to the amount of 76<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he said that he had a contract with the captain for a set of sails; and that he was to get them made up by a sail maker—he did not tell me who the sail maker was—I suggested that I should send the goods to the sail maker to save trouble, and I asked his name—he declined to give me the name, as he did not wish the sail-maker to know from whence the canvas came, and he asked me to send the canvas to Railton, Sim &amp; Co., shipbrokers, Seething-lane, one of his referees, as being convenient for the captain to see the canvas there, being close to the docks—I accordingly despatched twenty-seven cases on the 15th, which was all we had in the warehouse at that time, and the remaining sixteen on the 22d—the prisoner called on the 20th to inquire if the rest of the canvas was in hand—I told him it had not arrived, but I expected it on the Monday—he told me to deliver it where the first parcel had been delivered, and it was so delivered—I believed the statement he made that he had a contract with the captain to supply the vessel with sails—I parted with the property upon those representations—I afterwards saw the prisoner at Bow-lane station in the custody of Knight the officer—he requested me not to press the charge, and said that he would give me 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account if I would send or go with him, and that he would find security for the remainder—I said that I must go on with the charge.</p>

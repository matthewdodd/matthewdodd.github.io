               <p>JOSEPH LOWE. On the 20th of September, about six o'clock in the evening, I was going to Bow with my little boy. There was a crowd of people at a funeral in the road. I was getting out of the crowd, which I did for six or eight yards, and was hustled by several persons, running against me, both on my right and left side-my child was forced from me at the time. I received a blow on my right shoulder, turned round, and at that moment the prisoner, Knight, pulled my watch from my fob, I saw it in his hand. The gang consisted of about twenty persons. I saw Knight pass my watch to Evans, who held his hand out to receive it. In my hurry to secure Knight, I will not swear I saw the watch go into Evans's hand, but immediately as I collared Knight, Evans rushed up, I collared him - He tried to rescue himself from me. The gang kicked me so, that my legs were bruised up to my knees, and I was terribly beat about in my body. The other part of the gang rushed in and said, "D-n your eyes, let him go, you b-g-r!" - They rescued Evans from me. I kept hold of Knight, and called for assistance. Welfare came, and I told him I was robbed. I never let Knight go, Gray also came to my assistance. The gang then became quite desperate, and bricks and stones flew in all directions. I received several blows myself, and the officers had their heads cut. We got him into a public-house with great difficulty, where he was hand-cuffed. The mob surrounded the house, and said they would rescue him if they lost their lives. I went out to look for my child. Next morning, I found Evans at the office. I should know two or three more of the gang if I could see them. My watch was not found. I saw it in Knight's hand, and Evans holding his hand out to receive it. I do not know whether he got it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. Q. You never saw them before - A. No. Evans escaped. I can positively swear he is the man, his person is so particular.</p>
               <p>GEORGE WELFARE. I am a constable of the Borough. On the 20th of September I was attending an odd-fellows' funeral, in Whitechapel-road. I saw the mob, and heard the alarm - I went up, and found the prosecutor surrounded by a gang. He was beat about most terribly, and so was I. I took Knight from him-the gang followed us with bricks and stones. I took him to the public-house-Evans had escaped, but I took him again the same night. Lowe saw him next morning, and swore to him immediately. He had escaped before I came up - I had not seem him there.</p>
               <p>JOHN TAYLOR. I am a porter, and live in Whitechapel. I was at the funeral, and saw the prisoner, Knight, go up to the prosecutor, put his hand on his shoulder, and take his watch out. His companions surrounded him. I was pushed about, and received a cut in my hand with a stone. The prosecutor collared Knight-the gang were using him very violently.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I did not see Evans, the mob was so great - He might have been there.</p>

            . I am constable of Mile End. I came up, being told of the robbery, Welfare had hold of Knight - I laid hold of him; one of the gang collared me, and tried to take him from me - I knocked that man down. We went on; when we got to Baker's-row, a gang, consisting of twenty or thirty persons, surrounded us, and assailed us with sticks and stones. I saw Evans in the crowd.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I did not see him do any thing.</p>
               <p>JOHN DYER. I am a headborough of Mile End. I was attending the funeral. There was an alarm, I went to the spot, and found Knight in the custody of Gray, he endeavoured to get away; the mob followed and assailed us with stones and bricks; opposite the King's Head the officers received several wounds. I was very much beaten. I saw Evans throwing stones, or in the attitude of throwing them; my head was desperately cut, and my body hurt. The mob cried out, "Rescue!" I was obliged to retire into a court.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL DOBSON. I am a headborough. I was at my own door, and heard the mob crying out "Rescue, Rescue!" I ran for assistance. I went to the watch-house, and received Evans in charge.</p>

               <p>EVANS'S Defence. I was not present at the time of the robbery. I saw the crowd, ran up, and went into Baker's-row, and the officers took me.</p>

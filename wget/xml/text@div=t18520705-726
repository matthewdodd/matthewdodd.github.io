                  </hi>. I live at 2, Sun Tavern Gap. On a Monday evening, in May, about 7 or 8 o'clock, I saw the Chinese by the Stone-fields, near High-street, Shadwell—there were two other Chinese with him—he was talking to an Irishman—that is the Irishman (<hi rend="italic">pointing to the prisoner</hi>)—I was about a yard off—one of the other Chinese was about half a yard off him, and the other about a quarter—I did not understand anything that was said—I saw the Irishman knock the Chinese down with his fist—the Chinese had a watch in his pocket, fastened with a chain round his neck—I did not see him do any<lb></lb>thing with it—I saw the Irishman take it out of the prosecutor's pocket; he gave it a hard pull and broke the chain—the prosecutor was on the ground at the time—there was a mob collected; the prisoner ran back into the mob, and I believe gave the watch to a man there—the prisoner was not on the ground, but he stooped when he took the watch, and after he got up the prosecutor got up—I saw the prosecutor get a policeman, and afterwards saw the policeman take the prisoner, round by the Stone-field's, where this had happened—that was about ten minutes after he had taken the watch.</p>

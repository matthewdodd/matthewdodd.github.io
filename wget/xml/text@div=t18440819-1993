                  </hi>. I live in St. John's-place, Back-road, Shadwell—I know James Winson. On the morning of the 16th of July he came, and called me up about a quarter before six o'clock—I dressed myself, and went out with him—we got to Lombard-street—I saw the prisoner there, whom I bad known pre<lb></lb>viously—while we were in Lombard-street I saw some persons who by their dress and look appeared to be foreigners—they addressed us, and said some<lb></lb>thing about money or bank—the prisoner was about directing them to the Bank of England, and the taller one shook his head, and said "No"—the shortest one had a paper in his hand, and the taller one said "Robert," as far as I could hear—the prisoner looked at the paper while it was in the short one's hand, and he went up the steps with him into the banking-house—I saw that—I and Winson went on—we were not joined by the prisoner—I went to London-bridge, and from there to Gravesend.</p>

DOANE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What are you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I assist Mr. Winson in his busi<lb></lb>ness, in his boat, and sometimes I have jobs with a truck, or a cart—I have nothing to do with his house—I am not a partner with him—he always em<lb></lb>ploys me—I do not carry on any business of my own—my wife sells fish—she does not keep any green-grocer's shop, or any shop—Mr. Winson knows very well where I live—he called me up that morning, about a quarter before six o'clock—I know it was before six, because Shadwell bell was ringing—he was in the habit of calling me, but not every morning—I was in bed when he called me—I asked him in, and he walked in, and I went up stairs and dressed myself—he sat down stairs—there are but two rooms, one up stairs, and one down—I did not shut the street door when I let him in—when I had finished dressing, I came down and found him still in the room—he got up from his seat, and accompanied me out of the house—we did not have any breakfast—we started and went direct to Shadwell-dock—we waited for ves<lb></lb>sels to come up—I cannot tell exactly how long we waited—I dare say it was an hour and a half, or two hours—we went to the entrance of the docks, went to the Fox, and had two pints of beer—I had one, and he had one—we had not anything to eat—we then came through the Commercial-road towards the City—the prisoner overtook us in Aldgate, where we were standing look<lb></lb>ing at a horse that had fallen down—he came up and said, "Good morning"—I knew him as a doctor—he attended me three months ago, and also eighteen months ago—three months ago he lived in York-street—I went and found him there—when he came up to us on the morning of the 16th, he asked us where we were going—we said to Richmond—he said he was going to buy a waistcoat in Lombard-street—he did not mention any shop—I did not say anything to it, but Mr. Winson did—we were about leaving him at the end of Fenchurch-street, and he requested us to accompany him as far the tailor's—I suppose it was to look at the patterns—we consented—we did not go into any tailor's, but went and looked in at a tailor's shop—Winson advised him to go to a shop in the Poultry, or Cheapside, and we were going on on the right hand side of the way—we saw the foreigners on the left hand side in Lombard-street, but we had crossed over before they overtook us—one of them was tall, and the other was about my size—the short one was fair—the tall one was dark, and had mustachois—they were talking, and appeared to be disputing among themselves—they turned round, and addressing Winson</p>

               <p>and the prisoner, saying, "The bank, the bank"—I turned round at that and the tall one said, "Robart, bank, money"—I could not understand what he said, but I recollect those words—the prisoner said, "Round here, at the bottom"—the tall one shook his head, and said, "No, Robart's"—the short one had a paper in his hand—the prisoner had hold of one corner of it—that was at the end of a street—the prisoner and the short Frenchman went into the house with it—I do not know what became of the tall Frenchman for I did not stop—we went on to the Poultry—we did not wait at the door of the house—I have been in the passage while Winson was examined—I have not been spoken to by anybody.</p>

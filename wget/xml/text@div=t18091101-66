            . I told Boucher I was sorry but I had reason to believe he had something that he should not have. I unbuttoned his coat and waistcoat, the frill of his shirt was pinned, when it was unpinned then the nutmegs appeared; I found 2 lb. 9 oz. of nutmegs between his shirt and his skin. He said, he was very sorry; it was the first time. I have had the nutmegs ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. You had nutmegs in the warehouse where he was at work, had you not. - A. We had. I went to No. 12, Off-Alley, in the Strand, I found a woman there, he said it was his wife; she seemed alarmed and fell down as if in a fit behind the door, and there I found a nutmeg bag, and a bag of cloves. These are the nutmegs I found on his person; they are like those that were in the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. It is the first time that ever I was accused of a thing in my life. I sat down behind a chest and fell asleep, when I got up this person followed me, and said you have something that you ought not to have. He opened my bosom and found them there, it was unknown to me, nor was it caused to be done by me; there was an animosity between him and me before. I know nothing of this charge.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

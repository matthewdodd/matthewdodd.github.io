             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect ever being present at any church where she was married? - A. Yes, on the 4th of October, 1799, at St. George's in the East, I was witness to the marriage of a man of the name of Hamlyn, and the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. How long is it since you have seen Hamlyn? - A. I saw him to day.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How were they married? - A. They were married by licence.</p>
               <p>Q. Is she an English woman? - A. I believe she is; I saw her married to that man; I believe you will find my name in the book.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Where did you come from now - You have just come from the New Inn? - A. No, nor the Old Inn.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been a little in the sun? - A. I have not seen the sun-shine.</p>
               <p>Q. You are as sober as ever you were? - A. I believe I am.</p>
               <p>Q. It is a great many years ago? - A. Not quite seven I believe.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How came you to recollect the time - You do not know what this woman was? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What was Hamlyn? - A. He was a baker by trade, and is now, I suppose.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. How came you to recollect the year and the day? - A. Sometimes one makes a memorandum of these things.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you make a memorandum of the day and the year that this woman was married? - A. It is at home, I suppose; I have not got it here; I can recollect such a thing as that.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. I am afraid you have been drinking; I will not have any flippance in witnesses - How came you to recollect the day? - A. Very well, your Worship; likewise I have it in the register, in my own name; I have a memorandum somewhere, if I have not lost it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. When were you applied to, to become a witness? - A. On Tuesday night last, between six and seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the woman, from the year 1799 to the Tuesday night after she was in custody? - A. I have seen her for three or four years since.</p>
               <p>Q. You might have seen this memorandum since Tuesday last, or how came you to recollect the day? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Because that would refresh your memory? - A. I have said all that I can say.</p>
               <p>Q. The reason that you recollect it at all is, you had made a memorandum of it; you were not applied to till Tuesday last; how did you know when you were applied to on Tuesday last what day it was; did you look for the memorandum? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. How came you to refer to the memorandum in the first outset of the business? - A. I recollect it very well.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. We have no doubt at all that she is the woman that was married to the man at that time.</p>

               <p>Q. Did she call on you? - A. No, only where I live.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by saying only, are you married to another? - A. I said only at our house; she did not come into my room, because I cohabit with another.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you indicted her for marrying another, and you cohabit with another yourself? - A. She married another.</p>
               <p>Q. Who pays the expences of this prosecution? - A. The first husband, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. How much does he pay you? - A. He pays me nothing; I come of my own free will; he applied to me to prosecute; he found out where I lived.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you persuade her or she you? - A. She persuaded me as much as I did her; it is so long ago I cannot hardly say.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you live together before you were married? - A. Not at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you inquire about it, whether she was single or married? - A. I never inquired about it.</p>

               <p>Q. From whom do you expect to get that? - A. From Mr. Hamlyn, to pay my expences for attending here, and neglecting my work.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's wife. On 18th Nov., about a quarter to eleven o'clock at night, I was standing at my mother's shop door talking to Mr. Hammond, who was outside—the prisoner came to the door—he was in the habit of coming and using very improper language towards me before the customers—he passed me, went ir, and passed out again, making use of a very improper expression, and wint up the street—about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after, I was still at the door and looked up, and all of a sudden I saw him close to me with a knife in his hand, what they call a Spa<lb></lb>nish knife—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he instantly stabbed me in the left side—</p>

               <p>it cut a cape, which I have on, and caught against a stay-bone over my breast—it did not enter my person—he then took the knife and cut along my waist—it only cut the outside of my dress—I fell backwards on the floor with the first blow, and was on the floor when I received the second—one of the blows cut a small piece from my finger, and cut my hand—I think it was in warding off the first blow—I could not scream or speak—my mother was standing in the shop, but it was done so momentarily that she did not see he was in the shop—a lad outside <hi rend="italic">sung out</hi> "He has got a knife, be has got a knife"—I was struggling to keep him from me—Mr. Hammond came and caught him by the back of the neck and held him till the policeman came—we have been married eleven years—he has frequently threatened me—about a month before this he came in and I said something to him about work, and he said, "Do not bother me; if you do I will cut your b----y heart out."</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a public-house, in Powis-street, Woolwich. I was at Mrs. Hill's mother's shop on this night, about half-past ten o'clock, standing at the door talking to Mrs. Hill—the prisoner came up, and used some expression towards her and left—about ten minutes after he returned witli a knife, and made three or four stabs at Mrs. Hill—I was not going to in<lb></lb>terfere till some one said, "He has a knife," and Mrs. Hill said she was being stabbed—I immediately seized him, the policeman came, and the knife was taken from him—it was then open.</p>

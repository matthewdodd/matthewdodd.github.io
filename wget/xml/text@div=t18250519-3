On the night of the 12th of May I saw the house locked up, and went to bed about eleven o'clock; I was awoke about three o'clock, by Jones, the servant, knocking violently at my room door. I jumped out of bed, ran partly down stairs, and heard the watchman's rattle spring, which led me to think the disturbance was in the street; I went to my sister's bed-room, looked out of her window, saw a watchman, and told him to come to our door - I ran down stairs, found the door open, and him there; it appeared to have been opened from within. I saw the mark of a centre-bit on another door and the pannel was broken - that door appeared to have been opened by a centre-bit; the hole was large enough to admit a man; there is a wall at the top of the house, with spikes on the top. The watchman found an umbrella in the passage, and that morning the servant picked up a centre-bit. There were marks on the wall (which is white-washed) as if persons had got over there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. LAW. Q. Where do the prosecutors reside? A. In Warwickshire; they come to town every year. I am the son of John Betts, but have no share in the business. I saw the side door fastened, that was found open; the door with the broken pannel was not open. I got up the moment I heard the alarm, and only guess the time - it was twilight.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where is the door which had the pannel broken? A. It leads into a yard, round which the wall goes. A person getting through that pannel must break open a door to get to the shop - an attempt had been made to cut the lock of that door away. I am sure all the doors were fast the night before. I manage the business; the prosecutors pay rent, taxes, and wages.</p>

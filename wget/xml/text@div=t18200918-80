               <p>"You trod on my dog," and instantly struck me in the mouth with violence, it made it bleed, he knocked me up against some shutters, came close to me, and drew my watch from my fob. I laid hold of him and accused him of stealing my watch, - I saw it in his hand, he was in the act of passing it behind him to some of the others; he then twisted under my arm and ran off, the others had run away directly he gave them the watch. I ran after him, and saw two young men stop him. He was never out of my sight. I am sure he is the man. I have not recovered my watch.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODERICK. Q. It was nearly dark - A. Yes; I looked round before it occurred, and did not notice many people about. He did not appear in liquor. I was alarmed very much and confused. I think the occurrence might last five or ten minutes. I cannot be mistaken in his person. I do not think that I trod on his dog. I certainly did not before it was twisted round my legs.</p>

I was with the prosecutor, and saw the prisoner strike him in the face, he advanced on him, and took his watch from him as he fell against the shutters, he put it behind, and I saw one of the persons go up and receive it from him and run away. The prisoner got off and ran too, we followed, and he was never out of my sight till he was taken. I am sure he is the man.</p>

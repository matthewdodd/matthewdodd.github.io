Somebody trod the heel of my shoe down, and I stooped to pluck it up before her. When I had put my shoe heel up, I looked round for the prisoner, and she made a motion for me to follow her.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176406070038"></xptr> I did, and we went into the first public-house we came to, and to the necessary; the prisoner sat down, and turned out a gold necklace, two rings, a guinea, a 5 s. 3 d. about 4 s. in silver, a pair of gold bobs, two sleeve buttons, and three groats: she gave me one of the rings with stones in it; I had the 5 s. 3 d. piece, and 4 s. and the 2 s. which she took out of another gentlewoman's pocket: then we made the best of our way for London, to her lodgings.</p>

             stood straight before me, and hindered me from going in. As I tried to go on one side, she was before me, and stopped me; when I tried on the other side, she was still before me: there was a man on my right side that hindered me, which I believe to be the prisoner, Holliday. I said to the woman, what need you crowd so, here is room enough; she said, it is true, there is; this whole was but about half a minute. I was going to put the chain of my watch in the inside, and missed it. I never saw my watch again.</p>
               <p>Q. What fort of a watch was it?</p>
               <p>Ogier. It was a metal watch, with two seals; the outside case tortoise-shell, and a steel chain. I am certain I had it about half an hour before: I had looked at it when it was about half an hour after eleven: I recollected the woman's face very well, and I think I recollect her voice: it appeared as if she had some design in stopping me. As soon as I felt for my watch, the place was so clear that any body might pass without the least crowd.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was she to you?</p>
               <p>Ogier. She was close to me, before me.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way was her face?</p>
               <p>Ogier. It was towards me: she was near enough to me to have taken the watch.</p>

               <p>A. Brinklow. We were picking pockets, and please you, my Lord. Mrs. Elger went up to him, and took his watch out of his pocket, but which way she got it out, I cannot tell; they hindered him from coming either on one side or the other. As soon as she had got it, she delivered it into my hand; it was a figured tortoise-shell spotted case; I never examined it, to look full at it, but I directly gave it to Holliday, under the Piazza's. I don't know what he did with it; we all left the place directly; and made the best of our way to St. Bride's church; Holliday went from us, and said he had put the watch safe: I never saw it after. Then we all went to an eating-house, in Flower-de-luce court, in Fleet-street, and dined: after that, we met at the two Blue Posts, facing Brook-street, Holborn, a place where we generally met at: there we divided a guinea and a crown piece, which we had out of a gentlewoman's pocket. Holliday left us after we came out of the two Blue Posts, intending to fetch this watch, from where he left it in the city; Martin was to have it; we met at Sadler's Wells: Holliday came to us there: we got a watch at the Wells, which Martin had.

She was a person of such a bad character, that nobody would take her in: my husband went with her to pawn a watch; he once fetched her ring out of pawn; and I heard her say, she would swear forty lives away, before she would go herself. She is a very wicked person: I used to talk to her to go to service; but she said, she would whore, thieve, or do any thing, rather than go to service; and if that would not do, her husband, that lives in good Cow-cross, must maintain her; he lives in good credit: she never was married to

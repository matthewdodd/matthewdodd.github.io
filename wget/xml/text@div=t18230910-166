On the 7th of August, I marked eight half-crowns, and put them into the till, also sixty shillings, and twenty sixpences; I marked them all with a shoemaker's awl. About dinner time, (one o'clock,) I sent the prisoner for some beer; and while he was gone, I took all the money out of the two tills, and put this marked money in, except two half-crowns and one shilling, which I gave to a man, and desired him to buy a piece of bacon with them; he came and laid that out and three-pence more, several other customers came in. After dinner, I came into the shop with the other shopman; I said</p>
               <p>"William go in and get your dinner" - he stepped down below, I took all the money out of the till, and found adeficiency of 1 s. 6 d.; I sent for an officer; I then took him into the room, and said,</p>
               <p>"William, here is an officer, I suspect you have some of my property;" the officer desired him to pull out his money, he pulled out 20 s. and 1 1/2 d. - he put them down before me, and I picked two of the shillings out which I had just marked; I said,</p>
               <p>"I have suspected you a long time, and now find it is true; I shall give you in charge;" he said,</p>
               <p>"No, Sir, you will find I have not robbed you." I told him it was no use denying it, and the officer took him. Upon looking my money over, I found nine half-crowns, one of them not marked, fifty-five shillings and twenty-two sixpences, two of them not marked.</p>

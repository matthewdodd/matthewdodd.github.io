                  </hi>. I live at No. 31, Holy well Road, and am a carman—on the afternoon of Tuesday, the 16th November, about 3.30 I saw six or seven men in my father's yard—I went to them, told them to be off, and remonstrated with them—as I was going away one of them caught hold of me, hustled me, and took my watch from my left waistcoat pocket—I saw it in his hand—he then ran away and I followed him—I overtook and kept him until a policeman came up—I ran above 200 yards after him—the swivel broke from the chain when the watch was taken—it was in a doorway in North Place where I caught him—he tried to get away and struck me a blow, and the people from behind tore the coat from my back—I suppose they were his comrades.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">By the Prisoner.</hi> The men came into the yard to ease themselves—I asked them to go further away, as they could not be allowed there—they took no notice of me, but muttered something that I could not understand—you hustled me as I was going back towards the office—the other men also endeavoured to stop me from entering the office, and they also attempted to stop me from running after you, who had the watch—I saw your hand take the watch from my pocket—I saw it in your right hand when I ran after you, and you put it under your coat—when I stopped you you tried to <hi rend="italic">get</hi> away from me—I gave you in charge of a police-constable then, and directly after I let go of you they broke you from the constable, knocked him down, and took charge of his staff.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carman—I live at 31, Holywell Road, Bow, and I am a brother of the last witness—I was in the office on this occasion when the men came into the yard—I saw my brother go down to them to tell them to go away—they were too many for him—he walked back towards the office, two or three of them followed him round and took his watch, but I did not see it taken—I saw my brother run after the prisoner, and I followed and kept sight of him all the way—I saw the prisoner given into the policeman's custody—he got away from custody, and I then ran after him myself—in consequence of what a boy said to me, I went down a court and met the prisoner coming towards me—there was no thorough fare—I laid hold of him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">By the Prisoner.</hi> I saw them hustle my brother about—there were seven or eight of them altogether, and two or three of them followed him up the yard—the others were about the gate—the men were making water in the yard, and they blackguarded my brother—one of them caught him by the collar of his coat and turned him round—I saw my brother follow you, and he said that you were the man who had the watch—I ran to the North Buildings against the lodging-houses, and I saw my brother had—hold of you there.</p>

               <p>Gould's custody in North Place—he was given up to a police-constable there were other men there—I went to the crowd to see what was going on, and one of them said' He would break my b----y jaws if I went near"—they hustled the constable; James got hold of him and some of the <hi rend="italic">men</hi>—a woman then threw herself bodily between them and broke them away—I ran after the prisoner and followed him to the end of North Place—I called to some people to stop him, but they let him go on—I followed him round Chapel Street, and at the corner of File Street he called me a "b----y sod," and before I got to the end of File Street he drew ix knife to me—I called one or two persons to come to my assistance, but nobody cared to approach us, and so I let him go and went back to my work—he swung the knife round at me—it was open—I am satisfied he was the man.</p>

He was running after others and thought I was one of the persons along with them. The people near told him I was not the person. That was the reason the constable left loose of me. If his brother had seen me at the gateway he must have seen me take the watch. If I had been one of them I should have turned round and <hi rend="italic">muzzled</hi> him. It has been all a get up for me; it was a preconcerted affair. I am innocent and work hard for my living. I did not take the watch. I have been living down the Southwark Bridge Road.</p>

               <p>EDMUND RYAN. On the 30th of September, about five o'clock in the morning; I was in a public-house, dozing - I had a half-crown, two shillings, a sixpence, and 10d., in copper, and four duplicates, which were in my fob-pocket; I had pawned a coat the day before for 6s.; I pulled off my dress at night, but that morning I was going to my work - while I sat on the bench, the prisoner came and sat next to me, and took my money from my pocket; the watchman came to the house, and took him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was not I drinking with you that morning, and you gave me the duplicates to take care of, and at the watch-house you and the watchman both agreed to let me go for half a crown? A. No - we were not drinking - I never saw him before; I did not give him the duplicates, nor offer to let him go for half a crown.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I went to the public-house; I heard a noise of loud talking as I was going by; I looked in, and saw Ryan sitting on the bench in the tap-room asleep; the prisoner was on his right-hand with his right-hand in his waistcoat pocket; he then went to his left-hand pocket, and took something out, but I could not tell what, and he put it into his own waistcoat pocket - I stood with my back against the counter, and watched him - when he had got what he thought proper to take, I called my partner, and we took the prisoner up to Ryan, awoke him up, and asked if he had lost any thing, he put his hand into his pocket, and said he had lost half a crown, some silver, and, copper; we took the prisoner to the watch-house, and found half a crown, two shillings, a sixpence, and 10d., and four duplicates; the prosecutor was sober.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Is not my statement true about his offering to let me go for half a crown? A. I know nothing of that.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I assisted in taking the prisoner - we found the half-crown, two shillings, a sixpence, 10d. in copper, and this knife open in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was drinking with him; the Magistrate reprimanded the watchman for agreeing to let me go for 2s. 6d.; the prosecutor came home last night, and said he should speak the truth, and that he was drinking with me.</p>
               <p>EDMUND RYAN. I had been out to the City-road the night before with a friend; the prisoner was not in the house when I went to sleep; when I awoke, he said I was his friend.</p>

               <p>I am an officer belonging to Litchfield-street; I know the prisoner: I took him in custody on the twenty-third of August in Tottenham-court-road in the street; Johnson came to the office to me, and in consequence of his information to me, I took up the prisoner; I searched him, and in his waistcoat pocket I found this bottle and this bit of black mittin, with these seven shillings, and fourteen sixpences, all bad; they have been in my custody ever since, and three shillings and sixpence in good money, I found in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the money mixed or separate? - No, the bad money was all in that bit of black mittin, the bottle was broke before the Grand Jury, but that is the liquor that was in it; I was obliged to find another bottle, and I took him before the Justice; I have some shillings to shew the Court that this stuff will turn them of that colour.</p>
               <p>Have you made the experiment yourself? - I have, but I have none of them here; I believe Mr. Vines has.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt, prisoner's Council. These kind of blanks are used for other purposes I believe. - Very few in that state, they have heads.</p>
               <p>Is there any impression on any of them? - Yes, on several, a faint impression.</p>
               <p>Jury. Some has no impression, and some a faint impression.</p>
               <p>Are not pieces of metal of that size, applied to various purposes? - Not in that state; a round blank with neither head or woman on it, you may make a button of it.</p>
               <p>Would you have taken any one of them as a shilling? - In the state I saw them in, they were finished fit to pass; I should not have taken any of them, but any other person would.</p>

            , about the 18th or 19th of August the prisoner asked me to go home with him, I went home with him.</p>
               <p>Court. What, was he an acquaintance of your? - Not in the least, but I found by being in company with Ford, that he dealt in base money, I went home with him, and called for a pint of beer, he took a bason of the shelf, and there was some pieces about the size of half crowns or crowns, I looked upon them to be copper; after that he told me that he could cast any of them, I immediately went to Litchfield-street, and acquainted Blacketer of what had passed, and he desired me to watch the prisoner; the next day my business led me to go over London Bridge, and I met the prisoner and asked him how he did, he pulled out a bottle out of his pocket, I thought it had been a sample of rum, I smelt of it and I found it was aquafortis, besides that he pulled out of his waistcoat pocket, something similar to paste, similar to that which is in Court, which he said was for cleaning of metal, then I left them, and called at Litchfield-street and acquainted them; two or three days past, and I called again on the prisoner on a Tuesday morning about seven the 23d of August, I was going to see Ford, he asked me for a bottle that stood on the shelf, which he took, he was in his own house, he was in bed, No. 7, White Lion-street, I took it to be something of bark, then he desired me to reach him another bottle, which I did, and when he got up he took off the shelf a black purse which is in Court (looks at it) this is the very purse, it had something in it that jingled I could not tell what it was, I went with him to Ford's, and Ford was not up, I knocked at the window and Ford got up and let him in, I kept on the outside, he asked Ford to give him a little salt, I leaned and lolloped on the outside of the window, there was no glaze to the window, only shutters; the prisoner asked Ford to give him some salt, after that he pulled the bottle out of his pocket, and began to rub some off it with the salt, with some of the metal which he had, which were of the size of sixpences and shillings, he rubbed seven pieces resembling a shilling, and thirteen sixpences, one sixpence I did not see him do (which is the sixpence which lays at the corner) after he had done them, he put him into cold water in a bason, I went immediately to find Blacketer, I could not find him.</p>
               <p>Did you observe what effect the rubbing of them had? - It appeared to make them look like shillings and sixpences.</p>
               <p>Before or after they went into the water? - Before they went into the water.</p>
               <p>What colour were they before they were rubbed? - Something similar to copper, when he washed them he put them into the very same purse, I then went to Dixon and told him what happened, and where he might find the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. How soon was it that you saw what you took to be the pieces that you say he rubbed in that manner, or something similar to them, again? - He rubbed them about a quarter after seven, I saw them directly after, the next day when the prisoner was examined, I went to Mr. Vernon.</p>
               <p>Then you do not know that they were the same pieces that you saw him do? - I really believe them to be the same, there is one shilling that has got a little bit of a hole or dent, that is it to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Pray, Mr. Johnson, has it ever fell within your observation that people stand in the street with paste resembling the colour of this, and rub buckles or buttons? - Such things might be in the street, but I never took notice of it, I have read in the paper of these things for cleaning of silver.</p>
               <p>Court. What way of life are you in? - I am at home with my friends, my mother is in the fan way, lives in Somerset-street, Portland-square.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178510190016"></xptr>Are you bred to any business? - I never was.</p>
               <p>What age? - Twenty-nine, my father once lived at No. 61. Friday-street, he is reduced.</p>
               <p>This man was not your acquaintance? - No, he was not, Ford was my acquaintance, I was under a predicament for an assault in New Prison, which was the way I got acquainted with Ford, I was a prisoner there for an assault.</p>
               <p>You met this man first at the Hampshire Hog, with Ford? - Yes, it is opposite St. Giles's church.</p>
               <p>What was your business there? - I called to see Ford being a prisoner.</p>
               <p>What business had this prisoner with Ford, could you discover by the conversation between them? - I found that they had been to Peckham-fair the day before, putting off bad money, and they were eating some salmon, and I eat some with them.</p>
               <p>Can you explain to the Jury what led to that? - I cannot.</p>
               <p>What is Ford? - He is a duffer.</p>
               <p>Because it seems a little extraordinary, that the prisoner should choose to put his life into the hands of an absolute stranger, you know Mr. Johnson? - I never saw the man before that time in my life.</p>
               <p>Did you give him any encouragement to help him with respect to this money to pass it off? - No, my Lord, far be it from me.</p>
               <p>Then, what was it that introduced you so far in the confidence of this man? - I thought it was my duty, or any other person's else, to have such a man apprehended.</p>
               <p>I am not blaming you for discovering what past, but what I want to know is, what it could be that induced this man to put so much confidence in you? - I cannot tell, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Do explain to the Jury how it happened that this man trusted you with such a secret as this? - I look upon it, knowing I had been in prison with Ford.</p>
               <p>But he had no reason, I imagine, to suppose you dealt in that way? - I never did in my life.</p>
               <p>But did he suppose so? - Being in prison nobody can tell what situation of life I had been in when I came out; I cannot tell rightly what made him repose so much confidence.</p>
               <p>Rightly, can you at all? - No, I cannot.</p>
               <p>Dixon. When Johnson applied to me I desired him to get some of it if he could.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. By your Lordship's permission, I beg leave to observe, this evidence does not sustain the indictment; as to the first count, it appears to me, that in the whole code of laws respecting the coinage of this kingdom, wherever counterfeiting of coin is mentioned, it must be so, that in the common course of receipts and payments of money, it might deceive a common observer; it is not merely the circumstance of money resembling in size, in diameter, and colour, that is such a resemblance as will reach the indictment, under the acts of parliament on this subject: there are various pieces of metal that are coloured for various purposes, that do, in some sort, resemble the current coin of the kingdom, both in size and colour, and yet have not that kind of resemblance to induce any reasonable person to take them. I conceive they must have some traces on the edges, or some traces of the inscription, or something of that kind of resemblance, that would induce people of common experience and of common observation to take them by themselves: with respect to the second count, I think there arises an objection to it from the very nature of the crime, as described in the act of parliament; it says, in a more general way, pieces of metal that only resembled in figure, pieces of base metal that are coloured for that purpose, so far as to resemble the colour of shillings; the evidence does not state that this money was the money that Johnson saw the prisoner colour, but if it did, it is within the eye of the Court and Jury, that they do not so far resemble the colour of shillings, so as to be taken by any<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178510190017"></xptr> person of common prudence or observation; I thought it my duty to submit these observations to your Lordship's consideration.</p>
               <p>Court. They are observations that go to the matter of fact.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. In the very last Sessions there was a trial of the very same nature, where the pieces did not more resemble the current coin of the kingdom than these, and the prisoner was acquitted.</p>

I was in a vault, in the area, on the 2d of February, and heard a foot-step - I opened the door, and saw the prisoner advancing towards the area steps; I said, "What do you want here?" he held up a bottle, and said, "Do you want any blacking?" I said, "Come here, sir;" he then got into the street, and I followed; he dropped the basket, which he had in his hand, in the area; I pursued him down several streets - he got out of my sight, but he was taken; I saw him again at the watch-house, with these five spoons, sugar-tongs, and books - the spoons and tongs are the property of my master - the books are my own; the plate had been on the right-hand side of the pantry - when I returned to the pantry, I found some hay, and a bottle of blacking in the basket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you any opportunity of seeing the man before he left the area? A. Yes; he spoke to me for about a second or two; I saw him about three minutes afterwards.</p>

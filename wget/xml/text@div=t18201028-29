A morocco box was in a drawer in my parlour, containing a lady's gold watch, a neck-chain, a seal, a key, and three rings, all gold. She dined with me on Tuesday, and I asked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182010280015"></xptr>her to do some needle-work; while she was doing it she said Mrs. West, who lived on the second floor, told her I had a gold watch. I took it out of the box, shewed it to her, put it back again, and did not see it afterwards. I missed it on Saturday, she was then gone. Before she went she gave me two 1 l. notes for her lodging; one of them had</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODERICK. Q. You have many female lodgers - A. Not many; they are all females. I lived there twelve months before I was married - I have been married two years.</p>
               <p>Q. Your lodgers are visited by gentlemen - A. Yes. I did not know the prisoner till a week before she came to us, which was three weeks before the robbery. My maiden name was Taylor - I have gone by the name of Williams. I have lived with two gentlemen, and went by their names.</p>
               <p>Q. On your solemn oath, when you shewed the prisoner the watch, did you not desire her to pledge it -</p>
               <p>Witness. Am I to answer that question, my Lord?</p>
               <p>COURT. Most undoubtedly - A. I never did. I had redeemed it about a week before. I never said I directed her to pledge it. I had redeemed it not many weeks before.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What was your reason for asking whether you was to answer a question perfectly innocent - A. Because the gentleman seemed to ask such inconsistent things. I never did authorize her to pledge it.</p>

               <p>Q. That is not in the parish of St. Bride. How came you to be married there - A. My wife wished it. We were married by banns. The prisoner lodged in our house. On Saturday, the 7th, in consequence of what my wife told me I went to Robson's, and on Monday went to Robertson's. I was obliged to pay away the notes I took of the prisoner. I found the property at Robertson's. My wife let the prisoner the lodging.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know what she came to lodge with you for - A. I believe she came for what the lodgings are let for. I only knew her while she lodged there.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at her - do you mean to swear you have not known her some years - A. Not to my knowledge. I think I have some recollection of her about seven years ago living in Leonard-street - I visited her once there. I am not certain it was her.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, when she came to lodge with you, did you not recognise her as an old acquaintance - A. I said I thought I had seen her.</p>

I asked her if she had ever pawned a watch at Robertson's, in Bishopsgate-street? she said No, and asked me what would be done to her? I said it was impossible for me to say, and then asked her what she had done with the ticket? she said she had destroyed it - she had denied pledging it.</p>

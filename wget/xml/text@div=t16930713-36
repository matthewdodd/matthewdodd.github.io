            </rs>. The Matter of Fact appeared upon the Evidence thus: Mr. Pickering being an <rs id="t16930713-36-viclabel165" type="occupation">Apothecary</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t16930713-36-victim113 t16930713-36-viclabel165"></join>, there was some Monies due to him from Sir Richard Mansell; and in order to be satisfied, and to come to an amicable Account, they agreed to meet at Squires's Coffee-house in Fuller's Rents, where being met, they did not long continue, but for more privacy went down into <placeName id="t16930713-36-crimeloc166">Grays-Inn Walks</placeName>

The Surgeons gave their Opinion that the Wound was the occasion of his death, &amp;c. Sir Richard being asked what he had to say in his defence, he answered that it was a Misfortune that happened much against his will, and that he was heartily sorry for it; and that he had no design of doing of him any hurt, and desired that the Judges would be of Counsel to him, and was willing to submit his Case to the Court; <rs id="t16930713-36-verdict167" type="verdictDescription">

               Then the Judges gave their Opinion, and did agree that the Matter should be found special, because it was a new Cause; Matter of Law did arise thereupon, therefore it was resolved that a time should be set aside for the Judges to consult the matter
            </rs>. Then Sir Richard Mansell moved, that he might continue upon Bail; but the Court told him that could not be granted.</p>

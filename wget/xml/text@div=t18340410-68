               <p>CHARLES SAMUEL CARTER. I live in Throgmorton-street. I had been out to spend the evening on the 11th of March, and was returning home about twelve o'clock, or a little after - I was accosted by the two prisoners, and went with them to their residence near <placeName id="t18340410-68-crimeloc386">Finsbury</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18340410-68-crimeloc386" type="placeName" value="Finsbury"></interp>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you recollect doing any thing at all with the watch? A. No; I might have put it between the bed and mattress; there is nothing impossible.</p>

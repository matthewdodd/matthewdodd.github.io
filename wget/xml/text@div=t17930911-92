               <p>Q. Did you, in consequence of any suspicion of the prisoner at the bar or any body else, go any where with a constable? - I did.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110158"></xptr>Q. Where? - I went to his lodgings in St Mary Axe; he was then in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you went to the prisoner's lodgings? - The 17th of August.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know they were the prisoner's lodgings? - There was his wife there, and I asked his wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear the prisoner say any thing about his lodgings? - I did not; I went there supposing it to be the prisoner's lodgings.</p>
               <p>Q. And what did you find there? - I went there, looking into his box I found two pieces of hessian cloth; it was in a box under a turn-up bedstead in these lodgings.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know to whom that hessian cloth belonged? - I did not know till I ordered the constable to take it home, when it was at home me and the constable compared it together with what I had at home, to see if they corresponded in the cutting and parting, they did exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you enabled to say, from the correspondence of these two pieces of hessian cloth found at these lodgings, that they were your property? - They fitted.</p>
               <p>Court. How long before this day had you seen the hessian cloth together? - I had not seen it in one piece a long time; I don't remember only cutting off eight yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen it in one piece? - Yes; I bought it myself; the piece was upwards of thirty yards, there has been at times cut off more than twenty yards, I never cut off any only eight yards when I bought it.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity did you find at the prisoner's lodgings? - One piece containing about four yards, and the other about two yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they together? - They were in the box together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they seem to tally one with the other? - They did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. The piece you found in the prisoner's room is the width of your piece? - It is.</p>
               <p>Q. And that is the general width that cloth runs? how many pieces of this had been cut off by your foreman, or by your porters for your use you cannot say? - The foreman is here.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you any other reason to say that it is part of that piece than, because it is particularly of the same width? - I have no other reason.</p>
               <p>Q Then all that you can say is that it was of the same width as that you have.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Was there any other mark by which you knew the hessian cloth? - None but by the cutting off.</p>

            . I know the stable of Mr. Neal; I am a patroll. As I was going my round, between four and five in the morning of Thursday, the 24th of January, and asked the watchman if all was right. I went to the box of the man in whose beat Mr. Neal's stable is; and on asking him, he said, he thought something was not right. In consequence of this, we went down Goodman's Yard and found both the prisoners there. Shuttleworth had this stick in his hand, (producing it.) We secured both the prisoners, and I asked them what brought them there at that time of the morning? Shuttleworth said he had got a little in liquor, and did not know when he was going. I searched them, and in Smith's hat I found this key, (producing it) with a bit broken<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181602140044"></xptr>from the ward. I examined the door of the stable, and there I found the rest of the key in the lock of the stable. The door was unlocked. I went into the stable. There were several articles in it; such as harness, &amp;c. On Smith's shoulder was wrapt up this bag, (producing it.) Neither of them appeared to be so intoxicated as not to know what they were about.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ADOLPHUS. Mr. M'Combie has the other part of the key. These men might be forty yards from the stable when I took them.</p>

            . I am a constable of the city of London. These premises are the last that are in the City of London in that direction. The warehouse is in the county, and the stable is in the city. I was in the watch-house at the time the prisoners were brought in; all was safe in the watch-house when I went down to examine it. I got this bit of key which matches the rest found in Smith's hat, out of the lock after considerable trouble.</p>

            . I am carman to Mr. Neal, and had the care of the stable. In the evening before this matter was discovered, I locked the stable; none of the harness was gone.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ADOLPHUS. You don't know you locked the stable that night - A. It is my firm belief that I did so, as well as I did on all other nights. There were horses in the stable.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS as counsel for the prisoners, briefly addressed the jury with a considerable degree of ingenuity upon the mischiefs that might arise from convicting men of a misdemeanor upon evidence like this, where his clients might have got into this stable for the purpose of getting a bed, upon an amour with some lady; perhaps resident over the stable, or from fifty causes which every one knew, men in their circumstances of life were frequently more or less subject to. It would be hard to impute to his clients an intention to commit a felony, when in fact, all that was proved against them amounted only to tresspass, for which Mr. Neal might have his sction, if that was any satisfaction to him.</p>

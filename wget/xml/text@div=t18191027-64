            . The last witness is my apprentice; he brought me the note. I thought it was bad, ran into the shop, and asked the prisoner if he had got another? He said, No; he said he took it in the way of trade. I said,</p>
               <p>"If so, I suppose you know of whom you took it." He said he should know the man if he saw him again, but he did not know where to find him - he said he sold the man some glass beads for it. I told him I suspected it was a bad one, and should detain it until he brought me good money for the things. He went away, and I went to No. 9, Ironmonger-row, which is at least a mile and a half from my house, but found that no such person lived there. I inquired at several houses in the neighbourhood, but could find no such person. I then went to No. 9 Ironmonger-street, which is just by there, but could find nobody who knew him - I had left orders at home to detain him if he should come again. On my return I found him in the shop - he said I have brought you the money for the goods. I said, Let me see, where did you say you lived? He said, I lived over at Walworth. I said, that is not the address which you gave on the note. He said, No, I work at No. 9, Ironmonger-row, and am to be found there every day. I said I believe Ironmonger-row is only a short street; he said it was. I then said, I presume there is only one No. 9? he said there was not. I said, what sort of a house - is it a shop? He said it was a private house, and he had worked there eighteen months on his own account. I said, I suppose the person you took the note of came to your manufactory to purchase the goods? He said, No, he did not. I said, I suppose you took the goods to him, and know where he lives? He said, No, I met him accidentally at a house in Petticoat-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say who kept the house in Ironmonger-row - A. I asked him - he said, Robins. I said, I now suspect that what you have told me is all false. He said, No, it is not; I will go to Ironmonger-row with you, if you like. I said, he need not do that for I had just come from making inquiry there, and the house you describe as No. 9, and a private house, is a shoemaker's shop, and the person's name who keeps it, is Baker. He had said he worked on the first floor. I sent for an officer, and gave him in charge. I told him he had given a false address. He said his reason for giving a false address, was, that he was a glass bead maker, and was obliged to pay the Excise duties, and he could not get a living by it if he did.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Saville, auctioneer of Chigwell—on Thursday and Friday, 22d and 23d of March, we had a sale at Claybury Hall, Barking—the prisoner came on Thursday, the first day of the sale—I was standing outside the front door—he came up to me, and asked for Mr. Saville—I asked him his name—he said, "Harris of Stratford",—I said, "Are you any relation to Mr. Harris, the ironmonger?"—I did not say of where—Mr. Harris is a gentleman known to us—the prisoner said, "I ought to be"—I said, "What! are you his father?"—he said, "I am old enough"—I was not quite satisfied with that answer, and I asked him a second time, "Are you his father?"—he said, "I am old enough to be, <hi rend="italic">aint</hi> I?"—he said he wanted to see Mr. Saville, because a friend of his, a Mr. Thompson, who was a large wholesale grocer in Stratford, was going to sell off his stock, and his lease too—he did not say auything more—I believe I then left him, to find Mr. Saville for him—Mr. Harris, the ironmonger, lives in High-street, Stratford—on Friday, the second day of the sale, the prisoner came to the sale and purchased a lead pump for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—on the Saturday he came to pay that for it, and 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for other lots which he had purchased, making a total of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he gave me, in payment, this 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I observed to him, "This is a <hi rend="italic">rum un</hi>; where did you get it from?"—I cannot remember whether he made me an answer—he did not give any direction as to any name on it—believing him to be father of Mr. Harris, Ironmoger of staratford, I wrote on the note, "Mr. harris, stratford," and gave him the change—he did not give the name of Harris on that occasion—I believe, when he came into the room I said, "Good morning, Mr. Hrris"—I left the note, with other monies, at Mr. Saville's residence—I wrote the name on it</p>

               <p>immediately I received it—Mr. Saville brought it to the office on the Thursday following, it having been returned to him by his bankers as forged—I made inquiries—I did not find the prisoner at Stratford—the prisoner came to the sale in a cart with a name on—that induced me to go to Stepney—the police found him there—we gave information that evening to the police, and I went with them the next day, and found him in bed at 13, Wellesley-street, Stepney—I took the note with me—I said, "Well, Hams, we never heard from your friend Thompson"—he said, "No, it is put off"—I then questioned him as to how he paid me—he said that he gave me a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I said, "Exactly; that 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note was a forged one"—he said, "I did not know it; I took it at an auction sale, "or "of an auctioneer" I don't know which—he said he did not know it—I said, "If you took it at an auction sale, you know where you got it"—he merely said that he should not be able to find the man; that the man was a broker—we have not had Mr. Thomp<lb></lb>son's sale on yet—I afterwards asked him Mr. Thompson's address—he said, "You cannot find him; he has gone down to live in the country;" he said Thompson had sold the things by private contract"—I said that it was rather a short time to do that in.</p>

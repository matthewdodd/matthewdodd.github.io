The prosecutor turned back again; I saw his watch and took it from him, and insisted on having his money: he gave his money into Jones's hand, but Jones did not ask for it. We went away together, and spent the money between us; we were taken up and carried to Bridewell next night for having run away from our master, and the watch was found in the place next day.

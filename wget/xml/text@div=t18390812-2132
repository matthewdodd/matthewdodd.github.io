On the 30th of May I went to the cellars with Mr. Barefoot, and found two 36 gallon barrels, which ought to have contained stout, empty, and another barrel had eighteen gallons taken from it—I had charge of the cellars—the beer had not been taken by permission of Mr. Goding—on the 1st of June I saw some stout produced by a constable at Queen-square office—it was the same quality as that which bad been in the barrels in the cellar—there is an air-hole in the cellar, looking into Mr. King's stable-yard.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police inspector. On the 30th of May, in consequence of information, I went with Hay ward to the cellars under Charlotte-street chapel—I found two barrels empty, and another partly empty, and there was a spill in that barrel—on the 1st of June, early in the morning, I went to the cellars with Floyd the constable—the spill was precisely the same as I had left it, except a shaving which I had put on it was gone off—we concealed ourselves, and about half-past five o'clock heard a noise at the end of the vault, in the direction of King's stables, and Doherty, who has been convicted, came into the vault in that direction, with a lighted candle in his hand—he examined the place; and Went di<lb></lb>rect to the stout barrel with a peck measure, which he filled four times, and on the fifth occasion I advanced upon him, and took him into custody—I found a man named Morse and the prisoner, at the hole of King's stables, in the direction Doherty had come from—I saw each of them receiving the measure when Doherty took it to the hole—I took Doherty into custody, but the prisoner escaped—I searched Mr. King's stables, and found a funnel, with the froth of malt liquor on it, a bung, and part of another, and in a sewer, which runs through the premises, I found two large stone bottles, which had been recently broken—we had seen Morse take a large stone bottle towards the hole.</p>

I accompanied Barefoot to these vaults on the 1st of June—I saw Doherty there with a candle—he came three times to the barrel—he put the beer in the measure through a hole, and gave it to Morse, and the prisoner, who stood outside on King's premises'—I afterwards saw a stone bottle with a funnel in it—Morse took it towards the sewer—Barefoot apprehended Doherty—I endeavored to get through the hole, but could not—on Saturday, the 20th of July, I ap<lb></lb>prehended the prisoner in the Excise-office, in Broad-street—I asked him if he knew what I was taking him for—he said, "No"—but there was a woman with him, who I believe to be Doherty's sister—she said, "I know very well, it is about the beer"—he said he would go wherever I took him—Doherty and Morse were employed by Mr. King as Carmen.</p>

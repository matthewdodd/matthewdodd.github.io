On the 17th of September the prisoner went to load a load of hemp from Burr-street. I sent a good covering with the waggon, to keep the hemp dry. I told him, to take particular care of it. He was to take it to Chester's quay, near the Custom-house. I sent my clerk to watch that it went safe.</p>

He threw it on the tilt, and covered it with the corner of the tilt. He went to Chester's quay. He got on the top of the waggon, and rolled up the tilt with the head of hemp in it. He delivered the load of hemp according to order, except the load of hemp in the tilt. After he had delivered the hemp, he drove up into Thames-street. I asked him on Chester's quay, and likewise in Thames-street, if he was sure he had delivered all his load of hemp. He said, he had delivered the whole.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the quantity of hemp the whole load - A. Six or seven hundred pounds weight. The gentleman that employed us to cart the hemp, and had informed him what I had seen. He was waiting on the quay to receive it. I asked the prisoner, if he had anything in his tilt. He said, no. I made him undo it. He was very loth to undo it. The head of hemp was then found in the tilt.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the weight of the head of hemp - A. Fifteen pounds all but two ounces. He said, he did not know how it came there. The value of the head of hemp is thirteen or fourteen shillings. I made him drive the waggon home. I then informed my master, and then he was taken in charge by the constable.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence, nor called any witnesses to his character.</p>

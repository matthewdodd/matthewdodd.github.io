In consequence of a man being up the chimney when we took a prisoner the day before, I searched the front room in the first pair of stairs; I could not find him there. I then went into the back room, and underneath the bedstead I found him crawled up, under the head of the bedstead on the boards. I then called to my brother officer, I said here he is. I turned up the bedstead, and asked him what he came there for; he said he came to dine with a gentleman in the front room. What! I said, you come to dine with Finch; he said he did.</p>

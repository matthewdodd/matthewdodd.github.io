On the 14th of April I went from 82, Snow Hill, to 13, Long lane; I saw the prisoner in the shop as soon as I opened the door, with my sister in law.</p>
               <p>Q. What time in the day - A. Before five in the afternoon; the prisoner was trying on a shoe; I saw the shoe was too small for his foot; the instant I opened the door, my sister in law seeing me, left him and went into the back parlour; I took the shoe from off his foot; I took another pair which was too large for him; the prisoner arose up and placed the chair he was sitting in in the middle of the shop; I moved the chair and desired him to sit down, and gave him another pair of shoes to try on, which fitted him; a soldier came in soon after and stood inside of the door; the prisoner asked me the price of the shoes; I told him; he offered me money for them; I told him I could not take it; I looked at him and saw him very much agitated; I looked down his great coat, I saw something bulge out. I seized his pocket and felt that they were shoes; I desired the soldier to hold his pocket and not let him take any thing out. I got an officer; he searched him; he took a pair of shoes out of that pocket; I saw they were mine; the officer put his hand into his other pocket and drew out another pair of shoes; I saw they were mine; the officer searched his pockets and could not find any money whatever.</p>
               <p>(The property produced and identified)</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence, nor called any witnesses to character.</p>

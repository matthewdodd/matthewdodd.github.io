             of that parish, bachelor, and Caroline Elizabeth Miller, of that parish, spinster; after the ceremony had taken place it was hinted to me that she was a widow, and I have inserted it above the line in the register; I did not know the parties - they have both made marks: she was described in the bann-book as a spinster - I did not proclaim the banns.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Was not the marriage stopped in consequence of what was said? A. It was hinted to me that she was a widow, but I think it was after I had inserted her name as a spinster; and then I inserted widow in this irregular place; I did not notice a ring on her finger, and I do not recollect that I announced that there was an irregularity in the marriage - I have looked at the Marriage Act, but I thought the marriage was not void after the ceremony; I am quite confident I did not notice that she had a ring on her finger; the sexton and clerk are the only witnesses, which is a strong presumption in my mind that no women were present.</p>

Mr. Bailey then left the church and went away, and we went away also; we got nearly to the end of the street, when we saw the clergyman returning on the opposite side of the way - he called us back, and he performed the ceremony from where he left off; the ring was put on her finger, and she came home to her mother's house; I stayed there till eleven o'clock at night, when I left them there together; I saw the prisoner the next day, but I have no recollection of seeing Jones that day - I saw him a day or two afterwards, I cannot say how often; I saw him afterwards, it might be three or four times; I saw them together at her mother's two or three days afterwards - they appeared to me as man and wife; William Jones is still alive - he was at the hearing at the office on the 2d of August; I did not sign the book because I am no scholar, and Mr. Bailey said he should take it on himself, and the sexton and clerk signed it - we had a certificate the same day; I am sure the business about the ring took place during the ceremony.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is she not a very respectable person? A. Yes; I do not recollect that the clergyman suggested that the banns should be put up again; he suggested that the sexton and clerk should sign the register - I believe the man and woman could neither of them write, they both put their mark - I knew of Jones living apart from her soon after the ceremony, but I did not know of her going by the name of Miller; John Hogg was her last husband, and he is here, and I did not know him.</p>

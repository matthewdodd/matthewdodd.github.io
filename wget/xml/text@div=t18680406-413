I don't know what you mean"—I said, "Then tell me who and what you are"—he said, "I am George Bowrie, a medical student, just arrived from Hamburg"—I said, "Well, whether Burke or Bowrie you must come with me to the station"—he demanded to see my warrant—I said he would see it at the, proper time and place, and he refused to go with me—the constable took hold on one side and I on the other—I told him I should compel him to go with me, and we commenced to pull and drag him—he resisted and struggled—Casey interfered, and struck me several blows—after that Burke became quiet, and we walked on to the end of Russell Square—there he suddenly stopped, and said, "I demand to see your warrant"—I said, "I will show it by-and-bye"—on that he said, "Come, let me go"—I answered, "No"—the then made a sudden effort and wrenched himself out of my grasp, threw the constable off on the other side, and made off—I started in pursuit, when Casey came up and struck me several blows, and tried to prevent me going after him—I pushed him on one side and went after Burke, who had only gone a short distance—I pulled out my revolver, and said, "By God, Burke, if you don't stop I will fire on you"—he said, "Don't do anything desperate"—we then took hold of him again—I called on the bystanders to assist me, but they did not seem disposed to assist me or the prisoners—I got Burke into a cab—Casey wanted to get in—we prevented him, and got away—we went to Bow Street polioe-Station—Casey followed in another cab—I placed Burke in the inspector's room, and charged him with treason-felony—I sent for Deniay—he came into the room, and I asked him if he knew anyone in the room—he pointed to the prisoner, and said, "That is Rickard Burke"—I then proceeded to search Burke—he said, "You may rest assured you will find no treasonable docu<lb></lb>ments on me"—I searched him, and found various little things on him, and some money—I asked him what name I was to put on the list—he said George Berry—I told him he gave the name Bowrie at first—he said, "That must be a mistake"—and he spelled Berry—he said he was a medical student and had recently come from Hamburg—I asked him for his address—he said he could not tell me where it was, but if I would go out with him he would show me; that it was at an hotel somewhere in the, neighbourhood of Regent Street—Casey had come to the station with Burke, and I directed that he should not be allowed to leave—he said his name was Joseph Theobald Casey, he had been assistant station-master at Gleethorpe, Lin<lb></lb>colnshire, in the employment of the Great Northern Railway Company, and</p>

I am twenty-six years of age—I was formerly in the Federal army of the United States, first as a private, and afterwards as a lieutenant—I was in the Federal army in 1862, and knew the prisoner Burke at that time—he was a sergeant in the Federal army, and then became lieutenant and captain in the 15th New York Engineers—I became a Fenian in 1862—I took an oath; it was to overthrow the British Govern<lb></lb>ment in Ireland, and to establish a republic in its stead—I remained a Fenian until 1866, and attended several Fenian meetings—I saw Burke at a meeting at the head-quarters of the leaders of the Fenian organization—that meeting was held in Douane Street, New York—John O'Mahony, Colonel Roberts, the vice-president, and several of the leading members of the Fenian organisation were there—O'Mahony was at the head of the Fenian organiza<lb></lb>tion in America—there were none but leaders there—I left for Ireland after the meeting in 1865—military men were sent to Ireland to command the Irish people in the event of a rising—Burke took part in that conversa<lb></lb>tion, and agreed to that—I landed in Ireland in August, 1865—I saw, in Ireland, Colonel Thomas Kelly—I knew him Intimately—he was a leading man next to Stephens, in Ireland—I saw Stephens in South Ann Street, Dublin—I brought him some despatches from O'Mahony—Stephens was at the head of the Fenian organization in Ireland—he was in prison for a time while I was in Ireland—after he was in prison, I was sent from Ireland to America with despatches from Colonel Kelly to O'Mahohy—Colonel Kelly was in command of the organization in Ireland after Stephens was in prison—I took the despatches to America, and delivered them to O'Mahony—I did not see Burke in America at that time—I passed on two occasions between America and Ireland; once was after the convesation I have spoken of—I was in Ireland in February, 1866—the Habeas Corpus was then suspended there—I was there when it was suspended; it was after<lb></lb>coming from America the last time—on its being suspended; it Captain Beecher, whose proper name is O'Rourke, ordered me to leave Ireland and go to Liverpool as paymaster of the organization, and I went to Liverpool in Company with other American officers—when I was in Liverpool, Fenian meetings of those officers were held in several places—I saw Burke in Liverpool from April or May, 1866, down to October or November for weeks at a time, but sometimes not for four, five, or six weeks—I did not go to America during 1866—Burke attended Fenian meetings at Liverpool, at which plans were discussed and circles formed for the benefit of the organization—it was part of the organization that circles should be formed, the different members of the Fenian Brother<lb></lb>hood heading the different circles—circles were formed in America and Liverpool—I belonged to the military circle from America—Burke did not belong to a circle in Liverpool; he was an American officer like myself, just a I was—circle were formed in Liverpool,—with the exception of those for American officers—I belonged to the military circle formed in liverpool—the centre of a circle who has men enough to form a regiment can do so; if it is not large enough for that, he is caption of the company; and if it is not large enough for that, he becomes captain of that circle—no other—arrangements were made or discussed in Liverpool during 1866; we</p>

C. Winslow in the districts about Birmingham, where he had been to purchase fire arms for the Brotherhood—he said that he had sent them to Ireland, and that one or two cases had been seized at Queenstown by the police—he said that he had received credit for a short time for several hundred poundt—I think it was about 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I am not sure—I returned to London twice from Ireland, and on my second visit, about the 24th or 25th February, for instructions—I expected that the Chester affair would fail, I am not sure whether I knew that it had failed—I said only a part of a day in London—I learned that the rising was to be the 5th of March, at midnight—General Halpin com<lb></lb>manded the Dublin district—I was all over the country pretty much, I went to all the principal cities, to have a look at the disposition of the Queen's troops and see what resources the organization had in the way f arms and ammunition—on the night of the 4th of March I left Cork, and was arrested at Limerick Junction two hours after—I remained in custody for some months, and then I turned informr—I was present at General Halpin's trial in Ireland, and also at Colonel Burke's trial, where I was principal witness—Colonel Halpin went by the name of fletcher in London.</p>

How are you on for 'breech-loaders,' eh? You, if you want to satisfy the popular demand, must turn them out 'pretty considerably fast, I reckon,' as our friends north of Mason's and Dixon's line say. They and the needle gun are all the rage now; so much for the bitter experience of a seven days' war. Wait till they keep it up for four long blessed years; won't there be a fine field in Germany then for the sale of crape? I think so. Don't you? I have met with some slight losses since, but that is of little import now. I hope to be able to take a good stock off your hands, just if only to keep my promise, and not necessitate another of thy pet manufactures—apologies—you know. Kind regards to Mrs. Kynoch, Mr. Claddo, and Mr. Rubery. Thanks for your kind invitation; trust me, you will see me oftener at Spark Hill, when I again go your way. Good-bye. E. C. Winslow."

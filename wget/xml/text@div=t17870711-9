               <p>Was your wife's purse ever found? - Yes; Mrs. Altree gave me her purse, which I gave him; he rode directly down the road after he got her purse.</p>
               <p>How soon after was he taken? - I came up the road to Hammersmith, and enquired for some of the Bow-street people; I staid twenty minutes, and then proceeded to Hammersmith turnpike, and from thence to Kensington, where I found them, and described the man and the horse as near as I could; I believe this was about a quarter before twelve; and a quarter before one, the person took him; and brought word he was taken, the next morning; having left my address at the turnpike gate, they came down to acquaint me they had taken him; and the next day, between eleven and twelve I saw him at Bow-street; I saw my watch produced, and a guinea, and some silver, and a bad shilling which I lost, which was among the money; I saw the purse produced, I cannot say that I could swear to the purse, but there was one circumstance which was, that I put in half a crown and a shilling at Wendover, and I put the sliders the wrong side outwards, and it was in that situation when I saw it; it was a striped purse; I never had it in my hand three times I suppose, but the purse was the same kind; he said nothing when I was present; Sir Sampson Wright asked him if he had any thing to say; he said he had not; I know nothing further of Mrs. Altree's robbery.</p>
               <p>Did you know the person of the prisoner? - I cannot take upon myself to swear, but it is a very similar person, but at that time of night, situated as I was, I do not wish to swear; I have not a doubt with respect to my belief, but I would not wish to swear positively.</p>
               <p>Have you in fact any doubt about it? - No, I have not; it was a dark night for the season of the year.</p>
               <p>Mrs. ALTREE sworn.</p>
               <p>I was with my husband this evening; I perfectly recollect the circumstances of the robbery; the prisoner came up on horse back, on full gallop to the head of the horse; he said we must stop, Mr. Altree immediately stopped.</p>
               <p>What was taken from you? - A purse, brown and white silk, with half a crown, and a shilling in one end, the other end is torn, and had nothing in it; I had had it but a fortnight; I do not remember any thing particular with respect to that where the half crown and shilling was; I saw him put it in at Wendover; I saw the purse the next morning at Bow-street in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178707110031"></xptr>the same situation; I am sure it was my purse; I did not observe it being turned at one end.</p>
               <p>Did you observe the person of the man at all? - No, I did not, his coat I remarked, but the purse I am sure of.</p>

In Nov. 1815, the prisoner came from the country and lodged at Howard's coffee-house, Duke's-place. I was there one evening and he gave me an order for a waistcoat and pair of breeches, I made them, and took them home on the 25th, I gave them, to him upon his credit, he said he would pay me in an hour. I never saw him afterwards, the articles stated in the indictment were in the bundle with his things, but were not for him, he took them also; I never saw him again till the 19th of May last. I had him secured.</p>

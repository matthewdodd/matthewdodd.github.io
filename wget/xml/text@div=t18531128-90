                  </hi>. I am a builder, of Halton, in Hampshire, and officiate as parish clerk there. I knew the prisoner there, and his wife, Mary Louisa Gray—I was present at their marriage, in Halton Church, on Aug. 5th, 1840, and took my part in it as clerk—an entry was made in the parish register; this is a true copy of it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I have examined it with the register—(<hi rend="italic">read—Richard Thomas Clement Gray and Mary Louisa Burnt married Aug.</hi> 5<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, 1840)—they lived together, to my knowledge, three or four years, and kept a grocer's shop.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, living in Prescott-street, Whitechapel, and am the mother of Mary Bagnall Adams. She was married to the prisoner on 20th Aug., at the Register-office, Stepney—the prisoner informed me that the proper notice had been put up—I had known him six years—while he was paying his addresses to my daughter he said he had had a wife, and that he was married to her at Halton—he said he had had two children, but one was dead, and that his wife was dead—I had one of the children staying with me four months.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the daughter of the last witness, and am twenty-one years old. I have known the prisoner six years—I went through the ceremony of marriage with him before the registrar, on 25th Aug., 1852—when he proposed marriage to me he said he had a wife living, but she</p>

               <p>was living in adultery; that she had been in a madhouse, and that he was separated from her, but he said that she was alive—at the time of my marriage with him I believed it to be a good one—when he first proposed, he said he had better wait a little time till he was settled in business—I lived with him five months, up to the time of his apprehension.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I believe he has treated you with great kindness? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He has; we lived together as man and wife for some time before we were married—I knew that his wife was living, but thought he was separated from her on the score of adultery—he took a house, and has kept me ever since.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant, H</hi> 7). On Sunday morning, 24th Nov., I took the prisoner, at Poplar—I told him he was charged with <hi rend="italic">intermarrying</hi> Miss Adams, his wife still living—he said, "Very well; I considered myself a single man; my wife has been living in adultery for the last five years, with an omnibus proprietor; I suppose I must go with you"—I said, "Yes; I have come for that purpose"—I showed him both the certificates—the first he said he knew nothing about—this is the second (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he also said his wife had been in a madhouse, and that Miss Adams knew that he was a married man.</p>

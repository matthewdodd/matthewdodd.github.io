               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord, I shall trouble you with very few observations: When I became acquainted with my first wife, I was but 19 years of age, and was a dupe to a woman of the most depraved character; the represented herself to be a woman of respectability; but I found her mistress to be a kept woman, and she herself a woman of loose manners; I was unnable to support her in her extravagance, being only an articled servant; she stripped me of every thing I had, and went away, declaring, by an oath, she would never return; this is three years and a half ago, and I have never seen her till this time; and I frequently heard she was dead; I did not marry the second wife till after I heard of the death of the former, after a knowledge of her for a year and an half; I had no interested motive in this marriage, quite the contrary, she has not fortune or expectancy; it was a marriage of affection; we lived amicably together, and by my industry, were getting forward in the world.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q.(To O'Donnel). Did his first wife live with him? - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q.How did they live together? - A. That is unknown to me; perhaps they would quarrel, but their family affairs I have nothing to do with.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you not represented her to be a very abandoned and drunken woman? - A. I know nothing of her character; I know nothing that is dishonest of the woman, she might drink for what I know, I have seen her take a glass many times, that is nothing to me.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Is she an abandoned woman? - A. I never saw any thing dishonest or disgraceful, only just taking a glass, which many women are liable to.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did they live together? - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she a drunken woman? - A. I never saw her, to say drunk, in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us how many glasses of liquor have you seen her drink one after another? - A. Not more than three, one after another.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never said, she lived in a bawdy-house? - A. He told me so, I had nothing but his word for it.</p>

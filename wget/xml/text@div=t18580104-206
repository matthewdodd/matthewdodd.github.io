                  </hi>. I live in Giffin Street, Deptford. On Wednesday evening, 11th Nov., about half past 8 or a quarter to 9 o'clock, I went with the prisoner and a woman named Lockwood to the Ship York public house, at Rotherhithe—a woman named Bishop was there also—we had some ale, and remained there about an hour—we went from there to Lightbody's, the next house, a beer shop—we had some lemonade and ginger beer there; the</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 17, Cross Street, Rotherhithe. On Wednesday, 11th Nov., I was at the Ship York public house, with Gordon—therewere, three young men there, and three females; the men were foreigners, but I cannot tell who they were—we went from the public house to Lightbody's beer shop; Gordon, and Bishop, and me, and two young men; we had some lemonade and ginger beer there, and left between 11 and 12 o'clock, closing up time; the prisoner is one of the young men—we were going to Deptford, which would be about three quarters of a mile; the mate walked with me, and the prisoner with Gordon—when we got by the Blade<lb></lb>bone or Defiance public house, I and the mate were going in there—the prisoner was not willing to go, and we went on—the prisoner did not wish Gordon to go the right way to Deptford, and she said, "This is not my way"—he said, "Yes, it is"—she said, "No, it is not," and she was in the act of turning back to come with me, when the prisoner drew something from his breast, and struck her on the head—I was close behind them, about a yard or two away—Gordon screamed out, and ran—the prisoner took hold of her by the cloak, and pulled it off her, and then both he and</p>

               <p>the mate ran away—I was very much frightened, and ran away—I afterwards saw Gordon at the Defiance—there had been no dispute whatever; the prisoner was quite sober—we had been drinking lemonade and ginger beer, and we had a glass of ale at the Ship York.</p>

I am a surgeon, at Deptford—I was called to the Defiance public house on 11th Nov., about half past 12 o'clock, and found Mary Gordon sitting in a chair in front of the bar—she was very much exhausted from loss of blood; but the haemorrhage had then ceased—I did not see the wound—a quantity of flour had been applied to her neck—I sent for a cab and sent her to the hospital—she was quite sober.</p>

                  </hi>. I was house surgeon at Guy's Hospital when Mary Gordon was brought there, about 3 o'clock on the morning of 12th Nov.; her neck had been bound up, and a large quantity of flour was put into the wound to stop the bleeding—I cleared that away, and examined the wound; it was two inches in length, at the upper part about half an inch deep, and two and a half inches at the lower part, and was situated about three inches behind the right ear; the depth of the upper part was less, in consequence of the instrument having come in contact with the skull and glanced downwards; she left the hospital well on the 28th—any long sharp bladed instrument would inflict such a wound.</p>

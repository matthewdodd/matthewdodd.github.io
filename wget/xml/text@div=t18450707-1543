                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman.</hi>) On Saturday, the 5th of July, I was con<lb></lb>veying a person to the station-house at Poplar, and was in the act of shutting the station-house door, when the prisoner, who I believe is a sea<lb></lb>man, struck me a blow on the head—I did not know him before—he fol<lb></lb>lowed me in to the station—Young, who was on reserve duty, came to my assistance, and the sergeant on duty came out to assist also, and ordered the prisoner to be secured—the prisoner, at that time, had me by the cuff of my right coat wrist—he tore the sleeve off, and in a minute afterwards I felt a knife run across my hand—I saw the knife in his hand—finding myself wounded I called out to the sergeant to be careful, that he had a knife—I drew my truncheon and struck him twice on the arm with intent to strike the knife out of his hand—the sergeant then ran into the guard-room to get a cutlass, as he had his hand ready to strike—he came out and struck him with the flat of the cutlass, and knocked the knife out of his hand.</p>

               <p>he was trying to liberate the prisoner, I said, "Let that man be secured"—the two men went up, but they were no use at all, he swung them about easily—I went up to him, and heard Beale cry out, "For God's sake, mind; he has cut me with a knife"—Beale got away—Young still clung to him—I went into the charge-room, and got a cutlass, which was the nearest weapon I could get—when I came out again Young was about half a yard from the prisoner—I saw the knife raised over Young—I immediately gave him the flat side over the knuckles, and knocked the knife out of his hand—I only struck him once—Beale struck him with his staff.</p>

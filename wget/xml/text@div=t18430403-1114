                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joseph Sharpe, and live I in Middle-row, Brixton. On the 17th of March I came in an omnibus from Brixton to Gracechurch-street, and am certain I then had my purse about me—it contained seven sovereigns and a half, three half-crowns, and some shillings—I joined my husband at the corner of Fenchurch-street, and walked with him to Fleet-street—I felt my purse safe two or three times after getting out of the omnibus, and was not aware that I had lost it till I received information.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer. On the 17th of March I was passing down Ludgate-hill about two o'clock in the day, and noticed Mr. and Mrs. Sharpe on the opposite side, and some persons near them, which attracted my attention—I watched, and saw them dodging Mr. and Mrs. Sharpe, who walked a little beyond Salisbury-court, in Fleet-street, then turned back and looked into several shops—the persons closed on them opposite Poppin's-court, and immediately after separated—the prisoner was one of them—I noticed, as he crossed the road, that he had his right hand in his coat-pocket—he crossed over to me, and as he turned into the court I laid hold of his collar with my left hand, put my right hand into his coat pocket, and partly</p>

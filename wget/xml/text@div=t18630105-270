                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Bowers, of 36, Herbert's buildings, Waterloo-road—one night in December, between three and five minutes past 12, I was walking down Waterloo-road with my husband and Mary Ann Trybeck, coming from market—three persons accosted us—the prisoner was one of them—he said to my husband, "If you hit that woman, I shall hit you"—my husband asked him what woman he meant—he said, "That girl coming down the road," and he pointed to some girl coming down the road—my husband asked him what he meant, and he said if my husband hit that woman he should hit him—I said, "Mate, you are labouring under a great mistake, no one was interfering with that woman or with you"—he told me to mind my own business, and used improper lan<lb></lb>guage</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186301050164"></xptr>
               <p>—I told him it was my business, and he hit my husband a violent blow—it out his eye open—he hit me in my eye and blacked it; it was a violent blow—he did not knock us down—after I came out from the crowd I missed 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—a great crowd collected—when the prisoner hit me in the eye, another person who was with the prisoner, hit my husband too—the other seemed to be acting in concert—I had blows from several of them round—the 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was loose in my gown pocket—I am confident the prisoner is the man—I have no doubt in the least about it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did you see me steal the money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I say you might have done so—when you were accused of taking the money, I said I did not know whether it was you who stole it or not—I did not say I did not want to charge you—the money was safe not three minutes before I sit you—I missed it about five or ten minutes after I got out of the crowd<lb></lb>there was not much of a crowd when the policeman was there; they had gone away.</p>

I am the husband of the last witness—I was with her and Mary Ann Trybeck—we met the prisoner and another man standing against the wall by the Victoria Theatre—I said nothing to them, but the prisoner said to me, "What girl did you hit"—I turned round and said, "You are making a mistake, we are not talking about you; you are labour<lb></lb>ing under a great mistake altogether," with that I had a blow in my eye, and before I could recover myself, I had another, which knocked me on to my knees—on getting up to run after a policeman, I saw Tyndall strike my wife—when I came back with a policeman, he and the other man had gone—my wife had a black eye and her mouth was cut—there was a lamp opposite—there was sufficient light for me to see the prisoner's features—I knew him directly I saw him again—I am quite sure he is the man who struck me and my wife—I had seen him before.</p>

I was with the two previous witnesses on the night in question, we met the prisoner and another young gentleman—I have not seen him since—neither of the persons with me said a word to the prisoner—he said to Mr. Bowers, "You will not hit that girl"—Mr. Bower's said, "What girl?"—he said, "That girl going down there"—Mr. Bowers said, "I was not going to hit any girl," and Mrs. Bowers said, "You are labour<lb></lb>ing under a great mistake"—he said, "No, I am not," making use of im<lb></lb>proper language—he then hit Mr. and Mrs. Bowers—I turned round to look for a policeman, but could not see one—when I came back I did not see either of them, but I saw a female hit Mrs. Bowers in the mouth—I was not hit—the prisoner is the man who struck Mr. and Mrs. Bowers—I am quit sure of him.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Holywell-street, Strand. On the 1st of June I had a watch on my mantel-piece—I saw it safe between five and six o'clock—a young man named Coombs came to my house on that day, with the prisoner—I did not know the prisoner before—I afterwards missed my watch—this is it.</p>

                  </hi>. I lodge with the prisoner, at No. 118, Great Titch<lb></lb>field-street. I went with him on the 1st of June to Mr. Tyler's house—two or three days previous I had changed a watch, and sent to Mr. Tyler to ask him to lend me one, while he was regulating mine—I asked the prisoner to walk with me—Mr. Tyler asked me into the room—I said I had a friend outside; he told me to ask him in, which I did—we went into the parlour and stopped supper—while there, the prisoner took this watch off the mantel-piece, and asked if it was not mine; and I said, it was but I thought they would think him meddling—I took it and put it on the mantel-piece again—we staid till half-past eleven o'clock; and then Mrs. Tyler asked if we would sleep there, and we said no—we got up and started off home—we went to work the next day—in the evening I had occasion to go into the City, and called on Mr. Tyler to see if he had regulated the watch—he said he had missed the watch from the mantel-piece—I said no<lb></lb>thing to the prisoner that evening—in the morning I got up and searched the prisoner's pockets, and found the duplicate of the watch pledged the day previous—the prisoner was not quite sober when we were at the pro<lb></lb>secutor's house.</p>

I picked it up, the 1 l. note was still in the pocket - all four were together. The prisoners were afterwards apprehended. I am certain they are the men.

            . I am landlord of the Bell, public-house. I saw the prisoners at my house - the coat was on the screen. They went away without paying their reckoning. Annison was in their company. I went to the bar, and all in a hurry I saw two or three go out, in haste, Dalton followed and returned with the coat. Godfrey, Johnson, and Annison came back afterwards, and asked for another pot of beer. I refused to draw it. Annison left almost directly. Dalton charged them with stealing his coat. Johnson denied it - the others said nothing - there was no constable near to send for. Johnson and Godfrey staid till eleven o'clock, and had nothing to pay there reckoning.</p>

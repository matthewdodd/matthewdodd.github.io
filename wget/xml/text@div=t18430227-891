                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker, and live in Drury-lane. On the 24th of Feb. the prisoner brought a ring to my shop and asked if it was gold—he described a young man—I went outside, and saw the prisoner there, answer<lb></lb>ing the description—I called him in, and asked if the ring was his pro<lb></lb>perty—he said, "Yes," that he had brought it from Wiltshire—I gave him into custody with it.</p>

                  </hi>. I conduct the business of my father, at the Edin<lb></lb>burgh Castle, in the Strand. This is my ring—I had it on my finger on the 16th of Feb., and, as usual, on going to bed, I took it off my finger, and put it on the dressing-table—next morning, about eleven, when I was going to dress, I could not find it, and inquired among the servants, the prisoner was employed there on the 16th assisting the cellarman—I might have taken the ring off to wash my hands in the course of the day in the kitchen, which is near where his work is—it fits me too well to fall off—the prisoner ceased to attend the house on Sunday, the 19th—I did not ask him about the ring—he must have seen me wear it.</p>

I was knocked down by a fist - I was hurt in more places than one; I received a blow in my face, my arm and breast were also bruised - I was rendered insensible at the time. When I came to myself I found a crowd collected round me, and requested that I might have assistance home. I got home to Wellington-street, Goswell-street, about eleven o'clock, but was detained sometime at the watch-house for a coach. I was quite alone, and had given offence to no person. When I got to the watch-house I found I had lost my hat and a pocket-book containing a check on Messrs. Barclay and Co., drawn by Messrs. Wyatt and Son for 4 l. 4 s. 6 d. I caused notice to be sent to the bankers' before the house was open in the morning, and saw the check next day at the Mansion House. I cannot say I was perfectly sober, but could go home very well.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Were you not very drunk - A. I was not - I knew what I was about as well as I do now. M'Combie went home with me - I got to bed myself without any person's assistance. The check was dated in February, I do not remember what day. My own name was endorsed on it; it was in my pocket-book when I was knocked down.</p>
               <p>DAVID M'COMBIE. I am street-keeper of Houndsditch. On the 18th of April, between eight and nine o'clock at night, I was nearly opposite Aldgate church, a boy said some person had been robbed; I ran down, and found the prosecutor most dreadfully cut and all over blood - he was standing up without his hat, and a mob round him. I conceive this to have been about twenty-five minutes before nine. I took him to the watch-house, and found 22 l. in his breeches-pocket. He was rather fresh, but still sensible - he remained there till ten o'clock, I then took him home in a coach. He spoke quite reasonable; and complained of losing his pocket-book, with a check for 4 l. 4 s. 6 d. on Messrs. Barclay and Co., and gave orders to his wife to stop payment of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you ask if he was robbed, or did he tell you - A. Immediately as I came up he said he had been robbed, but did not describe the parties. I asked him if he had been seen by any girls? as he was near where girls walk. I found him opposite St. Mary Axe. I took him to the watch-house for protection.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not said that you went home with him because he was so drunk - A. No doubt I have, and I said on account of the state he was in I doubted whether he had lost a pocket-book at all. The place he was robbed at is farther down than where the women frequent.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How do you know where he was robbed - A. I saw him coming up for a good way farther down. He was quite sensible to know what he was about.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Could the bruises on his face have arisen from the fall - A. No, it must have been from personal violence.</p>

            . I am clerk to Messrs. Barclay and Co. On the morning of the 19th of April orders were given to stop payment of a particular check, and about eleven o'clock, or ten minutes after, the prisoner brought the check and presented it to me. I asked him of whom he received it? he said he received it of a person, whom he would fetch. Wishing him not to suspect there was any reason for questioning him, I told him it was a good one. I said to the person next to me,</p>
               <p>"This is the check which is stopped" - the prisoner might have heard it. He was requested to walk to the back of the house, he did so, and I remained at my station. We sent to the prosecutor - Mr. Higgins, of the firm of Messrs. Hale and Co. came - an officer afterwards came. I marked the check before it left my hand, and delivered it to the officer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was not his first question,</p>
               <p>"I want to know whether this is a good check" - A. It was not. After saying he would fetch the person, he said,</p>
               <p>"I hope it is not forged;" I said it was good.</p>
               <p>JOHN BROWN. I am an officer. I was sent for to Messrs. Barclays'. I received the check and produce it; it is dated the 15th of February - I took the prisoner into custody there; he told me he took it of a man whom he had dealings with for some goods; that he did not know his name, nor where he lived, but if I would go with him he would be at his house by twelve o'clock. I took him to the Mansion House, and sent an extra constable, named Esketh, to his house - according to the direction he gave it was No. 2 or 8, at the bottom of Lemon-row, Lemon-street, Goodman's-fields; this was about eleven o'clock in the morning - Esketh returned to me at the Mansion House about one. I went there myself about four o'clock - it is a small private house with two rooms; the lower window was shut up, and a girl was going out - no business whatever appeared to be going on. He produced a publican from Rosemary-lane at his examination, and at his request he was examined.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You went to the house some hours after he was apprehended - A. Yes; no name was on the door.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you find any goods in the house - A. None packed up - I found a piece of calico and some waistcoating, and binding for bed furniture; also a pair of womens' shoes, in different drawers. He said they were the goods he sold for the check, and that he had sold several of the waistcoat-pieces before to some other people, and had been taken in with them.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the evening of the robbery, from four o'clock in the afternoon till eleven o'clock at night, with the exception of a few minutes, I was at one house. I got up on the following morning at-half-past seven o'clock. Having quarrelled with my wife we were separated, and I had a girl to mind the house. I went into Brick-lane for my father, who I do business for. I have been in the habit of purchasing rope from the ships in the docks, and on this morning I received the check from a man whom I frequently sold rope to before. He<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182005170023"></xptr>came to my house - my father is very ill, and does not attend to business. I returned that morning to breakfast, the girl told me the man had been, and while I was at breakfast he came and asked if I had any rope? and said he had bought some a day or two before - he said he wanted half a hundred weight. I had the linen, waistcoat-pieces, and shoes on the sideboard; he bought them of me for 2 l. 4 s., and asked if I could give him the difference of a check? I said I would ask my father if he would take it. I went and saw my father at breakfast, he said he would not take it. Being anxious to sell the rope I asked my sister to lend me a pound or two; she could not, but advised me to go to Mr. Wright, the baker - he was not at home, but his wife advised me to go to the banking-house to enquire about it. I left the man whom I took it of at the corner of the Minories, and went to the banking-house - it was the first check I ever presented, and went to the wrong counter. I laid it on the counter, the gentleman said,</p>
               <p>"Who presented this check?" I said</p>
               <p>"I did, I will thank you to inform me if that person keeps cash at your house." He said it was a good check, and I was asked to walk backwards. When at the Mansion House I asked Mr. Wolley to state the exact time he was robbed, he said ten o'clock, and M'Combie corrected him. I proved I was at a different place.</p>

            . I am clerk to Messrs. Barclays, and was at the counter when the prisoner presented the check. I did not hear the conversation between him and Mr. Dunford; the conversation I heard was between him and Mr. Barnes, another clerk. He presented the check to Dunford, who spoke to Barnes, and desired him to introduce the prisoner to one of the principals. I went into the inner room soon after, and asked him how he came by the check? he said he received it of a man who came to the house that morning to purchase some articles in which he dealt, that he called a second time, and he not being conversant with checks, was not willing to part with the goods till he ascertained that it was a good one, and that he had desired the man to come again in about two hours for the goods. The prisoner said he hoped the check was not forged, I said it was not, and he expressed himself much relieved. I told him a person had been robbed the preceding evening, and it would be necessary that he should assist in tracing the delinquent, which he expressed himself ready to do. I kept him in conversation till Brown came. He said he was unwilling to take any check, and particularly one that was dated so far back.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did he tell you the man came with him to the corner of the Minories - A. No. I think he said something about having shewn it to his father.

            . I live at No. 2, Dock-street, Rosemary-lane, and am the prisoner's sister. On the morning he was taken up he came about nine o'clock to my father's house, and asked him to cash the check - my father looked at it, and noticed the date; it was the 15th of April, and this was on the 19th.</p>
               <p>Q. Take time to recollect yourself; what was the date of the check - A. It was the 15th of April - I do not positively say so. My father said he would not take a check of anybody, unless he knew them. It was for 4 l. 4 s. 6 d. I could swear to the check if I saw it. He then asked me to lend him some money, as he had sold goods and wanted the change. I advised him to go to Wright's. He went away. (Looks at the check) - this is it, I am sure. I was mistaken in the date.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You are positive that is the check - A. Yes, I noticed it. My father is not here - he is ill - he is scarcely out of bed two days together. He was in bed this morning.</p>
               <p>Q.He can get up early - A. He is obliged, as he cannot afford to lay abed.</p>
               <p>Q. When was he out last - A. On Monday. He deals in coals, and buys rope at the Docks.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your mother at home when he brought the check - A. Yes, she was in the shop.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Your mother knew of his bringing the check - A. Not till after he was taken. My father was at breakfast in the parlour behind the shop. My mother was busy, and saw nothing of it. My brother said he had sold the rope to this man. He kept a little servant girl about twelve years of age, she left the day after he was taken, as his wife came from the country. He only kept a servant when his wife was out.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182005170024"></xptr>Q. Will you swear you saw him playing an hour before he was in the taproom - A. I do.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. The sun set at seven o'clock, do you mean to swear that people were playing in your skittle-ground for two hours after that - A. People were playing. He did not go away to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. You have sworn you did not lose sight of him - A. I did not to my knowledge. My reason for remembering it is because I had a precept served on me between nine and ten o'clock to attend at Hicks's Hall, and he was in the taproom then. The people played for porter, and I took it to them. The prisoner payed for three or four pints. I went to the Mansion House at the first and second examination, which was three days after the 18th I believe. I do not know whether it was one, two, three, or four days after - it was not the next morning, I think.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How many days before you had to attend Hicks's Hall was the process served - A. I had to attend next day, but did not go, for I was ill, and continued ill a day or two.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you could not have been at the first examination - A. Yes, I was. I read his examination in the newspaper, and his sister told me of it. I really do not recollect when I first heard of it - there were only two persons in my taproom.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell the names of any other persons who were in the skittle-ground - A. There were Thorpe, Lloyd, and Piper. They are carmen who use the house.</p>

            . I am a carman, and generally use Gavill's house - I live within two doors of him. I did not hear of the prisoner's being apprehended for eight or ten days afterwards; Gavill was the first person that spoke to me about it. I then remembered having been in company with the prisoner in the skittle-ground on the 18th. I am quite sure it was the 18th, for I earned 3 s. 4 d. that day.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that an uncommon thing - A. Yes. I had to give three months credit for the money; I went to Gavill's about half-past five o'clock; a man named Davis, and Green, Lloyd and the prisoner were there - the prisoner was not out of my sight till I left the ground, which was about a quarter before nine o'clock. I then went into the house, and he also went into the house with Green and Lloyd. I staid there a short time, and then went to look at my horses - it was neither dark or light.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was the prisoner committed when Gavill spoke to you - A. I cannot say - it was between light and dark when we went into the house, but I am sure there was daylight enough to see a man's face. I left the house in about ten minutes, it was hardly light then. It was as light as when I came into Court now - (quarter-past nine o'clock.)</p>
               <p>Q. If anybody told you that you were playing two hours after sunset, you would say that was false - A. I do not say I should. It wanted about ten minutes to nine by the taproom clock when I went in.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was there any light in the taproom - A. Two candles.</p>
               <p>Q. How much does it cost to keep a horse and cart - A. About one guinea a week. I keep four carts.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you think 3 s. 4 d. a great deal to earn - A. Sometimes I earn nothing - I remarked in the skittle-ground that I had earned 3 s. 4 d. I frequently saw the prisoner there.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Gavill tell you - A. He said Davis was apprehended for robbing a gentleman, that was all he said.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how came you to know it was on Tuesday the 18th, when he mentioned no day - A. He said no more. It was mentioned at Gavill's house four days after that it was Tuesday, the 18th - Green and two or three others mentioned it, they said they believed the man was there at the time, and I said I knew he was; Green said he could not tell what he was taken up for. I remember I had carted a puncheon of rum that day, looked at my book, and saw it was the 18th; Green said he had seen it in the paper, but he did not know what it was for - he did not know what he had robbed him of. I could not walk from Gavill's to the bottom of Houndsditch in five minutes. I should think it would take fifteen.</p>

            . I am a carman; I have often seen the prisoner at Gavill's. Gavill told me of his being taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Gavill himself tell you - A. Yes, some men were talking about it in his house, he was one, and asked me if I remembered playing at skittles with him? I did not at first recollect the day, but I remembered having loaded cork that day, went to my book, and found it was the 18th of April. I had carried six bundles of work for Pickford's in Fore-street, and I had carried none there for two years before. I went to Gavill's about half-past five o'clock that day, and played at skittles; I played three rubs with the prisoner, and left the ground at dark, I should think it was very little after eight o'clock - we could not see to play. I believe I left the prisoner on the ground - I went out at the side door, and stood at the front door which leads into the house. I stood there about twenty minutes, then went in, and sat talking to the prisoner and others in the house - he was smoking his pipe, and sat on my left hand, four others sat on my right. I remained there till near ten o'clock; the prisoner was not out of my sight long enough to have gone to Houndsditch - I should think it would take him twenty minutes or half an hour.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was he in the ground when you went - A. He was. I did not see him leave the ground, for it was so dark.</p>
               <p>Q. Might he not have gone to Houndsditch during the twenty minutes you was at the door - A. He must have passed me to have gone out.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after the 18th was it that Gavill talked about this - A. About a fortnight after. Lloyd and I were present when he spoke of it, but Press was not; I think he said he was taken up for a check - he did not tell me that he had been to the Mansion House about it. I never read about it in the newspaper, nor never told any one that I had.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. You frequent the house, and do not particularly notice the company in the room - A. No. Press never read the newspaper to me. Nobody ever told me they read it in the newspaper.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You frequent the house - A. Yes, most every evening. I heard nothing of this for a fortnight after. When Gavill told me of it, he said it was on the 18th of April.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182005170025"></xptr>Q. What did you get for carrying the cork - A.6 s. 8 d. - it was a bad day's work. I saw Lloyd there, but heard nothing about what he had earned. Press did not say what he had earned, I am sure of that - he said nothing about 3 s. 4 d. I went to the house almost every evening. I left the skittle-ground a little past eight o'clock.</p>

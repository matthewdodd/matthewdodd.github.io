The watch was on our mantle-piece in the parlour, at the end of the shop - it was silver gilt, and had a gold seal, and two keys to it; one metal and the other gold; they are worth 5 l. together. On the 29th of July, I saw it safe at half-past twelve o'clock, and about one the prisoner came in to enquire about a first floor we had to let; he had been twice before, on the same business. I am quite sure of his person. I shewed him the apartments, of which he approved; he was sometime talking in the parlour. He said he took them for two friends of his in the Bank, and requested me to fetch him pen, ink, and paper, as he had no card in his pocket. I went into the counting-house, (which joins the parlour) for it; I left him alone - I was absent about a minute, and as I returned, he met me, and took the pen and ink from me, saying he would not give me the trouble to come into the parlour, and wrote on the card on the end of the counter,</p>
               <p>"Dupree, Nelson-square, Blackfriars-road," and went away. I missed the watch immediately he was gone - nobody but him could have taken it. I am quite sure it was in the parlour when I went for the pen and ink. He was taken into custody on the Monday following.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you leave me in the parlour while you went to see if the rooms were ready for my seeing them - A. That was the first time he came.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask any clerk in the Bank to get you any lodgers - A. Mr. Berwick most likely did. I told him Mr. Berwick would require a respectable reference, and that he knew a Mr. Smith in the Bank.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Berwick. I recollect the prisoner coming after the lodging. I did not know where the watch was. I was informed it was stolen. I went out to look for the man, but could not find him. On the Sunday after, I saw the prisoner in Long-lane, and charged him with stealing the watch - he said I was mistaken in the person; that he had never been in Bishopsgate-street about any apartments. I am certain he is the man. He said he was going to meet a friend in St. John-street, and would satisfy me he was not the person. I walked up that way with him - he then said he would take me to his lodging. He ran away from me, but I took him without losing sight of him. The metal watch key was taken from his person at Giltspur-street, by Taylor. I saw him come to the house the day the watch was stolen, and on one day before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. You saw me the first day I called - A. Yes. I saw you pass through the shop. I was examined before Mr. Alderman Waithman, and did not say I was not at home on the day it was stolen. I was asked why I took such particular notice of him, and said I noticed his shabby hat and boots. When I saw him in Long-lane, he turned into a hair dresser's shop, and disguised himself as I understand. I stopped, and met him coming out. I cannot say whether he saw me, and when we got nearly to the corner of Long-lane, he turned back and ran away on seeing Taylor. I followed, and caught him by Carthusian-street.</p>

            . I am a constable. On Sunday, the 4th of August, between eleven and twelve o'clock in the morning, I was meeting the prisoner - two men were following him; Myers told me to take him into custody; I asked for what; he said he was a thief. I looked behind, and he was running off as hard as he could. I ran to Charterhouse-lane to meet him, and found him in the hands of Myers, and found the watch key on him at the Compter.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was apprehended early in the last vacation, and my time was postponed last Session, for the prosecutrix's convenience, which has deprived me of the important evidence of Dupree and Lawrence, who employed me to take the lodgings. They are now returned to their native country. They would have convinced the Court, I did not introduce myself into Berwick's house to accomplish a premeditated theft; but was employed by them to take the lodging.</p>

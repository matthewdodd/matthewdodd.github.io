               <p>My acquaintance and I were coming down Frog-field: Curchen came running down the field as fast as she could, and said they had been robbed; I saw two men running, I pursued them; M'Loughlin was never out of my sight, I took him; he said, pray, Sir, let me go, I am not the villain that committed the robbery; I asked him why he ran? he said he was afraid of being robbed himself ; all the company said he was one as soon as he was taken; as we were taking him across the field the other three came up; he begged we would let him go; he said he was not the man that committed the robbery; the other three were the men; as they came up they separated, and we took Moore; we had them to New Prison; I went back to see for the pistol, and found it within ten yards of the place where I took M'Loughlin ; this is the pistol (producing it); it was loaded, the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177610160067"></xptr> charge is drawn; it was almost in the path where M'Loughlin had run.</p>

               <p>I was coming from Islington, some people coming along this field laid hold of me; I was walking very slow, a man laid hold of me and said, you are one of them, are you? he asked the people if I was one of them, and they said, no; Edwards said M'Loughlin took his watch out of his pocket, and in the morning he said it was me.</p>

               <p>How long has the prisoner Dickinson lodged with you? - Five weeks; he is a <rs id="t17761016-48-deflabel281" type="occupation">drover</rs>

               <p>What time did Dickinson come in? - About a quarter before six.</p>
               <p>Was it day light or dark? - It was dark.</p>

               <p>How long had it been dark? - I cannot take upon me to say; the candle had been lighted, I believe, about five or six minutes; I supped with them, and went away by eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>How long was you in the house in the whole? - I look upon it when I went into the house it might be about half after five; I went out and came in again; I was there first about a quarter after four.</p>
               <p>How many hours was you in the house? - About two and a half, I believe, in the whole.</p>
               <p>Where was Dickinson when you went away? - He was going to bed, and desired his wife to light up a rush-light to burn all night, because he was going to Smithfield.</p>
               <p>Who was the quarrel between? - Dickinson and his wife; that was before I came; the people came and told me; I have kept a fruit shop in Kirby-street, Hatton-garden, about three weeks.</p>
               <p>Is this house your's or your husband's? - My husband's; I gave the landlord a quarter's warning to let the house at Christmas; I went on Monday about eleven in the forenoon for my money; I saw some men come to the house; I asked them what they wanted? they said some bad people; I told them they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177610160068"></xptr> might go up the house; they did, but took nobody; Dickinson was then at breakfast with his wife; he went up to the justice's to see what was the matter, and being in a public house he was taken.</p>
               <p>You heard what was the matter? - They said it was for a robbery the night before in the New-road at about seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Did you tell them he was in your company at that time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you go and tell the justice that? - No; I did not know it till they had been there.</p>
               <p>Who did you tell he was in your company? - Dinmore who came down to our house to take him; Edwards saw me before I went in, and I spoke to him.</p>
               <p>To EDWARDS. What did Dickinson say before the justice? - Very little, but that he was innocent.</p>
               <p>DICKINSON. They would not let me speak for myself.</p>
               <p>To EDWARDS. Is that true? - No.</p>
               <p>Dickinson called five other witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

            ; we were attacked by three men as I saw.</p>
               <p>Was it dark or light? - It was a fine starlight night.</p>
               <p>Do you know any of the men? - Yes, Moore and M'Loughlin are the men that stopped me; Moore is the man that robbed me.</p>
               <p>Were they armed? - I saw either a sword or a cutlass.</p>
               <p>Which had that? - Moore.</p>
               <p>What did they say to you? - They bid me stand and deliver my money; I gave a 5 s. piece.</p>
               <p>There was no particular mark upon it? - No.</p>
               <p>You are positive Moore and M'Loughlin are two of the men that stopped you? - Yes; Moore was the man that robbed me; they were taken in about five minutes after; Moore had a brown linen apron on.</p>
               <p>Was you present at the taking of them? - I was in the field when they were taken.</p>
               <p>There was a great alarm in the field? - Yes; I was not by when M'Loughlin was taken; I was close by when Moore was taken; he came walking up; he had his apron on.</p>
               <p>Walking up by himself? - Yes; I saw nobody in company with him.</p>
               <p>Was you sober? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who seized him? - I cannot say; when he was taken he said he was not the man that had done the robbery.</p>
               <p>You are positive it was him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You know nothing of Dickinson? - I cannot say that I do; there were three of them, but I cannot say I should know his face again.</p>
               <p>Were any of them standing at a distance? - I cannot say I saw them.</p>
               <p>You was robbed at the same time the other people were? - Yes; I was going to get away and he came up to me.</p>
               <p>You did not see the other people robbed? - No; I was within three or four yards distance of them when they were robbed.</p>

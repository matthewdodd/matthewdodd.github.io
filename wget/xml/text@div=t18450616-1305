                  </hi>. I am in the employ of William Winch, a job-master, of Windmill-street, Westminster. About the 28th Oct., 1843, the prisoner came to my master's, and said he wanted a strong horse to carry a heavy gentleman, a friend of Mr. Harvey Combe—we had a chestnut gelding—I turned it out—the prisoner approved of it, and said he would go and show it to the gentleman—I told him it was twelve guineas a month, if the gentleman hired it, and if he sold it, sixty guineas—in about two houn he brought back the horse, said the gentleman was not at home, and he should require it another time—he came again the same night, and said he should require it in the morning, and I had to send it to Story's-gate by Hurd, one of our men—I did not give the prisoner any authority to sell the horse—he told me it was to go on job, or very likely to be sold—he might not have sold it without consulting Mr. Winch—the next I saw of the gelding was in a stable, near Trinity-mews, in the Borough, on the 30th of Oct., 1843.</p>

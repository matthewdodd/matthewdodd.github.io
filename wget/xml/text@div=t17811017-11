She got up, and went to the window. Hearing a noise again, I got up, and threw up the sash, and saw two men in the street, opposite the house. I called the watch; and then the men went away. As I continued to look out of the window, I saw a head come out of the one pair of stairs. I thought it was Mrs. Caulfield's brother,

The man then looked up, and said, D - n you, you b - h; another word, and I will blow your brains out. He then took hold of the lamp-iron, and went down by it, and went down Buckingham-street. I called the watch, and told him which way he went. In a little time after, he was brought back. I knew him to be the man I saw out of the window, by his voice, when I heard him speak. He had no hat on when he got out of the window, and none when he was brought back. There were some bird-cages thrown down under the window, which were brought in after the prisoner.</p>

               <p>I lodge in the one pair of stairs, at Mr. Slater's. My brother is sometimes with me, and was the night this happened. I slept in the bed-chamber adjoining to the dining-room: it is the back part of the house, but looks into an alley, which is a thorough-fare. About one in the morning, I was alarmed by a noise in the street. I got up, and looked into the alley, but saw nobody. I then heard the noise repeated, and hearing the birds flutter (there had been three in the dining-room), I concluded it must be in our house. Mrs. Jackson came down stairs, and called me, to open the door. The watchmen came up. I gave them the key of the dining-room. They went in, and I followed, and found every thing in the room as I left it, except the birds. I left the dining-room windows down over night, but they were not fastened. One of the window-shutters was to, but not fastened. I put the side window up, where the birds were, but don't recollect putting it down again. I frequently left that window up. There did not appear to have been any violence used, not so much as a pane of glass broke.</p>

               <p>I lodge in the two pair of stairs room, at Mr. Slater's. I got up, on hearing a noise, and saw two men in the street. One of them turned up Off-alley. Then I saw a man get out of the dining-room window, and get down by the lamp-iron into the street. I saw him run down Buckingham-street, and turn up George-street. My sister called, Watch! They pursued him, and the man was brought back. I am sure the prisoner is the man. There was a light in the lamp he got down by, sufficient to distinguish his person.</p>

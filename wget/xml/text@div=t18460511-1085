                  </hi>. I am the son of James Bagley, of Motcomb-street, Pimlico. I am eight years old—on the evening of the 4th of April I met the prisoner in Cadogan-terrace—he asked me to go to the bookseller's, to get two penny sheets of writing paper, and said if I made haste he would give me a halfpenny—he gave me a half-crown—I went to Mr. Caines' shop, and gave the half-crown to him—he made up a paper parcel, and told me to give it to the man that gave me the half-crown—Mr. Caines kept the half-crown, and I went to the bottom of the street—I saw the prisoner, and offered him the paper parcel—he did not take it, but walked on—I beckoned to Mr. Caines, and told him that was the man—Mr. Caines ran and caught him—he asked him if he gave me the half-crown—he said no—I am sure he is the man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bookseller. Bagley came to my shop about six o'clock in the evening, for a sheet of paper, and offered me a half-crown for it—I immediately detected that it was bad—I made up a small parcel of paper to detect the person, whoever gave it him—I told him to take the parcel to the man who gave him the half-crown—he went out with the paper—I followed him—he went towards the prisoner, who was about the centre of the crossing, within sight of my house, about fifty yards from it perhaps—he joined the prisoner, and by the time he got to him I came up to him—I had seen the boy beckon him—I cannot say whether the prisoner made any advance to meet him—I was looking for a policeman—when I came up, the boy and the prisoner were not more than four or five yards from each other—they were having communication—I laid hold of the prisoner, and said, "You have sent this boy to my shop with a bad half-crown"—he said, "No, I did not"—I collared, and led him on towards the top of the street, and on arriving at Mr. Bagley's shop I pushed him in—he sat down on a chair, with his arm resting on a tea canister—he then got up from the chair and ran down the street—Mr. Bagley and I followed him, with a cry of "Stop thief!"—we never lost sight of him—we took him and brought him back to the shop—it all took place within five minutes—the policeman Loveless came, and I marked the half-crown and gave it to him—it had been in my possession—it had passed to Mr. Bagley.</p>

Q.</hi> Your shop is in Halkin-street, is it not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yet—I saw the prisoner at the corner of Motcomb-street, in Lowndes-street—I gave the half-crown to Mr. Bagley in his shop—he examined it in my presence, and showed it to some other persons in the shop—it was not out of my pos-session three minutes—several persons came into the shop when they saw me push the prisoner in—the half-crown was shown about—I marked it before I gave it to the policeman—I had before put it into my waistcoat pocket—I had no other money whatever in that pocket.</p>

               <p>case for the police, and I should send for a policeman—he placed his arm over the tea-canister after he had been there a few minutes, and I heard something drop, which I thought was one of the brass weights—I turned to my wife, and asked if anything had dropped off the counter—we did not find anything till the Friday after, when Terry, who was occasionally employed in sweeping the shop, found a half-crown—the shop had been swept before the Friday, but the canister had not been removed—there were no other canisters by it—it stood in the corner, and was only moved occasionally—Mr. Caines showed me a counterfeit half-crown—I gave it him back again.</p>

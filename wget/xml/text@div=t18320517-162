Three or four days before the beginning of last month I became acquainted with the prisoner at the appartments of Mr. Burger, when he invited me to take a little play - he applied to me to lend him a guitar, which I did several times; at the beginning of April he asked me to lend him one for a night- he was not to pay for it; I did not want him to take it then, as I wanted to clean it, but he took it from a table; he was to return it the day afterwards - two days afterwards he invited me to go to his house in Bath-place; he came in a horse and gig; Mr. Crutz came with him; he saw a very beautiful guitar at my house, worth ten guineas- he said he wished to show it to his Baroness, as she would want to take a lesson very likely, and he invited me to go to Bath-place; I went there to tea - he gave his address "

Yes; he had all three of the guitars in his possession - I leat him one, and these other two were sold; I had not sold him the three, to he paid for in three months; I had not asked him to return the one I left him - I went to a great many pawnbrokers, because I suspected I had got with a set of swindlers; I did stand once where the prisoner now does, but I went out with very great honour; you scolded my wife very much - I was charged with bigamy.</p>

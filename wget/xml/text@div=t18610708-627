                  </hi>. I was formerly an inspector of the V division, and am now employed by the Mint authorities—in consequence of information I received from them, I marked five sixpences and two fourpenny pieces on 21st June last—I gave four sixpences to a man named Girling, and three fourpenny pieces and one sixpence to Yeomans at a coffee-house in the Westminster-bridge-road, about a quarter before 6 in the evening—I sent them to the Rochester Castle beer shop; in about seven minutes Yeomans returned and gave me four counterfeit half-crowns, which I produce—in consequence of that I went to the Rochester Castle, accompanied by other officers—I saw the prisoner France there—Yeomans said to me in his hearing, "This is the man I bought the half-crowns of; I gave him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4 1/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for them"—Girling was in the tap-room at that time, and he came out and said to me, "And I bought seven two-shilling pieces of him, Mr. Brannan, here they are"—he gave me those pieces (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I then seized France, and said to him, "Well, <hi rend="italic">Turfy</hi>" (he is known by that name) "I received instruct<lb></lb>tions from the solicitor of the Mint to mark some pieces of coin in cones<lb></lb>quence of your large dealings in counterfeit coin"—he made no answer—he was then seized by Inspector Bryant and I—he resisted, and we pulled him into the tap-room and searched him—I saw Bryant take out of one of his pockets two half-sovereigns, nineteen shillings, two sixpences, and a three-penny piece, and from the other pocket, five pennyworth of coppers—among that money was the marked money which I had sent in before—all the rest of the money was good—he said his name was William France, but he refused his address—I then took him to the station—he there refused his address again, and speaking to the witness Girling; he said, "I shall plead guilty to this at the Old Bailey; I shall shake hands with you when I come out, and soon stop your wind"—when I first went into the beer-shop I looked through the tap-room window, which looks into the yard, and saw the prisoner Brennan run from the door into a shed in the yard, followed by Sergeant Leather—this is the marked money (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) which I gave to Girling and Yeomans on the evening of 21st; they were taken from France's pocket by Inspector Bryant.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-inspector, G</hi>). On 21st June I accompanied Mr. Brannan from the coffee-house to the Rochester Castle beer shop—I had seen Yeomans and Girling at the coffee-house that same evening, and had seen Mr. Brannan mark some money and give them—Yeomans returned to the coffee-house, and I accompanied him, Mr. Brannan, Sergeant Leather, and other constables to the Rochester beer shop—when we got there I saw France sitting down on a form in front of the bar—Mr. Brannan told him he had been instructed to look after him as dealing largely in counterfeit coin—I took him and searched him in the tap-room—I found a quantity of gold and silver, which I gave into Mr. Brannan's hands as I got it out of his pocket—he resisted very much—among the silver I found in his pocket, were the sixpences and fourpenny-pieces which Mr. Brannan had given to the witness—I saw him pick the marked pieces out—I took France out into the yard, and saw Brennan coming out of the shed with the officer, Leather, who called my attention to a paper parcel, which he said Brennan had thrown down behind the door—I picked it up, and it contained these</p>

               <p>seven counterfeit half-crowns (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I also found another counterfeit half-crown on the ground in the shed—when Leather said Brennan had thrown down the packet, he made no reply—I was at the station when the prisoners were brought there—France made use of some threat to Girling—I do not exactly remember the words.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-sergeant, G</hi> 6). On the evening of 21st June, I accompanied Inspector Brennan and the other officers to the Rochester Castle—when I went in I saw the prisoner Brennan run from the tap-room to a shed in the yard at the back of the house—I went after him and over-took him in the shed—I there saw him throw something down in paper—I pointed it out to Inspector Bryant, and saw him pick it up—I took Brennan in custody, and took him to the station—I found nothing on him.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Police-sergeant, G</hi> 21). I went to the Rochester beer-shop with the other officers on this Friday evening—I went into the yard and shed, and in a large trough which is in the shed I found these three counterfeit crowns (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) wrapped separately in a piece of paper, and also a very largo quantity of strips of paper, bearing the impression of money having been wrapped in them—I went to the station when the charge was taken; it was read over to the prisoners, and France said, "I will plead guilty to this when I get to the Old Bailey; but as for you," shaking his hands at Girling, "I will shake hands with you when I come out and stop your wind."</p>

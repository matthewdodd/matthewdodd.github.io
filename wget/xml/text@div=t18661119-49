                  </hi>. I live at 34, Chalk Farm Road, Haverstock Hill, and am sixteen years old—on Wednesday, the 10th October, I went to the Railway Tavern, kept by Mr. Parry—I live next door—I went for a pint of ale—when I went in the barmaid and Parry were in the bar—Hoskins came in afterwards—I knew him by sight—I had seen him about the neighbourhood—he was a short old man—he asked Parry for half a quartern of gin, with which Parry served him—he put down a two-shilling piece, and said to Parry, "What did you turn me out for the other night?"—Parry said, "For grossly insulting my wife"—some abusive language arose between them, and Parry made a strike at Hoskins over the bar and missed him—he jumped over the bar and knocked him down, and beat his head against the boards with his hands—he did it three or four times, I should say—Hoskins called out "Murder!"—there was a little private bar and a little door, that you can get from one part of the place to the other—there is a bottle and jug department, which divides it—the door was un<lb></lb>done, and I went through there and opened the front door and let Hoskins out—he was dragged out by Parry and Mike, a man who sells apples at a stall outside Parry's house—I opened the door, and let them drag him out—when Hoskins got up he called Parry an abusive name, and Parry slapped his face, and with that he fell down—he slapped him with his open hand as hard as he could—Hoskins called Parry abusive names several times—when he fell Parry went to hit at him, and knocked one of his teeth out with his fist—after that Hoskins tried to get up—while he was trying to get up Parry struck him twice or three times I think, once in the mouth, which bled furiously, where the tooth was knocked out, and</p>

               <p>the other was under the eye—he struck at him with his clenched fists—after that Hoskins did not go in, but waited outside the door and called Parry abusive names—Parry went in—Hoskins's eye was very much swollen, and his collar and necktie was torn completely off, and his mouth was bleeding—he held a handkerchief to it by his left hand—I picked up his tooth that had been knocked out, and gave it to him—I helped him up and fastened his collar and necktie.</p>

It was not me that did it, it was another surveyor that I had with me"—there were two stablemen inside—they sat in the further bar that leads to the coffee-room—I swear that the prisoner knocked the deceased's head against the floor several times—he was going to get up, and the prisoner knocked him down again—I went and opened the door, and he was dragged out by Mr. Parry by one arm and Mike by the other—he laid senseless on the ground then for some time—it was after that that he came to the door and abused Mr. Parry—I first gave this evidence to Mr. Wontner, the solicitor—I do not know the date now—I was examined before the grand jury on Monday—that was the first time I gave public evidence—I have only known the prisoner since he came to the place—I cannot say how long that is—I have not been speaking to my father about this matter—I have not heard him make any offer—he is here if you require him—he saw nothing of this—I know one of the two men that were in the place, not the other—he is an ostler—I do not know his name—I know Rogers, a fish<lb></lb>man—he was not there at all—he was not inside—he was not at the doorway—I believe he had gone on an errand or something—he came up very near as it was over—I told Mr. Wontner that I did not know the names of the two men that were there—he asked me if there were any men there—I told him two, and that I knew one, but not the other—I knew one only by sight—he did not ask me to try to find him out, or point him out—I swear that the prisoner knocked the deceased's head against the floor—he <hi rend="italic">catched</hi> It in his hands like that, and dashed it against the boards like that (<hi rend="italic">with both hands</hi>)—I think I saw Mr. Wontner on the Monday or Tuesday week after the inquest—Mr. Hoskins, the deceased's son, came for me—I was subpoenaed—I knew nothing of the inquest—I was in the City along with my mother and father.</p>

On Sunday evening, the 14th October, I was called to see Mr. Hoskins; he was suffering from great pain in his head; he had a severe bruise under the left eye, and there was extra<lb></lb>vasated blood in the surface of the eyeball itself—his pain was princi<lb></lb>pally in his forehead—he was somewhat rational in his conversation, and apparently attended to business—I continued to attend him until the time of his death, on the 2nd November—from the apparent weakness of his system, I considered it would be as well to see another medical man, and I called in Dr. George—during the last two or three days he was more or less unconscious—sleepy—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—externally there was a bruise under the left eye, with effusion of blood round the ball, a yellowish discolouration of the scalp on the right side on the skin of the head—internally the <hi rend="italic">dura mater</hi> was very much thickened and adherent all over the inner surface of the bones of the skull, and underneath the <hi rend="italic">dura mater</hi>, on the entire surface of the right hemisphere, was a diffused coagulum of blood from the back to the front—the lungs were flaccid and loaded with mucus; the heart was flaccid and loaded with fat—the liver was large, indurated, and presented a nutmeg-like appear<lb></lb>ance on being cut into—the coats of the stomach were thickened and contained a brownish liquid like beef-tea; the kidneys were enlarged, somewhat soft, and enveloped in thick fat; the left kidney on the lower part contained two cists of serum, which burst—they contained about a tablespoonful of serum each; the spleen was healthy—the cause of death was the extravasation of blood on the brain, that might be caused by external violence—when I first examined him his head was sore on the right side, he could not bear any pressure, and there was great heat over the forehead, it was burning to the hand.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do I understand you to speak with confidence that the injury to the head was the cause of death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—when he complained of pain in the first instance it was on the forehead and round the sides, but the clot was at the side, and on the top part of the half of the hemisphere—there was no injury at the top of the head, no bone broken, there was a bruise, not on the top, on the side, one bruise—I should think it might have been the result of one fall—he was a moderately built man, something weighty, not particularly muscular, but well<lb></lb>formed—I should take him to be about twelve or thirteen stone, and about five feet four inches in height; I should call that a moderate height.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Put your hand to where the external injury was that you saw when he was alive? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About there (<hi rend="italic">near the top of the head</hi>)—he could have got that if he had had his head knocked on the ground by falling—if he was taken by the ears or hair, or collar, and his head knocked on the ground, I should think it likely that part would be touched, because the neck would give to a certain extent as he bent over—he might have fallen on that part of his head—his feet would to a certain extent be up in the air for him to do so, but he would fall that way, even if he was struck.</p>

I did not see anything that happened on the Mon<lb></lb>day—on the Wednesday I was standing by my stall opposite Mr. Parry's house; I heard a noise in one of the compartments of the bar—I went to see what it was, and I saw Mr. Parry trying to turn a man out—I opened the door, and the old gentleman was sitting on his latter end on the floor, and Mr. Parry put his hands under his armpits, and lifted him out—when he got; outside he made use of very bad languare, and called Mr. Parry a b—vagabond, and squared up to him in a fight<lb></lb>ing attitude, and Mr. Parry hit him and knocked him down; he then went indoors, he did not strike or kick him while he was on the ground; as soon as he delivered the blow he went indoors—I am quite sure the de<lb></lb>ceased squared up, he did it in that way (<hi rend="italic">in a boxing attitude</hi>)—he squared right up to him—I know Caroline Garrett, I saw her standing by the side of her mother, and my wife was standing at the other side of her mother at the time—there was no one in the bar barring Mr. Parry and the old gentleman when I opened the door.</p>

I live at No. 31, Leonard Square—my husband is a coal-heaver—I know Caroline Garrett by sight—I have spoken to her—I saw her three days after the coroner's inquest—I heard of what occurred at the public-house—I had not heard of the death of the old man before she told me—I and my sister, Mrs. Thomas, were going to Mr. Cook's, the butter-shop, and we met Miss Garrett—she said, "Do you know anything of Mr. Parry's affair?"—I said, "No, not much; did you see it?"—she said, "Yes, I was in there getting some ale"—I said, "Oh"—and she said, "Well, Mr. Parry jumped over the bar and struck at the old gentleman, and then went and bolted the door, and knocked the old gentle<lb></lb>man down and then kicked him"—I said, "Were you in there when he <hi rend="italic">done</hi> that?"—she said, "No, I was outside"—I said, "Then how did you see it?"—she said, "I only go by what the newspapers tell me and what I was told"—I said, "Then you will swear false"—she said, "Never mind; there's plenty of money, because I shall get my dollar a day."</p>

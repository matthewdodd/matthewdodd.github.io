            . I live in Tottenham-court-road. On the 9th of June the prisoner came to my shop and presented a silver milk-pot to sell; she said she lived with a lady in Oxford-street, and during her absence the children had got the milk pot and battered it up, and her mistress sent her to see what I would give for that, and what a new one would cost; I said the old one was worth about 15s., and a new one would be about 2l.; she cried and made a great piece of work - she said she would leave it with me, but it was a very hard case that she should have to pay for what was done by the children.</p>
               <p>FREDERICK HILES. I am an officer. Here is the milkpot, all bent up.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH NUTTALL. This is my property, but it was not in this state.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had to clean the parlour, and I had to move a trunk from one side of the parlour to another; I did not see the milk-pot, and I put it upon it;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110111"></xptr>I knew my mistress was very severe, and I know the property is not hers - it belongs to a man she lives with, who has a wife - I wanted to know what I could get one for, as I knew she would make me pay for it; I asked what he would charge for a milk pot the size of that, he said 2l. but he said," You can sell this for old silver, and it will come to 15s. or 16s." - I said it was a good deal of money to pay, but I would go and ask my mistress to come.</p>
               <p>MR. HUNT. This is broken purposely.</p>
               <p>MRS. NUTTALL, re-examined. Q. Did you make her pay for any thing before? A. Yes; for a baking-dish which I lent her - she was very insolent, and I did keep 2s., and told her when she replaced the baking-dish I would give it her back again; I am a little hasty sometimes.</p>

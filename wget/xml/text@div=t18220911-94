            . I am a potato-merchant. The prisoner came to lodge with me in January. He left me about a month ago. I pressed him hard for money; he said it was not in his power to pay, but that if I chose, he would give me a piece of goods as security. I said I had rather he would leave me some of his furniture; he gave me a pawnbroker's duplicate, and went and transferred the goods, that day, into my name, and left that duplicate with the pawnbroker, and took another in my name; it was satin; he said he had taken it in part for a bad debt. I wanted him to go to the pawnbroker's with me, but he gave me a piece of paper instead.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 5th of September, I accompanied Miles to Mitchell-street, Whitechapel, and found the prisoner there. We asked if he had any duplicates about him; he immediately produced this duplicate out of his pocket. I told him what I came about, but neither threatened or promised him; he said,</p>
               <p>"This is part of Mr. Stanbridge's property." The duplicate was for twenty-one yards of satin, pledged for 2 l. 6 s. 6 d. He said his landlord, Harrold, had taken the ticket of the other part instead of rent. I took him to the office, went to the pawnbroker's with the ticket, and they brought the satin to the office. I found his wife and family in the greatest distress. The prosecutor's house is in the parish of St. Leonard, Shoreditch.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have been a housekeeper in a very respectable way of business for a number of years; but my circumstances became embarrassed. The shortness of time prevents my obtaining gentlemen of the first respectability to my character; the prosecutor, however, can speak to my character for years. I have four children, and my wife expects to be confined every moment with a fifth. I was never charged with any offence, but distress has brought me into this situation, and I trust my great distress will in some measure tend to mitigate my sentence - and implore your mercy towards a penitent man.</p>

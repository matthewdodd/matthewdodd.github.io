On the 1st of July, about half-past five o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came to the warehouse, and asked to see bombazeens - he said he wanted no credit, and we must do them on the lowest terms. He selected three pieces, and said he must have them sent immediately - he put the coarsest piece aside, and said,</p>
               <p>"I'll have the other two first." He came into the counting-house, and gave the name of</p>
               <p>"Bolton and Co., No. 16, Nicholas-lane;" I followed him there with the goods - I found him standing at the door, and seeing Bolton and Co. on the door, I gave them to him; he took them up stairs telling me to wait. I heard him speak to somebody; he then ran down, and said</p>
               <p>"The gentleman wants the other piece, run back as fast as you can for it, and I will pay for all three." I ran back, and on returning found it was an empty house. I did not see him again till he was apprehended. I gave information at the Mansion-house. I met him in the Old Change last Wednesday, and gave him in charge. I have never found the property.</p>

            . I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner, and asked him what he had done with the bombazeens; he said he had pawned them over the water, and he would settle with Mr. Lea for them, if he would allow him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have been in good circumstances, but through unforseen misfortunes have fallen into distress. When I bought the goods I expected to receive money to pay for them, but was disappointed. About six weeks ago, I obtained a respectable situation at Mr. Ferguson's, in the Old Change, and meant to pay for them.</p>

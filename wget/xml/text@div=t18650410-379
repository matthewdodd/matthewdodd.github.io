                  </hi>. Until lately I was in partnership with my brother, Joseph Adnam, and carried on business as spice merchants in Maiden-lane—the prisoner was in our service as traveller—he received a salary of 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—his duties were to take orders and receive monies, and account to me for them—he used to remit a certain amount in the course of the week, and at the end of the journey he made up his book, and handed over the balance—he made use of a portion of the money to pay his expenses, and for his salary during the journey—in June 1864, I received a letter from a customer in the country—I believe the prisoner was then on his journey—when be came home I told him that I had received a letter from Messrs. Walters and Co. of Bristo I, stating that they had paid him an account for which I had applied to them—he said he had received the amount—I asked him if there were others—he said, "Yes, there were two or three others, "and either my brother or I requested him to give us a list—this is the list (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I can't exactly say when I received that from him, but I should think it must have been in October—he had pre<lb></lb>viously told me he thought the amounts he had received were between 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—when he handed me this list I said, "This much exceeds the sum you told me, this represents about 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,"—I asked him to give me a perfect list of the sums he had received—after he gave me that list he continued in the same position, so far as regards the collection of money, but afterwards he represented Messrs. Hicks—I still allowed him to collect my debts—after he left me to go to Messrs. Hicks, I ascertained that that list was not com<lb></lb>plete—this list contains a statement of the amounts which the prisoner had to collect upon his last journey—the writing on the left-hand side, where the amounts are debited, is a clerk's writing, and it was the prisoner's duty to enter what he collected on the right-hand side—Mr. Carter's name is down as a debtor to the. firm for 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—on the opposite side there is an entry of 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the prisoner's writing as received on 31st May, 1864, but that was really paid in a prior journey, and on 31st May he received 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—Mr. Stone is put down as a debtor for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—there does not appear to have been anything collected there—the name of William Candy is down for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and nothing received—I have looked through his book—I do not find any entries of money having been paid by Mr. Stone or Mr. Candy—it was the prisoner's duty to enter the sums received</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What was the prisoner first of all? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He came as an engineer, about eleven years since—he continued in that capacity between two and three years, then a Mr. Hawkins, a traveller, left and the prisoner was placed in his situation—he took four quarterly journeys to the West of England—he had about 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to collect each journey—we first gave him 32<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, and then 35<hi rend="italic">a.</hi>—he was also to have a present of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at Christmas—we paid his expenses—I remember his complaining to me of not having enough for his journeys and expenses, and Calling rather behind—I can't say that that was the first time of his falling behind, because there was a falling behind before be commenced as traveller—he married a second time—I took a mortgage of his wife's property—I found that he was about 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. behind—we were told the mortgage was worth about 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that there was about 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. coming to him—I don't know what the property consisted of—he had received 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—after he had given this security he continued on with me and my brother—our profits did not keep increasing while he was traveller; they kept about the same—he kept receiving about the same amount each quarter—my brother and I ceased our partnership in December last year—the prisoner then continued on with me for some time, until he went to Mr. Hick's, who carries on a similar business—I knew where to find the prisoner—I did not always find him right and regular in his tran<lb></lb>sactions; sometimes there were deficiencies—I did not always call his attention to all the names in the list—I did to some—I used to say why has so and so not paid—I can't swear that I did that with respect to these three sums.</p>

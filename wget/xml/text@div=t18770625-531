I am housekeeper at 4, King Street, Cheapside—Mrs. Montague Barnett has an office there—there are other letter-boxes to the door besides his; his box has a glass face to it—on the morning of 1st June, a little past 8 o'clock, I was cleaning the stairs—I went down and saw what, was in the box—it is no part of my duty to open Mr. Barnett's box—I saw that there were letters in it; I then went upstairs again—about half an hour after one of the office lads spoke to me—I then went downstairs and looked at Messrs. Barnett's bos, and it was then empty—I did not notice whether it was locked or open.</p>

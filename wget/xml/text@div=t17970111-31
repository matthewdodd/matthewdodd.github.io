               <p>Q. Did he take you to that place as being his lodgings? - A. He did; in his box, which he unlocked, I found these four razors, two combs, one pair of plated buckles, and a cork-screw.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jackson. (To Roberts.) Q. Look at those things, and tell me if you know whose property they are? - A. These two razors are my master's.</p>

               <p>Q. You mean to swear to the general mark of those that are in your master's shop? - A. I know them by the private mark.</p>
               <p>Q. By the mark of the price? - A. Yes; we mark them what they cost, and what we sell them at.</p>
               <p>Q. Are these the only marks by which you ascertain them to be your master's? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been in the same business before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you could ascertain your former master's property by the same kind of mark? - A. Yes; the razors that I had given him I left at his lodgings.</p>
               <p>Q. There are no other marks than you have described? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jackson. Q. Whose marks are they? - A. Some are my marking, and some my master's.</p>
               <p>Q. You know his hand-writing? - A. Yes; these other two razors I believe to be his, but I cannot swear to them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Is there any other person in the shop besides yourself? - A. Myself, and my master, and my master's son.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you missed these articles? - A. We had a suspicion of him a long time.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you undertake to say that you have not told these very articles in your shop? - A. I don't believe I ever did, but I cannot tell; he confessed before the Justice that he took them.</p>

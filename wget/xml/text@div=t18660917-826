I am a stevedore, and live at 7, Church Road, Stepney—on the afternoon of 27th August I was on Tower Hill—I saw prisoner go up to the prosecutor—he took something, which I supposed to be his watch—I told the prosecutor he had lost his watch—he said, "I think not"—he felt in his pocket, and found he had—I said, "There goes your watch over the road"—we both went after the prisoner—he took a turning where there was no thoroughfare, and stopped and put the watch down on the pavement—I saw him do it—the prosecutor stopped to pick up the watch—I caught the prisoner, and took him to the station—I never lost sight of him</p>

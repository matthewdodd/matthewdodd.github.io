                  </hi> In July last, I was cook and steward on board the British ship <hi rend="italic">Medina</hi>—she was lying off Lagos, on the west coast of Africa—the prisoner was a seaman on board, and also the deceased Edward Hyland—one of her Majesty's ships, the <hi rend="italic">Medusa,</hi> was lying near us—on 11th July, about 8 In the evening, I saw the prisoner and the deceased lying together on the fore-hatch—I went up and found they were arguing—they were both drunk—Hyland was the worst—he had the <hi rend="italic">hiccups,</hi> and the prisoner said that he was trying to frighten him out of them—I left them, came back in about 10 minutes, and Boland was then standing by the starboad fore-rigging—Hyland was coming across the deck, between the foremast and the foredeck, towards Boland—they were about three yards from one another—Hyland had a broad clasped knife open in his hand—I took hold of him, and said, "For God's sake, do not use your knife"—he threw me away from him—I ran, took hold of him again, and said, "For God's sake, Ned, give me your knife"—he gave it to me, and I threw it away—I cannot say whether it went on deck or overboard—he then immediately struck the prisoner twice in the face with his fist—they took hold of one another, and I saw Boland's right arm round Hyland's waist, with a sheath knife in his hand—that is a knife which is always open—it is about tea or twelve inches long, with a sharp point, and goes into a leather case at the side—it is what sailors generally use—it was unsheathed—the broadest part of the blade was an inch and a half or three quarters—it was not sharp at both edges—I took hold of the prisoner's hand, and tried to get it, but could not—I cried for help and could not get any—the prisoner suddenly jerked his hand away and cut my fore finger—he swore by God that he would not let it go—I went and told the mate, George Farrow—I did not go back with the mate, but I turned round and saw them scuffling in the gangway, and in, a moment I saw Hyland fall on the deck—I had not seen them separate at all—I saw blood where he fell, and went on board the <hi rend="italic">Medusa</hi> for a doctor—a boat was lowered for the purpose, in which the prisoner assisted, and went with me; and as we were going, he said that Hyland had stabbed himself—I came back with the doctor—Hyland was carried into the cabin—the doctor examined him, and I saw that his bowels were out on his left side, and they were hacked in two or three places—there was another stab on his left shoulder behind, pretty deep; and I believe a third wound on his hip—the doctor attended to him, and went away about half-past I that night—he lived to half-past 1 next day—up to this time I had never seen him sick—his age was about twenty-three, I think—they had been on the ship about four months—I had never seen them fighting before, but have seen them arguing a little; a little angry.</p>

                  </hi> On 11th July, I was a seaman on board the <hi rend="italic">Medina</hi>—I saw the prisoner and the deceased quarrelling about 2 o'clock—they got a cask of ale out of the hold, opened it, drank it, and about an hour after<lb></lb>wards, I saw them playing at cards—towards the evening they were sitting on the forehatch—it was getting dark, and they began quarrelling—the prisoner was in liquor, but not so drunk as Hyland was—I was using the prisoner's knife doing something to the rigging—I had it in my hand or 10 minutes—he got up, came to me, and asked me for it—that was about half-past 7; and after the quarrelling began, be went to the other side of the vessel, and I saw him put it into the sheath—I saw them quarrelling afterwards, but I kept out of the way—presently I heard that a boat was being lowered as there was a man killed—the boat was lowered about 20 minutes after I gave up the knife.</p>

                  </hi> I am a surgeon, and have been in practice in London for some years—if a wound is inflicted on the abdomen with a knife, so that the bowels protruded, death would be likely to occur within a few hours; and if the intestines obtruded and were cut, the wound would be fatal within a short time: internal hemorrhage would probably be the cause of death; the perforation of the intestines at that part is of a very dangerous character.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Might the intestine protrude through the external wound without itself being lacerated? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; and on the wound being inflicted, the omentum would be likely to protrude as well as the in<lb></lb>testine; but there is hardly anybody so ignorant as not to know the gut when they see it—the peritoneum has a bright shiny appearance, and sup<lb></lb>posing the intestine in passing through the wound pushed the peritoneum before it and a portion of the omentum, an unpractised eye might mistake it for the intestine itself—I have operated for hernia, and have had cases in which not only the gut, but the omentum protruded—I have seen the omentum protruded in greater proportion than the gut, and perhaps an un<lb></lb>practised eye could not detect one from the other—if the intestine is no lacerated, but merely protruded, and is replaced, the person might recover; it would not be so dangerous: even supposing peritonitis sets in; it is not incurable—a person having received such a wound at this might die hours afterwards or days afterwards from aneurism of the heart or apoplexy.</p>

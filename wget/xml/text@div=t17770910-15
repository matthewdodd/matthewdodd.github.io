               <p>I am a servant to Mr. Wildman; I lost eleven guineas and a gilt shilling out of the drawer in the shop; there were in it nineteen guineas and six shillings; I locked it up at half after eleven; six guineas were marked; as I expected the prisoner to come I got some friends to stay with me; about 5 o'clock the bell rang; the maid let him in; he asked if her master was within; she said he was in the country; he asked where I was; she said I was out; he then asked if Nanny was at home, and said he would go up stairs and see her; I heard him come down and go into the cellar; he came up, and I heard something crack; I looked and saw him on his knee, opening the lock of the drawer; he left the door on the jar and went away; I thought he had heard something that alarmed him; presently he came in with a lighted candle; he put to the door, and unlocked the drawer; he then went into the back shop and I heard no more of him; as I looked through the crack I saw something pass by it, and thought I heard the lock of the door go; on which I rushed out, and found the prisoner at the door; he was going out; I called my friends; we secured him, and sent for constable I found the eleven guineas and a gilt shilling upon him; I examined the till, and there was just that sum missing; there were among them six guineas, marked with a small punch; the money was sealed up and delivered to the constable.</p>

               <p>I am a silversmith: on Saturday evening last Mr. Mardell informed me, he was very uneasy in his mind about the loss of some money, and if I was not engaged he would be obliged to me to spend the afternoon on Sunday with him at Mr. Wildman's house, as he thought he could detect the person; I went, with a friend; he shewed me the manner in which the person must perpetrate the fact, and where he himself was to be concealed; he desired we would conceal ourselves in the chamber, and when he gave a hem we were to come out; at about five o'clock the bell rung; the maid<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177709100023"></xptr> said that was Richard by the ring, meaning the person they suspected; I went into Mr. Wildman's chamber, and I believe Mr. Mardell went into the shop; I heard somebody go down stairs, and soon after I heard Mr. Mardell give two or three loud halloas; I thought he was engaged with the prisoner, and ran immediately down stairs with my friend and secured him; we called in a soldier and another man to our assistance; we sent for a constable, who searched him, and found the money upon him; I saw some of the marked money as it was taken out of his pocket; the money was then sealed up and delivered to the constable Ranking.</p>

               <p>To MARDELL. What situation was you in when you saw the prisoner open the drawer? - We have shutters to secure the compters, and a couple of doors that lock up; I was within the shutters, on the right hand side; the cash was kept on the left hand side; I made an opening between the shutters, so as to have a little crack; I saw him go in and open the drawer.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called several witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

On the 2nd of March, my ship was at Mr. Green's dock at Blackwall - I fell in with the prisoner and another girl, between eight and nine o'clock in the evening - they asked me to give them something to drink; I took them to a public-house, and gave each of them a glass of spirits - the other girl then went away; the prisoner remained - I went with her and had some oysters and a pot of ale; she then asked me to go home with her - I said No. but I would take a lodging; I went, took a lodging, gave 4s. for it, and gave half a sovereign to the prisoner; I went to bed, and in about an hour and a half she awoke me - she said she wanted to go home and suckle her child; I said why did not she tell me that before - she said did I intend to let her out, or she would break the door open; I then put on my clothes, and missed this money and my pocket handkerchief, which had been in my coat pocket - she had some of her clothes on when she awoke me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Are you sure the handkerchief was in your pocket? A. Yes - I did not put it round the prisoner's neck when we left the oyster-shop; I was not quite sober - I had nothing but water on board ship; I had a crown-piece and the small silver in my pocket.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. I took the prisoner into custody in the Commercial-road; I found on her a 5s. piece, a sixpence, one penny, a bad half-penny, a small pencil, and a snuff-box - she gave me the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not she tell you the man had put it round her neck? A. No; she thrust it into my hand, and said, "Put it into your pocket, and say nothing about it;" the prosecutor did not say how much he had lost, nor did he mention about his handkerchief, but I showed it him at the watch-house - he talked about some loose silver besides the 5s. piece.</p>
               <p>GEORGE SMITH. This is my handkerchief.</p>

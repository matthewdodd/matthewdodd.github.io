I have a drawer in my bar with a patent lock to it—I keep the silver in it, which is dropped into it in the course of the day through a space, out of the other tills, every two hours, and at night I empty it, and leave some silver on the sideboard for change—on Tuesday morning, about a quarter after two o'clock, I observed a shilling with a mark on it in the basket and left it there—I left my house that day and did not return till the following evening, Wednesday, when I had informa<lb></lb>tion about a quarter past seven—the basket would not be emptied in conse<lb></lb>quence of my absence, not until the last thing at night—the prisoner was not employed in my house at all.</p>

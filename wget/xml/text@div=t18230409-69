            . I am an officer. On Saturday night, the 15th of March, about half past eight o'clock, I was in the Old Change, I saw four suspicious characters. I saw the prisoner come from behind them with the bed on his back; he was about three minutes walk from Broken-wharf - I stopped him, and asked him what it was - he said it was the same inside as out - I questioned him; he said he fetched it from his master's, and was going to take it home; that his master lived at No. 12, Catherine-wheel-alley. I took him to the watch-house. I went to 12, Catherine-wheel-alley, which is kept by a widow woman, who knew nothing of it. When I returned to the watch-house, I found he had escaped through the bars of the windows; and on Tuesday, at ten o'clock in the morning, I met him with a person I knew, and took him.</p>

I went out to take them in, and I found they were stolen. The shirts were afterwards found on the prisoner. He must have got over the pales.</p>

               <p>On the 8th of this month, about half past six, me and a friend and my little boy were coming across the fields, and we discovered three men by Bishop Bonner's castle; two were right upon us, and another about twenty yards distance, with a bundle; they passed us, and we got up with them again; and they enquired the way to London; we told them: they passed us again afterwards. We came up with the prisoner, and asked him where he was going, he said to Bethnal Green, and that he did not know any thing of the other two; we watched him past Bethnal Green, and then we had suspicion; I charged him, and he said he had got some shirts his father had sent him; I took him by the collar, and found the four shirts all of a heap, froze up; I sent for an officer, and after taking the marks, I delivered him the prisoner and the shirts.</p>

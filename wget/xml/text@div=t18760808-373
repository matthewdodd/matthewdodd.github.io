I am a painter, of 45, Pawson Street, Lewisham—I am a widower, and have three children, Charles Guthrie is one of them; he is three and half years old—the prisoner has been cohabiting with me—on 26th June, at 9.30 p.m. I went out, leaving her at home with one child, Charles—she was recovering from drink when I left and quarrelling with a neighbour next door, Mrs. Davis—I was called home and went with my child to the hospital.</p>

I am surgeon of the Seamen's Hospital, Greenwich—on 26th June the child was brought there at 11.55 with a wound an inch deep on his throat, extending across the front of the neck 4 inches from end to end, and extending down to but not into the wind-pipe—there was profuse bleeding—there was also a slight wound, very little more than a scratch, in front of the right shoulder—he was in danger for several days—some small arteries were severed, but neither of the carotid arteries—he was in the hospital nearly a mouth and has recovered—both wounds could have been inflicted by this knife—the child was quite unconscious when he was brought in, from loss of blood.</p>

I do not remember how I did it. That is all.</p>

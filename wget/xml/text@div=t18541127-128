                  </hi>. I live in Maypole-alley, High-street, Southwark; I am a bell hanger. On Wednesday evening, 15th Nov., between 6 and 7 o'clock, I went into M'Enoff's house, which is opposite to mine—I there saw my cousin Kelly, and Frances M'Enoff, and John M'Enoff—I was given in charge for a deserter, but I found it out, and I went into their house, and I said to John M'Enoff, that he was b—deceitful for informing against me—Kelly was cleaning some knives—she had some knives in her hand, and I suppose she thought I came in for a <hi rend="italic">row</hi>—she <hi rend="italic">up</hi> with a knife, and stabbed me in the lip—the husband of the young woman put his hand round me to hold me, and Frances struck me in the head with a knife; that wound bled—I do not know; I suppose he was trying to take his wife away—he struck me several times with a soldering iron, made out of a penny piece—he was trying to keep his wife and daughter away—I do not wish to press the charge against him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was that all that happened? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he struck me with the sol<lb></lb>dering iron about the arms, but only I dare say to keep away his wife; I tried to get away—I went down stairs and hallooed out, "Murder!"—I cannot recollect in what state I was, when I came down—I was taken to the hospital—I cannot tell how long I was there; I ran away, and got them out of gaol in the morning—this is the man that has got a family of children, and never had a key turned on him—I am a soldier and have got to go to fight the Russians, and if you will let us shake hands and make it up I will go and fight the Russians—would I have the curse of a family of children in my breast?—this is not the wound they gave me in my face—I hit that against the bed post since.</p>

               <p>morning she said the children disturbed her, and she wished to sleep in the kitchen—I had a bed made up for her there, upon a sofa—I went to bed about twelve o'clock that night—the prisoner was then in the kitchen—she looked out to see if we were gone up stairs, and then shut her door—about half-past five or six in the morning I heard her call out to my son, who slept in the attic, "Edwin, give me my gown," and her voice seemed very tremu<lb></lb>loos—my husband went down after six, and came back and told me something—I then went down and found the bureau had been opened—I missed six dessert-spoons, two gravy-spoons, six teaspoons, a musical snuff-box, two gold breast-pins, and other articles, and some plated forks, from a plate-basket—I had seen those things safe the evening before—the table-spoons and tea<lb></lb>spoons bad been in use—I found that the prisoner was gone and had taken all her thing' with her—I did not see her again till she was in custody—she had not expressed any dissatisfaction with her situation.</p>

I came down stairs about half-past six, and found the prisoner was gone—I missed some woollen cloth from the back kitchen, and the plate from the basket in the front kitchen—I had left the street-door fastened over night—it has one of Chubb's locks—I found it closed, as usual, in the morning—it fastens by the catch—anybody from the inside could get out, but it could not be opened from without—I heard the prisoner about the house as late as half-past five in the morning, but not after that.</p>

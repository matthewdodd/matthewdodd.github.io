About one minute; I was very much alarmed, and a lady opposite gave me information; in consequence of which I went after the prisoner; I called to her, and beckoned her, and then she run away; I followed her into a house up one pair of stairs, and there I catched her by her gown; I took the woman in one hand, and the cloak in the other; I brought her into the street, and delivered her to the constable, with the cloak.</p>

               <p>"My Lord, with the greatest deference to your Lordship, and this honourable Court, before whom I stand, I humbly address myself. The offence of which I stand accused, I am innocent of, as I never saw the property till I saw it in my prosecutor's hand; my prosecutor offered my father to make it up for the sum of three guineas, which my father, being but a poor working man, could not give him; and now have nothing to depend upon but your Lordship's justice and mercy; the prosecutor's wife struck me several times, without giving her any provocation. As I am innocent, I trust to your Lordship, and the laws of my country, being quite ignorant, and unable to speak for myself. I remain, with the utmost respect, your Lordship's obedient and very humble servant."</p>

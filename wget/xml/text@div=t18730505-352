I live at 7, Edward Street, Stepney; the prisoners lodged with me—there is a yard attached to the house, but they had not the use of it—on the evening of 23rd December, about 6.45, William Palmer rode a light chestnut horse with a star on his forehead into the yard—it was about 13 or 14 hands high, and had a saddle and bridle about 11.45 at night, I saw them take the horse out of the yard in Mr. Bootle's cart, my opposite neighbour—James Palmer was driving, and William was leading the horse by a halter—I don't know what the prisoners are; they have been living with me seven weeks or two months.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Crouch; I sent for the officer on the 12th of July; about eight in the evening, I was taking the things down from the door, the prisoner came in, I saw her looking at some gowns hanging in the shop for sale, I missed a poplin gown; I went to the door, and saw the prisoner going along with the gown under her arm, part of the gown hung below her cloak; I brought her back with the property on her, I did not see what was in the bundle; the constable took her to the Compter, and there he searched her. (The silk gown was produced in Court).</p>
               <p>Mr. Purse. It is mine, I know it from the trimming of it; the officer found my private mark on the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Clarke. There was a ticket on the gown when I apprehended her. (Producing it).</p>
               <p>Mr. Purse. This is my own hand-writing, it is a ticket I pinned on the gown myself.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I bought the silk gown of a woman who had bought it, and had it to sell again.</p>

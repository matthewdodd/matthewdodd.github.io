I am a weaver, and live at 9 1/2, Hope Street—on 22nd February, about 1.50 in the day, I was in Spicer Street, coming along to Brick Lane—something seemed to pass my face and made me feel giddy—I was then met by the prisoner and two others—I was pushed against the wall, and I saw Kingston's hand go to my pocket—he took my watch and chain—I was held down by the other two, and was nearly strangled—I can't say that Buck was one of the two men that held me—my watch was worth about 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—my senses were nearly gone, and how I received the cut on my eye I can't say.</p>

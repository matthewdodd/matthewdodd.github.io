He made me no reply, but said, what do you want, let go; I had not observed any other persons than these two; I then observed Levi coming out of the window; as soon as he was out, he said, in Hebrew, hush, let me go, we are Jews, you know me; I said, I did not care, and went, in order to get to the gate; Simmons pushed me backwards, against the wall, where the gates were fixed to; I am sure it was Simmons; by the force of Simmons's push I received a blow on the back part of my head; I then called out murder, several times, on that

Levi then turned back, and squared up to me, and said, what do you want? by that time my master had opened the door, and come out to my assistance, with the poker in his hand; my master said, Micke, what is the matter; I went into the house, and shut the gate; and I went into the parlour, in order to shut up the shutters, and my foot kicked against one of the chandeliers; they had been left, when I went out, on the back part of the mantle-piece; and I found them on my return close to the window, where Simmons was standing.</p>
               <p>Are you certain as to all the prisoners? - I knew them all before; I have known two of them this nine or ten years.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Prisoners Counsel. Is this a private house, or a shop? - A private house in Mansell-street, Goodman's-fields.</p>
               <p>This street is a very public one? - Not very public.</p>
               <p>At what time was it this happened? - About a quarter after five; about dusk.</p>
               <p>You say on your first coming, and seeing a man come out of your master's inclosure, you was very much alarmed? - I should not have been much alarmed, if I had not known him; I was so alarmed, I was not myself till I went to bed; I trembled for most of the whole night.</p>
               <p>Then from that time, till you went to bed, you trembled for most of the whole night? - I trembled for about half an hour.</p>
               <p>How am I to understand you; first you trembled till you went to bed, and then that you trembled for about half an hour; what effect had it on you? - It was a fright, and a shock.</p>
               <p>Was it so considerable as to hurt you very much; did you find it had a very considerable effect on you? - Yes; any body might be alarmed at seeing a thief come out.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath was you very much alarmed? - I said, I was frightened but not very much.</p>
               <p>You have said you felt the effect of the fright, for half an hour? - When I found I had lost nothing, I was more easy.</p>
               <p>Till that time then you was frightened? - I was frightened, but not very much frightened; I was then a little more easy than at first.</p>
               <p>And yet you continued in a state of alarm, for half an hour; what kind of a night was this; was the moon arose? - No, it was not.</p>
               <p>Then not the lighter for that? - No.</p>
               <p>How long did this continue before these persons made their escape? - From the first beginning, it might be about three minutes.</p>
               <p>You tell us when you laid hold of the man, you suppose to be Simmons, you said, you villain, what do you want here; you did not say, why Simmons, I know<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179002240067"></xptr>you; you never called him by his name? - No.</p>
               <p>But yet in the struggle, your head was against the wall, and in your struggle your fright did not at all lessen? - I cannot say any thing, either one way or another, to that; I do not know it increased.</p>
               <p>At first when you came up there was but one? - I shut him out.</p>
               <p>Yet your fright did not increase, when there were three? - No, I do not know it did.</p>
               <p>I think you said, that Marks came back, and on your crying out, he came and asked you, if you wanted help? - Marks did not lock it after him.</p>
               <p>When did you attend at Bow-street? - On Monday night.</p>
               <p>When did this happen? - On Saturday.</p>
               <p>And at Bow-street you found that all the three persons had come voluntarily to the office, knowing themselves to be innocent? - On Monday morning my master and I went to give information.</p>
               <p>Did not you then hear, that these three men had been at the office, hearing their names had been called in question, and they came to answer to it? - Yes; Mr. Townsend told me so.</p>
               <p>How long before had you been in the parlour? - I had just shut up the shutters of the back parlour.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp, Counsel for Levi. Mr. Levi, do you know a brother of the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you never seen either the prisoner or his brother, at Clapton? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you never said to any body, since the apprehension of Levi, that you thought the prisoner Levi was innocent, and you was mistaken in him? - No; I never did.</p>
               <p>Did not you acknowledge this, that at the time some prisoner, of the name of Marks, entered, it put you into such confusion, that you did not know the man of the name of Levi? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. GOLDSMID sworn.</p>
               <p>How long has this last witness lived with you? - About a year, or a year and two months.</p>
               <p>What is his character? - I should not have taken him for a servant, if I had not heard a very honest character of him, and I hope I shall find it so. (The chandeliers produced and deposed to.) I sent my servant on the 24th of January, on a message, to Prescot-street, which joins very near Mansell-street; he was not out about five or ten minutes; on his return I heard a great noise; there is a small yard between my gate, and the iron rails: I heard a cry of murder! I concluded something was wrong, and went out with a poker; my door stuck fast, and as it was wet weather I thought somebody held it to prevent me from coming out into the yard; afterwards my servant rung the bell; I came to the door again, and said, Micke, what has happened; says he, I will go and see what is lost; I went to the left hand parlour, and he had shut up one shutter, and carelessly left the other open: I found one of these chandeliers near the window, and the other not far from it, on the floor: the following day I went to give information to Sir

               <p>I am a master weaver; I live in Bell-court, Spitalfields: I saw the prisoner Levi at the Plow in Cox's-square; it was last Sunday four weeks; he and two more Jews were drinking in a box opposite to the fire; I went in at near five, and staid there till near seven, when I left the prisoner there.</p>
               <p>How came you to recollect the day? - I went in on the Tuesday following, and the prisoner's wife asked me if I could recollect the man who sat there; and what made me recollect it, was because they were looking at his waistcoat; and the Jews were disputing whether it was kersimere or cloth; I was in company with Brett; he was in company with two other Jews.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Was the landlord there; what is his name? - His name is

               <p>Who was there else? - There is an uncle that helps, a boy and a maid.</p>
               <p>I want to know how you came to be so particular as to the day; how came you to fix your attention upon him? - Why, I told you concerning hearing them disputing whether his waistcoat was cloth or kersimere; because it is common for Jews to examine one anothers clothes, and even our hats.</p>
               <p>Then, if it is common, what is there remarkable in the circumstance, for to excite your attention, so as you should remember it perfectly? - So it is with Jews.</p>
               <p>How long did you see him before? - About two or three days before.</p>

               <p>I know the prisoner Levy: about a month ago, I recollect seeing him at the sign of the Plow, at about half past four in the day; he staid there till almost eight in the evening; I saw him there all the time; he was shewing a waistcoat; and there was a kind of a dispute whether it was cloth or kersimere; I am sure it is the same person; I have seen him two or three times before; I went in with Mr. Reynolds.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. How long have you known Mr. Reynolds? - About twenty years.</p>
               <p>What was remarkable in that talking about a waistcoat, whether it was kersimere or cloth; what was remarkable to fix your attention? - In a public house they listen to many things which are remarkable.</p>
               <p>It seems to be a remarkable thing, that you should by this remember the next day, a man's coming in at an hour, and going out at an hour; it seems to be a very odd thing? - The publican desired me to make this remark.</p>

               <p>Mr. Brett, you can tell whether there were eight or nine? - I cannot positively say.</p>
               <p>Was there five; you can tell whether there was five? - I cannot positively say; there might be five.</p>

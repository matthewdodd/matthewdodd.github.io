Q.</hi> What are your duties at the Court? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have the entire management of the Court, and its operations, in the absence of the clerk—the clerk was present at this time—I sit under the Judge, and note down the appearance of the parties, and the determination of the several cases—I do not take down the names of the witnesses, I take down whe<lb></lb>ther the parties appear by counsel, attorney, or in person, the determination of the cases, and the order made—I have plenty to do between the com<lb></lb>mencement of the case and the determination of it—while I am sitting in Court, and counsel are occupying the time of the Court, perhaps very long, I have little to do—I listen to what they are saying, because sometimes we gain useful information—assuming that the parties appear in person, I ask the plaintiff his name, because I have the name in my minute book, which lies before me, and I enter the words, "in person"—that does not take long; I then ask the defendant, or the party who appears for him, similar ques<lb></lb>tions; and should they happen to be in the affirmative, I enter it in my book—I then launch the case by asking the cause of action—I then sit and listen, that is all I do during the hearing of the case, unless I have occasion to make a minute of the order that is made; that is, at the end of the case—I have nothing to do between whiles—no counsel appeared on this occa<lb></lb>sion—the plaintiff, Mr. Scott, and the prisoner were examined, and the defendant, Mr. Danks, and a man named Cusack—I cannot recollect the name of the case that was taken before this, or what any of the witnesses said, we sometimes have 250 cases in a day, I could not recollect them all—I have a perfect recollection of all that the prisoner swore; and for this simple reason, that it was an extraordinary case, and I had to draw out the certificate—Mr. Fletcher, the clerk, was taking the consent cases on the opposite side, and I called him over when I found how the case was going on; that was not before the prisoner's evidence was completed—Mr. Flet<lb></lb>cher came to prepare the certificate; I supplied you with a copy of the Judge's notes last session, per favour—I have never read the notes since, except to see that the copy was correctly made—the prisoner stated that he called on Danks to request the payment of the 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on account of a guarantee given to Mr. Scott for rent; the 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. included the rent and the expenses of the levy—I think he said that Mr. Danks disputed the payment, and refused to pay the money at first, and afterwards sent for a witness to see him pay the money: no, it was not the prisoner who said that the man was sent for to witness the payment, it was Danks who swore that—the prisoner said that he had brought the book containing the guarantee, and handed it to Danks before Danks gave him the money, and that he cut the name out upon his giving him the 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said "I handed the book to Danks, I told him I could not let him have the book, for there was some</p>

               <p>there was anything more said than that—we were not talking about that during the whole three hours; we talked of different things—it was a good half hour before I paid him, that I said I would—I cannot exactly say what money I paid him in; it was all silver, I know—I got the money out of my pocket, out of this purse—there were some half crowns amongst it; I cannot say how many; and some shillings—I did not take out the money until I paid it—my wife was not with me all the time—she went and asked my neighbours whether it would be right to pay him—she was not away long; it was more than a quarter of an hour, but I should not like to state the time—she was out at different times—I wanted to have the memorandum out altogether, and he said there was some memorandums of his son's at the back—it was at the last moment I thought of saying if I cut the name out that would be enough—he wanted to write across it, and not let me touch it; but I said "No, I won't do that," and I cut it out, and threw it in the fire—I never signed my name to anything—this is not my handwriting—(<hi rend="italic">The witness wrote his name upon a piece of paper, at Mr. Robinson's request</hi>)—I know the defendant's son by sight, nothing more—I never knew him previous to this transaction—I saw him here last session—he came to my house the night after the hearing at the County Court—I did not tell him on that occasion that I had paid 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to his father—he was not present at any part of the conversation on the 13th Feb.—the defendant came by himself—I am not aware that I said to him that I had offered Mr. Scott 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a week; I would not say that I did or did not, I firmly believe I did not—I had offered Mr. Scott half a crown a week about two days after I signed the document—I will not swear that I did not say to the prisoner that I had offered Mr. Scott half a crown a week, which would pay him his 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and that was why I would not pay him—I swear that I offered Scott the money, and I might have said to him, "This would have been paid previous to this, but Mr. Scott would not have if—nothing was said about 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I signed a document for 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I thought it all belonged to Scott—my brother did not explain to me why I was to sign the document—Mr. Scott and Ryland's son came to me and begged me to sign it, to release the broker out of my brother's house, but I never spoke to my brother about it—I do not know that I heard Scott swear at the County Court that I had never offered him half a crown a week; I told him I had done so—I do not think that he denied it—I have no recollection of his saying anything about it—the defendant did not tell me when I refused to pay him that it was very hard upon him, that he was a poor man, and that 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of it was money out of his own pocket—he did not say anything to that effect—he said, "Here is the book, what more do you want?"—I do not recollect his saying that 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of it was money due to him, and he could not afford to lose it; he might have said it, but not that I know of—I am a cocoa nut fibre mat manufacturer—my brother is a mat weaver—he is at Hull, I wish he was here—he has never paid me any portion of this money; he ran away and left me on the following Saturday night.</p>

Q.</hi> At what time did Ryland get to your house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He came between 3 and 4 o'clock; it was between 6 and 7 o'clock when I saw the money paid—I was there most all the time—they were not talking about this matter the whole of the time, they were talking about dif<lb></lb>ferent things—my husband did not, in the first instance, object to pay the money; he said he did not like to pay it without Mr. Scott—Ryland then produced the book, and said, "What more can you want?"—he said Mr. Scott was of no use without the document, and Mr. Scott did not hold it, he held it—he produced it soon after he came in—I cannot say that I know my husband's handwriting, for I am no scholar, I can neither read or write—I have seen him write sometimes—I have never had a letter from him, I cannot read letters—I have never had a letter from my husband, I have had no occasion; he has always been with me—I have been married</p>

               <p>three years—we had known each other very shortly before we were married—I might have received one or two letters from him before I was married—I believed that they were signed by him—I did not read them, I could not; I got different parties to read them for me—I cannot say who they were—I swear that I cannot read (<hi rend="italic">looking at a paper</hi>); I cannot read a single line of this—I can neither read or write—I saw this money laid upon the table—it was got from my husband's pocket; I cannot recollect which, he keeps his money in both pockets—he took the money out of his pocket; that was after I came back from fetching Cusack—I do not know whether Cusack saw what was done—I went and called him as a witness—when I came back, my husband was standing at the table—he took the money out of his pocket, and paid it to Ryland; I cannot say how he paid it—all I fetched Cusack for, was to come and see the money paid, and as he paid it, of course I thought that was sufficient—he counted it on the table before me, Cusack, and Ryland, and that was all I wanted done—my husband counted it on the table—I do not know whether he took it loose out of his pocket, or whether he took it out tied up in a purse; I saw him put the money on the table—I saw him take it out of his pocket, and count it loose on the table before Ryland; that is true—during that time Cusack was standing by me, looking on—I have never given evidence before—I do not remember my husband telling me about Mr. Scott sueing him for the money that I had seen him pay to Ryland—I know that my husband was sum<lb></lb>moned twice to the County Court—I knew what he was summoned for—I recollected then that I had seen the money paid to Ryland—I was not before the County Court Judge—Cusack's house is about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes' walk from ours—I first went to an agent that lived next door, and asked him—Cusack was not the nearest friend I had, I had plenty nearer; but I thought he was the most convenient at that time.</p>

                  </hi>. Mr. Danks owed me 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on or about 13th Feb.—he owed it me upon a guarantee that he signed in a book—I did not direct the prisoner to call for that debt of Mr. Danks on that day; I did not direct him to call at all—if he called to demand that debt of Mr. Danks on the 13th, or at any time, it was without my direction—I sued Danks for this money at the Southwark County Court, on 5th April—I sued him for 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—my debt was 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the broker's fee was 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which made it 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—when I went to Mr. Danks for this 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. he and I did not agree exactly, and I said, "I shall summons you," which I did—previous to my sum<lb></lb>moning him I saw Ryland, a day or two after, and I said to him, "I shall summons Danks; I cannot get the money from him"—he said, "I have got my expenses, 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; in fact, I have got 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I said, "You have no business with that, that is 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. off my debt."</p>

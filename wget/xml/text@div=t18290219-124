            . I am a patrol of Cripplegate. I saw the prosecutor driving his chaise in Redcross-street, opposite Paul's-alley; I saw the prisoner run from the back of the chaise, in the road, and up Paul's-alley - I saw Mr. Giles rise up, and call out Stop thief! Stop him! I then went after him, and got sight of him in the alley - he was running; I then observed a parcel in his right hand, which I had not observed before, as I was on his left side: I stopped him three or four hundred yards off - he had not got the parcel then; I had not seen him part with it - the moment I collared him, he collared me; I said "I will never loose you;" he said "What do you want me for?" I said "You know perfectly well:" he would not go back- another man came, and with his assistance, I got him to the watch-house, and the parcel was produced after I got there; it was claimed by Mrs. Giles, who was in the chaise.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was not he coming towards you when you took him? A. No; I was not above three yards from him when he first started: I never lost sight of him at all - he ran about three hundred and fifty yards; I met nobody while I was running - Paul's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182902190054"></xptr>alley is no thoroughfare; I did not search him, as he said he had got nothing: there are four gas-lights in the court: I was about two yards and a half from him when I saw the parcel under his arm - he was never further from me than that.</p>

            . I am a painter, and live in Bunhill-row. I was coming out of Jackson's-court, which leads into Paul's-alley, and something was thrown before me - some papers flew about, and I thought it might be jewellery - I immediately got a light from a neighbour, looked about, picked up this bundle, and took it to the watch-house; I had heard the cry of Stop thief! about a minute before - the parcel contained two gown pieces; I saw Mr. Giles in his chaise, but did not see the prisoner till he was at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where did you pick it up? A. In Jackson's-buildings - I suppose I was twenty yards from the cry; the bundle was thrown against my legs, as the person ran by the buildings which lead into Paul's-alley, and almost immediately a person went by after him - he was about twenty yards behind him; it is a dark alley - a person might lose sight of him; I do not think I could distinguish a person twenty yards off, not to swear to him - the alley is one hundred and fifty or two hundred yards long, and Jackson's-buildings about eighty yards up - there are a great many turnings in the direction he went, which I should think would intercept a person's view; there are gas-lights there, but he must be lost sight of in going down the alley; I heard of the prisoner's being taken in about five minutes; I took the parcel to the watch-house.</p>

               <p>JURY. Q. Did you see any body in the court except the man running, and the man in pursuit? A. Several were running in pursuit.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going to see a friend in Bethnal-green; on going through Hare-court, leading to this alley, as I turned round by the chapel, a man ran by me, and immediately after the officer ran against me, and knocked me down - I told him a man had run by me, but he took no notice of it; the constable swore at Guildhall that he saw me throw the parcel away into the court on the right-hand side of Paul's-alley.</p>

             re-examined. I cannot tell how far the constable was from him; I saw one person run by, and it was some time before I saw the other, I should think twenty yards behind him - I should think a person twenty yards off must lose sight of the man from the darkness of the alley; a parcel could not be seen under his arm at that distance - I cannot swear the same parcel was picked up as was thrown into the court.</p>

            . Q. Did you lose sight of the person you pursued till you stopped it? A. Never; there are four different courts leading out of the alley, but not turnings.</p>

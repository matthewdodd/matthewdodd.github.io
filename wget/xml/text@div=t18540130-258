                  </hi>. I am postmaster, at Uxbridge, and high con<lb></lb>stable. On 2nd Jan. the prisoner came to the post-office—he had before left orders with my servant for me to send a post-office order according to the address of a letter—when I saw the prisoner, he inquired if the money order had been sent in pursuance of his instructions—I asked him if the order was for 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he said "Yes"—I told him he had not given enough money; he had given 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., but he had not given enough to pay for the postage—I showed him the letter, and asked him if that was the letter—he said "Yes, that is right," and he gave me a penny for the postage—I had looked at the letter before he came—I was compelled to do it to make out the order, as he left instructions for me—this is a copy of the letter—on reading it I made out the order, and enclosed it in the letter, and it went in the ordinary course of post, containing the post-office order for 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I took a copy of the letter, and communicated with the police, because my suspicions were excited and aroused—I saw the prisoner again in about two days; he came to my office, and asked if the letter that had been posted on the Monday had gone, for he had had no reply and no parcel, according to his direction—I told him it was gone most certainly.</p>

In consequence of a communication from the last witness, I gave directions to the carrier from Uxbridge to London—I afterwards saw Beech, a carrier, and he made some communications to me about a parcel—in consequence of what he told me, I went to his house at 7 o'clock the next morning—while I was there the prisoner came—I was placed so that he could not see me—I could see him—he asked whether the parcel was come for him—Beech said it was, and he produced the parcel to him, and said, "Is it yours?"—he said, "Yes; how much is it?"—Beech said, "1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.," and he said, "There is the name of Dowling on it; is that your name?"—he said, "No, Brannan;" he said he sent for it in the name of Dowling—I went round the back way, and met him coming out with this parcel in his hand; I stopped him, and took him back</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carrier from London to Uxbridge. I brought the parcel down to Uxbridge on 11th Jan.—it is directed to "Henry Dowling, Chequer-yard, Uxbridge, Middlesex"—there is a person of that name who keeps a lodging house there—I did not take the parcel there myself, but a man took it, as he said, and brought it back again—on Thursday, 12th Jan., the prisoner came to my place about 12 o'clock—he said, "Have you a parcel in the name of Dowling?"—I said, "What is your name?"—he said, "George Brannan"—I said, "I have sent the parcel back to London, the party that it was directed to would not take it in"—(it had not gone back to London, it was in my possession)—the prisoner then left, and came the next morning about 9 o'clock—he said, "Is my parcel arrived from London?"—I said, "Yes"—he paid me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the carriage, and took it—I said, "Before you have this, I don't want to get into any bother; if it is not yours, you take the shilling up; you recollect there is a great deal of difference between Henry Dowling and George Brannan"—he left, and in a few minutes the officer brought him back again—he said to him, "Is this your parcel?"—he said, "Yes"—he said, "What does it contain?"—the prisoner said, "Pamphlets and songs"—he opened it, and found this coun<lb></lb>terfeit coin.</p>

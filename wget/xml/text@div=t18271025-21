On the 24th of September, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I was passing from the water side; there were 136 barrels just landing; I observed the prisoner rolling one barrel away, which had been put on the platform in the market - he was just turning the corner, about fifty or sixty yards from where it had been put- I came up with him about half way up the market, and asked what he was going to do with it - he said he was going to take it on to room land, and one of the men had employed him; I asked him to come back and point the man out; he said he would not, and used bad words; he appeared tipsy - I gave him in charge; he did not offer to go away; these casks are never rolled away, but always carried on men's knots.</p>

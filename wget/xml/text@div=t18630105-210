                  </hi>. I am a sailor, living at 108, St. George's-street—on Saturday night, 13th December, about half-past 11, I was in the street near a public-house, and saw a fight going on with the prisoner and an Austrian <hi rend="italic">chap</hi>—the Austrian was drunk—the prisoner left him and went home, and came back with a knife, and I saw him stick the knife into Placido's left shoulder—I knew Placido before—there was some likeness it him to the Austrian—it was about half-past 11 when the prisoner was fighting with the Austrian, and it was after 12 that he struck Placido—there were two more men with the prisoner at the time—one of them struck Placido in the face—the other knocked him down, and then the prisoner stabbed him with the knife.</p>

I am a sailor, and lodge in the same house as the last witness—on Saturday night, 13th December, about 12 o'clock, I was in a public-house, along with a Portuguese and some girls—when I came out I saw the prisoner—he said, "How much money have you got? "—I said, "I have no money"—he then struck me—I said, "What do you strike me for"—another man then struck me, and another, and the prisoner struck me on my left shoulder—I don't know what with—I went to protect another man from the prisoner, and then he struck me with a knife—they all three then ran away—I am sure it was the prisoner who struck me with the knife—I pointed him out the next day—I stopped in the hospital Saturday night and Sunday, and came out on Monday morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at the London Hospital—I saw the prosecutor on Sunday morning, 14th December, and found an incised wound in his back, about two inches deep—the knife had entered in an oblique direction, and come in contact with one of the ribs, and glided along the rib—if it had entered in a direct line, and gone into the cavity of the chest, it would have placed his life in imminent danger—as it was there was only one-eighth of an inch between the wound and the cavity of the chest—he was with us two or three days—there were no inflammatory symptoms—he wished to be discharged as his ship was going to sea.</p>

             sworn. Examined by Mr. Gleed. I live at the Cross Keys, Gracechurch-street. On Tuesday the 6th of May, about a quarter before two, the man prisoner came and asked me for a glass of gin, I received a shilling of him, I suspected him, and put the shilling in a particular place, I gave him tenpence change, he went away; shortly after the other prisoner came and asked me if the Maidstone coach went from my house, I said yes, she asked me what time of the day and what was the fare, I told her I could not tell; she said, I shall thank you for a glass of gin, she gave me a shilling, exactly like the other, I told her it was a bad one (I have kept them separate), she said she would go out and get it changed; I asked a Mr. Barnard to see whether she did not join couple with some man in the street; I went out too, and in a passage I saw them both standing together conversing, I said this is the man and this is the woman, if you will take care of the woman I will take care of the man; the woman stopped but the man rushed from me and ran towards Cornhill; I cried out Stop thief, and he was overtaken and brought back.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present at the time he was searched. - A. I was, there was some halfpence and some silver found upon him; I produce the shillings, I have kept them separate, one I marked Man and the other Woman.</p>

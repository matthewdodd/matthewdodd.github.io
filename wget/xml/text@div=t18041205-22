Yes, on the 30th of October the prisoner was delivered to me; I searched him, and found this watch upon him; (produces the watch;) I asked him how he came by it, and he said he had purchased it; he had given seven guineas for it; I asked him what he had done with the remainder of the notes; he hesitated for some time, and at last said, if I would let him go along with me, he would shew me where they were.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he say where he had bought the watch? - A. Yes, at Mr. Grant's, in Fleet-street; I went with the prisoner to the shop, to know whether he had bought the watch there, and he said he did; I then took him to the Office; he there told me he recollected where he had changed all three of the notes; one he said he changed where he purchased the watch, another at a hosier's shop, and another at a shoemaker's; all three of those places in Fleet-street; I went and made inquiry, and found a lad had changed a 20 l. note at each of those places; I then returned back to the prisoner again, and asked him if he were sure there were no more things of his at Shepherd's, and in consequence of his direction I went and found a number of things that he said he had bought; (produces them;) after he had been examined once, I asked him how he had got out of the house, where he had stolen the notes from; he said he had been a very silly fellow for so doing, that about twelve o'clock at night he took the key and unlocked the box, and took out three 20 l. notes and three guineas and a half in gold.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say where he took it from? - A. No, I told him there were more missing, and he said he was sure that was all he had took out; he told me the room door was not locked; I asked him how he got out at the front door; he said he unfastened it, and let himself out, and pulled the door to after him.</p>

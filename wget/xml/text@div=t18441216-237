               <p>The prisoner was in my service—I think she entered about the 30th of Sept., and left about the 19th of Oct.—she was with me about three weeks—after she had left I went with a constable to No. 22, Great Windmill-street—it was on a Wednesday, and I think the 27th of Nov.—she was coming out, and I met with her in the street—I stated to her that from information I had heard, I felt confident she had got the velvet, that it was a very unpleasant thing for me to proceed in, and if she would acknowledge she had it, I should not take any steps in consequence—she took me to her lodging, and I found there an immense quantity of cuttings—I did not find any velvet, but I found about a quarter of a yard of gimp, worth about sixpence—this is it—while she was with me she was employed to work on a mantle on which some gimp of a like description was put—it was made to order and it matches in every respect—it is not, I think, gene<lb></lb>rally kept to be sold—it was made expressly for the mantle which I have in my hand, and there was this quantity more than was sufficient—I have not the slightest doubt of the identity of it—Mrs. Budson brought some velvet to the office afterwards.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Budson; we live at No. 22, Great Windmill-street—the prisoner lodged in the same house—on Wednesday, the 27th of Nov. she came into my room, and brought in three yards of black velvet, and one yard of green—she put it between a box and a chest of drawers, and told me to lock it up, and not to say anything about it—I told her she had better take it away, but she went out of the room and left it—I suspected it was stolen, because they were searching the house at the same time—I called in a person from the next room, and looked at what she had left—I then took it down stairs to Mr. Belcham, the shoemaker, who keeps the shop and the house—the parties who had been searching the house were then gone—I did not take it down while they were searching the house, as I did not know what to do in the confusion.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">re-examined.</hi> This is the velvet which Mr. Belcham brought to me—I know it—this green piece corresponds precisely in every respect with this mantle which I had to make tip—I missed this exact quantity—this corresponds in quantity and in every other respect with what the prisoner had to make up the mantle with, and this piece of cutting which I saw found in her box corresponds with this other piece produced by Belcham—with this cutting and this larger piece the deficient quantity is supplied—the prisoner was engaged to work on this material as fore-woman when she was in my service—she cut it out.</p>

               <p>of this is rather peculiar, and it corresponds exactly with it—I think we had twenty-four yards, or twenty-four yards and a half—it was used to make three scarfs, and the prisoner was employed to cut them out—there was about five yards and a half used for each scarf, which would amount to sixteen yards and a half—five yards were returned, and three yards I have produced.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Who were you making the scarfs for? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Messrs.

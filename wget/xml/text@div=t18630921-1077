                  </hi>. I am a wholesale perfumer, in partnership with my father, in Little Britain—Sparkes, who has pleaded guilty, was in our em<lb></lb>ployment about seven years, as a working man—I do not know Gent—he is not a customer of ours—on the morning of 6th August, in consequence of something that was said to me by detective Smith, I went to Gent's place—I saw him there—Smith said to him, "We have come about some fat that you bought from Sparkes last night"—he said he had not bought any—Smith said, "Be careful what you say. We are police-officers, and this is</p>

               <p>Mr. Benbow, whom Sparkes is employed by, and Sparkes is in custody"—he still said he had not bought anything from him—on opening a door to go to the back of the premises, I saw this tin (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I said, "Why, this is our tin!"—Gent said, "Oh, yes: I bought that last night of Sparkes. I gave him sixpence a pound for it"—it is worth a shilling a pound at least—it is grease now—it is not in the state in which it left our place—it was what is called "spent pomade" when it left our place—Smith then asked him if he had any other tins on his premises—he said no, he had not—he said, "We must search your premises"—I went with him, and we found about a dozen tins, some of them exactly the same as this one—the prisoner then called his wife down, and said, "Here are some sheriffs' officers come about that matter of Sparke's last night"—Smith said they were not sheriffs' officers, they were detectives—Smith then asked her some questions, and the prisoner told her to hold her tongue, and not answer—Smith asked the prisoner if he weighed the fat when he bought it—he said he had not, there was thirteen pounds—he said he knew Sparkes was in our employment and had known him some time—we have a great many cans of this sort in our place, which are sometimes full and sometimes empty.</p>

On 5th August, about 7 o'clock, I was watching Mr. Benbow's premises at the time the men were leaving work—I saw Sparkes leave with something in a bag on his back—I followed him to two or three public houses, and then he took an omnibus and went to the Oval, Hackney-road—he, got out at the Durham Arms, and walked to the Oval to some gates at the side of Gent's premises—he pulled a siring and entered, stayed two or three minutes, and came out with the bag empty; he then went back to where the omnibus starts, got in, and came to the City—next morning we made a communication to Messrs. Benbow in reference to</p>

               <p>what we saw, and about a little after 1 o'clock on Thursday I and another officer, Legg, were in Little Britain where the prosecutor's premises are, and saw Sparkes come out—I said to him, "We are officers "—in consequence of something that was said, I and Mr. Benbow and Legg went to Gent's place—I pulled the string over the gates, went in at the private door, and went to the back part of the premises—Gent came out to us—I said we were detective-officers, and that he had received some pomade or fat from a man last night—he appeared very much agitated, and said he had not—I said, "Now, be careful what you say; we watched Sparkes here last evening"—at that moment Mr. Benbow pointed out a can which was under a bench or desk, and said, "Why, there is the can" or "tin"—I forget which he said—it was immediately taken possession of by Legg, and Gent said, "Oh, yes; I had it of Sparkes last night, and I gave him sixpence a pound for it"—I said, "Did you weigh it?"—he said, "No"—I said, "Did you know that he was in the employ of Mr. Benbow?"—he appeared very nervous at that time, hesitated, and then said, "Yes"—I said, "How long have you known him?"—he said, "I have known him ever since I was in business in Bishopsgate-street"—he was asked, either by myself or Legg, "Have you any more tins or cans like these on the premises?"—he said, "No, I have not"—I said, "We must search further"—he said, "If that is the case, I must have somebody down with me," or words to that effect—he then called up stairs, and a lady came down, who he represented as his wife—he said, "These are two sheriffs' officers, come to search my premises about that affair of Sparkes' last night"—I said, "We are not sheriffs' officers, we are detective-officers "—I then proceeded up stairs, and Gent handed me the key of a closet, and in that closet I found another can—I said to him, "How is this? you said you had no more cans"—he said he did not know it was there"—I then went to a bed-room and kitchen at the back, and found another can—we then went down stairs and made a further search in the warehouse, and found some other cans—I asked him how he could account for the possession of them—his wife was about to reply, and he said to her, "Say nothing, and know nothing," and she gave no answer to the question I put—we then took him to the station—Sparkes was fetched from his cell, and I said to him, "Is this the person to whom you sold the pomade?"—he said, "Yes, that is the man"—Gent said, "Yes, that is the man that I bought it from; but I did not know it was stolen, and I gave him 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it"—these are the tins (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—two of them are the same size as this full one.</p>

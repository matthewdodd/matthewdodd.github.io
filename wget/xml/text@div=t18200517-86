            . I am an attorney, and live in Staples Inn. On the 25th of September I paid Mr. Whitaker's clerk 47 l. 12 s. at my chambers; the prisoner is so much altered in dress and manners, that I have no recollection of him - he wrote the receipt, which I produce, in my presence. I paid him some 10 l. notes, also two 1 l. notes. He called on me for the money, and I paid him.</p>
               <p>MR. WHITAKER re-examined. The receipt is the prisoner's writing.</p>

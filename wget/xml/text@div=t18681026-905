                  </hi>. I am a wine merchant, residing at Staines—on Friday, the day before the prisoners were given into custody, I saw some timber on Mr. Andrews' premises at mid-day, similar to this—Andrews was building some concrete walls, and was using a parcel of timber—I went to watch the construction of the walls, and saw similar timber to this, forming a casing to the concrete walk—I know that timber occasionally floats down the river.</p>

               <p>years water-bailiff of the City of London—on the evening of 5th September, I was sitting by the water, with a friend, and asked him to go with me in my punt to pick up two pieces of wood which were coming down the stream—we picked them up, and afterwards saw two pieces of timber like this, but much larger—the police came and took it away from me—they did not charge me with stealing it—I have picked up many pieces of wood on the river at different times—I picked up timber from 400 to 800 yards above where the timber was found—it was from 500 to 600 yards from Staines railway bridge—there is no tide there, and wood does not float up the stream.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was it 500 yards above the railway bridge? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, the stream goes down—the police told me that they had found the owner of the wood—I never picked up a cart load of wood in a day, nor yet a barrow load.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WILLIAMS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know of your own knowledge, that fisherman do pick up wood and treat it as lost property; have you done it yourself? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, it is not valuable—the wood which I picked up above the iron bridge could not have been part of the wood which was under the dry arch; it could not have floated up; it must have floated from elsewhere.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a builder, of Staines—I have at times lost timber by it floating away—I have picked up timber on the river and burnt it—I Dover found any other use for it—the prisoners are in my employ as sawyers—they earn from 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week the two—they have been on bail since the last Session, and are defended through the kindness of the clergymen of the place, and other persons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Have you picked up wood? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, a dozen times in the last two or three years—pieces of timber frequently float down the river—I saw a good cartload floating about last Sunday week—I did not pick it up, I had not got my punt—if I lost a cartload of timber I think I should have a good deal of difficulty in getting it back.</p>

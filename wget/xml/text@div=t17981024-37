               <p>Q. How did you know them to be your's? - A. I can swear to the three that were alive, they were marked with a G on the rump and across the shoulders; he had riddled them afresh across the shoulders, and cut the G mark out.</p>
               <p>Q. How can you swear to those in the field? - A. I had had them about two months, and I had been so used to the sheep, that I could have sworn to them if they had not been marked at all; I found the two skins in the Fell-market, the G was cut out, and they were marked fresh across the shoulders, but I can swear to the sheep by the skins of them; I lost them from the fields at Mill-hill, in Hendon parish.</p>

             sworn. - On the 29th of September, the prisoner brought two skins into my yard, at Watford, which I purchased; I did not observe any particular mark, any further than they were very much riddled; when Mr. Boys came to enquire for them, I examined them, and found the mark had been cut out of them; the prisoner is a butcher at Watford; I asked him no questions about them, he brought them as he usually did.</p>

               <p>Q. Your mark was gone - by what can you swear to them? - A. By the riddle over the shoulder.</p>
               <p>Q. That is impossible; no man can swear to the riddle of a sheep? - A. I can swear they are our sheep.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I met a man with five sheep, between Edgeware and Stanmore, that I had bought sheep of before; he told me they were almost knocked up, they seemed very tired, and he wanted to fell them; he asked me ten guineas for them, and I gave him ten pounds.</p>

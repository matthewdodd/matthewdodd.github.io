I am an engineer, in the service of the Herne Bay Steam-boat Company—they have a shop on the outside of the East India Docks—the prisoner was employed there—his right time for leaving was seven o'clock—there was some soda in casks, in the shop, the property of the Company—I know David Halkett—he has no other name that I know of—he is one of the Directors of the Company—there are so such cases of white-lead as this produced, there—we do keep white-lead.</p>

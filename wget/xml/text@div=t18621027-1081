                  </hi>. I am a sub-warder in the House of Correction, Cold-bath-fields—the prisoner was a prisoner there—he had been confined these since the 7th July last—on Monday morning, 22d September, I reported him to the Governor, for some breach of the prison rules—in consequence of that report he was confined in his cell during the day—in the afternoon, at fifty-five minutes past 5, I was in the dining hall—the prisoner came in with the other prisoners, and he came in behind me—I was sitting on a stool, with my back partly towards him—I saw him lift his hand with some in<lb></lb>strument in it—I then declined my head to escape the blow, and I felt myself struck on the head behind the right ear—he then made use of the words, "I will die on the scaffold for you, you b——, I will"—the wound bled, and one of the other warders, named Lloyd, came to my assistance—I saw this piece of iron (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in the prisoner's hand, and afterwards in the officer's hand—it was held in this position, like a dagger.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the warden at the House of Correction—on 22d September, I was in the dining room—I saw the prisoner there, and saw the last witness sitting on a stool—as the prisoner led into the room, I saw him make a blow at Warren with that hook or piece of iron—he held it as if he had got a dagger—he seemed to strike with great violence—Warren immediately ran to the centre of the room where I was—I went up to the prisoner and got it from him—at the time the prisoner struck the blow he said, "You b——, I will die on the gibbet for you; I don't think you will report any more"—I was about half a dozen yards from him at the time he struck the blow—this piece of iron is part of the window—it was broken off the cell window where he was confined during the day, and sharpened.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sub-warder at the House of Correction—on the 22d October, the prisoner's mother came to see him—I was present at the interview which took place—he told his mother that he had been stabbing one of the officers, and that he was going to be tried at the Old Bailey for the offence—he told her that the officer had reported him wrong<lb></lb>fully, and that he would put his lights out for him—his mother asked him if the officer was seriously hurt, and he told her that the surgeon had reported that he looked very queer about the eyes since, and that if he got an oppor<lb></lb>tunity now he would blind him—his mother then asked him if he thought he should come back there again—he said, "No; if I get four years I shall got; should I, I will be hanged for it."</p>

                  </hi>. I am surgeon to the House of Correction—on 27th September, I examined Warren's wound—it had then been previously dressed by the infirmary warder—the wound was just at the back, a little above the ear, on the right side; the skin was broken—it had slipped along the bone—it was such a wound as this instrument might have inflicted—it was not of a dangerous character—if the man had not stooped down it might have hit him on the carotid artery, or the jugular vein.</p>

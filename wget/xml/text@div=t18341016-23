            . I am in the employ of Mr. Richard Robinson and another. I was in their shop on the 6th of September - about half-past seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came, in and took a bottle-case and bottles, worth 40s. - I went out, and caught him about three doors off with it - he was walking - I told him to come back, and he did - my master fetched an officer - the prisoner did not see me when he came into the shop - the case stood on some desks.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I saw him when I went in - he was knocking with a nail - this case was by the side of the door, and I was ordered to go and fetch it - a person came in at the back door, and he asked me if he sent me in for the case - he seemed very much agitated, and said, "No" - I told him to go to the corner of Great Queen-street, and he would see the young man. Witness. No, he did not - he said he had been sent.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going up Queen-street, and a young man stopped me near the corner of Drury-lane, and told me to go and get this case - he was very much like the person who came in at the back of the shop.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a jobbing porter. On Wednesday afternoon, I think it was this day fortnight, I was at the tap of the Queen's Arms, St. Martin's-le-Grand, between 2 and 3 o'clock, and saw the prisoners there drinking, I believe, together—Froud told me he wanted me—I went to the door, and he asked me to follow him; I did so, down to the vaults of the Post-office—he went in first to show me the way, as I had never been there before—he gave me a bundle of books, tied together, of a size between these two produced—I saw a cistern there—I brought them to the door of the vault, and asked Froud what I should do with them—he told me to carry them over to the person I had just left, Bowyer—I did so, and found him at the tap—his dog was with him—I put the books down beside him, and said, "Now this is for you; take notice, I have nothing to do with it;" because I was fearful that I might be called out for a job—he asked me what I would take, and I had a drop of rum—Froud came back, gave me 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and they went away together, saying that they were going over Black<lb></lb>friars Bridge; Bowyer carried the books.</p>

On 16th Jan. the prisoners both came to my ware-house between 2 and 3 o'clock with 1 cwt. 3 qrs. weight of books—I bought them, and paid Froud—Bowyer had a dog with him—that was the first time Froud had been to me that day—I believe he did not come again that day—I have two entries in my book—I believe Froud was alone the first time, and the second time was about 3 o'clock—there was at least two or three hours interval between the two visits Froud made—I had seen Bowyer more than once with Froud on the subject of paper, either before or after this transaction—I sold part of that paper to Mr. Lee.</p>

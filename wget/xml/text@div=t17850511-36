               <p>Did you allow her them to use? - No, I lost ten boxes of it, the value is about four shillings, that is the intrinsic value, the boxes were found at an acquaintance of her's who is a servant at the George and Vulture; I allowed her to use as much as she could in my house, I took her to be very honest, and I apprehend still, that she did not consider the consequence, I look upon it that she meant to give them.</p>

               <p>Do not you apprehend this to be a mistake of the poor girl's, did she make any money of this business? - I believe not.</p>

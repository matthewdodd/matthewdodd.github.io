On the 21st of January, I was out at work all day, and when I returned home, about a quarter before six o'clock in the evening, I was informed the crow-bar was missing. I went to Mr. Haynes, the prisoner's master, and he was taken the next morning - I had seen the crow-bar the day before - it has never been seen since.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's wife; I was at home - the bricklayer was at work then; the prisoner, and, I think, another labourer came there in the course of the day; that was the first day the prisoner had been there - I saw the crow-bar safe under the stairs, when the men were gone to tea - the prisoner returned about half past five o'clock, and took the crow-bar - I saw him come up the stairs with it - I did not stop him, as I was not certain that my husband had not given him leave to take it.</p>

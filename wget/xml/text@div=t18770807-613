                  </hi>. I am a partner with Mr. Fulton, of 134, Fenchurch Street, as indigo brokers—large portions of indigo are kept on the premises for samples—Branagan has been in our employ about twelve months—I have known his father many years—he is a housekeeper—we missed a quantity of indigo—I cannot fix the date—I spoke to Branagan about it twice—he had no right to take it—it is worth from 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per lb. wholesale—about July we put the matter in the hands of the police, and Lawley watched for us—on 12th July the police showed me 27 lbs. of indigo, in which two lumps bore my own pencil marks, 23 and 27—I afterwards saw twelve sheets of brown paper which had been used in wrapping, and which is similar to the paper we use, and also two other parcels of indigo—a parcel of 62 lbs. was found in the possession of another man—the indigo found is similar to ours—I have had no business trans<lb></lb>actions with Cowart.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an assistant to Mr. John Dorking, of 91, Minories, who has an office on the same floor as Cowart's shop—Cowart brought a canvas bag to my shop, tied with a string, and asked me to take care of it for him as he was going to Liverpool—he said it contained his property—it remained in my possession, and in the same state, till Cowart wan taken in custody, when it was opened and found to contain indigo.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187708070018"></xptr>
               <p>I cannot remember the dates when I took indigo to 91, Minories, but I went there about eight times altogether during a period extending eight months back—our first conversation took place at 91, Minories—Cowart paid me from 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per lb. for it when I delivered it—after I had been twice Cowart said "It is a great bother your coming two or three times for the money, what will you give me out of it if I pay you the whole amount?" and then he deducted 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—then he asked me to bring some more indigo and he would pay me each time—in the letter I asked for 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and we made an arrangement that whenever I referred to the matter in writing I should allude to some one else; that is why I say in the letter "My friend will clear out," and "My friend wants the money on Thursday"—he did not send me the money from Liverpool—I do not know how long he was absent—I saw him on his return—I remember Mr. Broomhall calling my attention to a deficiency of indigo afterwards—as I felt unhappy, my health was in a bad state, and I had been out late at night spending money with bad companions; I was passing this man's place on my way to St. Katherine dock and called and told him not to expect me to keep the appointment I had made with him—he said "That is all nonsense," and that I should have to keep the appointment—I said I had made up my mind, I should leave it all alone—he said it was all <hi rend="italic">bosh</hi>, or something of that sort, and threatened me that if I did not go on bring<lb></lb>ing indigo he would take all I had brought to my employers and then tell my father—I afterwards took him more indigo, for which he paid me at the same rate, and on one occasion he advanced me 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I again asked him to give me time to refund the money and I would give him interest for it—he would not hear of that and I felt obliged to take him indigo for the 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—on 11th July I took a parcel of indigo from my masters premises to 91, Minories, by appointment—I suspected that I was watched, and went into the shop as quick as I could, and said "I believe I am followed," and put the parcel in Cowart's hands, who hid it and substituted another parcel for it, and instantly the policeman came in and examined the parcel—I did not see the parcel of indigo afterwards—the next morning I asked the officer to withdraw while I spoke to my master.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have known Mr. Hall for some years, he is a coffee dealer, I have sold him indigo; I did not always see Hall when I took indigo—I sold indigo to Hall before I did to Cowart—I asked Hall to buy indigo—he said he would provided I came by it honestly—Cowart did not ask me how I came by it, nor whether I had a right to sell it, nor did I say "I assure you I have Mr. Cowart," or anything like it—Cowart was always ready to take it in—I had made an arrangement with Cowart, that I was to reckon that I sold for somebody else, and I was not to say it was my own property, but always to mention a third party—Cowart said "For God's sake, do not let us get into trouble, be careful," but I no not recollect his ever saying "Have you come by it honestly"—Hall was never present when Cowart paid me for the indigo—I have seen Hall several times—I have met him in the street since he questioned me about the indigo, but I did not speak to him about it—I never sold coffee to Hall, but I have seen him sell coffee about the City.</p>

I was employed to watch the premises in Fenchurch Street, from 8th July—on 11th July, I saw Branagan leave the office about 8 p.m.—I followed him into 91, Minories, Cowart was standing behind the counter, I asked for the parcel which the boy had just brought—Brauagan picked up a similar parcel—I said "What does it contain"—he said "Tea and coffee"—I opened it and found it was a tea sample—I said to Cowart "Has the boy brought any indigo"—Cowart said "Not that I know of, he has come here to see a man named Hall"—on the following morning the boy asked my permission to speak to his master privately, and I afterwards went with the boy to Cowart's place—I said to Cowart "I have come for the parcel of indigo that this boy brought last night, you knew perfectly well that the parcel you gave me was not the one"—he said "Yes, I did, but it was not my matter, it was Hall's matter I said "Where is the parcel"—he said "I do not know"—I said "I must have it, here is the boy, he has confessed to it"—Cowart said "I have not got it, but if you will wait here, I will fetch it"—he went into the cellar, I and the boy followed, and he produced this bag from behind some boards, just as it is now, saying "Oh, I shot it amongst the other"—I said "Where did you get the other from"—he said "The boy brought it here"—I said "How many times has he been here"—he said "About a dozen times"—I made a further search on 16th July, and found two other parcels weighing 27 lb. and 62 lbs., there are some pencil marks on some of the indigo, and some private marks of the makers; I found this envelope and letter in a drawer which I opened with a key found on Cowart—I also found this rent-book of Mr. Hall's, twelve sheets of brown paper, and this black bag (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the paper is similar to that in Messrs.

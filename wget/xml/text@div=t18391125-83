                  </hi>. I am warehouseman to Richard Lewellin, and two others, Manchester warehousemen, Wood-street, Cheapside—the prisoner sold goods fur my employers on commission. On the 28th of September he asked me for a piece of print for a shipper or merchant to offer as a sample of a lot—he had had patterns previously—he returned, and said he had shown the print to the shippers—I gave him a piece of twenty-eight yards, and after be had it I inquired who it was for—he said it was for Dunsford and Turner—he was to take an order for the goods—I meant to them to Dunsford and Turner—he did not come back to bring me the money—he ought to have left the print at Dunsford and Turner's, or to have brought me the money, if they had bought it—he did not bring back the goods—he came back on several occasions after—I asked him when the sale was to take place—he stated that Dunsford and Turner's agent or agents in Manchester were purchasing for them at the time, and they were waiting to receive an account of what goods their agent had purchased—some few days after the 28th of October, he not having come for some time, I went to Dunsford and Turner's—when I caught the prisoner I asked him what he had done with the goods he had—he refused to give any account of them—I sent for a policeman, and gave him into custody—the goods are here now—these are what I gave him to sell.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Mr. Turner—we are merchants, and live in White Lion-court—I cannot swear to the prisoner, but my impression is that I have seen him—I did not authorise him to get any goods from Messrs. Lewellin for my inspection or for sam<lb></lb>ples—he has never brought to me twenty-eight yards of printed cotton—I never purchased or received any from him—there are many persons call, and I cannot say whether he may have called—if there had been any purchased at our house I must have known it—I do not know Messrs. Lewellin.</p>

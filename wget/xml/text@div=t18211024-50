On the 9th of October, about half-past twelve o'clock, I received four sovereigns, and 6 s. 6 d. I met the prisoner, about a mile and a half on this side of Chelsea, about two o'clock, she walked with me, and got in conversation, we went to a public-house, had a pot of beer; I came out, and sent her to get me a lodging - she said she could get me a very comfortable one. As I went along I felt her hand feeling my pocket; I said "I hope you don't mean to rob me?" she said No. She took me to No. 6, <placeName id="t18211024-50-crimeloc295">Shire-lane</placeName>

About two o'clock I awoke, and she was gone; she was in the room when I laid down. I was quite sober. I missed all my money from my tobacco box; which I had put on the floor under the bed; she left me sixpence in the tobacco box, and put it in my jacket pocket. I only went to a public-house with her.</p>

            . I am a patrol. About half-past nine o'clock I was going up Shire-lane, and saw the prisoner go in with the prosecutor. Between one and two she met me in the lane as she was coming out. When the man went in he rolled about, and appeared very drunk. About ten minutes after he came and said he had been robbed. The prisoner was afterwards taken.</p>

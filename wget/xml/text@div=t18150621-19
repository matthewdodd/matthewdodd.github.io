               <p>COLONEL MILMAN. On the 13th of May, between three and four in the afternoon, I was in <placeName id="t18150621-19-crimeloc105">Bond-street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18150621-19-crimeloc105" type="placeName" value="Bond-street"></interp>

On a sudden, I missed my snuff-box, being alarmed by a jerk of my coat; I turned round, and saw the prisoner behind me; I let him go on, and I followed him, until he got to St. James's church, in Piccadilly; I there tapped him on the shoulder, and requested he would have the goodness to oblige me with a pinch of snuff; he told me, he had none. I replied, you must have some, for you know you have just picked up my box, in Bond-street; he then said, is it your box? I told him it was; and he asked me to describe it; I did, and he then gave it me. I called an officer, and immediately gave him in custody.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming along, and saw the snuff-box on the ground, just behind this gentleman; I picked it up, and put it in my pocket. He came after me, and said, it was his, but I did not choose to give it him, until he had described it; when he had, I immediately saw he had a right to it, and of course surrendered it up to him.</p>

On the 18th of December, about seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came into my shop, and asked for some ribbons-my son served him; my son told me he had taken some ribbon, and I sent him for a constable; the prisoner wanted to go out, but I would not let him. I told him I had sent for a constable, and he took the ribbons out of his pocket, and wanted me to measure them, which I did; they came to 13s. 6d.: he had only 5s. to pay for them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. I did not suspect him till my son told me he had taken the ribbon; I cannot swear to them-the constable searched him.</p>
               <p>HARRIOT TAYLOR. I was in the shop when the prisoner came in; I saw him lay his hand on the drawer and put it in his pocket; I and Mr. Williams' son were close to him: when he was found out, he pulled two pieces of ribbon out of his pocket, and said-here are the ribbons, I have fixed on: they were measured, they came to 13s.; he pulled out 4s. or 5s.</p>

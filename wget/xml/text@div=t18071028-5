            . I was returning to town from Hammersmith on the 2nd of October, between ten and eleven o'clock, I met the prisoner near the turnpike bar, <placeName id="t18071028-5-crimeloc20">Kensington</placeName>

               <p>Q. How lately before had you seen them in your pocket book. - A I had seen them there in the course of the day, when I had last seen my pocket book.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon missing them what did you do. - A. I returned and went after the prisoner; I saw her in the company of two other young women and three dragoons. I saw the patrol, and I gave charge of the prisoner; she was taken to Knightsbridge watchhouse and there searched; no property was found on her. Being persuaded that I had had the property, and that she had taken it, I told her if she would give me the property, I would proceed no further with her; but she took a solemn oath at the time that she had not seen nor touched a pocket book, and the pocket book not being found on the prisoner, I dismissed the charge.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before you met the prisoner had you felt the pocket book in your pocket. - A. I had not felt it for some hours before that. I left my address in the watchhouse I heard in the morning that the runners had got the prisoner, and had found the money in her possession.</p>
               <p>Q. You was not near any of the other women, was you, so that any of them could take it and hand it to her. - A. I was at the first, about a minute, when I met them.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you do not know whether you might or might not have lost the pocket book at that period when these three women were about you. - A. I might have lost it at that period.</p>

            . I am a patrol belonging to Bow-street office. On the 3d of October, about a quarter past twelve o'clock, I was returning home, I met Summers with the patrol; the patrol told me what had passed, and understanding that three men of the twelfth light dragoons, and three women were together, I followed the party that he described; I found them going into Duck-lane, Westminster. I followed the prisoner and one soldier into her apartment; the moment I entered her room she threw down five pound five in silver and in gold.</p>

               <p>Q. Then one of the notes had been changed. - A. Yes; she tucked a one pound note under the bed. I searched the soldier that was in company with her; I found on him a one pound note and twenty shillings in silver; she declared that she had only robbed the gentleman of ten pounds; the next morning she acknowledged to the gentleman that she had taken twenty three pound.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the pocket book. - A. No, that was burnt with a candle.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I leave myself to the mercy of the court; the prosecutor promised that if I would own to it. he would not hurt me.</p>

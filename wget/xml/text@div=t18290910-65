            . I heard the prisoner was at the slaughter-house, and saw him taking what I supposed to be fat, as there was nothing but fat there - I watched him; he went to Mr. Ordway's mother's shop, to take the keys back: he was then going away, but he was called back, and the fat was taken from him - it was between eight and nine o'clock in the morning; he said it was the first time he ever took any, and he hoped it would not be made known to his father and mother; he had gone to the slaughter-house to get a head - I saw him standing on the steps, and putting something in his bosom; no person had fat there but Mr. Ordway.</p>

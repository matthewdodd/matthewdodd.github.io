             sworn. - On the 2d of January I heard a noise in the chapel, in the evening, soon after the congregation was gone. I opened the street door and looked to see if any body was on the steps. I then called Mrs. Bickley, and we both went into the chapel with a light. we saw<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180301120061"></xptr>the cushions and books mislaid in different parts upon the ground. In this handkerchief I produce six prayer books which were found on the prisoner, one of which belongs to Mr. Robson, and another to Sir John Smith. (Produces them). We could not see any body below, and I thought somebody might be in the gallery. Thomas Preston went up with me, and in the second pew we found the boy, who is the prisoner, sitting upon a hassock, we asked him if there were any more. He said no, for he had just let the man out with some books. We asked him who the man was; he said he met him at the top of Swallow-street; that the man asked him to go with him to Trinity Chapel for some books, and he should have part of the money, which would be of service to him. The boy seemed very much frightened.</p>
               <p>(Mr. Robson identified his book).</p>
               <p>MARY BICKLEY sworn. - I was close by when the books were taken from the boy, and have had them ever since.</p>
               <p>The prisoner declined making any defence.</p>
               <p>One witness gave him a good character.</p>

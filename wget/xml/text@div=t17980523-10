             sworn. - I live at No. 4, Crown-court: Mr. Freeland lives at the corner next door but one; I saw the prisoner at Mr. Freeland's house the evening before the robbery; and on the Tuesday evening I was going to Mr. Brookes's, in East-Smithfield, for some leather to bind shoes, and I saw the prisoner in East-Smithfield, counting money in the street, a good step from Mr. Freeland's; he had this bundle slung upon his arm; I asked him if he did not lodge at Mr. Freeland's; he said, no, he did not lodge there, but he knew Mr. Freeland very well; I asked him if he would not go with me to Mr. Freeland's, for they had been robbed; I had heard so about half an hour before; I was next to the wall then; and he was next to the pavement; I went to the other side of him; I laid hold of his jacket, and then he pushed me in the side, and run away.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to take hold of his jacket? - A. They said it was him that had robbed Mr. Freeland; I called out for assistance, and nobody would assist me, and then a butcher's boy stopped him, but who the boy was I do not know; then I got hold of him, and he went with me to Mr. Freeland's house; then the officer took him in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. He was strong enough to have pushed you away, was not he? - A. Yes, but he did not do it.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the bundle? - A. He carried it on his arm till he came to the office at Mr. Freeland's house, and then he dropped it at Mr. Freeland's door, outside, the officer took it up; I have had it ever since. (Produces it).</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say how he came by the things? - A. I did not hear him.</p>

             - we live in Broad-street-buildings, Finsbury. On the 18th of March I saw the prisoner at our house - he asked me to let him have some ear-rings to show a customer; when our traveller came home I sent some by him, telling him to bring back the money or the earrings - the prisoner had worked for us: he said the customer lived at the bottom of the street or place where he lived: he said they were to be under 22s. a pair - I sent six pairs; I think it was between three and four o'clock in the afternoon when I sent them - here is one pair with my marks on them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. When did you see them again, before the Magistrate? A. About six weeks afterwards.</p>

            . On the 18th of March Mrs. Levyson told me to take some ear-rings to the prisoner's house, in Europa-place, St. Luke's; I took them, and saw the prisoner, who told me he had got to show them to a lady at the west-end of the town - he wished me to leave them till the next day, when I was to have them or the money for those that were sold: I went the next day, and he said he had not got an answer from the parties - I went the next day, and he made a similar excuse; I called on the Saturday, and then he said his wife was going to have a party on the Sunday, and I should have them on the Monday - I went then, and they had left the premises; I never saw him again till he was taken: I was examined at the office on the 25th of April - I did not see the prisoner before that; I believe three pairs of ear-rings were produced - I left six pairs, and never got any back: one pair I can speak to - these are them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many times did you call for the money? A. Three times - I think it was on a Thursday, the 18th of March, that I left them; I gave him a memorandum of the prices, not a bill of parcels, for I wrote "On approbation" - if a thing is left on approbation it is not a bill of parcels; if his customers had approved of any of them they were sold, but the money was to be paid for them - he said he had not had an answer; I have no copy of the note I gave him - it is my duty to make an entry of the things I sell, but when on approbation I put "Approbation" on the bill, and in the book likewise; I believe the officer has the bill, which was left with the prisoner - when he had removed I made inquiry of several persons in the neighbourhood, but could not find where he was; I did not receive a card of his residence till after he was taken up - upon my oath I never saw this card; he never told me a word about his going to remove - this is the paper which I delivered to the prisoner when I left the ear-rings; I did receive a gilt chain from the prisoner on the 18th of March - not a, gold one; I sold it, and should have given him the money if he had not absconded - I was advised not to pay by the officer, till this matter was settled; that was on the day he was taken; he said, "I have a chain, if you can sell it for me," but there was no specific time to pay the money - I should have paid if I could have found him; there was a small pin besides - I sold the pin to one of my customers, and the chain at a shop; I do not know the person's name, upon my oath - I sold it where I never sold an article before; I am allowed to do a little on commission - I sold them about a fortnight afterwards; I made a minute of them, but my book is not here - I was not desired not to part with them for less than 12s.; I was to give the prisoner 6s. for them - I do not know of the prosecutor having been summoned by the prisoner; he might not tell me of every transaction - this transaction of the chain and pin was the only one I ever had with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What was the price you got for the chain and pin? A. I sold the two for 7s. 6d. - I was to give him 6s.; the value of the ear-rings was between 5l. and 6l. - I did not see a person named Davis at the prisoner's house.</p>

             BAYFIELD. I am a pawnbroker. I have a pair of ear-rings, which were pawned with me by the prisoner on the 27th of March, in the name of John Smith.</p>
               <p>CHARLES WORLEY. I am a pawnbroker. I have two pairs of ear-rings, pawned with me on the 28th of March by the prisoner, in the name of Nugent - I have known him some time, and thought him a very respectable man; he does not go by the name of Nugent, but I thought this might be an error - this is the duplicate which I wrote, but I might not have recollected his name at that moment: I did not recollect his name, I will swear - he lived in John's-row, Europa-place; he gave me a card in the name of Nugent.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM HALL. I am a constable. I took up the prisoner on the 20th of April - I found in his back room drawer two duplicates, which relate to these ear-rings; I told him I wanted him about Mr. Levyson's ear-rings he at first said it was all right, he had left them with a gentleman at the west-end of the town; I said I had found the duplicates - he then said, "Yes, two pair I sold,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110039"></xptr>three pair I pawned, and one pair a master builder has;" I found him in a room, at No. 7, Albemarle-street, Clerkenwell - Boot had applied to me for a warrant on the 18th of April; Mr. Levyson and Mr. Boot went and pointed out the house to me - the prisoner gave up this note at the office, which Boot says is what he gave him; he went by the name of Samuel Nesbitt.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you ever advise the witness not to pay the prisoner this money? A. I met Boot at the west-end of the town, about three weeks after the prisoner had been in custody; he then said he owed him for a chain and pin - I told him I knew nothing about it, but I thought he had better not give it to the prisoner; the prisoner might have said he was in distress.</p>

            . Q. When did you first know the prisoner was to be found in Albemarle-street? A. When Mr. Levyson found out where he was.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is this the bill you left? A. Yes- it is not such a bill as I should have left with any other customer without the receipt; I have put "Approbation" on it - I did not know where to find the prisoner till Mr. Levyson told me of it; I will swear that I had not had this card in my hand for days before, nor one like it - I did see Davis, and asked him where the prisoner was gone - he said he did not know; I swear that I did not know where he lived till Mr. Levyson found it out, which I believe was the day before he took out the warrant.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Then you mean that Davis had not given you a card, or told you where the prisoner lived? A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I bought the goods in question as I usually buy other goods - there is the bill of parcels; I bought them at three months credit, and a three months bill - Boot said, "As this is the first dealing we have had together, we will have a drop of something to drink;" I sent my daughter for some - I said three pairs of earrings would be sufficient, but he would leave the six pairs - he called the day after, and I said they were out, which they were, for people to look at; it appears this has been through treachery, because I summoned Mr. Levyson - Boot sent a message to me to say, that the warrant would be issued; I produced the bill of parcels, and I said to the young man, "Where can I see Mr. Boot?" he said, "I don't know, but I shall see him tomorrow night" - I said, "Give him this card, I wish to see him, as there is a balance between us;" I had no idea of any thing improper, but on that Saturday night I was in distress - I wanted 15s., and I pawned them; Mr. Levyson called at my house on the Thursday or Friday previous to taking out the warrant - I was busy, and had a gold chain in the fire, and sent my lad down to say I should be down in a few minutes; when I came down he was gone - he said to my wife, "It is of no consequence, I will call as I come back," and then he went and got the warrant.</p>

               <p>MRS. LEVYSON re-examined. Q. When did you first know the prisoner lived in Albemarle-street? A. The day before the warrant was taken; I had sent Boot several times to make inquiries, and he could hear nothing about him -I think he had summoned Mr. Levyson about a month before - it was for work; the prisoner did not purchase the things on credit; I told Boot he should wait till the goods were sold, and bring them back or the money; I asked Nesbitt where the customer lived, in order that I might know the distance he would have to go.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON to MR. LEVYSON. Q. Had you any transactions with the prisoner? A. He had worked for me; I was summoned by him for 17s. and he took 12s. 6d. for it; I have no recollection of having refused to pay him more than 6s., but I know the charge was considered exorbitant - I think the summons was not for 12s. 6d. - I think I can swear it was not; I think it was more according to my receipts - I certainly paid him 12s. 6d. after Boot had made this delivery; I called at the prisoner's former residence and found he had left - I inquired of his neighbours, but they did not know where he was gone to; I had called at his residence before he was apprehended, as I wished to know whether he lived there, but I had then received information, as I called at Davis', who is another workman, and got this paper; Davis had some work of mine which he kept longer than he should have done - I paid him for the work he had done - this was ten or twelve days before the prisoner was apprehended; I do not know when I told Boot of it; I have no doubt I did mention it four or five days after.</p>

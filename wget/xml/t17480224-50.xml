               <p>White. I have been puzzled a good while to get Scott to come to be an evidence, and have been his security for his coming to give evidence, because I would not have this mate escape; so I went for him, and went to his father's, and said I do not know how the Court may take this, it may be taken as if he was an accomplice, and it may be a great damage to him, and desired he might come; and I said if he did not appear against the Prisoner I would transport him.</p>

            . The Captain of the Duke of Cumberland was bad, and not capable of doing his duty, and I went on board to get it dispatched, and I went to one Claghorn that keeps an alehouse for the sugar; and he said I should not have the sugar; I told him I would have it, and I went to the ship for an officer, and sent it on board the ship again: the waterman confessed he carried it on shore by the Prisoner's order. The sugar was carried to the Custom-house, and I petitioned for it, but before I petitioned it was condemned and sold.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I carried this ship out, and I brought her home, if I had a mind to have been a rogue to my King and country, I might have got more than by taking a little dirt. I hope, my Lord , and the Court, and the Gentlemen of the Jury, will take this into consideration; and that as I have belonged to the sea a great many years, I hope they will not believe that I would be a thief for a parcel of dirt and sweepings: he that swears against me wanted to get a friend of his in, in my room.</p>

                  </hi> I am clerk to Mr. Flight, of Bond-court, Walbrook, the prisoner was in his service—his duty was to collect the weekly rents, and occasionally the quarterly rents—he was paid a weekly salary of a guines and a half—what he received one day he had to pay me next morning—he has never accounted to me for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. received of Mrs. Miller, on 27th Oct., 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of Mrs. Lines on 27th Oct., or 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of Mrs. Alforth on 28th—the receipts produced are in his writing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What is Mr. Flight? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A gentleman—he has large estates in houses and landed property—he occasionally discounts a bill—he does not keep an insurance-office—sometimes he has got a friend to insure his life for security—he is not a money-lender—he may have 700 or 800 tenements from which weekly rents are collected—I cannot say to a hundred or so, he may have 600 or 700 from which the rents are collected quarterly—we have a quarterly collector, he is sixteen or seventeen years of age—when he could not enforce payments the prisoner used to get it—it was his business to enforce the quarterly payments, when I instructed him, but not without—I swear positively he had no right to collect quarterly rents without instructions—I did not instruct him to get Miller's, Lines', or Alforth's rent—I have our pass-book her (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—on 3rd Nov. he paid me 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that was the first time he paid me after 28th Oct., but this book merely alludes to the weekly tenants—this is the cash-book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—you will find the weekly tenants entered and classified, and the amounts paid are passed to his credit—there is no entry here to show that these payments only allude to weekly tenants—if he received a quarterly account he would pay it to me, and I should enter it in his presence, not in this book, but in the other—he generally brought me a list—he did not bring me one on 27th, only for his expenses, 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—if he had not received anything from the quarterly tenants he would not bring a list—if he brought money from weekly tenants he would put it down in the book—I do not know London-street—my master has a great many tenants there—they are set down in the books as weekly tenants, but they are very respectable people, and weekly payments are not enforced except with some of them—I believe the prisoner has had to put in distresses—I received nothing but what the tenants owed—the prisoner received his instructions from Mr. Flight in his private office—I may have heard in general conversation that the prisoner remonstrated about putting in distresses to particular people—I do not recollect his saying it was very hard thing to cast that business upon him, or beg that he might be relieved from it—he has not said it to Mr. Flight in my presence that I am aware of.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is he broker himself? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe so—he has all the profit when he distrains—he would collect weekly tenancies, which were allowed to go on, and become quarterly—I believe Miller, Lines, and Alforth, were weekly tenants, but were collected from quarterly—the amount paid on 27th Oct. consisted of weekly tenants—I enter the amount in a</p>

               <p>lamp in the cash-book—the prisoner puts down in the books belonging to each estate, who are the parties who pay him the money, and I examine the adding up—those books are not here—he and I agreed in the amounts every week—the books were made up by the prisoner—I can undertake to say that I have never received these three sums—the prisoner sent a letter and admitted having received so much money—that was after I had been to his house—a clerk went with me—the prisoner was in bed—we told Mr. Flight, and he said we had better see him to-morrow, as he should like to know the amount of his deficiencies—I cannot tell that I told him it would be better for him to say the amount—if I did say so, there was no promise of forgiveness—I might have said so.</p>

                  </hi> I live in Bond-court, Walbrook—the prisoner was my collector, and was paid a weekly salary—he has never accounted to me for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. received of Mrs. Miller, or 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of Mrs. Lines on 27th Oct., or 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of Mrs. Alforth, on 28th Oct.—I have no doubt this letter is his writing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did the prisoner come to your office after you had discovered what you call certain defalcation? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—he requested to be allowed to make up his books—he told me he had paid over some of the sums he had collected from the quarterly tenants, instead of payments he had received from weekly tenants, and he did not believe he owed me anything in the balance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he bring you a list of sums that he had paid which he had not received? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> His statement was, that he had paid in several small sums which he not received—I said, "Admitting that to be true, you have done what you have no business to do, you have lent money to theses people; and secondly, if it is true it only goes to the extent of that amount, and it is idle to say a few pounds would be a set off to 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I do not be<lb></lb>lieve he pretended that there was a balance in his favour—I cannot say how many tenants have not paid—I should say there are very few—I believe, not 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he asked to be allowed to go round to the tenants and point out the people who had not paid, but I refused to have anything more to do with him—I said, "If you have paid money through them, it is a loan from you to them, and I have nothing to do with it"—I do not know that I said he ought to have distrained—I have often said so—I have not complained of his compassionate feeling—I have complained of his neglect—I make it a rule in cases of sickness, or any extraordinary accident, always to forgive the rent—I have heard that the prisoner has been out of his mind—I sent my</p>

               <p>JOHN-WIGHT WICKS sworn. - Q.Were you robbed at any time, and where? - A. Yes, on the 9th of September, between the hours of eight and nine in the evening; I was returning home from Somerset-street, Portman-square; I had a lady with me who had dined at the lame house.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live? - A. In Aikin's-row, Bayswater.</p>

               <p>Q.What sort of persons were they? - A. One was taller than the other by half a head, or thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Q.Was it the taller or the shorter one that did you stop? - A. I think it was the taller one that cried stop, but that I can scarcely tell; the taller one, who immediately saced me, caught hold of my watch-chain and seal; of course momentary resistance took place, by putting my hand against both of them, leaving my companion by herself; during that momentary resistance, the taller one made off, and ran away; still resisting, or rather endeavouring to palliate any thing that might ensue from the shorter one, I was hustled or forced into the road from off the foot-path.</p>
               <p>Q. By whom were you hustled and forced into the road? - A. By the shorster one; when in the road, the man who hustled me did not say any thing, but immediately 
               <persName id="t18020918-122-person826">drew</persName>
             a pistol, which he presented at me, the taller one being in the act of running away, crying, shoot him, d-n him, shoot him, or words to that amount; a coach was just at that moment coming near me; I immediately gave the glarm of thief, very loudly, the person at that time still holding his pistol, making his way, commencing his run, and I followed him down the road.</p>
               <p>Q.During this time, was it sufficiently light to make any observation of the person? - A. It was so light, that I could distinguish the general aspect and appearance of the man who held the pistol.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was it? - A.That man. (Pointing to the prisoner.)</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain? - A.Positively certain: I gave the alarm, and followed him immediately; he had commenced his running away, he was not out of my sight till two gentlemen, whom I had passed before, had stopped him; I myself not being three yards behind him, so that in fact he was between two sires; as soon as I had him in my own hand, which could not be half a second, or scarcely a second; I said, you are the man, sir, that offered the pistol at me; the man then offered to exculpate himself; I would not make any answer till we got him to a public-house, where he was taken by myself and the other two gentlemen, in the way to the public-house; the lady being at some little distance, came up, and immediately said, that is the man that stopped us.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is that public-house? - A. At the end of the row where I reside, at the back part of Knesington-Gardens, it is a continuation of the road; when there I put him in custody of two men, who came in under the names of Bow-street patrols; the man most strennously denied the fact; I asserted positively, before every individual there, that I would describe the pistol, it was the object that struck me; when the prisoner denied having any pistol, I pledged myself, that I would mention it in this particular way; it is an old fashioned brown, round handled pistol, and has all the appearance of a muzzle of a bellows; it struck me at the time, when a school-boy, at Eton, I purchased such an one at an iron shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner drop the pistol? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you first described the pistol, it had not been found? - A. It had not.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the patrol do with the prisoner? - A. I saw no more of him, till I saw him at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose any of your property? - A. The prisoner did not get possession of any property, the one who ran away got possession of the watchchain and the seal, breaking it off close to the pendant of the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a chain was it? - A. A common gilt chain, and two seals, the one was a family gold seal, with the arms, they were both gold seals.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180209180062"></xptr>Q.Have you seen the seals since? - A.I have not.</p>
               <p>Q.Nor chain? - A.Not any part of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. I believe, at the time you took the prisoner, he denied he was the person who held the pistol? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q.The lady who was with you, I believe, appeared alarmed, and he desired her not to be alarmed? - A.Certainly not, I believe she took no sort of notice of him.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see him throw the pistol away? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Perhaps, you were a little alarmed? - A. No, I was not.</p>
               <p>Mrs. ROSE LEONARD sworn. - Q. Were you in company with Mr. Wicks, at the time of this transaction? - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. You were walking home with him? - A. I was.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you meet with any interruption? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You must state what that interruption was? - A. We met two men, one taller than the other; they both ran against Mr. Wicks; the shorter one drove him into the road, and then the taller one went off.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you observed any thing more done before the tall one went off? - A. No; as he was running off, he said, shoot him, d-n him, shoot him.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see any thing taken from Mr. Wicks? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any instrument used by either of them, by which he might shoot him? - A. I did not see the pistol.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you distinguish the persons of either of the men? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner? - A. I know him very well.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he or not one of the men? - A. He was the one that drove Mr. Wicks into the road.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any other circumstance that you are enabled to speak to? - A.Nothing more than I picked up a stick in the road, which was dropped by the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him drop it? - A. No, but the taller one was never in the road.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you positively sure the prisoner at the bar is the person you have described as the short one? - A. I am very sure of it.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the stick you picked up? - A. I delivered it to a person who is here.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys Q. All this violence was addressed to Mr. Wicks, there was none addressed to you? - A. None.</p>

             sworn. - Q. What do you know of this transaction? - A. I was walking with Mr. Sherwin, who had been to my house in Aikin's-row; I observed, when we got to the road, which leads up to Craven-hill, we met two men, one taller than the other; they had sticks in their hands; they ran against us, face to face, as close as could be; I suspected what their intentions were, and put myself in a posture of defence; they passed by, they dared not attack us, we had both of us, sticks; a short time after, we met a gentleman and lady, not above twenty yards from the place where we expected these men to stop us, in a short time after that, I heard a cry of thieves, thieves, stop thief; I immediately turned back, and Mr. Sherwin with me, as hard as we could; I could plainly see the men running away from the gentleman; I came up as quick as I could, one man jumped upon the bank, I saw him jump, and in a moment I seized the other by the breast; the prisoner at the bar immediately said, there he goes, pointing to the one over the hedge, yes, says I, and you shall go too.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing in his hand? - A. I did not, I shook him two or three times, rather in a manner he did not like; he begged for God's sake I would not hurt him, and he would go any where with me; we took him to a public-house; Mr. Wick's was close by, and as soon as the lady saw me bring him up, she said, that is the man; Mr. Wicks desired me to take him to the Blacklion, and take care of him till he came up, which I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the prisoner is the man that passed you? - A. I am sure of it; I said, you are the man that wanted to stop us, you had not courage, I believe.</p>

               <p>Q. They did not say any thing to you, did they? - A. They did not; about thirty or forty yards further, we met the prosecutor and a lady; they passed us, and I suppose, they had not got more than an hundred yards, before we heard the cry of robbers and thieves; we immediately returned, and perceived two men, meeting us directly, and about eight or ten yards before we came up, one jumped up upon the bank; before he had effected his escape, we came up to the prisoner; I saw it was one of the two that we had just passed; we seized him in the way the other witness has described; Mr. Wicks immediately came up, and said, you are the man that held the pistol to my head; we took him to a public-house, and attended the next day; we saw no pistol, nor any weapon that we were afraid of.</p>

At a wax-factory, near Craven-hill; I immediately came up, and saw the two last witnesses have the prisoner in hold; I then went with them to the Black-lion, and after he was given into the custody of the patrol, some company borrowed a lantern, and we searched the ditch.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might that be after the prisoner was secured? - A. It might be ten minutes or a quarter of an hour; some not into the turnip-field, and others searched the ditch; I proposed to Mr. Wicks, that the watchman at the factory should call us up as soon as it was light, in the morning; we searched for the space of five or ten minutes, and then found the pistol that I have now in my hand, in the ditch, it was loaded and cocked; Mr. Wicks had described it before I went to search.(Produces a pistol.)</p>

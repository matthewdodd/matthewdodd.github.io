               <p>Q. In September, 1810, were you present at the sessions house when she was convicted - A. I was present; she was ordered to be in the house of correction one year, and and at the expiration of that time to find sureties for two years more. She was delivered to the governor of the house of correction, and Phillips was sent with her.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember the prisoner coming to your house - A. Yes, it was on the 26th of July, she came at about eleven o'clock in the day; there were three of them; one stood outside the door; the prisoner and another woman came in. The prisoner called for a quartern of cloves; I served her; she gave me a shilling to pay for it; I gave her sixpence in change. They went out, and the moment they went out Johnson (the officer) came in. I shewed him the shilling that the prisoner gave me; the same shilling I marked by his desire. I am quite clear the prisoner is the person that gave me the shilling, and I gave her the liquor.</p>

            . I am a city officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. I do; I have known her some time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her on the 26th of July last - A. I did; I saw her first in Whitecross-street; there was a party of them together; I suppose there were fourteen or fifteen of them, together; the prisoner was supplying them with bad shillings. I know that of my own knowledge. The prisoner was giving some money to the parties before she went off; she was distributing them herself. Three of them set off together; the prisoner at the bar, and two others. I knew the other two before. They went to Old-street; they at last came to Mrs. Marlar; they separated themselves before they came there; they went into several houses before they came there, and when they came to Mrs. Marlar, I placed myself at the bow window, so that I could see them and they could not see me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing tendered from the situation of your place - A. I did, a shilling; the prisoner tendered it after the cloves had been served out. I am sure the prisoner is the person that tendered the shilling. They came out, and immediately I went in and asked Mrs. Marlar to let me look at the shilling; Mrs. Marlar shewed me the shilling; I desired her to mark it; she gave it me; I have had it ever since.</p>

               <p>JURY. How many went in - A. Two went in and one staid out. I kept the shilling. I went after the prisoner, and took her into custody. I did not tell her what I took her in custody for; she knew. I searched her; in her pocket I found this tin box; it contained sixty-eight counterfeit shillings, and three counterfeit sixpences. In another box I found a bit of scowering paper, which appeared to have rubbed the shillings to get the grease off. I also found on her eighteen-pence in copper, good money, and a dollar good, and a sixpence good. I gave them to her. I asked her how she came by the money; she said she found them all.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the shilling that you received of Mrs. Marlar - A. It is.</p>
               <p>JURY. We should like to know where the shilling was put before it went from Mrs Marlar into the officer's hands.</p>

             to Mrs. Marlar. You say, Mrs. Marlar, the prisoner gave you this shilling - A. Yes, I put it into the till with two good shillings; they had letters on them, and this was a plain one. I am sure the one I received of the prisoner I gave to the officer.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the two other shillings had letters on them, and this is a plain one - (The shilling uttered by the prisoner to Mrs. Marlar, handed to the Jury.)</p>
               <p>Mr. 
               <persName id="t18140914-10-person184">Knapp, Q.</persName>
             to the JURY. Has that shilling letters on it - A. Yes, it has.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Marlar. No, that is a mark.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of letters were upon the two shillings in the till - A. One was an A and the other a P stamped with a punch. The mark on the prisoner's shilling is my mark. I had noticed the two good shillings; I know the persons from whom I had actually received them. I have not the least doubt that is the shilling I received of the prisoner. I had only two others in the till.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The gentleman took a false oath. I never offered a base shilling. The other woman is lesser than myself; she gave the shilling. I poured out the liquor. I never gave the shilling; I did not indeed.</p>

            . She pleaded Not Guilty, and put herself upon the Countrey.</p>
               <p>Mary Read, for Mr. Higgins's Ring, against whom Stephen Higgins deposed thus.</p>
               <p>That the Prisoner had been a Customer to the Shop for near a Twelve Month, and used to come with a high Crownd Hat covered with an Oyld Case like a Country Market Woman, and would ask for Rings of Just such a Value, and would have them no more no less. She said she lived at Holloway, and came almost every week to the Shop; but yet she never bought above two in all, she only would cheapen, and he lost a great many, which he believed she stole from him. The Saturday before this Ring was gone, she came to buy a hollow Ring, which she had, and paid for, all but nine pence, and then he lost a Ring. Upon Thursday following when she came, having a suspicion of her, he resolved to lay wait for her. She came and asked for a Ring of such a Value. He reach'd down a Box, in which there were Rings upon every Pin, and laid it before her, she pitch'd upon one, which being weigh'd, she said was too heavy. He, to give her an Opportunity, turn'd his Back, and she took hold on it, and put one into her Bosom. When he turn'd about he presently miss'd the Ring, and affirming the Box was full, tax'd her with it; but she denied it, and offer'd to be Searched. A Gentlewoman who was by, and had seen her put it in her Bosom, told her so, and she offering to undress her Self, they carried her into the Kitchin, and there opening her Bosom the Ring drop'd upon the Bricks in the Floor. And he said it was the Fifth Ring she had stole from him.</p>
               <p>The Woman testified her seeing the Prisoner put her hand to her Bosom, and that she heard it fall upon the Bricks, but did not see it fall. The Value of the Ring was Sworn to be seven Shillings.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner with a great deal of whining denied the thing, and that it was but a Trick of the Goldsmiths to make her pay for Rings he had lost. But the Court told the Jury, the Witnesses Othes were to outway her bare Allegations, and left the Matter to them for the Value.</p>

                  </hi>. I am residing at the Midland Hotel—on the 20th May I was in the City Road—when I came to the corner of Nelson Street I felt a scatch at my breast and missed my watch and part of my chain—this piece (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) remained—on getting to the corner of Nelson Passage I saw a man running; I gave chase—I recognised the prisoner by his slim appear<lb></lb>ance; I couldn't see his face—I followed him through Nelson Passage and George Street, and I called out "Stop thief!"—I could not catch him—the crowd impeded my progress, but they cried to me to run—I next saw him at the police-station—when I got to the station I told the inspector what had happened to me, and he wrote it down—I gave no description beyond that the man had on black clothes, and was of a slim figure, and wore a loose black tie—as he ran down the passage I could see the black ends of the tie floating over his shoulder—he had that tie on when I saw him at the station—the prisoner was brought in while I was at the station by the</p>

I was in the City Road on this Saturday after<lb></lb>noon at 2.30—I saw Cardus walking along, and when he got close to Nelson Street I saw the prisoner make a snatch at his pocket, and run down Nelson Passage—I was sent for to the station, and picked him out of fifteen men.</p>

I live at 4, Whitmore Terraco, Hoxton—on Saturday afternoon, 20th May, I was standing at the comer of George Row, leading from the City Road, and saw the prisoner run very fast up Waterloo Street—a female asked me if I saw a man running that way, and then Mr. Cardus came up—on the Sunday I was sent for to the station, and on Monday morning I picked the prisoner out—I have no doubt he is the man I saw running.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I picked you out of four or five—the inspector told me to go up and touch you, and I did so—I had no conversation with Cardus on Sunday morning; I didn't see him till Monday—I was told on Saturday that a man was in custody for this robbery when the policeman came to my house—after I saw you cross the street I told a constable that he had just lost a chance—I only knew the constable by sight; he knew where I lived when he was told.</p>

               <p>about a quarter before eight o'clock, I was at my stand in Covent-garden, and saw the female prisoners go to Mr. Pankhurst's stand, two stands from mine on the same side—his name is Thomas Henry—they waited four or five minutes, till his attention was taken off—Gammon then took a basket—I followed her to Hart-street—she put it on the ground, put the apples into a sack, put the basket into a cart, and carried the sack—I followed her to the Garrick Hotel, Bow-street—James Jeffery then took the sack from her, and put it into a cart—I went and told Mr. Pankhurst—the barrow remained there till I came back—I took the beadle to it, and said, "This is the sack I saw the apples emptied into"—I then took him to a cart in Hart-street, and he found a basket with the name of Wilson on it—I had lost the prisoners—I went to the market, staid three or four minutes, saw Gammon and Elizabeth Jeffery, I followed them to the corner of James-street, and gave them in charge.</p>

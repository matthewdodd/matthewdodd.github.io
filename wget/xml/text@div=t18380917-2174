                  </hi>. I am a seaman. I lodge with Margaret Byrne, in Twine-court—the prisoner came to stop there. On the 3rd of Sep<lb></lb>tember, I came on shore after dinner, and found her there with Byrne—I undressed myself and went to bed—the prisoner played a frolic with my clothes—she put them all on, dressed herself in them, and went out she came back with them on, and put them where she took them from—I went to sleep afterwards, and about eleven o'clock I missed every thing but <hi rend="italic">my</hi> waistcoat—Mrs. Byrne was in bed with me—I found her still in bed—I have never seen my clothes since.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Gray's-buildings, opposite Mrs. Byrne—I saw the prisoner, about four o'clock, dressed in men's clothes—she came back again, came into my house, and sat down on a trunk—I said, Be careful about the man's clothes"—she said, "I will"—she went into the house—I did not see her again till nine o'clock, when she had on her morning gown; and about half-past ten, she and a young man stood at the door—she went in, and came out with a bundle in a coloured apron, locked the door, took the key with her, and went away with the man, towards Back-lane—I saw either the sleeve of a jacket, or the leg of a pair of trowsers hanging out of her apron.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I went with the prosecutor to 5, Bluegate-place, and found the prisoner in a back room—I asked her if a girl was there named Nicol—she said no—I looked about the room, then came down stairs, and, as I was going to search the back part of the blouse for the girl, I beard glass rattling in front of the house—I opened the door, and saw the prisoner making her escape from the first-floor window, to the house opposite—she had broken two panes of glass in slipping down, in the window below her—I followed her, and took her—the prosecutor said, "That is the girl, I give her in charge"—she begged for mercy, and said if he would not give her in charge, it should be all right to-morrow, she was in circumstances to do so, she would replace the things, and she was sorry for what she had done—she admitted pawning the prosecutor's shoes, but denied all knowledge of the other things.</p>

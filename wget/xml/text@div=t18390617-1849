                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Howes, and live in Gros<lb></lb>venor-street, Commercial-road. On Thursday, the 23rd of May, I left my house between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, and double locked the door, leaving nobody in the house—I had some property in a drawer in my front parlour—my children went to school in the morning, and were left in care of Mrs. Jordan, to whom I gave the key of my door—when I came home, between ten and eleven o'clock at night, I found the drawers open, and missed the articles stated—my window was shut to—it fastens with a bolt, which was taken out, and the window left wide open—a square of glass had been broken before, and a piece of pasteboard was nailed up, and that was pushed away to get at the bolt.</p>

The prosecutrix's children were left in my charge that day with the key, and at a quarter past seven o'clock in the evening I went to the house to put them to bed—I had a difficulty at first in getting in at the door—when I got in I saw several things lying about the parlour, and the drawers open—I went up stairs, and other things laid about there in the same way—the back window was open, and the pasteboard pushed down.</p>

On the 23rd of May I went into Grosvenor-street, with a lot of gravel, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon—I saw the prisoner Strude and two others, who I know, but they are not here—I saw Strude cross, and put his hand inside the palings of Mrs. Howe's house—it is a door in the fence nailed up—that would have opened the gate if it had not been nailed up—he then</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bit and spur-maker, in St. Martin's-lane. The prisoner was in my employ for nine weeks, till 23rd April—she left me on that day, and on the following day I missed a diamond ring from my bed<lb></lb>room—this is it—it had been kept in a jewel-case, in a drawer in a chest of drawers, in my sleeping-room—I thought it was worth 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I think I have overrated it—I had seen it about a fortnight or three weeks before.</p>

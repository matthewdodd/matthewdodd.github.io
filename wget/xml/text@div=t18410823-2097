                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Bryant Hills, a corn<lb></lb>dealer, in Red Lion-street, Holborn. The prisoner was in our service for about four months, and left without notice, about twenty minutes before six in the morning, before I was up—I missed from a room up-stairs, in which nobody slept, two sovereigns, a shawl, 2nd other articles, from a drawer—I have since seen some of them—I had missed the keys of the drawer where the sovereigns were, and one key was found under the prisoner's bed, which opened a drawer where the other keys were kept.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I took the prisoner in charge at Enfield-wash, in a room occupied by Mrs. Abbott—I found in the room, on the table, and on a chair, an apron and shawl—the handkerchief was on her neck—she began crying, and said she had stolen some money, and gave it to Mrs. Smith, who led her astray, and she was innocent enough before she got acquainted with Smith.</p>

These are my things, and part of what I lost—I had no character with her—I knew her mother lived with respectable families—I know Mrs. Smith—I cannot say whether she has led her astray.—if she had given me information we should have had a warrant, and searched Smith's premises—Smith's husband was our horse-keeper, but is discharged—they lived in our yard—my husband is a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> proprietor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. Mrs. Smith told me on Sunday she wanted some money, as she had kept back part of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> money from Mr. Hills, and she would make it up again before mistress came home.</p>

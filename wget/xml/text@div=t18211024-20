On the 17th of October I was sitting at work on the second floor, and heard the latch of my mother's parlour door lifted up. I listened, and heard it a second time, and a noise like a door being burst open. I immediately went down stairs, and found the street door open, which I had latched about half an hour before, and on turning round I found the parlour door open; I shut the street door, and pushed the parlour door quite open, it was a-jar; I found the prisoner at the top drawer of the bureau, with his hand in it; he turned round, and put on his hat. I asked what he wanted - he made no answer, but attempted to push me away, to get out; I held him by the arm, and called Faulkner, the lodger, who detained him till I went for my mother, who was out; on coming home she examined her drawers, in the prisoner's presence, and missed a shawl from the top drawer - he immediately said it was not out of the house; Faulkner asked him where it was - he pulled off his hat, and tried to throw the shawl out, Faulkner told him to keep it in till the officer came, and when he came he took it out of his hat.</p>

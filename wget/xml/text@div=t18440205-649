                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Burgess, pawnbroker, Chichester-place. On the 23rd of Jan. I was in the shop—I saw in a looking-glass, which was placed for the purpose of seeing persons at the door, the prisoner standing at the door—by the manner in which she was handling the gown which hung there, I watched her, and saw her take one pin out—she put her hand and took out the second pin—I ran round the counter, and by that time she had got it down, and secreted it under her shawl—I pushed her into the shop, and sent for a policeman—I said she had stolen the gown—she said she did not know what she was pushed in for—she was pushed up into a corner—she moved her body about, and I saw the gown on the ground by ber feet.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I was with Mr. Wallis about a quarter before eight, I drove the chaise, I can only say the same that Mr. Wallis said; I perceived the men some distance, before they attacked us, I perceived the prisoner coming down the hill, he was the first of the three, I am sure of the prisoner, he was the only one of the three I had the opportunity of seeing; at the moment when they came opposite to my mare's head, the prisoner strove to catch hold of the reins of the chaise horse, I gave the mare a couple of strokes, and the prisoner gave me a stroke with the back part of the cutlass over my left arm, thinking, I suppose, I should drop the reins.</p>
               <p>He did not wound you? - No; he did not; one of them came and robbed me while the prisoner robbed my friend; I am sure this is the man that robbed the prosecutor, Wallis, he held a pistol to his breast, and a cutlass.</p>
               <p>Wallis. I saw a pistol and a cutlass, which took my attention more than the man a great deal.</p>
               <p>Did you see any thing done with the cutlass? - No, I did not see him strike.</p>
               <p>Mr. Keys, prisoner's Council. Did the man that robbed you go away immediately from the chaise, after he had robbed you? - Yes, he bid me turn my head about, which I very readily did; after he took the basket of fowls, I did not see him offer to strike any person; this transaction was a minute about, or two, three or five, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>To Daniel. The prisoner was a perfect stranger to you before this transaction? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long do you imagine it was about? - I thing it was about five minutes; he was longer in robbing my friend, than the others were in robbing me; at the time we were about the bustle of the mare, I had as much view of him as I have of you now, and for a considerable way, he was coming down the hill, I had a particular view of him every way, I particularly observed him before he came.</p>
               <p>Had you no terror on your mind at this time? - No, I had not, only when one of the prisoners threatened to shoot my dog, my attention was taken up with one more than the other; I knew all the three, and my friend knows them too, if he chuses to speak; the other two men were convicted on my evidence last sessions.</p>
               <p>What are you? - I am a tea-dealer.</p>
               <p>Where do you live? - In Southampton-street, Covent Garden; I was taken into a room, where the other men were, with twelve or thirteen, and I picked them out directly.</p>
               <p>How long was it before you saw these prisoners again? - I suppose it was a month.</p>
               <p>Mr. Keys prisoner's Council. If the prisoner struck at you, it must be across your friend? - Yes it was.</p>
               <p>Yet your friend could not see that? - I do not wonder at that, he was a good deal terrified.</p>
               <p>Court. Where did you see this man after the robbery? - At Litchfield-street, at the Rotation-office, he was taken up at Litchfield-street, and I was sent for.</p>
               <p>Was he with other people at that time? - No, he was not.</p>
               <p>When you gave evidence of the person of the prisoner, had you described the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How? - In black clothes.</p>
               <p>How was he dressed when you saw him? - As he is now.</p>
               <p>And was you sure he is the man? - Yes, I was clear he was the man.</p>
               <p>How long have you lived in Southampton-street? - About sixteen years.</p>
               <p>You have not a doubt about? - No, I have not indeed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Keys. My Lord, the prisoner wished to have postponed his trial, on account of the absence of his witnesses, and I can only say, that if they had been here, they would have proved, that this young man's uncle is a man of reputation, and lives at Ealing; that the prisoner has been an officer, and since the peace he has been supported by his uncle, and bears a good character.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>When I was brought to Litchfield-street, I was pointed out by Dixon and Blacketer, two men that belong to the office, to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178510190014"></xptr> gentleman who was robbed; I heard one man in particular, make answer, and say, that is the man; any body might have been sworn to equally with me, I am innocent.</p>
               <p>Court to Daniel. Was the prisoner pointed out to you as the man that robbed you, or did you yourself know him? - No, he was not pointed out, the prisoner was taken up on my information, and he told a long story before the Justice, that he was down at Folkston, from the first of August to the second of September; I had been there for some time.</p>

On the 7th of April, about nine o'clock in the evening, I fell in with the prisoner in Woodstock-court, near Oxford-street, at a house. I met her there by chance - we got into conversation; I had only been a few days in town - I said, I had no residence, and we slept together there; she got up while I was asleep, about six o'clock; but I awoke before she was gone, and saw her with my clothes in her hand; my money was in my pocket, and my watch on the table; she said she was looking for money to fetch some beer; I said, I wished she would, for I was thirsty - she went out and never returned. I found my pockets empty, and my watch gone. I found her in the evening at her lodgings - she acknowledged having pawned my watch; and said she had lost the duplicate, but had a certificate, and would return it to me at Mrs. Baker's, at one o'clock, but she never came. I found her in the evening, and she delivered me a certificate of the watch, pawned for 30 s.; I gave her in charge. I swear I did not give her the watch - the door was bolted inside. I had been at the house one night before.</p>

            . I keep this house; the prisoner came in to wait for another female who was up stairs: the prosecutor had been at my house from the Saturday before; they went up stairs together; she came down in the morning, and said the gentleman had lost his money, and borrowed sixpence of me to fetch some gin; she said the gentleman had no money, and she was inclined to pawn his watch to pay her; I desired her not, and she said she would not. I did not see her again till next day, when she brought the certificate; the prosecutor has slept at my house every night till now, as he has no money.</p>

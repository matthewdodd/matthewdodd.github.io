               <p>Q. Did you lose a quantity of wearing apparel at any time. - A. Yes, on the 5th of last month. I lodge backwards in the yard; the prisoner lodged with me for a week, in the same room; I go out washing. I did not miss the articles till I came home; I kept these things in my drawer and in my box; there were no locks to them. I went out to work on that morning about half<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180801130057"></xptr>after six, I returned home about half past ten at night; I found all these things; gone they were all safe in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner return to her lodging. - A. No. I saw my things on Wednesday the 6th of January; I saw the prisoner the next day where she had lodged that night in Chick-lane; she had part of the things with her. I gave her in charge of the constable, he took the things and the duplicates.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a baker, and live in Portman-street, Marylebone. I was in my shop on Tuesday afternoon, 19th April—the prisoner came there first about 5 o'clock, or a quarter past 5—I am quite sure it was him—he came for a penny loaf—I served him, and he gave me a shilling—I gave him change, and put the shilling into a bowl in the till, where there was no other money—after he was gone 1 looked at the shilling—it was bad—I ran to the door to see for the prisoner, and could not see him—I locked the shilling up in the desk—I saw the prisoner a second time; he came again in about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes—I am sure he was the same man; I knew him the moment he entered—I did not see him come in; I was in the parlour; my sister-in-law was in the shop—I saw him in the shop—he came for another penny loaf—I ran out to see whether he gave any more bad money—I saw him hand a shilling to my sister—I took it out of my sister's hand—it was bad, and I told the prisoner so—he said he did not know it, and gave me another shilling that was good—I stopped him, and gave him in charge—I gave the two bad shillings to the constable, and the good one.</p>

On the 16th of August, at five o'clock in the morning, I got up, being unwell - I came down, opened the parlour window, and sat there till six o'clock; I then rang my servant up, and returned to my bed-room; in a quarter of an hour I heard her give a scream below - I was alarmed, and made inquiry; I found a clock was gone, which had cost me twelve guineas - I had had it twelve or thirteen years; it was worth ten guineas - also two tea-spoons, worth 2s. I could learn nothing except from a witness.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Greig. I came down at half-past six o'clock in the morning, and went into the kitchen - I opened the shutter, and saw two men fall from the parlour window - they did not see me; I cannot say who they were - they were much the same size as the prisoner. I could not perceive that they had any bundle. I ran up to the parlour, and gave a scream. I missed the clock from the side-board in the parlour, and two spoons from the dumb-waiter; they were safe when I went to bed. One of the men appeared to me to have fustian clothes on.</p>

            . I am a smith. On Thursday morning, the 16th of August, I was passing Mr. Greig's house, and observed the prisoner and another lurking about opposite - I passed on to the end of the square, stopped there a few minutes, and presently saw the prisoner run up the prosecutor's garden, and receive a parcel from a man at the window; the man jumped from the window; there was another outside, and they all three ran off together. I have no doubt of the prisoner's person, having seen him before.</p>

            . I live within fifty yards of Mr. Greig. I was going out on the 16th of August, and saw the prisoner pass me - he was running, and I noticed him pull his jacket off; I stopped, and looked at him particularly; at that moment another came up, with a clock under his arm, covered with a white cloth or something. The prisoner pulled his jacket off, and threw it over the clock, so that nobody could see it. I followed them down New Peter-street - they went through a court, into Duck-lane. I returned, and met Mr. Greig's son running after them; I told him what I had seen. I saw the prisoner in custody three or four days afterwards, and was positive he was the one who covered his jacket ever the clock, not the one who carried it.</p>

            . I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner on Wednesday, the 22d of August; I told him it was for a clock. I asked him when he was in Vincent-square last; he said he had never been in Vincent-square all the summer. Quin, the other man, is now in custody in the House of Correction, under a sentence of three months' imprisonment.</p>

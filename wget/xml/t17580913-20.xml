Some time after, my maid came and told me the sawyers were gone from work, and that the watch was missing.

I took them before justice Keeling, but could not make any thing of them. On the, Thursday following my maid missed a silver milk-pot, then I took them both before justice Fielding; I found Evans, the evidence, had got a silver stock-buckle, and a better coat than he had before, from which I strongly suspected that they had the things. Before the justice, Evans confessed the watch was pawn'd on Snow-hill for a guinea, to one Mr. Brown, and that they knocked the milk-pot to pieces, and sold it to a Jew.</p>

This watch (taking it in her hand) is the property of my master; it was lost on the 12th of August, between the hours of two and three; the prisoner and evidence worked at sawing for my master, they had been there that morning, till about eleven o'clock; they both came back again, between the hours of two and three, and went into the yard to their saw-pit, they soon came out of the yard through the entry.</p>

               <p>Q. When was this ?</p>
               <p>Haines. This was about a month ago, on a Saturday; my master was not at home, we did not go to work; we went to go out of the yard, and when in the entry, the maid asked us who was there; we said the sawyers; we took the watch from off the nail by the fire-side in the kitchen.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the door open or shut when the prisoner took the watch?</p>
               <p>Haines. It was open; that door used to stand open, and we had seen the watch several times before. After we had taken the watch, we went and pawn'd it on Snow-hill for a guinea.</p>

               <p>Q. Who pawn'd it?</p>

               <p>Haines. I do not know, I never saw him before, neither do I know where we found him; we went from Snow-hill to him, it was in an open place near Tower-hill.</p>

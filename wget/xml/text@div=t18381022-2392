                  </hi>. I live in Portland-street, Oxford-street, with my father, who is a carman—I look after Mr. Lee's pony and chaise—I have known the prisoner two years—on the 23rd of September, about six o'clock in the evening, I met him in Portland-street—he told me he had got no money, and asked if I could let him sleep in the it able—I did so—I had a leather purse containing nine sovereigns and a half, which I kept on a high beam in the stable—I had been four or five months saving it—I locked him in the stable, and in the morning unlocked the door, and let him out a little after seven o'clock, and my purse was gone—I had seen it safe the night be went to the stable—it has not been found, nor any of the money—I saw him afterwards, and charged him with it—he said if I was to kick him from here to Birmingham I should not find it on him, and said, "Do you think if I had 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I should stop about this neighbourhood?"</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. I never said so—I said I did not know anything about it—it was about six days after that I saw him, and he did not say a word about it to me. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. No, because there were two <hi rend="italic">pals</hi> with him—I thought if I spoke I should get ray head knocked off.</p>

                  </hi>. I am agent to Messrs. Chaplin and Home, the railway carriers, and have an office in Billingsgate Market—on Thursday morning, the 2nd of November, at about half-past 9 I saw the two prisoners—I was standing at my window—there was a van of Messrs. McNamara's nearly opposite—Rains had charge of it—he was delivering boxes of fish to the porters—I saw him deliver three to Blackburn—the boxes had the letter "M" upon them—there was a cart standing near the pavement, and he put these boxes in it—shortly afterwards Rains delivered to Blackburn two more boxes, marked with the figure "8"—Blackburn turned the boxes upside down, and threw a sack over them—and as soon as be had done that he put his hands in the pockets of his "smock" and walked away—I went and looked at the cart, and found it had the name of Grisley on it, some<lb></lb>where down by Bow—I then told one of Mr. McNamara's clerks what I had seen—the herrings were found afterwards, but not in the cart—while I was looking from my window, Rains was delivering boxes to some porters on the other side of the van—the van would hold, I should think, about 300 boxes—the porters receiving on one side of the van could not see what was going on on the other—Blackburn had his boxes from the side where the regular porters were not working—I have known Blackburn about fourteen years—he is a porter there.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> During those fourteen years have you ever known of his being dishonest? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Never—the window I was looking out of was at my own private house—it was the second-floor window—the van was stand<lb></lb>ing in the centre of the street—Blackburn wore the ordinary dress of a porter, a whitey-brown smock-frock—after I had taken a cup of coffee I went down to McNamara's office—their office is the same as mine, we have it between us—it is in Lower Thames-street—I saw Blackburn about a quarter of an hour after that—there was a boy in the office, and he was asked if Blackburn was the man that moved the herrings, and he said he thought he was not, he thought the man bad a longer "smock" on—when I first saw Blackburn he had a dirty "smock," and three-quarters of an hour afterwards he had a clean one on—he had changed his dress—the second time I saw him he was outside McNamara's office, and one of McNamara's men asked him to go and change his dress—I suppose they wanted to identify him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager to Messrs. McNamara—on Thursday, the 2d of November, Rains had charge of one of our vans at Billingsgate-market—that van was laden with two dozen boxes of herrings, which were to be delivered at the market—it was his duty to deliver them—those marked "M" were to be delivered to Mr. Dearsley, and those marked with the letter "8" to Mr. Jex—he had no authority to deliver them to anybody else—I received some information from Mr. Woodgate, and in consequence of that Blackburn was brought into our office—I afterwards saw five boxes of herrings—they were delivered to me from Mr. Grisley's cart—three of them were marked "M" and two "8"—the "M's" were Mr. Dearsley's and the "8's" Mr. Jex's, and they ought to have been delivered to them—I know nothing of Blackburn, only as a porter working in the market—after I had got the boxes, I asked Rains how he had delivered his load, and whether he had delivered any to anybody but the regular men—he said no, he had not, he did not know anything about it—I asked him to come from the van into the office to see if he had delivered any to Blackburn—Black<lb></lb>burn</p>

               <p>was in the office, but he objected to come and identify him—I do not think he has been in our employ long, but he has been delivering at Billings-Bate for the last three or four weeks every day—we generally deliver a great quantity to Mr. Dearsley, he is a very large salesman—and to Mr. Jex too—MR. Harris, one of our clerks, asked Blackburn to change his clothes—he Bid this in order that a boy who had seen him might identify him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did he come back in his porter's dress? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the boy could not identify him, because he did not take much notice of him.</p>

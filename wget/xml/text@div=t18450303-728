                  </hi>. I am a seaman, and live at the Sailors' Home in Well-street. Last Saturday night I was crossing Tower-hill with Deacon—we met the two prisoners and another—they were not dressed as they are now—they came up to me—I pushed them away, and told them to be off—I had a bundle in my hand, and in pushing them away I dropped it—I stooped to pick it up, and found Pierse's hand in my right-hand trow<lb></lb>sers pocket—I had my watch, and felt, and it was gone—I saw Peirse put had hand behind her, and there was another girl behind her who ran off—I took Peirse, and held her till I gave her to the policeman—I know I had my watch safe four or five minutes before, when I crossed London-bridge—I took it out to see the time, and I had my hand on it when the prisoners came up to me.</p>

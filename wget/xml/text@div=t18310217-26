            . I am a house-broker, and live in Lambeth walk. On the 6th of January, about half-past eleven o'clock in the morning, I was crossing out of Ave Maria-lane into Stationer's-court, and saw the prisoner in company with four others - they were all together; I watched them, and saw the prisoner take a handkerchief from a gentleman's left-hand coat pocket - the gentleman was coming out of the passage into <placeName id="t18310217-26-crimeloc187">Ave Maria-lane</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18310217-26-crimeloc187" type="placeName" value="Ave Maria-lane"></interp>

               <p>JURY. Q. How did he get the handkerchief into his own pocket? A. He put it into his breeches pocket - it appeared the same sort of handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You say you are a broker? A. I have said so - I took a licence out to buy furniture and to sell it; I have been here before - I was here the very day the prisoner was taken; as I was accidentally passing in the Strand, I saw a boy cut a window with a pebble, and was here about that - I have not been here before that for twelve months; I suppose by your manner you are talking to the prisoner at the bar - I hope you will not hurt my feelings because I have come to tell the truth - I cannot say how often I have been here; I think I can swear I have not been here half a dozen times besides.</p>

               <p>Q. Has it always been to give evidence against some person guilty of felony? A. I believe not - I cannot recollect what it was; I was in company with a person when the boy cut the glass in the Strand - he was not an officer; to the best of my recollection I have not been here a dozen times - I never was in this Court a dozen times, and never was in the other as a witness; I have been hearing trials.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear you have not been a witness in both Courts? A. I do not - I believe I have not been on this side of the water on such unpleasant business for the last six years; I will not swear I have not been here within twelve months - I do not recollect that I have; I do not think I have sworn the last time I was here was six years ago - to the best of my recollection, the circumstance in the Strand is the only one; my memory does not furnish me with any other.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, what is the name of the person who was with you on that occasion? A. I really cannot tell, though it was a very respectable gentleman who lives in the Strand, a glover, but on my oath I cannot tell his name - he lives within a dozen doors of Charing-cross; he was not before the Justice - he left me to follow the prisoner; he did not know where I was gone - I do not recollect whether I told the Justice I had a friend with me when it happened - he left me when I was fool enough to follow the prisoner; I do not recollect that I have said I called on him to notice what was going on - I do not recollect that I did so; I only saw one handkerchief found on the prisoner - I do not know how much is allowed per day to witnesses here - I do not recollect what I got on the former occasion; the Policeman received it, and the expences were divided.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How much did you get? A. The gentleman gave me a sovereign for being at Hick's-hall, here, and before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What is the name of the Policeman? A. I do not know - I have received nothing on this occasion; I do not expect any thing - if his Lordship is pleased to give me my expences, if not I must submit to lose my time; I do not come here for the expences - my name is on my door, and my business also.</p>

            . I am a Ward-officer. I was coming out of my door, No. 2, Creed-lane, and heard a cry of Stop thief! - I turned round directly, and saw about fifty people running down Ave Maria-lane towards Creed-lane, pursuing the prisoner, who was running; he went down Creed-lane, and was running from the cry -I stopped him; Shackell came up immediately, and said, in his presence, that he had picked a gentleman's pocket in Stationer's-court - I searched him, and found this handkerchief - he assisted me in taking it out; I cannot say whether it was in his small-clothes or his pocket - he said he had picked it up; he was taken before the Magistrate, and remanded - Sir

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you been a Ward-officer? Q. Not quite twelve months - the prisoner was not present when I gave my deposition; he was locked up - the deposition was read over to him afterwards; I did not mention to the clerk that the prisoner said he had picked it up - I was merely asked if I took him in charge, and had the property; I only found one handkerchief on him - I swear there were fifty people in pursuit of him: Shackell was the only one that spoke about him - the prisoner had a rag, which might serve for a handkerchief; I gave it him back again - he was dressed in a sort of brown frock coat; Shackell did not point out any body who had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183102170037"></xptr>lost his handkerchief - nobody came to the office with him to my knowledge; nobody was examined but him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, of 10, Star Lane, Canning Town—on Wednesday, 4th July, I was drinking with the prisoner and he went home with me to my lodgings—I was tired, suffering with a bag leg, and laid on the bed to rest it—he shoved me over on the bed and said he was tired too, and laid down by the side of me—I was not sober—my purse was in my outside coat pocket, I saw it there a few minutes before I laid down—about two or three minutes afterwards I felt his hands in my pockets—he left me and I slept—the next morning I missed ray purse and three sovereign—in the afternoon I missed a serge jacket and shirt—after giving him in charge I found he had got two knives and a pipe of mine in his possession—the pri<lb></lb>soner was potman at the beer-house where we had been drinking—the day after I missed the things I went with two police officers and found the pri<lb></lb>soner</p>

               <p>at the beer-shop—I identify the two knives and pipe and the shirt and jacket produced; I had them the day before, in company with the prisoner; the jacket was hanging on the chair back and the shirt on a line—I did not give the prisoner any of those things; I made him a present of other articles previously; I intended to give him an old jacket on the night in question, but not this one.</p>

I went with the prosecutor on the evening of 5th July and found the prisoner at the Robin Hood beer-house—I charged him and he said "I know nothing of the money, I have heaps of my own; I haven't got it"—he said the prosecutor gave him the serge jacket and shirt—he was taken to the station and searched, and a duplicate to of the two knives and pipe, identified by Egan, were found in his possession—I went the nest day with the prosecutor to the pawnbroker's, when he identified the jacket and shirt.</p>

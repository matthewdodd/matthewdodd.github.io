                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Frederick Maris, a pork-butcher, in Shoreditch. The prisoner solicited washing, ironing, and mangling from us—my servant, in my presence, gave her a bundle con<lb></lb>taining the articles stated, on the 27th of January, to iron—she ought to have returned them on the Saturday evening—I did not see her again till she was at Worship-street a fortnight afterwards—her brother was taken first.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer of Worship-street. On Friday, February the 5th, the prisoner came to the office, and asked if there had been a boy com<lb></lb>mitted on the wednesday previous, as she wished particularly to know—I told her to wait, and I would look at the book and examine—I did so, and found it was a boy committed to the House of Correction, for illegally pawning a gown—thought that the prisoner was the sister of that boy whom the officers had been told to look after—I then took her, and placed her at the bar—she said, "He is my brother; I am come to pay the money"—I searched her, and found a shirt, two collars, and various other things, which have been identified by the prosecutor—they were in a bundle who she had at that time.</p>

            . I am a watchman my box is near the Bull and Gate. On the 1st of June I had just called the hour of the night, when the prisoner at the bar came to me, he said you make a worse noise than a ship's corporal on board a ship but you have a better light; he was taken at the corner of Queen-street. He and I walked to the box close to the Bull and Gate, he asked me how <note>[Text unreadable in original.]</note>t was to the top of Holborn; I told him; and then sat down in my box; he had nothing with him then. About half an hour afterwards I went out, I saw him rolling something up in a cloth, I thought it was a bed quilt as he came out of the gate, the pocket being narrow, I saw what he had got; I asked him where he was going, he said to Gravesend, I took him by the collar and told him he should go to the watchhouse: he took the two cushions from his shoulder, they were covered<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180707010062"></xptr> up in a great horse rug; he said if I took him to the watchhouse he would cut my guts out, and struck me in the face.</p>
               <p>(The property produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My lord, and gentlemen of the jury, on the 1st of June last, I received directions from captain Fowler, of his majesty's ship Britannia, to come to London to look after my prize money. On my arriving at Gravesend, I took the boat to London; when I arrived at Billingsgate, I went with a girl of the town to the Bull and Gate, which is a house for the reception of prostitutes, and there at the corner of the gateway I saw a bundle, I took it up and swore I fell in with a prize. The watchman was calling the hour, he says you are half seas over, what prize is this you have got; I opened the bundle, I said they will do for my hammoc; I am an innocent far. I have served his majesty eighteen years, I was with lord Howe on the 1st of June; I have sailed with lord Duncan, and I was in the action of Trasalgar, with the immortal Lord Nelson.</p>
               <p>Q. (to Parr). Had he any girl of the town with him when you saw. - A. No, he was alone.</p>

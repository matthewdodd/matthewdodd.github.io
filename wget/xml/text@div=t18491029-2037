                  </hi>. I live at 4, Maryland-buildings, Rotherhithe; my father, James Driscoll, keeps the house. About a quarter before one o'clock, on the 24th Sept., I was awoke by a noise—I threw up the sash and saw the prisoner getting out of the parlour window—he turned and held up his fist, and said, "I am sorry I did not do for the lot of you"—I went down stairs, and found the parlour window open; it had been safe between eight and nine o'clock the night before—the window was shut down, but not fastened—the prisoner lodged next door to us at that time, but the people have removed since he has been in prison.</p>

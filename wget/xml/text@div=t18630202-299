I have heard Funnell's statement up to the time the prisoners were brought to the station—I believe it is correct—when they were brought to the station, I asked them whether they could give me any information about the person from whom they bought the silk—Tunn said, "A few weeks back we met a man, dressed as a porter, in Cannon-street; he asked us if we were buyers of hair nets, as he could get some cheap; we told him we were, provided they were cheap; we gave him our address in Bread-street-hill, and the next morning he called and brought us a piece of black silk; I asked him if he had got any nets; he said not then, bat we should have some; we bought that piece of silk; two or three mornings afterwards the same man called, and brought two pieces of silk; I still kept asking him about the nets, and he said we should have some; altogether we bought six or seven pieces of silk of him, which we afterwards give to Hutley, and he disposed of them; we were to give him a shilling a yard all round"—when the charge was read over to them, the name of Messrs. Leaf was mentioned in it, and they both said, "We did not know it came from Mr. Leaf"—I afterwards went to No. 2, Bread-street-hill, which might be about 300 yards from Leaf's warehouse—there was no appearance of business going on there; no fittings or furniture—the place was in a filthy, dirty state—no boxes with hair nets in them, or anything of that kind.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Does not the value of silk vary very much? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> When there is a difference in the price of the raw silk, there is necessarily a great deal of difference in the price of the made silk—this is Spitalfields silk—goods of this description are a very small branch of the trade—it is perhaps the smallest branch of the silk trade that there is—it is not uncommon—it is as liable to fluctuation as every other—this silk may have been on our premises some time—the cases were dirty—the piece that is marked to sell at 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. I gave 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for, and the one that is marked to sell at 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. I gave 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for—I cannot tell you when I bought them—I do not mark the dates when I buy goods—it is a frequent occurrence in the trade that silks are sold in job lots—I never knew myself of people buying silks and pawning them—I never saw Cole before, to my knowledge—I am quite sure these silks were in stock on the Monday after Christmas-day—I don't know exactly what the date was—I am quite sure that the piece pawned on 1st January was in stock on 28th December—my department is in the further corner, the first branch of the house—these silks were kept in the actual corner of my department, in shelves, which are made for that purpose—they were kept tied up in brown paper—there are counters in front of the shelves—the goods are arranged in shelves—I can't say whether, if any one came there, they could abstract a piece of silk without my knowing it—I am often out in the day—there are hundreds of people in the establishment, I should think—I can hardly tell, it is so large.</p>

               <p>JOHN GRIFFITHS. On Saturday the 1st of August, I was sent for to Mrs. Levy's house; I went up one pair of stairs. In the room I saw the prisoner, with another soldier, sitting in Levy's room; he had got a small quantity of rhubarb before him; I believe it was in the scale: she gave charge of him for stealing this bowl; I took them both to the office. The prisoner said in the clerk's office to Mrs. Levy, that he knew the man that stole it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord and gentlemen of the jury, never was a case before a rational jury more to be pitied than mine. My prosecutrix knows well I am not guilty of the crime. I went to her house on the 1st of August, a very unlikely thing for me to do if I was guilty. Mrs. Levy asked me where the tall soldier was, that came to her house; I told her I did not know; she told me if I did not tell her she would have me taken into custody. I told the officer, that

             and Black Wainwright, of the first guards told me of the robbery; they told me, that while they were drinking in Thames Street, they went to her house, they found her in bed, and they took the bowl. If Mrs. Levy thought that I took the bowl, she knew where I was before the 1st of August.</p>

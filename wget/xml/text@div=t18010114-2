             sworn. - On the 9th of December I was in company with Mr. Lifford, in a single horse chaise, near the three mile stone, on the <placeName id="t18010114-2-crimeloc8">Uxbridge-road</placeName>

               <p>Q. Did he present any thing? - A. Yes; he presented a pistol to my friend's breast, it appeared to be a short thick pistol, but being dark, I cannot be particular.</p>
               <p>Q. Neither of you were armed? - A. We had a gun in the chaise, but we made no resistance; Mr. Lifford gave him two half-guineas, and a guinea, I believe, I did not see the money; he did not seem satisfied with that, and I gave him a purse, containing a guinea, one or two half-guineas, I am not certain which, a seven shilling piece in gold, and some silver; he then demanded our pocket-books, we told him we had none; he pressed us very hard, and I said, d-n you, cannot you believe us, we told you before, we had not; he then demanded our watches; he took from me a double case metal watch, a steel chain and a metal key, there was no seal to it; I had had it twelve or fourteen years; I described it at Bow-street, before I saw the watch; he then took my friend by the hand, and said, God bless you, I have got a wife and family, and then rode off towards Acton; we were not more than forty yards from the White-horse inn, we intended to drink tea there, and we told them we had been robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabout was it that you were stopped? - A. Near the three mile stone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ride off pretty quick? - A. Yes; the man that keeps the White-horse, said, the Bow-street officers had been there the night before, and he expected them there again; they came in the course of a quarter of an hour or ten minutes afterwards, they separated and went away; I told them the maker's name on the watch was Watson; this was on the Tuesday; on the Saturday following, I went to Bow-street, I described the watch, and then it was produced to me, and I swore to it, it had the chain and the key exactly as I lost it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not describe the man as riding upon a dark horse? - A. Yes; I said, I believed it was a dark coloured horse, but it was impossible to see the colour of the horse it was so dark.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say that you thought the man was a bigger man than me? - A. No, I did not say so; I said, I could not swear to the man, neither can I now.</p>

             sworn. - I am one of the Bow-street patrol, I went to the White-horse-inn, Acton-road, with four others; Mr. Thackthwaite and Mr. Lifford were there, they said they had been robbed by a single highwayman, very near where they had put up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they give you any particular account of the robbery? - A. Only the watch; Mr. Thackthwaite described it; he said, there was the name of Watson on the watch, the number he could no tell, but there was a small dent at the bottom; he said, it was a metal watch with a steel chain; the conductor of the patrole, Creedland, sent me and another man away to Hammersmith turnpike-gate; we got there something before seven o'clock, and remained there till twelve; I was then in the toll-house, and my comrade was looking out.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Lifford.) Q. Had you an opportunity of observing what kind of a pistol it was? - A. It was a short thick pistol, but it was quite dark, it appeared to me shorter than usual.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it a metal watch? - A. Yes, (produces it;) and here is the pistol, (produces it;) it was loaded with powder and ball, (produces the loading and priming;) we then took him to Bow-street.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see them? - A. Yes, I saw the end of the pistol, and the metal watch; I have never seen him since, till I saw him here; he was very much intoxicated with liquor.</p>

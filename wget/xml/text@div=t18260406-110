On the 21st of February, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoners came and asked to look at some Irish linen - they bought three yards and a half, for which they paid me - they then asked to look at some black silk handkerchiefs - I shewed them some, to which they objected - I got them some others - I saw a person at my door beckoning to one of my shopmen, who came, and told me the prisoners had got something in their hats - I went round, and in Broughton's hat I found ten black silk handkerchiefs.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. LAW. Q. Did not Broughton appear to be a person of weak intellects? A. No; when I took the handkerchiefs from his hat he fell on the ground and appeared to be intoxicated; there was one handkerchief separated from the rest. I then sent for the constable.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. Wilson had no part of your property? A. No; he had bought the linen and paid for it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When you was looking for the handkerchiefs was not your back towards them? A. Yes; it must have been done in a moment.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoners. Broughton appeared to be in liquor, and smelt of liquor when I spoke to him - he appeared tipsy.</p>
               <p>WILSON's Defence. I went to buy a bit of linen, and met this young man, whom I knew; he was tipsy, and I asked him to step into the shop with me, and I would see him home. I bought the linen and then looked at some small handkerchiefs - I asked to look at some larger, which were 10s. - I had not got so much with me, and I said I would call again. I had not seen this young man take any thing. I had 7s. 6d. still in my pocket, which Mr. Brooks knows.</p>
               <p>BROUGHTON's Defence. I was in liquor. The property, by some means unknown to me, got into my hat. I have a complaint in my head, and when I am in liquor it deprives me of my senses.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you observe him all the time he was doing this? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is the person that did this? - A. That man that stands there, I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw him without any crape? - A. I did, and without his hat; I had a view of his face entirely.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any remark upon the horse? - A. Yes; the horse's head, and his eyes, the offside to me was half a wall-eye, and a blaze in the horse's face.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the prisoner again? - A. The day he was taken, the 9th of May; I do not recollect what day of the week it was; I saw him in the cart in which he was brought to town, about five minutes after he was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to him, or he to you, at that time? - A. No; I attended at Bow-street, and gave my evidence there.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at him again, and tell us if you have the least doubt that he is the man? - A. No; I have not the least doubt whatever.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Const. Q. He was in custody when you saw him? - A. Yes; Balam had just taken him.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw the horse also at Bow-street? - A. Yes; I rode the horse up.</p>
               <p>Q. The horse you rode up is the same horse that the man was upon? - A. I am certain it is the same that he did the robbery upon.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw him in the cart, how happened it that you did not tell any body he was the man that robbed your mistress? - A. I did, to Balam and my master, as soon as he was taken; Mr. Gundry said, we have got the highwayman; I went and looked at him, and said it was the man.</p>
               <p>Q. This man met you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He came up to the coachman first, of course? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say he came past the coachman, and up as far as the carriage, before he put the crape over his face? - A. He did not put the crape on at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the coachman say he could not see his face for the crape? - A. Yes; he held his hat so, while he came past the coachman, trying to put the crape on.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he never had the crape on at all? - A. No, it hung down his back; the wind blew it over his head, and it fell down his back.</p>
               <p>Q. All this the coachman must have seen as well as you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It is a chariot, is it not? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And that chariot standing still? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you are equally positive as to the horse? - A. More so of the man than of the horse.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. He was by the side of the carriage when he was robbing your mistress? - A. Yes; his face was towards her.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he was behind the coachman? - A. Yes, with his horse's head straight to the carriage-door.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Did you see any fire-arms? - A. He did not shew any fire-arms at all.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I live very near Mr. Balam's house: The day that Mrs. Gundry was robbed, I was driving my cows upon the common, a man on horseback overtook me, and asked me what those two women were, in that field; I told him they were picking up some sticks; there was a man went into the field, and he asked me what he was going to do; I told him I thought he was going to take the sticks from the women; and he said, a son of a b-h, if I was there I would well lick him; he asked me if I had never been there; and I told him I never had; and he said, if I was you, I would fetch all that wood away by night; I said, Sir, you want to get us hang'd, don't you; and he replied, no, d-n hanging, they cannot hang you; and then I called to the two women coming across the field to come to me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might this conversation take up? - A. He stopped with me near a quarter of an hour; he went on with his horse towards Edmonton-Common; I saw him go through the gate near Balam's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts was Mr. Kingston's house? - A. Very near; close by.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ask you any questions about Mr. Kingston? - A. Yes; he asked me if that family were then here; I told him, no, they were not here now; they were mostly in town, but came down backwards and forwards; then he rode towards Edmonton-Common; I had not got into my house before the news came that Mrs. Gundry was robbed!</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him again? - A. The same man rode by me that very day that he was taken by Balam.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner? - A. I really think that is the man; I am almost positive it is the man.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Are you or not positive? - A. I am not quite positive; but I think it really to be the man.</p>

               <p>Q. How was he dressed? - A. In a brown loose coat; he had boots on at the same time.</p>

You said, you are the driver of Edmonton-Common; that, on the 9th of May, your wife held up her finger, and beckoned to you; that you touched your nose and was home in a minute; she clapped her hands together, and said, good God! Joe, here is the man that robbed my mistress, Mrs. James, and Miss Clark, and Captain Owen; I bid her give me my shoes, my stick and my bill; I said, I will pursue him please God blesses me, and take him; the prisoner was then in sight; I pursued him in my cart and the prisoner jogged on upon his horse, till I came to the other side of Mr. Gundry's, nearly a mile, then I got higher; as I got on, he was never out of my fight, I drove down to the gate that parts Edmonton-Common and Enfield-Common, I took up my stick, and my bill, and got out of my cart; I sprung at the prisoner's bridle, and caught it; I up'd with my bill, and told him he was the man that robbed Mrs. James, on the 13th of March; he hesitated a little, and said, it will not do; I told him it should do, it was either him or me, either your life or mine, I will take you; he flew immediately from his horse, he went off on the off-side of the horse, that is on the right-hand side, a different side from that on which a man would get up; the prisoner flew from the hind quarter of the horse to make for the Chace, and so did I; we both joined like, at the hind part of the horse, I had got hold of the skirt of his coat; then we skuffled till we tumbled into a muddy ditch together; I was quickly at the top, and squeezed him into the mud; I clapped one hand upon the nape of his neck, and my knee upon his loins, and said, where is your pistol; he said, it was in his waistcoat-pocket; I turned him on one side, and took the pistol out of his pocket; then my son came up, and I begged of him to lay hold of one of his hands to keep his hands from his side; we took him out of the ditch, and took him into my son's cottage; he had some water to wash himself, and then he made a very great plunge in the house, with a deal of resolution, to try to get away; then I set at him with resolution, and down'd with him in the house; when he fell down, his hat fell off, and a crape fell over his face; the hat did not fall off in the ditch, for it fitted on very tight; this black thing, that crape, has two pieces of lead, one at each end; I tied his hands behind him, and put him into a one horse cart that I had at the door; I took him to Mr. Gundry's, and then to Bow-street, my son went with me to London; Mr. Bond examined the pistol at Bow-street, and it was not loaded; I heard of Mrs. James being robbed about ten minutes after I came home. In cross examination, he said he heard of no robbery the day he was taken.</p>

               <p>Court. (To Witness.) Q. Is what I have read, true? - A. It is all true.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any thing that you would add to it, or take from it? - A. I saw him before he robbed Mrs. James, I thought he had been some gentleman, and I let him through the gate; I knew him again when I saw him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Did you see Mr. Gundry, or his footman, after you had taken him? - A. Yes; as I was taking him to town, I saw Mr. Gundry Mrs. Gundry, and the footman; the footman said, in the hearing of the prisoner, that that was the man.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180005280071"></xptr>Q. Did he make any answer to that? - A. He said, if we knew who he was, and the circumstances he had been in, we should pity his case; Mr. Gundry made answer, and said, no, not in these matters, these matters are terrifying.</p>

            ; I live on Edmonton-Common: I saw my father get out of his cart, with a bill in his hand, and go towards the prisoner; I heard the prisoner say it would not do; I heard my father say, if he moved his hand he would chop it off; then the prisoner flew from his horse, and tried to run away; my father was close after him, he had hold of him at the time, in a boggy place, or ditch; my father got across him, pinned him down, and I came up and assisted; he laid hold of him on one side, and I on the other; he asked the prisoner where his pop was; he said, in his waistcoat-pocket, but not loaded; we took him into the house, and then my father told me to get a string to tie his hands; he resisted very much, and tried to get away, and the force of us all three struggling burst the door way open; we tied his hands, and put him into the cart; in the struggle his hat came off, and the crape fell down over his face; we did not examine his pockets; the crape had leads to it; we put him into the cart; he wished to be released, for his hands were tied behind him, and he was in very great agony; after that we stopped and had some brandy and water; I told him it was a bad day for him; and he said it was a very good day to him, for he was tired of his life.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord, the day that I was apprehended by Mr. Balam, and when I hired the horse, I told Mr. Watson I was going to South-Mims, which is but a very little distance from where I was, I have an uncle lives there that I meant to have called upon, that was my reason for going that road; when I was taken, I was very glad it had frustrated my intention in a thing that I never was guilty of; and as to the day that they attribute the robbery to me, I was at Mr. Castell's in the morning, about half past eleven o'clock, and I only went to the other end of the town to see my poor mother, who is bed-ridden; I staid with her about an hour, or an hour and a half, and then I took a walk round and came to Mr. Castell's again; that I declare is the truth, and nothing but the truth.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>- CHAMPANTE sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. Q. You have heard Mr. Watson examined? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the horse? - A. I cannot swear to the horse; I hired a horse of him on the 13th of April; I rode him a circuitous course by Swaffham; on the 27th I was indisposed; I remained at Swaffham till the 4th of May, and then I sent the horse to town by the waggon.</p>
               <p>Q. That waggon would arrive in town on the 7th? - </p>
               <p>Court. I am satisfied that the horse that he had, when he was taken, was not the horse upon which the man who committed the robbery rode.</p>

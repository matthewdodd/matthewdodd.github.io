               <p>Q. You have known Abrahams some time? - I have for these three or four years.</p>
               <p>Q. He did business for the India company? - He did find men for the commanders and owners of the ships.</p>
               <p>Q. You had therefore an opportunity of transacting business before him? - Yes, because he signs before me, whenever he is bound for a person.</p>
               <p>Q. Has not this man always had the character of an honest man? - Quite so, as much as I know of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen him write often? -O yes, a vast number of times.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen Hounsley write? - Yes, three times, that I can swear to.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe Hounsley came with Abrahams to you, before he went abroad, for the purpose of executing some bond? - He did; this is the bond.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you look at the signature of that will, Samuel Hounsley? - I firmly believe it is one and the same hand writing, but I will not positively swear to it, because I did not see it.</p>
               <p>Q. Except that you did not actually see it executed, have you any doubt that it is his hand writing? - It corresponds exactly with the hand writing that I see him write.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell the prosecutors so themselves? - I told Mr. Fletcher so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell any body so on the part of the prosecution? - No one applied to me. I firmly believe it is Hounsley's hand writing.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you witness the execution of that? - I did.</p>

               <p>Q. The other signatures in your book you see Hounsley sign? - I did. I have got the contract they are obliged to sign before they go to sea, it is in the hand writing of Hounsley.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that another document from whence you form your judgment? - It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you have got three signatures in the book, those articles and that power of attorney.</p>
               <p>Q. When a man applies to these men, such as Abrahams, to sit them out, they sit them out with slops? - They do.</p>

               <p>Q. At this very instant Mr. Abrahams was bound for Hounsley? - He was; here is his bond for a hundred pounds for him.</p>
               <p>Q. Except this man had some estates in the skies, ten pounds and odd would have been the whole that he could have received? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe all the documents, the power of attorney, the absent bond, and whatever was to entitle any one person to receive money, were all directed to Abrahams? - They were.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at the character. Do you believe, or do you not, that is his hand writing? - Really I cannot say; nor I would not wish to say what I do not think.</p>
               <p>Court. Supposing it had been wrote at full length, what should you have thought then? - Why then I should rather have thought it was his hand writing.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 15, Hanover Cottages—on the night of 19th December, I went to bed about 12 o'clock, leaving the house all safe—the lower windows were fastened—the servant slept with me—I was disturbed during the night by a little dog that I had—he barked—I heard a noise in the house, and I listened about ten minutes, and heard a creaking on the stairs, and a noise of some one passing their hands along the wall, and I heard whispering outside my bed-room door, and afterwards the door was tried, but it was locked—I heard the next room door opened, and I jumped out of bed and went to the window and gave the alarm—I called police and thieves—a policeman came shortly afterwards—he went round and got over the wall—he came back to the house afterwards—I went down stairs into the sitting-room, and there I found that a cloak and muff which had been on the sefa had been moved on to the chair, and the gas was alight—I found the plate-basket on the table—I saw Gamier after wards—Goust was found in the dog-kennel.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Miss Alexander—I went to bed about the same time—I had washed up the spoons and other things, put them in the basket in the cupboard in the breakfast parlour—I shut the cupboard door—I came down sometime after the policeman had been—Gamier had called at the house in the early part of the evening, between six and seven—I saw him—he asked for Madame Pauline—I believe the person in the house before was Madame Pauline—I told him she did live there—he spoke in English—he stood some minutes in the passage, and then he walked very fast away and gave no answer.</p>

I went there at 7 o'clock to see Madame Pauline, whom I had known for some time, and she told me she was not there, and, fearing she had given orders not to admit me, I wanted to be assured of that fact, and at night time I entered the house alone. I shall give more particulars on the trial."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Garnier in his defend stated that he made the acquaintance of Goust ai a public-house, that they met a man named Jules, who persuaded them to get into the house; that they did not break in, but merely opened the window. He was going up the stairs, having lighted the gas, heard somebody cry out, and ran away as fast as he could, and fell right into the hands of the policeman. That there was no robbery committed, although it was true the intention was there; but that there was a vast difference between an intention to do a thing and a thing which had been done.</hi>

               <p>Q. Is that the letter she delivered to you? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Examined by Mr. Trebeck. I am one of the clerks at Bow-street; I attended at the time of the examination of the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. If any thing he said was not taken down in writing, tell us what it was? - A. Mr. Bond was going to examine some persons about a parcel sent to Mrs. Murdock, with a watch and some rings; he said he would save them the trouble, and confessed that he sent them.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was any thing taken in writing? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. There was nothing signed by the prisoner? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ally. The act of parliament giving the magistrate that authority was made for the purpose of reducing to writing such observations; your Lordship, therefore, seas, that if these declarations of the prisoner are now admitted against him, he is reduced to this dilemma, this witness may swear that which only makes for the prosecution; whereas, if it was in writing, your Lordship would have had every thing, as well that which made for the prisoner as against him, inasmuch as the intention of the legislature was not pursued.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Heath. This has been often overruled; and there can be no doubt at all about it; it is a principle of common law, if the justice had taken it in writing, it would have been admissible by the force of the statute; and being in writing, it is the best evidence that the nature of the case will admit of, and then the parole evidence, not taken in writing, would be admitted.</p>
               <p>Sleath. Bodkin admitted he sent that parcel to Mrs. Murdock; and when he was asked, how he came by the parcel, he said, he kept a bird; I am not certain whether he said a black bird, or what; that going to the bottom of the garden for some worms, he found these things in his master's garden; and he said, the glove they were in was his.</p>
               <p>Q. Are these the articles? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ally. Q. Is it usual for you not to reduce examinations to writing? - A. Almost always; part of it was, but none signed by the prisoner; this is the more occurrence of the day.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys to Vaux. Q. What did you hear the prisoner say? - A. The prisoner said, he was going to the bottom of the garden for worms, and found these things; he confessed it was his glove; he confessed it without any thing having been said to him, at which I was surprised.</p>

               <p>I am an officer of justice; I was sent for to Mr. Ardesois's, the morning after his house was broke open; I think it was the 31st of September.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when the prisoner was at Bow-street? - A. Yes; I apprehended him on the 1st of October.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when these articles were produced? - A. Yes; Mr. Bond asked him what he said to that; he said, I am sorry I did not save you all this trouble before; the woman knows nothing about these articles; I gave them to her; I found them, looking for snails at the bottom of the garden; and, he said, the glove was his.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys to Ardesoif. Look at that watch; is that your's? - A Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It is worth 40l.? - A. More than that.</p>

            When he was first taken the officer searched him, and this is the account he gave of the things found upon him; his first examination was on the Thursday; the next on Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Q. Does that part you have taken down relate to any thing with which he is charged now? - A. No; that is in the information returned to the Court.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any examination of the prisoner taken in writing? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. If it had been taken properly, it might have been read in evidence; it not being taken properly, it cannot be read in evidence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Trebeck to Ardesoif. Q. Are the rings your's? - A. Yes.</p>

The day, with rapid strides approaches,"that will compel me to appear before a solemn"tribunal, and shall be arranged for a crime that,"perhaps, you are the innocent cause of. Be-"lieve me, that in making that assertion, I don't"mean the smallest reflection; I am incapable of"baseness; but only to remind you of my former"assertions, that I would sacrifice my existence"for your sake. Perhaps you imagine that I"dread the event, and am fearful of conviction; - "neither, believe me, is the case, for I have al-"ready confessed my crime; but I dread, and with"horror reflect, that you are going to appear against"me; the person that I hold most dear; - that dear"Hayles! - that I never gave reason to complain,"or ever shall. You may say, perhaps, that it is"neither your wish nor inclination to do me an"injury; that you are impelled to do so by the"instructions given you by the magistrate, or by"the directions of Mr. Christian and Mr. Vaux;"I will admit the plea; but pause for a moment,"and consider that my existence is at stake; that"you, and you alone, can convict me. When"you have convicted me, you will ever after feel"a painful pang, and will then, too late, repent"that you have deprived one of his existence that"adores you. I will likewise admit, that it is"the duty of the magistrate to direct you to"appear against me, but permit me to observe to"you, that no mortal power can compel you to"act or say any thing against your interest or in-"clination; nor can I suppose that Mr. V. or Mr."C. can be instigated by any other motive than"that of justice; but yet mercy is the darling of"heaven; and when they reflect that I have con-"fessed my crime, that I am not guilty of the"crime that I am charged with, that I suffer and"do feel the most pungent contrition, I do slatter"myself with hope that they will relax in their"sentiments, and not direct you to appear against"me. I am not prepared with a counsellor or"attorney. Believe me, at the same time, that"I remain your most affectionate,"J. Bodkin."</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. By a late order of Court, we are not permitted to see the indictment without your Lordship's permission, I will be very much obliged to your Lordship to let me see it now.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Heath. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I have very little to address to your Lordship and the Jury; I am ha of hearing; but I am given to understand I am accused that there was a watch found upon me; there was no such thing; as to the letter that they say is my signature and direction, I totally deny; I have no concern whatever with the said letter, and I have got a letter of

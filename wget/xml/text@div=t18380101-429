                  </hi>. I keep the Grapes, in Milton-street, near Cripplegate. I know the prisoner—I saw him on Saturday, the 30th of December, about three o'clock in the afternoon, with another person, at my bar—the prisoner asked for half a quartern of gin—he gave me a shilling—it was a good one, I am confident—I put it into the till—he made an observation that he had coppers enough, or. halfpence enough—I gave him the shilling out of the till—he then said, "Never mind," and put down a shilling on the counter—I suspected him, and I bent it up, and went round the counter and secured the prisoner—I took him by the collar—he gave the first shil<lb></lb>ling back to me after I seized him—I sent for the constable, and as he was coming in, the half-quartern measure that he had been drinking out of was taken up, and there were two more bad shillings in it—the other man walked out when I sent for the officer—they had heard me send—I threw the other shilling into the measure, but the others were not so much bent as that—I can distinguish it.</p>

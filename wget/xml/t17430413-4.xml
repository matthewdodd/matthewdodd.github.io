I was Partner with Mr Leake in this Skin, that was sold to this Tanner; I knew the Skin again by an J. which was upon the Hip; when I had found it out, says I to the Prisoner, John, how came you to be guilty of such a Thing ? said he, I never robb'd you. Why, said I, did not you rob Mr Leake, and if you robbed him of that Skin you robbed me; said I, I am sorry you should be guilty of it. He denied it, but after he found I had come at the Skin he confess'd it, and said, he would give a Guinea for the Skin, or any Thing to make it up.</p>

               <p>Court. Do you wish to call that man? - No, I do not want to call him, I do not know any of their names; I had been as the public house several times before, it it the sign of the Star, in Wells-street, Rosemary Lane; I did not take him for three weeks afterwards, he made out of the way, I live at the bottom of that street myself; when I took the prisoner, I went to the public-house, and there were five or six persons sitting round the fire, and I knew him; I did not see the young man there the next morning, which I saw the night before, and the prisoner fell a laughing, and said you do not know what you are talking of, you was drunk.</p>
               <p>What time of night was it when you went in? - About nine, I was there about two hours, I had two pints; I believe I had a dram in the morning, which we generally have when we go to market, I was very sober indeed, I borrowed this money of my mother.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowles, Prisoner's Council. Have you never been in that place where that man is now? - I never was inside this place in my life, nor never in the yard.</p>
               <p>Was you never tried for any offence? - No, never, neither here nor any where else.</p>
               <p>You say you were quite sober when you came into this house? - Yes, my husband went out directly.</p>
               <p>Then you thought proper to stay two hours after your husband went out? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Pray, how many quarterns of gin had you at this alehouse? - I had none, no other liquors than the two pints of beer.</p>
               <p>You had better speak the truth: was not Davis in the house during all the time you was in the house? - I do not know such a name.</p>
               <p>Was not there a man besides the prisoner in the house during all the time you was there? - There was nobody in the tap-room but me and him when he robbed me, nobody went out with me, I went to another public house, I thought my husband was there, I came in again.</p>
               <p>Did not you say, you would make it up? - I said, give me five or six shillings, and I will not hurt you; but I never saw him in prison, nor never sent to him.</p>
               <p>Did not you go with another man from that place to Salt-petre Bank, and there ask for a lodging to sleep with that man that night? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Do you remember one Mr. Patrick being there? - No.</p>
               <p>How much money had you when you went into the house? - Eleven shillings and six-pence.</p>

               <p>I work on the river, I am a lodger, I am a lumper; I remember coming in when the prosecutrix was at the Star, about seven in the middle of December; I cannot tell the day; it was a matter of five weeks after that he was taken up.</p>
               <p>Was the prosecutrix's husband there? - They had had some words; she was very much intoxicated with liquor, during my time she had two pots of beer and three quarterns of gin; when I came in she called me the father of her children, and took me by the neck; the husband had not come in at that time.</p>
               <p>Did this woman ask you to go with her? - She did several and several times, and moreover than that, she gave me five shillings and six-pence to procure her a bed, and I went out and could not get one at any house on Salt-petre Bank, but at the house of one Brunk; I came back and met her at the door, and she said she was robbed; she calls me Bob.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowles. Where did she take this money from? - From a little white purse out of her bosom.</p>
               <p>Was Riley in the house the time you was there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Riley. The prosecutrix was rather the worse for liquor when she came in; she drank till she fell off the seat; she was along with Mr. Patrick, and she offered him a shilling to go to bed with her, and he refused it, and said he had a wife of his own.</p>

               <p>Must you have seen it if she had been robbed in the house? - Undoubtedly, Sir, it could not be otherwise, because I attended the tap-room all the time, the prisoner never took any liberties with her; she paid for what she had to me; I took the money from her and delivered it at the bar.</p>
               <p>Did she never pay any thing to the prisoner? - No, she gave me one shilling one time, and I gave her four-pence.</p>

               <p>Q. When did this happen - A. On Thursday, the 17th of December, the prisoner came into my lower room; he said he was going to stop all night. He gave me a shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you let lodgings - A. Yes, but I had no lodgers in the house at that time. He came in between nine and ten at night.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he come in for - A. He came to sleep all night there; he gave me a shilling to go for a pot of stout. I went out for this pot of stout, and I locked the door after me. When I went out, my property was in the drawers. I might be gone about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour to the most. When I came back, I found my door open, and, when I came in I saw the man was gone. I looked round my room, I saw there was nothing missing in the room. I put the pot of stout on the table, and I looked over my drawers. I missed six sheets, two cotton gowns, a piece of patch-work, four yards of cotton, bed-curtains, a cotton shawl, a silk shawl, and a black velvit pellise, and a tablecloth, two side curtains, and a cotton top to the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you know this man before - A. He came into my place; that was the 15th he came in and set down, and asked me how I did. He might set down ten minutes, not longer, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. You have no doubt he is the person that came on the 17th, have you - A. He is the person that came on the 17th. He said, he would sleep with me, and pay me for sleeping with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find your things - A. Part of them. I found them in an old clothes shop, in Poplar.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon afterwards - A. Last Wednesday week; on the 6th of January. I found them at Mrs. Treadaway's. She lives at Poplar; she keeps a clothes shop. I found four linen sheets, two cotton gowns, patch-work, four yards of cotton, bed-curtains, a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181301130044"></xptr>cotton sheet; but I cannot say that is mine; it is like it.

            . I am an officer. I was applied to by Mrs. Lindsay. I went with Butler and Mrs. Lindsay's servant to Hounsditch; we met the prisoner between nine and ten o'clock at night, on Tuesday the 5th of January. The servant spoke to him, and called him by his name. She took hold of his shirt, and seized him by the collar. After a great deal of resistance, we got him into a public-house, and secured him. On coming along he tried to make his escape out of the coach; he threw himself out of the coach. He was handcuffed. He attempted it again the second time. We brought him to the office, and then we enquired of different people that had been robbed in the neighbourhood. The different people came up, and Mrs. Griffiths among the rest, and when we brought him before the magistrate he confessed the different robberies, and from his information we searched for Mrs. Griffiths's property. We found one gown and one shawl in Mrs. Treadaway's back room. I then went up stairs. We found the curtains hung up at the bed, the patch-work that was on the bed, and one gown. Butler found four sheets.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does Treadaway live - A. In High-street, Poplar.</p>

I gave her some money to fetch some things for supper.</p>

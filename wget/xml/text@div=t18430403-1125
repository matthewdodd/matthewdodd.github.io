               <p>corner, Minories. I knew the deceased and the prisoner as customers—on the 9th of March, I saw them at our house in company before the bar—the witness Jessop was there at the time—the deceased accused the prisoner of robbing her during the night of a fourpenny-piece, and some halfpence—he denied it, and threatened to strike her if she repeated it—she did repeat it, and he struck her—I am not certain where, but I think on the top of the shoulders or neck, with his clenched fist—she requested him not to strike her—he threatened if she accused him again he would strike her again—she did so, and he struck her a second time—she staggered, I think from the blow, and fell—her head came in contact with a rum puncheon, which was standing at the bar, and she lay apparently lifeless for some time—I advised medical assist<lb></lb>ance to be sent for—the prisoner said that she was subject to fits, and he sup<lb></lb>posed she was in one then, but not recovering, Jessop assisted her on to a seat—Mr. Baller, a surgeon, was sent for—he promptly attended, and declared her dead—she appeared to me to be perfectly sober when she came in.</p>

                  </hi>. I am potboy at the Blue Boar. On the morning of the 9th of March I saw the prisoner standing at the bar—the deceased came in, and accused the prisoner of taking a fourpenny-piece and some halfpence out of her pocket during the night—he said he had not robbed her of anything—she said, "Yes, you have," and he struck her on the breast—she said, "Don't strike me"—he said, "Yes I will, if you accuse me of taking money from your pocket"—she turned round to go out at the door, and he struck her again on the side of the head—she staggered and fell—whether her foot caught against a piece of wood that is put to keep the door back, I cannot tell, but she fell, and her head came against a rum puncheon—I went to pick her up—the prisoner said "No, let her alone, she is in one of her fits again"—she laid there, and he and Jessop afterwards picked her up, and put her on a bench—a woman came in just at the time—the deceased called her <hi rend="italic">Betsy</hi>—she went to go near her, but the prisoner would not let her—the deceased laid on <hi rend="italic">Betsy's</hi> shoulder, and she died on her shoulder—a doctor was sent for, but we could not get one for some time—I asked the prisoner if I should go for a doctor—he said, no, the boy was gone—at last the doctor came, and the woman was dead.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a fishmonger, and live in Rosemary-lane.

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Jewry-street, Aldgate. On the day in question I was sent for—the woman was dead when I came—I after<lb></lb>wards examined her head, to ascertain the cause of death—I found a bruise on the left temple, and another underneath the left eye—I could see no other external marks of violence—on the following day I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—I found the membranes of the brain very much congested, with blood in the ventricles—I also found effusion of blood—at the base of the brain I saw a very great quantity of blood, effused from rupture of a blood vessel—I attribute her death to the rupture of a blood vessel—that might be produced either by a blow, or falling against a hard substance—I think it much more likely to be by the fall against the rum puncheon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did the head indicate a healthy state of body or otherwise? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I saw no appearances but what were healthy, with the exception of great effusion, and the membranes being in a high state of con<lb></lb>gestion—congestion might be produced without a blow—I think congestion might follow in ten minutes from a blow—I have known a blood vessel broken without any violence—I do not believe the blow on the temple was the occasion of the rupture, nor the blow on the eye, because they had been done previously—I did not discover any bruise that had been produced that morning—I cannot tell whether she was addicted to drinking—I did not observe any smell of liquor about her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then if she had fallen against a rum puncheon there was no external mark of violence left? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was not, but that may be ac<lb></lb>counted for by the quantity of hair behind—a rupture of the vessel from natural causes would account for all the appearances I observed in the brain—passion would produce the effects I saw—the woman being in a passion from the excited state of the vessels of the brain, blood would be thrown to them, and they would be predisposed towards rupture—a slight blow at that time might produce rupture—I think it might be produced by the fall against the puncheon—I cannot positively say whether it was occasioned by external violence or natural causes, but from there having been a fall I think it more probable that that had something to do with it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Mr. Peter Clare, and no one else—we are watch-case manufacturers, and live in Clerkenwell. The prisoner had been in our service nearly twelve months—here are some cuttings of gold here, which I know from their description—watch-case makers do not have such, but engine-turners and dial-makers may have such—these are mine and my partners'—I saw them before they were lost, partly on the prisoner's bench, at dinner time, on the 23rd of Sept.—he left between seven and eight o'clock—I then received information, and went to a refiner's, where I saw this gold—I then gave the prisoner into custody—the policeman said to him, "You are given into custody for robbing your employers"—I said, "Prowse, you have been at it ever since you have been with me"—he said, "No, not ever since I have been with you, only since I have got into bad company, and given way to drinking."</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Jack of Newbury public-house, in Chiswell-street, in the parish of St. Luke. On Saturday night, 14th July, I fastened up my house, aud went to bed about half-past twelve o'clock—(Williams' house is about three-quarters of a mile from mine)—I was alarmed by the police, and came down between four and five—I found a large drawer had been pulled out, and biscuits and cakes thrown on the floor—I missed three shil<lb></lb>lings' worth of farthings, a tin can, and two bar-bottles, which contained port and sherry, about a quart or three pints—I missed from a half to three-quarters of a pound of cigars—this is the bar-bottle that contains port, and these are the fragments of the bottle that contained the sherry—these cheroots pro<lb></lb>duced resemble mine, they are Bengal cheroots and Mexicans.</p>

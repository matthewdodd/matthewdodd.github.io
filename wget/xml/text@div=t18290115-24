            . I took up the prisoner on the 30th of December; I waited at a private house, which I understood he frequented - when he came I told him I had been waiting for him some time, and I wanted him for a gun; he said, "What gun?" I said, "The gun you have taken from Mr. Egg's;" he said, "I know nothing about it" - that it was a foolish thing, and a drunken thing: as we went along I accused him of dropping something from his left hand, and I told a person to pick it up - the prisoner said he had dropped nothing; he had got the duplicate - we went to Mr. Egg's; I searched him, and said, "You have not got the duplicate - I must strip you;" he then gave it me from the cuff of his coat.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I found the duplicate on my father's premises.</p>

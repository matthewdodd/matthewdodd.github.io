                  </hi>. I am a musician, of 31, York Road, Walworth—on 9th July I was on board the Fairy steamboat, and had some beer with the prisoner, who I had seen on board beats before—he went upstairs and I sat there some time—when we left Cherry Gardens Pier I saw the prisoner drinking a cup of tea, and he said to the girl "Will you get me another cup of tea?"—she went to get it and he sat on the bar down behind the partition, and I saw him put his hand out and bring it back to his coat tail pocket, it seemed to me he did that twice—I went up and told the captain what I had seen and afterwards told the mate and spoke to the barmaid who was counting her money—the mate went upstairs after the prisoner and brought him down, and said "Where is the money you have taken from that girl?"—he said "I have not"—I said "You have"—the mate said "If you don't give it up I will shake it out of you"—he said that he not, they had a scuffle, and the mate took 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from him while he was on the ground.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a barmaid on board the Fairy steamboat—on 9th July the prisoner was in the cabin and asked me for some tea—my back was turned towards the bar while I was fetching it, and when I turned round I saw the prisoner pulling his hand from behind the bar, near the place where I had 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., including halfpence, a quarter of an hour before—the silver was in a glass inside the bar on the right hand side—the money belonged to Mr. Bishop—I gave the prisoner his tea, and he went away and came down a second time—Barnes was there, about a yard from the bar, and the prisoner pressed him very much to have some<lb></lb>thing to drink, and after some time he took a glass of port wine—the prisoner then went upstairs, Barnes told me something, and the prisoner was brought down by the mate, who asked him whether he had taken the money—he said that he had not—the mate told him to give it up—he said "I won't"—I saw 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. taken from his pocket, and he was given incharge—no one else was in the bar.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> This occurred between London Bridge and Westminster—the boat started from Woolwich—I had only had one or two customers—I did not say when the mate brought the prisoner down that I did not know how much I. ought to have—when the mate took some money out of his pocket I said that I did not know exactly how much, but that would be right within a shilling or two—I did not know at the time how much ought to have been in the glass, but when I counted the second time I knew how much was missing—there was no gold, but about 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was left behind in the glass, we were about Cherry Gardens when I counted it and found that there was 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and did not count it again till the prisoner was in the mate's hand—I counted the money the mate gave me and found 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I saw the prisoner stretch over twice, and I had a suspicion on the first occasion—my back was not to him when he stretched over, I was about a half yard from him—the bar is very small, if I had been at the other end of it I should have been 4 or 5 yards from him—I was about yards from him the second time, pouring out the tea—I did not say a word to him about what I had seen, but I was counting my money when the mate brought him into the cabin—there was a great deal of copper—Cherry Gardens is about three piers from London Bridge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am mate of the Fairy—on the afternoon of 9th July Barnes spoke to me and I went on deck to the prisoner and told him the young woman wanted him downstairs—he said "All right, I will come down"—he went down and she accused him of taking her money—I said "Yes, turn it up, give us the money and you can go out clear"—he said "No"—I said "If you don't give us the money I will have it," and I turned him down and took it from his left trowsers pocket—the barmaid did not speak of any sum, but I counted it before the prisoner and it was 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>/—she was then counting her money and she said that that would just make it right within a shilling.</p>

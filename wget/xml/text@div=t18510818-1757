On 8th Aug., about 3 o'clock in the morning, I was on duty in Jonathan-street, Vauxhall, and saw the prisoner, about forty yards from the prosecutor's, standing, with a basket in one hand, and a rabbit in the other—he was stroking it—I was in my uniform—he could see me—I went up to him, put my hand into his basket, and said, "What have you got here?"—he said, "Another rabbit"—! said, "What are you going to do with them?"—he said the one he was stroking was a buck, and the other he was going to take to the buck, to 17, Vauxhall-street—it was dark—I asked where he lived—he said, "Two or three doors below a rag<lb></lb>shop in Jonathan-street"—I asked him his name—he said, "Brown," and that he was waiting for his brother—I said I very much doubted what he said, and he threw the rabbits down, and ran away—I pursued him, and he was stopped by another constable—I never lost sight of him—I afterwards saw the basket at the station, and found two knives in it—I found some matches and several pieces of candle in his pocket.</p>

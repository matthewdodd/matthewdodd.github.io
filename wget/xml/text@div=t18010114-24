               <p>Q. How near was he to Mr. Duncan's house? - A. It might be five hundred yards from it, he was going from Mr. Duncan's house; I conceived him to be a suspicious man, and as I had suffered much by fire two days before, I asked him where he was going with that property; he told me, he was going with it to a public-house; I asked him the name of the person who keeps the public-house, he answered me, he could not tell; I asked him the sign, and that he could not tell me; I asked him where he brought it from, he said, from a friend of his in King Edward-street, that was where the fire was; I asked him what his friend's name was, and he could not tell me, he said, he worked in the coal trade; I then told him, as he could not give me a better account, I should take him into custody and the property; I then took hold of him by his coat, and he very willingly went with me; I then took him to Mr. Bell's a publican, the Royal-oak, in Wapping; I then called Mr. Bell, and told him, there was a trunk with property, that I had a suspicion this man had not honestly come by; the prisoner said, he would fetch the owner; I did not conceive it necessary to detain the prisoner, I put the trunk in the possession of Mr. Bell, and requested him not to deliver it without my being present.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the trunk you afterwards saw at the Magistrate's, the same that you left with Bell? A. It was; I went away, and returned to Mr. Bell's again in the evening, about half past five; Mr. Duncan had been with me in the intermediate time, and informed me that he had lost a trunk of that description; I felt sorry that I had not detained the prisoner, but Mr. Duncan and I had not been at Mr. Bell's above five minutes, when the prisoner came into the tap-room; he was brought into the parlour by Mrs. Bell, and I took him into custody; he applied to know if the trunk was taken away; he said, if he should have it, he would take it to the owner; he was then taken before a justice.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am the sister of the last witness; I had this very trunk in my arms the morning of the fire; I put these things into it myself, with my own hands, about a fortnight before.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Bell.) Q. Do you know if the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180101140031"></xptr>trunk, when it was deposited with you, contained those articles? - A. No, I did not see it opened.</p>
               <p>Davis. It was opened at Bell's house that day, and Mr. Duncan saw the contents; it was shut up again, and Perry kept the key.</p>
               <p>Perry. I have had the key ever since.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Maloney. I kept the key of the trunk, and it was not opened from the time that I locked it, till it was opened at Mr. Bell's; Mr. Duncan and my husband took the key for that purpose; I am certain all these things were my sister's.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was going to work by the fire; I stood there about ten minutes; a man gave the trunk to me out at the one pair of stairs window, and begged some one to take it of him; it was put through the window, and I took it; he told me to take it to the first public-house in the first turning at the bottom of Gravel-lane, and I delivered it there, it is Mr. Bell's house; when I came back, the man asked me what I had done with it, and I told him I had taken it to where he ordered me, and he told me to go and bring it back again; I went, and then they would not let me have it, and then I went to work on board a ship till night, and when I went to Mr. Bell's at night, they stopped me.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called his serjeant, who had known him seven years, and gave him a good character.</p>

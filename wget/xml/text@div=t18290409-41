            . I am a cabinet-maker, and live in Green-street, Leicester-square. In February last I was overseer of St. Martin's parish, in consequence of which I went to Platt-terrace to see the children the parish had apprenticed; my first visit was on the 12th of February; I did not see Colpit that day - I first saw the daughter, and asked her if I might see the children who had been bound from our parish, and without any hesitation she brought five of them; they went into the parlour with me - some of them appeared very ill, and emaciated extremely; I expressed a desire to both the mother and daughter to take them away - there was some objection on the part of both of them, and I said I would call the next day; I called the next day, the 13th, accompanied by Mr. Wright, a surgeon - when I got to the house I think the little girl name Harford opened the door; I saw both the Hibners, and requested to see the children. and went up into the room in which they were working; Mr. Wright, at my request, asked the children several questions, having first requested the prisoners to leave the room - several of the children appeared very ill indeed, and we both particularly requested the mother and daughter to allow us to take them away with us; they objected to it very much indeed, but one that was then ill they would have allowed us to have taken - she was not in the room but in the back parlour; they objected to our removing any of those who were brought into the room - Colpit was not brought into the room; in consequence of what one of the children said we went into the back parlour; Mrs. Hibner accompanied us there - we found Colpit lying on a mattress, without any proper covering; there was apparently a dirty shawl or part of a blanket over her - she had a night gown and cap on; she said nothing to my knowledge in Hibner's hearing - Mrs. Hibner told us she had been in the habit of wetting her bed very much indeed, and to convince us of the truth of her assertion she took the bed up, folding it up with the child in it, and showed us the stains which had come through being wetted; being annoyed at she manner in which the mattress was folded, I remarked that I thought she would hurt the child; of that she seemed to take very little notice whatever - we removed six of the children that day, but not at this time; we went afterwards and removed them - Colpit was among them: we took her to St. Pancras Infirmary, for Mr. Wright considered her in too dangerous a state to be removed further - she appeared very ill, particularly thin; she appeared merely skin and bone, her lips were contracted a great deal, the teeth much exposed, a redness about the eyes, on one eye I observed a cut, and I think there was a bruise on the forehead, to the best of my recollection.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you any duty at St. Martin's workhouse? A. Yes, I had general duty as an overseer - six children were apprenticed to Mrs. Hibner; I never saw them on Sundays at the workhouse - it is the duty of the master of the house to know who comes; I was admitted readily to the prisoner's house - they were willing at the second visit for us to take away the one who was ill; I did not accompany the person who fetched it away - I did not notice whether the child bad wetted the bed, or not, for my mind was in a state of agitation to get the mattress put down again, considering the child would be hurt; I could not tell whether it was a shawl or blanket on the bed - it was certainly not a whole blanket - it was a woollen covering.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. Do you recollect the state of the weather about that time? A. I think it was wet - it was cold.</p>

            . I was apprenticed to the elder prisoner - I went to live with her in November twelve months. Colpit came to live there either last Easter or Whitsuntide, I cannot tell which - we had eight apprentices at that time; Colpit was taken away by the officers about ten weeks ago; she was called up to work between three and four o'clock, and continued to work till between ten and eleven at night, from Michaelmas till the time she went away - she used to have a slice of dry bread, and a cup of milk and water at breakfast time; she had nothing else in the course of the day, and no other meal till the next morning - she had her breakfast at half-past eight o'clock, and was allowed five minutes to eat it in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it ever happen that she had no breakfast? A. Yes, sometimes they used to say she had not earned her breakfast, and should not have it, and then they would give her potatoes at one o'clock; there were 9lbs. between us all when we had any, including the prisoners - there were twelve in all; when she had potatoes for dinner she had nothing else all day - we went to bed between ten and eleven o'clock; we slept on the floor up stairs, in the workroom - the mother and daughter had a bed, blanket, counterpane, and sheet; Colpit laid along with us, eight of us, apprentices - we laid together on the floor; we had one blanket under, and one over us, and our clothes on - Colpit's grandmother brought her a frock and petticoat, and she had a green baize of her own; she had no stockings - that was the only accommodation we had during the whole winter, from Michaelmas till we were taken away; but we did not lay so before Michaelmas - once a fortnight, on Sundays, we had meat, and on some Sundays we were down stairs in the kitchen locked in; on other Sundays, when we had meat, we were up stairs in the work-room - our mistress was at home during those Sundays; the shutters to the kitchen window were shut on the Sundays when we were down there, and the door locked; Colpit was never allowed to go out - she was in good health when she came to live with us, and continued so till the food was changed, and then she got ill; I first perceived her unwell about a week after the victuals had been taken off - <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182904090026"></xptr>they made her keep to the frame after the victuals had been taken off.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she ever found fault with for not doing her work? A. Yes, she used to be ill, which prevented her doing it - she was beat for not doing it; they all beat her in turns, and sometimes the forewoman beat her - I have seen them beat her; the other prisoner was the forewoman, her name is Robinson; they sometimes beat her with a rod, a cane, or a slipper - the daughter has taken her out of the frame, and knocked her on the floor, taken her up and knocked her down again; I never saw her punish her in any other way.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you ever recollect seeing a pail of water in the place? A. Yes - it was brought into the back room to wash the stairs with, and the daughter took her up by the heels, and dipped her head in twice, and then Robinson said, "Take her up, dip her in again, and finish her;" that only happened once - she used to cry, and ask mistress for food. but she did not get it; mistress used to say it was no use for her to cry, for the more she cried the longer she should be without it - mistress kept a dog, and the food for it was brought from Gray's Inn-lane; the son had some pigs; the man who misled them used to have the wash from the tavern, and when that has been brought for the dog I have seen Colpit, Foster and Howse take and eat it- there used to be sometimes bits of fish and bits of mutton chops in it, and they used to take it out and eat it; they took Colpit and Proctor to Judd-street one day to a doctor - I never saw a doctor come to the house to them at all.</p>

               <p>Q. How often were you washed or cleaned? A. We used to sluice our faces in the morning - our linen was changed sometimes once a fortnight or three weeks;

             took in the milk that was used in the house - half a pint was all that was taken in in the morning; a halfpenny worth was taken out of it for their afternoon tea, and the rest was divided among us.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where have you been since you left the prisoners' house? A. At Cripplegate; I have not talked this over much there - Mr. Metcalf, the churchwarden, asked me about it, and I spoke to the mistress of the school about it, but not to any body else; the mistress only asked how I laid, and what victuals I had - I did not tell her or the churchwarden the whole story; I told the rest at Hicks'-hall.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not stated a great many more things of consequence at Hicks'-hall, than you told the churchwarden? A. Not a great many more; I went to church once when I first went to the prisoners, and only once - when I first went there I went on a great many errands; I went to the City for cotton - none of the other girls went; sometimes the mistress went herself; we have not had tea since the victuals was taken off - I do not know what month that was in; we have never had tea since that.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not been treated with some kindness yourself by the daughter? A. When I first went there they said I should be forewoman over the girls; she did not buy fruit for me: I have had fruit given me by my friends, who have come to see us - nobody came to see me for six months, till a fortnight before I left, when my two sisters came; they are grown up: Colpit's grandmother came to see her - none of the others have got friends, except Howse, who has a sister; nobody has called for a long time, except Colpit's grand-mother, to my knowledge - three of the children have no friends at all; there were eight: four of them came a month after I got there.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you the same number at the time you were moved, as before? A. No, one was dead; Harris has got a father and mother, and she went to her friends.</p>
               <p>Q. Some of the little girls were dirty in their habits, were not they? A. Proctor used to wet her clothes, because they would only let her go down in the yard at meal hours.</p>
               <p>Q. She could have avoided that, though not allowed to go down? A. Yes.</p>

            . I went to live at Hibner's about a year ago, to do tambour-work; there were eight girls in all when I first went, seven besides myself; we used to get up sometimes at three o'clock, and sometimes at four, in the morning, and worked sometimes till two o'clock in the night, and sometimes till twelve; if we had not done our work mistress used to keep us without victuals, and she used to give us a good flogging before we went to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Used she to let you go to bed after flogging you? A. Yes, sometimes she let us go to bed, and sometimes she kept us up all night - she did so for two nights running; we had breakfast sometimes - I do not know particularly at what time; it was a bit of dry bread, and sometimes a drop of milk and water: if we had not done breakfast in ten minutes she would say she would take it away; when we had no breakfast we sometimes had potatoes, and sometimes we had none at all: once we had nothing to eat all day, from the time we got up till we went to bed- when we had breakfast we had no potatoes given us: we sometimes had meat once a fortnight; this short food began about three weeks after we were bound; we had been on liking first, and were fed very well then; I remember Colpit coming - she was in very good health when she first came; she afterwards became sick and ill- that was about five weeks after she first came; she complained of a pain in her side, and sometimes of the head-ache; she used to tell the prisoners so, and Mrs. Hibner used to say, "Never mind, you must do your work" - she did not wear stockings; I knew of her feet being had, and I told mistress of it - they were had a good while before I told mistress of it; she first told me they were bad in the winter: I told mistress of it - she said, "Never mind, you must wait a bit, for I have not got time to go down to her" - I complained to her again the same afternoon, and she said, "Never mind, she must lay there;" she was lying in the back room then, and confined to her bed, and had been so about a week.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you speak to your mistress after that about her feet? A. Yes, and then she gave me a cup of bread and milk poultice to put to them; she had been unable to do her work for a good while.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember at any time while she was so ill, her being told to clean the stairs? A. Yes, the daughter told her (there was a pail of water there - Colpit did her tambour-work wrong), and she did them, but could not quite finish them; she fell down on the stairs, and said she felt so weak she could not do them - she was taken up<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182904090027"></xptr>stairs, flogged well, and sent down again to do them; the daughter took her up stairs - I went up stairs, for I had to fetch her up; I saw the daughter flog her with a cane and a rod: she beat her a good bit - she took her clothes up to beat her: she sent her down to finish the stairs, and she made water on the stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. What made her do it there? A. Because she was not strong enough to go down stairs; she had her nose rubbed in it - the daughter did it: I have seen her taken by her clothes and dipped into a pail of water, a good many times; that was on the day the stairs were cleaned; the daughter dipped her in - it was after the flogging: Robinson was there, but mistress had gone out; her head was dipped into the pail five times - Robinson said,"Dip her in again, and that will finish her;" this was about seven weeks before she was taken away - it was since Christmas.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you, since October last, seen any body beat Colpit? A. Yes, the forewoman did, and sometimes the mother; she was beat very often - they beat her with a slipper: I have seen a slipper, a rod, and a cane used to beat her, because she did not do her work right, as she complained of a pain in her inside; they beat her sometimes at night, and sometimes in the middle of the day: she was working all day - I sat near her at the frame; she was in the middle of us; there were four girls between me and her at the frame - she could not do her work, she was too ill. We all slept on the floor, sometimes in the work room and sometimes in the back room; when we slept in the work room we had nothing but a blanket under us, and one over us; it was very thin, and we were very cold - Colpit was covered the same way as we were.</p>
               <p>Q. Your mistress kept a dog; were you the little girl that used to fetch the errands? A. Yes; I fetched the victuals for the dog from where Hibner's brother kept pigs, in Gray's Inn-lane; I used to bring it in a little wooden sieve - it was hog-wash, and came out of the tub the hogs feed in; at times there were little bits of fish and bones in it - I used at times to eat it myself, and so did Colpit - we all used to eat it, because we were so hungry; I was the cook, and used to boil the potatoes -I used to get 6lbs., and sometimes 3 1/2lbs.; eight of us and the forewoman eat of them; we had nothing but potatoes; the forewoman used to have a red-herring sometimes - mistress and her daughter dined by themselves.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The forewoman lived as you did? A. Sometimes. I now live at Cripplegate workhouse, and am now very well - all the girls are there now, except those who are dead; they are all pretty well now.</p>
               <p>Q. Did people frequently come to the house since October? A. Not very often: a man came with milk - nobody else brought food to the house: I used to fetch the coals: I used to be put up stairs with the others, when the prisoners went out; sometimes when they were out some of us went out, but we dare not go far, for fear they should come back - I knew my way to the workhouse: we never went there while we lived at the prisoners - we never went to church.</p>
               <p>Q. How many of the children's friends did you see there? A. Colpit's grandmother and sometimes Ellis' mother and father came - that was about five weeks ago- the prisoners were there then, and the girls at home; we used to eat the dog's victuals every day - it used to be put in two large tubs, but it was brought to our house in a sieve.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. What became of you on Sundays? A. They used to send us down to bed; we were locked in the room, and could not come out -

             - I lived at the prisoners about a twelvemonth; since Michaelmas last we sometimes used to have one meal a day - sometimes we used to get up at three o'clock, and go to work directly; sometimes we used to work till one o'clock, and sometimes till twelve - we used to have half a slice of dry bread, and sometimes we used to have milk and water, and sometimes none; when we had breakfast we did not have dinner on the same day; when we had dinner we sometimes used to have potatoes - Colpit was fed in the same way; she used to say she could eat a bit more: she did not get it; when she first came she had good health - she began to get ill after the alteration of our food.</p>
               <p>Q. After she became ill was she required to get up and work in the same way as before? A. Sometimes she used, and sometimes she used not, because she was not well; when she did not do her work she was beat, sometimes by Robinson, sometimes by mistress, and sometimes by the daughter; she was beat with a rod and a cane - I remember her being desired to wash the stairs - she was ill at that time, and was so weak she could not wash them; she was dipped into the pail of water by the daughter - Robinson was in the room, and said, "Take her up again and finish her." On Sunday we were down in the kitchen, locked up; we sometimes at night laid on the floor of the work room, with a blanket under and a blanket on the top of us - we all eight laid together - we laid in that way all the cold weather.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined Q. What do you mean by saying sometimes you had only one meal a day, then sometimes you had more? - A. Yes; when we entered we did, but not very often - we sometimes, since October, had more than one meal when we earned it; the second meal was potatoes; we had no tea; we had milk and water in the morning, that was all; we only had milk and water of an evening three times while we were there - the daughter gave me an orange when I was coming to my mother - that was a good while before I was taken away; it was a little after I was bound; I, Colpit, and Proctor had gin and water sometimes, because we were weak; that was not long ago - Robinson took me to the doctor's in Judd-street, and the daughter took me once - Colpit went with me; it was about three months ago; we had no oranges then - they gave us physic - we were left in the house about five o'clock one evening, when the prisoners were out; it was not long ago - Robinson's mother was then in care of the house; I do not recollect it being left without her - I do not recollect any of the girls going out while the prisoners were out - I did not know my way to the workhouse; I do not recollect anybody but the milkman calling at the house - I have a mother - I went to see her twice after I was bound.</p>

             in bed in the back parlour, No. 13, Platt-terrace, St. Pancras-road: I found her in a very emaciated state indeed, with sores on her toes, which were in a state of mortification: I then requested she might be removed to the St. Pancras Infirmary, which was done; when we got her there, I examined her minutely - I found the body extremely attenuated, with a slight cough, the toes mortified, some of them about separating at the time; all the toes on the left foot, except one, partook of mortification, and the right foot was in the same state, but was the worst. I attended her till Sunday, the 15th of March, when she died, in St. Pancras infirmary: after her death I examined her body, with two other medical gentlemen; there were abscesses on the lungs, with tubercles covering the lungs, a slight inflammation of some of the abdominal viscera and stone in the left kidney: her death arose from abscess on the lungs - that was the approximate cause, in conjunction with the mortification of the toes - I have heard two of the children examined - and have no doubt these tubercles might be produced by the treatment described, and want of food. I attribute the mortification of the feet to the want of food and necessary exercise - cold and wet would be an exciting cause - the disease might have been in the lungs a long time; the tubercles had been going on a long time I have no doubt; she had a bruise on the right eye, and some bruises on the right arm particularly - I should not think them produced by very violent blows.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you surgeon to the parish officers? - A. I am surgeon to the Directors of the parish. The mortification of the feet was not an exciting cause of the disease in the chest - I should hardly expect that had caused death: it might eventually have done so, but it might have been removed: many causes produce abscesses in the lungs, but these could not have been formed for any length of time, or there must have been puerile expectoration, which there was not; the inflammation might have been going on for a great length of time; the prisoner consented to her being moved to the Infirmary directly I requested it.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. When did you first observe expectoration of matter from the chest? A. In about ten days.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live in Oxenden-street. I saw this child twice while alive - it was in a dreadfully emaciated state; I examined the body after death; there was extensive disease on the chest, a vast number of tubercles; on the abdomen several patches of inflammation, in the kidneys a stone, and the toes mortified- the death was caused by abscesses of the lungs, together with mortification of the feet; tubercles were formed in the lungs; ill treatment, and the want of food, are very likely to produce those consequences - if tubercles had been formed in the lungs, the treatment described would produce such excitement as to accelerate death, as it would bring them into action.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You are a member of the College of Surgeons? A. I am; I cannot give any date to the commencement of the disease in the lungs, or say how long the ulceration or tubercles had been formed; the mortification of the toes alone, in the state I saw them, could not have produced death - subjects dying from diseased lungs generally die in a state of great emaciation; exposure to cold is the most general cause of the disease, and most likely was so in this case.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Has it happened that persons in the lowest condition of life, who have been all their lives in workhouses, have been much under your care? A. Very much; they are very often the children of diseased and weak parents, and more liable to consumption than any other complaint - commencing at times in early life, but generally at an advanced period; every thing which occurs to them has doubtless a tendency to increase these symptoms. I think dipping her head two or three times into a pail of water very likely to bring the tubercles into action, and form abscesses.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live in Brewer-street, St. Pancras. I was called in to see the deceased after she was in the Infirmary - I found her in a very emaciated state, and her feet mortified: I examined her after death, and she had abscesses on the lungs, calculus in the kidney, and a slight inflammation in the abdomen.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing inflammation to have taken place in the lungs, and tubercles to have been there, what, in your opinion, would have been the result of dipping her head into cold water as described? A. It would aggravate the disease and produce ulceration; my opinion is, that she died from abscesses in the lungs, which would have been aggravated by the treatment she received, and by dipping in water; the want of food and proper clothing would accelerate it.</p>

            . I am a pensioner. The witness Ellis is my daughter-in-law; I went to the prisoner's house several times and saw her; the last time was a fortnight after Christmas; she came home on Sundays, and I used to go home with her - the last time was about two months ago; I and my wife took her back; we saw one of the children -I think it was Harford.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any complaint to make of your child? A. I thought she had not her proper fill of victuals - she took victuals back on Sundays with her.</p>

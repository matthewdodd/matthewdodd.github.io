            Look at that note, and tell us if you have any correspondence with any house of that name? - A. This is a bill that was tendered to me by Ortman, on the 27th of May; I told him it was a forged note, and that we knew none of the parties; we had no correspondence at Yarmouth, nor did we know any of the parties.</p>
               <p>Q. You have not any correspondence at Yarmouth, nor are you acquainted with any such names? - A. No, we are not.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. I suppose all you mean to say is, that you have no correspondence with any such person at Yarmouth? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Is there any body here that has been at Yarmouth? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. As I am in the presence of God, these witnesses are mistaken with regard to my person, as I hope to prove by upright and just witnesses.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley contended that it was essentially necessary to prove the non-existence of such a person at Yarmouth.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Buller. We are now upon a question of evidence, and it must go to the Jury-let us see how the case stands:-here is a bill drawn by a person at Yarmouth, who prosesses himself to be a correspondent of Pybus, Call, and Company; a witness is called, who is a clerk in their house, and he swears that they had no such correspondent; then it is not a genuine bill, and what it imports to be.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Taking it that the instrument is a false instrument, then the prosecutors are to prove the averment.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Buller. They prove that there is no man of the name of Cavendish corresponding with that house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. it is not the best evidence that the nature of the case will admit of, because they might have brought a person here from Yarmouth.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Buller. The witness has proved that no such man corresponds with their house, that is a fact positively sworn to.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. (To Ortman). I think you said before the Magistrate, that the person who called at your house, had his hair well dressed and powdered? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say his hair was powdered? -

               <p>Mr. Alley. (To Greatbead.) Q. Do you recollect seeing the prisoner at any time before this indictment was preferred? - A.

               <p>Court. Q. Who was in your house at the same time? - A. John Lee, William Fenwick, and a servant of Lord Macdonald's, came in a little before four, he staid there till about six o'clock.</p>

            About a quarter before four, the boy always takes some beer to a shop in the neighbourhood, I asked him where he was going with that beer, and he said Mr. Fenwick and Mr. Hindes; and I am sure he was there before that, because I had spoke to him.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know he was there till six? - A. I was writing a letter to my brother at Egham, and I heard the bell go, it goes a quarter before six; I sent my boy after the bell-man with a penny, and instead of giving it to the bell-man he had put it in the Penny post-office; I asked him why he was gone so long; and he said the Post-office was half way up Bond-street; I sent him to get it back again, he got it, and I gave it to the bell-man; it was then past six, and while he was gone, Mr. Hindes and Mr. Lee, and Lord Macdonald's servant, were conversing about the letter, and offered to lay a wager it would go just as safe being put into the Penny-post, as if it had been given to the bell-man.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you all this time? - A. I had never been out of the house, I was no where but in the bar, and in the tap-room.</p>
               <p>Q. Between the time of sending out the beer to this neighbour, and sending out the letter, had you seen the prisoner frequently? - A. Yes; he sat down directly under the dial, facing the bar-door.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, that during that time, he never went out? - A. I never missed him all that time, to the best of my knowledge; I do not think he could have gone out without my seeing him.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it was Saturday, the 27th of May? -

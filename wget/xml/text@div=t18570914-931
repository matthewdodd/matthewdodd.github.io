                  </hi>. vis. I live with my brother, Benjamin Thomas Davis, in Kingland Road. On Thursday, 6th Aug., the prisoner came, and asked for a dress, which came to 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; she gave me a crown, I gave her a halfpenny, and she left the shop—I put the crown into the till; there was no other crown there—my sister-in-law and I were in the shop, no other person—this was about half past 9 o'clock; the shop was closed at a quarter before 10—no one came into the shop after the prisoner—my brother came home in about a quarter pf an hour, and my sister-in-law took the money out of the till, and brought it to him—no other person had been to the till—on the following Saturday night week, 15th Aug., about half past 9 o'clock, the prisoner came again, for a common cap and a pair of stockings; they came to 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and she gave me a crown—I tried it with the detector, and found it was bad—I told the prisoner I had not sufficient change, and I went to Mr. Howard's, at the next door—I did not lose sight of the crown—a constable was fetched, and the prisoner given in charge—I said that it was the second one I had taken of the prisoner—she said she did not know this one was bad; she did not say anything about the first one—I marked the crown, and gave it to the constable—I got the other crown from my brother; I marked that, and gave it to the constable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> She said that it was on a Tuesday, and that her brother came and took the money out of the till, and thought the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece was bad, and pat it into a bag with more silver, and took it out the next morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Benjamin Davis, who is the brother of the last witness. I recollect taking a bad crown from the till, and giving it to my husband, on Thursday, 6th Aug.—the last witness and I were in the shop that day—my husband came home about a quarter before 10 o'clock, and I took the money out of the till—there was no other crown in the till—my husband put it into a paper in a bag by itself.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the husband of the last witness. I came home on Thursday night, 6th Aug., and my wife gave me the money out of the till—I have no doubt about its being on Thursday night, because I had just come from taking a second business—the money my wife gave me was a half crown, a shilling, and this bad crown—I put it in paper into a bag, and kept it till the Monday week afterwards, and gave it to my sister to give to the policeman—I am sure the crown which was brought to me out of the till was the same that I gave to my sister on the 17th; I had kept it wrapped in paper all the while.</p>

I took the prisoner on 15th Aug., in Mr. Davis's shop—I received this crown from Miss Davis then, and received this other crown from her on the 17th—when Miss Davis said in the shop that it was the second crown the prisoner had given her, the prisoner made no answer—at the station Miss Davis said, "I think it was on Tuesday;" the prisoner said, "You are mistaken"—Miss Davis after<lb></lb>wards said it was on Thursday—when I took the prisoner it was about 8 o'clock; the gas was lighted.</p>

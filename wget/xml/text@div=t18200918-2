On the 5th of June, a little after ten o'clock at night, I was coming up the street, and heard the watchman's rattle sprung; I went to the house, several people had collected before I arrived, but none had entered the house. I went home, got a mawl, broke the pannel of the door open, and was the first person that entered the house - the street door was bolted, and had a small chain across, which would enable it to be opened a little, if unbolted. I let the people in, went along the passage, and on the right hand, at the end, I discovered a fire.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in the fire-place - A. I cannot exactly tell, there was a great deal of smoke. I saw the fire burning under what I thought was a boiler, but afterwards it turned out to be a cask with a cock to it - it was in the bar; we called for water, which the neighbours handed in, and we put the fire out in the bar, and at the bottom of the cellar stairs we found a pile of wood on fire, against the partition which was also on fire - it did not blaze - water was thrown on it, and it was put out. I then got the watchman's lanthorn, and opened the cellar flap. I had made a hole in the floor to throw the water into the cellar, but on examination found it was not opposite the place. I saw the prisoner about eleven o'clock, but had no conversation with him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Do you not know that coals and wood were kept in the cellar - A. I do not know. The fire had burnt through the floor to the bar.</p>

            . I live nearly opposite to the King's Arms. I heard a noise about eleven o'clock at night, and went to the house - they were then throwing water on the fire. I went home, changed my dress, and on my return they were opening the cellar flap; I entered the cellar with other people, and observed the partition burning, and a quantity of wood laid against the partition - it appeared a place intended to keep wood in. I took up a piece, it was the stave of a cask; Randall, the fireman, was knocking the partition down. I remained there until the fire was completely extinguished, we went to the front room on the first floor, which was full of smoke. We opened the windows, and examined every room - there were beds there, but no sheets on them. I went to the back parlour, and saw some pieces of paper and other stuff on fire in the cupboard, sparks of fire were on them; they were opening the cupboard, and taking the paper out as I went into the parlour. The bar is on the right-hand side of the passage, and the room with the cupboard was on the left - it was impossible for one to burn through to the other; the closet was near the stove of the back room, but there was no communication between them; a bundle of candles were taken out of the closet, partly burnt, and the door of the closet was blistered inside, as if by fire. The house was quite different from being fully furnished. I am an appraiser myself, but had rather not set a value on it - it was quite contrary from being good.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long had the house been closed - A. Only since September I know there was a petition from the churchwardens and inhabitants to renew the licence. The place in the cellar appeared a place to keep wood in. Several people were in, I saw none with torches, but the watchmen had their lanthorns. The people had been in the house an hour or more before I went to the cupboard; part of the paper was consumed, but there were only sparks when it was discovered.</p>

            . I am an officer of Shadwell. About ten o'clock at night I heard of the fire, and was among those who first went in. I ordered two men to get pickaxes and break open the door. I did not examine the back door until sometime after - it was then open; the fire in the bar had burnt upwards and downwards. I went down and found the wood burning against the partition - there was no fire-place in the cellar. I came up to the back parlour, opened the closet door, which was closed, I opened it with my fingers, and discovered pieces of paper burning, but they were all burnt out then, and were in a state of tinder; there were sparks of fire and two bundles of candles lay there, a little burnt and melted, and the door rather blistered. It seemed a general closet for all sorts of things. I went to the cellar again to look under the closet to see if any fire was there, but found none. There was no fire in the fire-place of the parlour, but on a round table there was a small bundle of matches, a tinder box, and a candle half burnt - it was not burning then; none of the matches were burnt. I examined the house, and found some empty boxes, the drawers were also empty, and the beds had no sheets or curtains on them. There was not much furniture in the house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. There was no fire in the parlour, therefore it was necessary to have matches to strike a light - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were people living in the house at the time - A. Yes; none of the matches were burnt. The street door was chained across; I think the force of a maul broke the chain.</p>

            . I am a fireman of the Phoenix Fire Office. When I arrived at the fire several persons had entered the house. I got there about eleven o'clock, and entered at the cellar window - water was brought, and I put the fire out. I went to the upper rooms - we opened the staircase window on the first floor to let out the smoke. I found a room on the second floor fastened by a piece of wood being put through the asp, I went in, and found the furniture in confusion - a quantity of loose paper laid on the floor, in a heap, I suppose a bushel. We then came down to the back parlour, and saw the officer open the cupboard door; a fellow-servant of mine held up a piece of wood or iron with the embers of fire on it. I found Mr. Bates at Mr. Jones's, Stepney-green; he came to the door - I had my fireman's dress on - I told him the house had been on fire, but it was then out, he said he would go with us - I had not asked him. On our way he asked me if I had the keys? I said No, we were obliged to break the door open. I asked him whom he was insured with - he said with the Sun. Mills, who was with me, said</p>
               <p>"Was not you in your house this evening?</p>
               <p>"He said Yes, and supposed he left about half-past eight o'clock. Mills asked him if he locked the door after him, and if he was the last person in the house - he said he was. Mills then said,</p>
               <p>"Certainly you must have the key." He said,</p>
               <p>"Oh, dear! Mrs. Bates has got it." When we got to the house I told the Sun firemen he was insured with them, and left him with them.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. It was a cupboard where the refuse for lighting fires in the house was kept - A. I supposed so.</p>
               <p>THOMAS MATTHEWS. I am a watchman of Shadwell. I saw Lawley break the door open, he was the first person that entered. I went to the bar, and found it on fire; after throwing water on it we found it arose from the cellar, which had burnt through. I did not see the back door.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The front door was fastened inside, whoever locked it could not have left that way - A. No, my Lord. I went into the parlour on the left, and saw some remains of fire in the grate; a sailor-looking man threw water on it by my desire, the smoke was then so great I was obliged to go to the front.

            . I am surveyor and appraiser to the Sun Fire Office; it is my duty when a fire happens to survey the premises. I went to these premises on the 6th of June, which was the following day; it was impossible for the fire in the cupboard to be occasioned by the one in the cellar - they were twenty feet asunder - nor could the fire in the grate communicate to it, there was at least eight feet of brick-work between them. I saw Bates on entering the house, and after examining it had some conversation with him.</p>
               <p>Q. What furniture did you discover - A. A very miserable quality; I valued the whole, including his own wearing apparel and his wife's, at 115 l. 15 s., which was all there was to satisfy articles insured for 1000 l. I found china and glass, value 9 l. 7 s. insured at 100 l., and the stock and utensils, which I consider the fitting up of the bar and the fixtures, value 96 l. 8 s., insured at 500 l. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182009180005"></xptr>asked Bates if he had lost anything - he said Yes, he had lost a leather portmanteau about a yard long, from under his bed in the front one pair room, and it contained a quantity of plate, which he mentioned, it was a silver teapot, nine table-spoons, seven tea-spoons, four dozen of ivory handled knives and forks, with silver tips, a gold necklace, two silver snuff boxes, a pair of sugar tongs, seven or eight rings, a pair of silver buckles, and many other articles of jewellery. I enquired if anything else was lost, he said only eighteen common dinner plates from the kitchen. I said the circumstances of the fire were so very suspicious, that I could not presume for a moment, that he would be paid a farthing for his loss - he said it was a hard case.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. The beer and other things constitute the stock in trade - A. Certainly. I do not know whether the brewer can tell what beer was there. It would cost him nothing to renew his policy when his licence was renewed. His bed appeared to have been slept in, but there were no sheets on it. If he had moved his stock the office would have allowed him to transfer his policy. His wife subsequently complained of linen being lost.</p>

            , ESQ. I am a magistrate of Shadwell. The prisoner's licence was suspended twelve months ago, not in consequence of his misconduct, but his wife's. The licencing day is to-morrow.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I trust I shall give every satisfaction. I hoped to obtain my licence again, and remained in the house. Immediately as my business was over I went to the Excise Office, withdrew my entry, and returned my beer and liquor. I thought it not worth while to alter my policy. When they sent to me to pay the money I took my policy and gave it to the gentleman, he said the old policy would do; he took 2 l. short in payment, sometime after they sent to inform me of it, and I went and paid it. A Mr. Jones had agreed to take a house about the time of the fire, we were to meet his brokers at the Sampson and Lion, public-house, about it, at eight o'clock. On the 5th of June Jones called on me, we went with his wife and mine - all four set off together - the brokers did not come; we left, went to a house in Neptune-street, and remained there about three-quarters of an hour - it was then near twelve o'clock; we then went towards Jones's house, called at the Ship, and asked the landlord to let us take home half a gallon of porter, as it was late; just as we had had supper at Jones's, a knock came at the door, I heard myself asked for, and was informed my house was on fire; I got my hat, and ran after the man. I said I had given my wife the key. I never saw the house after I left it at eight o'clock.</p>

            . I was employed as an occasional servant to the prisoner, I lived as a regular servant with him ten months; they kept another servant for eleven weeks, and then I occasionally went to assist them; only he and his wife lived there, the children were at school. The firewood and coals were kept in the cellar. There was a black and white cat in the house, I saw it after the fire, it had the hair on its back burnt. Candles for the evening's use, and rags to clean the candlesticks with, were kept in the cupboard.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. When were you there last before the fire - A. The day it happened, I called as Mr. and Mrs. Bates were going into the country to fetch the children home.</p>
               <p>Q. After you ceased to be the prisoner's regular servant, where did you live - A. I lived at Mrs. Jones's three months; I cannot say whether Mr. Bates ever slept there. The cat's hair was burnt about the breadth of the palm of my hand - Rose, the fireman, saw it. They generally went out at the back door at night, as the front door had bad fastenings.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. While you was in their service had they sheets to their beds - A. Yes, my Lord; they kept their plate in a portmanteau under the bed, there was always sufficient for use about.</p>

            . I live next door to this house.

The fire could not have been more than a quarter of an hour's continuance.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. Then it must have caught fire while the people were in the house - A. That is my opinion.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. On what is your opinion founded - A. On my observation on the evidence; it was burnt so little I think it could not have burnt longer - it was but partly burnt.</p>

            . I am a publican, and keep the Sampson and Lion, East Smithfield. In the early part of June I lived at Stepney-causeway; I intended to go into my house on the 6th of June. I saw the prisoner on the night of the fire, I had called on him with my wife at eight o'clock, for him and his wife to go with us to the Sampson and Lion - I called by appointment - we were going to meet the brokers. I went into the prisoner's back parlour, we came out at the front door, he fastened himself in, and came out at the back door; we waited for him in the street, and he came round to us; we then went to the Sampson and Lion, stopped there till near half-past ten o'clock, the brokers did not come, and we went away. It rained hard when we got to the Neptune, at the corner of Neptune-street, we called in there until the rain abated, then left; it rained again, we called at the Ship, remained there until half-past eleven o'clock, then proceeded to my house at Stepney-causeway. About half-past twelve o'clock a knock came to the door, and Mr. Bates was asked for. He had remained in our company from the time we left his house until then.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did you expect to be kept so late at the Sampson and Lion - A. No, the brokers were to come at eight o'clock. It was nearer to go to my house than to the prisoner's. He was to sleep at his own house that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you prepared any bed for a stranger that night - A. No; Mrs. Bates did not go with her husband, she went into Seabrook's, and remained behind.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When you called at eight o'clock where did you find Bates - A. In the back parlour; there was a fire in the grate; he did not go into the cellar that I know.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a porter in the employ of the London and North Western Railway at the Camden station—the prisoner was a porter at the same station—on 20th December, about 8. 30 p m., I noticed a</p>

I don't know how long the coat had been hanging there; they generally hang there all day—the prisoner said before the Magistrate that he had often reported to me finding loose cases, and I said he may have done so—he did not do so that morning.</p>

I am a checker in the employ of the railway company at Camden station—on 20th December I remember a box of fans being loaded there—some of the boxes fell out—the prisoner was helping me, and I sent him to stow them up on the bank so as to make room for other goods—that was about 9 a. m.—between then and 8.30 he would have an hour and a half for his meals.</p>

I am a detective-sergeant in the employ of the London and North Western Railway Company—on 20th December, about 8.30, the witness spoke to me at the station, in consequence of which I ordered all the men to take their coats—I examined the coat which the prisoner took—I found a fan rolled up in brown paper in the outside pocket—if he had found the fan it was his duty either to give it up to the checker or to have sent for me immediately—I asked him to account for its being in his pocket—he said he had been packing up some boxes and it fell out into the run and he picked it up and put it in his pocket—that he was very sorry; it was the first time he had ever done anything wrong—I examined the box and found one empty—each fan was packed in a separate card box.</p>

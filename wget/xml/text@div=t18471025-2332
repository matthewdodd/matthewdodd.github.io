                  </hi> I am a shoemaker, in Little Chapel-street, Westminster—I have known the prisoner ten years—he called on me the evening of the 16th of Sept., about nine o'clock—he began talking about boots—he said, "Hyde, have you got that pair of boots that I tried on?"—I said, "Yes, I have"—he then told me he had been to his solicitor, and had got a check for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he produced this check—I looked at it, and laughed at him—I said, "I do not think this is a proper check, Austin; I have had several checks, but never had anything like this; it is only a bit of blank paper"—he said he had had several from his solicitor like that, that he had got it at six o'clock in the evening, that it was too late to go to the Bank, he would change it early next morning, and would I let him have a trifle that night; that it would be safer for him not to take it with him to a common lodging-house—I told him I should not like to lend any money on it—he still pressed me to take care of it—I said, "I have no money to lend you; I have just paid the last away to my workmen; come in half an hour, and I will see what I can do for you"—he went away for a time—I took the check to Mr. Dickers, a cheesemonger, in Broadway, and asked him what he thought of it—I went home again—the prisoner came again, and wanted a little money—I did not feel inclined to lend it him, so to get rid of him I let him have 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., as he said it would be very acceptable to pay his lodging, he left the bill with me—next morning when I opened the door, between seven and eight o'clock, he was there, and wanted me to let him have half-a-crown to get his breakfast, that he should go to the banker's between nine and ten o'clock—I did not let him have any more—he then went to Pattison's the tailor's, and fetched me there—he borrowed a shilling of Pattison—I never saw him again till he was in custody.</p>

                  </hi> I am a solicitor in the Blackfriars-road. I keep an account at the Southwark Branch Bank of the London and Westminster Bank—I did not write this check, or authorize the prisoner or any person to write it—I have known him two years, and have seen him write on several occasions—I believe this to be in his writing—Hyde sent to me the following morning, to know whether it was my writing—(<hi rend="italic">check read</hi>—"Southwark Branch Bank, Sept. 14, 1847.

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman.</hi>) I was before Mr. Cottingham when the prisoner was examined—he made a statement which was taken down—it was read over to him, he signed it in my presence and Mr. Cottingham also—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—the prisoner says, "I admit the checks produced are my writing, but I did not intend they should ever be offered for payment.")</p>

I returned from thence with Mr. Gray, the Dean's Brother, about 8 in the Evening, and when I came Home I found my Laundress waiting for me in the Gardens. She told me that when she came to my Chambers, she found the Door open, and the Drawers of my Bureau lying on the Floor; that she acquainted her Sister with it, who advised her to leave every thing as it was, and lock the Door, and that she did so accordingly. In this Condition I found my Room; my Drawers were tumbled, and my Pocket-book with all the Notes gone. I advertis'd 'em, with a Reward for whoever brought 'em to Mr.

I told her I had lost a Pocket-Case with Notes in it. She said, she had found such a one. Graham said, he saw a Constable in the Street, whom she called Broadon P, and charged him with her. Says she, don't walk with me in Publick, but let me go and I'll fetch 'em. I was not willing to trust her, and so we followed her close to her Lodgings. There she told us, they were upon the Bed's Tester, and we found 'em accordingly. She said, she found 'em on a Bench in Gray's-Inn-Walks, on Wednesday the 8th of August.</p>

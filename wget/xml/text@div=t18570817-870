                  </hi>. The prisoner is my husband, we have been married turned five years. He went into the navy about three years ago—some months afterwards I went to live with another young man—I had a child by him; the prisoner afterwards came home, he came to where I was, and I went to live with him again; the child was not living with us, the father took it away and put it out to wet nurse—last month I went to see it; I had been there about ten minutes, when the father came there to pay something to the nurse—he had been there about a quarter of an hour when my hus<lb></lb>band came into the room—I was nursing the baby—he said, "Oh, this is no more than I expected; give me the key of my room, and I will go home and sell everything"—I gave him the key, and he went away directly—I saw him again on thursday, 6th Aug., he came up stairs, I was in the room by myself, at least the baby was lying on the floor on a pillow—he said, "I want you"—I said, "want me what for?"—he said. "Oh, I will tell you;" he caught hold of my two hands, and knelt on me on the bed, and was rummaging in his Guernsey for his knife—I said, "My God, William, are you going to murder me?"—he said, "Don't halloo," and he commenced stabbing me; only one cut me, but there were several cuts in my dress—the knife broke—it bruised my thigh, but did not cut the flesh.</p>

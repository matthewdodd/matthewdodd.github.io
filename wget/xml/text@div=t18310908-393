On the afternoon of the 12th of September a young woman gave me information; my shopman ran out, and brought back the prisoner - I asked him what property he had about him; he said none - I sent for an officer, and he was searched; I saw him shuffling about, and this handkerchief was found at his feet; it had been hanging inside of the door, fastened with a string - the prisoner had been there to redeem a waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q.Had you known him before? A. I had seen him once or twice - one part of it was across his feet, about three yards from the door, where it had been; there were three persons in the shop - he had been in the shop an hour and a half before, and I consider he loosened the string, so that a slight pull would get it down; he ran about fifty yards.</p>

            . I am an officer. I searched the prisoner - I did not see any thing on the floor when I began to search, but I soon saw this handkerchief on the floor; I took him to the station - he said he wanted a black silk handkerchief, and he had just taken hold of this and it fell into his hat.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my parents, in Slater-street, Bethnal-green. Last Sunday three weeks I was walking in Whitechapel-road with my two sisters and my brother—my brother called out, "Look here, <hi rend="italic">Sally</hi>, this toy is hitting Eliza"—my sister had four rows of large coral beads on, and on my turning round, I saw them in the prisoner's hand—he ran away directly—I saw him again last Friday fortnight at Worship-street—I am quite sure of his person—I did not see him take it off—I had seen it on her neck a little before.</p>

               <p>THOMAS FARRANT. I am in the employ of Mr. Smart, a refiner in Princes-street - on Wednesday, the 18th of December, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came to the shop of my employer, and tendered five gold coins called half-eagles, and asked what they would come to - Mr. Smart told him £5 6s. 8d. - he then asked to have it put down on a piece of paper, that he might show the gentleman what it came to, which Mr. Smart gave him, with a £5 note, and 6s. 8d., and he left the shop - Mr. Smart put the half-eagles into a bowl, and put them into the desk; and I followed the prisoner across Leicester-square into St. Martin's-street - he went into a house at the bottom of St. Martin's-street - I then went to Marlborough-street office and gave information - I afterwards returned to the shop, and received the five half-eagles out of the desk from Mr. Smart - I have them here, and know them to be the same, as I marked them, and have kept them in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.When did you mark them? A.When I came from the office, after giving information - I know we had no others in the shop - what Mr. Smart did in my absence I certainly cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. You received them from the prisoner? A. No - I saw him put them on the counter, and saw Mr. Smart put them into the bowl; and I know there were not any others there at all - we had none in the house - we had had previous information of the robbery; and they were put into the bowl in consequence of that - I might be absent about half an hour.</p>
               <p>THOMAS HOBBS. I am a policeman - in consequence of Farrant's coming to the office, I went to Mr. Jaunay's house, in Leicester-square, between three and four o'clock -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183401020051"></xptr>Mr. Jaunay called the prisoner into the room, and spoke to him in French, which I did not understand - I afterwards asked Mr. Jaunay if he meant to give charge of the prisoner - he said "Yes," in English - the prisoner understands English - I searched him, and found four shillings, two half-crowns, and twopence on him, and a bunch of keys, and two knives - I sent Stone with Mr. Jaunay to his locker, to search that, while I remained in the room with the prisoner.</p>

            . I spoke to the prisoner in French a little - I did not say he should come to no harm if he told the truth, or that I would not hurt him - he begged to be forgiven.</p>
               <p>THOMAS HOBBS re-examined. I said nothing to induce him to confess - I asked how he came to do it - he said, "I know I have done wrong, and I have ruined myself" - he said he only had five half-eagles - I said, "Yes, you had nine" - he said, "No, I only had five, and those I changed at Mr. Smart's to-day" - he said, "That is the remainder of the money which you found on me; and if you will go to my wife, she will give you a £5 note" - he said he had taken them out of a drawer in the gentleman's room - he did not say who the gentleman was.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He said he had done wrong? A. Yes - I told him he had stolen nine half-eagles and nine Napoleons - he said he had not, that he only took five - he said he had changed them, and had done wrong - I asked him if they were in a purse - he said, "No - they were loose in the bottom of the drawer."</p>
               <p>GEORGE STONE. I am a policeman. I went with the other witness - I made the search with Mr. Jaunay - I went with the prisoner to the station-house - when I got there he desired me to go to his wife and get the £5 note - he said if I did not find her at his own house, I should find her at his daughter-in-law's, in Carnaby-market, and I found her there - he said the £5 note was what he had received from Smart for the gold coin, and he gave it to his wife to buy some things - and he dare say she had not changed it yet - he did not say whose it was.</p>

             FITZPATRICK. I am clerk to the magistrate at Marlborough-street office. I was present at the examination of the prisoner, on the 18th - the prosecutor was there - his name I copied in the deposition from a printed card, which he gave me - it was Francis du Suau de la Croix - he answered to that name - the prisoner was present - (looking at the depositions) this is my writing - the depositions were read over to the prisoner - here is a note at the end, signed by Mr. Dyer - it is in my writing - I took it down from the prisoner's mouth - it was read over to him by me - I saw Mr. Dyer sign it - the prisoner was not asked to sign it (read) - "The prisoner says, I admit taking out of the drawer, which was unlocked in the gentleman's room, six pieces of American money, which were laying loose, but I took nothing more."</p>
               <p>FRANCIS JAUNAY re-examined. I know the room from which the coins were taken - I never saw the eagles until they were taken - the prosecutor showed me his purse in his drawers - they were taken from Mr.

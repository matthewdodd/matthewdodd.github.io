                  </hi>. I am barmaid at the Black Prince, Chandos-street, kept by Stephen Davis. The prisoner was his servant of all work—I have charge of the plate—it was kept in the bar, in the drawer over the till—on 21st June, about 3 o'clock in the afternoon, I had taken and used a spoon, and put it on a shelf in the bar, over the bread-drawer—the prisoner came into the bar in about five minutes to get some bread—I was attending to customers, and did not see her do anything—I afterwards missed the spoon, and inquired of the prisoner; she said she knew nothing at all about it, and said, "You are always bothering me for your spoons, you have no business in my kitchen"—this is the spoon (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—about five minutes afterwards, a person named Kelly came in—I had missed a handkerchief from a drawer on 12th June, and asked the prisoner about it—she said she had never been to my drawer, and knew nothing about it—the officer found it in the prisoner's drawer—Kelly had not been in the bar that day.</p>

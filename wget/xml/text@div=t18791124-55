(<hi rend="italic">The affidavit was ultimately read. The pari upon which the perjury was assigned was a denial of the allegation modi in the fourth page of the pamphlet, that prior to Hannah Dobbs entering the service of the defendant or at any period, he had immoral intercourse with her. The original pamphlet produced on the hearing of the injunction was marked Exhibit A, and this not being forthcoming, a certified copy produced before the Magis<lb></lb>trate was after much discussion proved and admitted.</hi>) I next saw the defendant about 7 o'clock that same evening; he came to the area gate, and whittled down the area, and Selina Knight went up—I afterwards went up—he asked me to go out for a walk—I said I could not go out then—he asked me if I would come out later in the evening—I told him I should not be allowed out so late; he asked me to come out after my people had gone to bed; after my master and mistress had gone to bed—I told him I would come out at 11 o'clock—nothing more passed then; he went away between 10 and 11 o'clock; I and my two fellow-servants dressed ourselves to go out—I had not locked the area gate—after we had dressed ourselves we all three laid down on the bed in the room behind the kitchen, where we all three slept, and we went to sleep—we were awoke by two policemen holding a bull's-eye lantern over us—we all three got up, went into the kitchen, I made some coffee, and gave to the policemen—they stopped about 20 minutes as near as I can say, and then went away up the area steps—I think it was about 1 o'clock when we went into the kitchen and gave them the coffee—we then locked up the area gate and the doors and went to bed—I saw the defendant the next evening about 7 o'clock—he whistled down the area again—Selina Knight went up first; I went up afterwards—he said "Why did not you keep your appointment last night?—I said we were very tired; we laid down on the bed, and dropped asleep, and were awoke by two police<lb></lb>men—he said, "Will you come out to night?" I said Yes, I would be out at 11—I got ready and went out at 11—I found him waiting down by the church in Torrington Square—I joined him there, and we went off together—we went to a coffee house; I don't know where it was; it was about a quarter of an hour or 20 minutes' walk from Torrington Square—I don't know in what street it was—we went into a bedroom there; I think it was on the second floor, I am not certain—we went to bed, and he had connection with me</p>

Wallis's two or three months; that was at 133, Euston Road, I think, and I left there to go to Mrs. Cripps—I heard of Mrs. Cripps's situation through Selina Knight—she called on me once in Sandwich Street, and, once at Mrs. Wallis's I think—it might have been twice, but no I more—I met her the evening I was going to see Mrs. Cripps—we lived there together; she was servant at Mrs. Cripps—it was in conse<lb></lb>quence of what she told me that I applied for the situation there; I only stayed there one month—I left because I did not like it—Selina Knight called once; that was in Guilford Street—from there I went to No. 12, New North Street, Mrs. Northcott's; that is a private house where they let apart<lb></lb>ments—I was not in service there, I was only two or three days lodging there—I should have looked out for another situation after leaving Mrs. Cripps if I had not known that I was going to the defendant's—I did not know that I was going there before I went to Sandwich Street; I did not know that the defendant was married then—I think I went there on 17th June, 1876, and left on 2nd August, 1877; I was away nearly a month when I left in August, and I went back to live there again—Mr. Riggen-bach was still living there then—he complained of missing some of his things; there was a little dispute inconsoqnence of that; that was in July, 1877—that was not the reason for my leaving the second time—they did not accuse me of having pledged Mr. Kiggenbaeh's things or having sold them—the defendant wanted some money and he pawned all his own things that he had got—it was after the dispute of Mr. Riggenbach'i things that I left; he lost some more things again in 1878, there was another dispute about that—I did not pledge the second lot, I did the first; I did not sell the second lot, I had nothing to do with it—Mr. Riggenbach visited me when I was in prison for stealing; I told him I knew nothing about his things, he came to ask me about the second lot; it was true as to those—I had pawned the first lot—I did not tell him so, I told him I knew nothing about the second lot—I swear I had not pawned or sold the second lot—I did not sell the second lot to Mrs. Pearce in Euston Street—I never sold Mrs. Pearce any gentlemen's cloth<lb></lb>ing or blankets, or things of that sort, I sold some ladies' clothing—I had not sold anything of Mr. Riggenbach's there; Mrs. Pearce keeps a wardrohe shop, a place for the sale of second hand clothes; I did sell some things to her, but none of Mr. Riggenbach's—I pledged the first lot of his things at Mr. Clarke's, 21, Hampstead Road—I pledged them for the defendant, because he wanted the money for us to go to Redhill together—I knew they were the lodger's things, (<hi rend="italic">The following passages at page</hi>

Mr. Findlay seemed to be a very mysterious personage, he had lots of money, got I know not how"—I did not know how the other lodgers got their money, I never saw anybody get money like Mr. Findlay—"but where he and his money have gone to, I am only permitted to suspect"—I could not say when I wrote this pamphlet where he and his money had gone to—to tell the truth, I mean to say that perhaps he might have been done the same as Miss Hacker—I meant that the sane might have been done to him as was done to Miss Hacker—that is what I suspect; there was a Mr. Findlay lodging there—I stated before the Magistrates, "I have read the pamphlet, there are two or three mistakes in it; one is that I went to Redhill with Mrs. Bastendorff; it should have been Mr. Bastendorff, and there is a wrong name of one of the gentlemen lodgers; Mr. Waldron it should be, it is Mr. Warren, I think those are the only mistakes, the rest of the pamphlet is true. "It is true; there may be some little mistakes in the dates—in the pamphlet H says that I went from Torrington Square to Mrs. Cripps; it should be that I wont to Sandwich Street, and that I went to Mrs. Wallis's before I went to Mrs. Cripps—with those explanations I think the rest of the pamphlet is tree, and that is what I mean. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then are the jury to understand that when you wrote this you suspected that Mr. Findlay, like Miss Hacker, had been murdered at 4, Euston Square?—<hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That was what I fancied, that was what I thought; because the defendant had a revolver. I first thought it when I went back into the service—when I went back I found that Mr. Findlay was gone. I don't say that I knew he had been murdered in the house; I did not suspect he was in the house; I did not think anything about it. I did suspect that he had been murdered. I went back and re<lb></lb>sided in the house where a lodger was missing since I left, suspecting that he was murdered. I afterwards had a watch and chain exactly like Mr. Findlay's, and which I thought was like Mr. Findlay's; I had that just after I went back to the service, about a week after I think. I don't re<lb></lb>member how long I had it, about a fortnight or three weeks. I gave it back to the defendant I afterwards received the watch and chain of Miss Hacker. "The police have been too stupid to guess, their officers too im-becile even to accept, a broad and startling clue. Dogberry and Noodle-dum. No matter, that is public business now. "The startling due was to see if they could go and find Mr. Findlay—I could only suspect where he had gone to—I had not told the police that I thought he was murdered—that was what I thought myself; now you are speaking of what I said of the police—as I said before, the startling clue was to see if they could find him, and inquire about him—I did think he had been mur<lb></lb>dered, and yet I remained in the situation—I do not know who Dogberry is; I never heard of him till I read the pamphlet; I don't know where he lives—I don't know anything about it—I do not know who Noodle dum is, or what he is, or where he lives—I could not fix the time after my return when I received Miss Hacker's watch and chain; the last time I saw Miss Hacker was when she went out to post the letter—that might be on the Thursday or Friday I know it was after she had gone over the third week—she had gone out to post her letter, and she had not returned—it was on the Thursday or Friday that I went to Hampstead with the Bastendorff s' children; it might have been Wednesday—I can't</p>

It was not that Sunday that was spent at Kew Gardens—that is not as I wrote it down in my book—I went again and again to the office—the pamphlet states that I have read it through and declare it to be correct in every particular—I did not any I went to Kew with the defendant—it was not that Sunday that I went to Kew, I was at Redhill, I could not go—I did not read all the pamphlet—I did not read it from beginning to end—I did not write that part that it was true in every particular—I don't know who wrote it—I signed my name to it—I was told to sign it—I don't know by whom, Mr. Moore or Mr. Birley—I did not think of all these little things at the time—I said I thought all the rest was true, all the other particulars—I have not seen much of Mr. Moore and Mr. Birley lately—I have seen them several times about this matter, and have been about with them—I have not seen them here to-day—I saw Mr. Birley here yesterday, but have not spoken to him—I have not seen Selina Knight at their office—I saw her at Mr. Armstrong's office, I met her there—I have seen her every day that the case has been on, every time we came to the Court—I have not gone away with her—I have met Clara Green at the Court, and have seen her twice at Mr. Armstrong's office—I have not seen her at the. Central News office—I saw Selina Knight three or four times between the time of my leaving Mrs. Pearoe and going to Mrs. Cripps—we were always intimate after becoming acquainted at Mrs. Pearce's—I never went to see a baby at Goodge Street, nor vet a child—I really mean to say that, and it is true—I did not go to see her in Goodge Street—I do not know Mrs. Jones in Goodge Street, or Mr. Jones—I know Richard Henry Jones, I have seen him once—I was down there one evening, at his house with Selina Knight, in Goodge Street, Tottenham Court Road—I don't think I went by appointment—Selina Knight went with me, because it was a friend of hers—we went out one evening from Torrington Square, I think—I did not see a child there, nor hear of one—I did not know there was a child there—Selina Knight did not go to see a child to my knowledge—I went into Mrs. Grippe's service because Selina was there—she came and told me and I got a situation in the same house.</p>

I said "Because I have seen it many times;" he said "It is not Mr. Find lay's, I bought it at a sale; "I said "It is just like it;" he said "There are many watches alike;" I said "it is too large for me, this is a gentleman's watch;" he said "You can wear that before I can get you smaller one; "nothing else was said at that time—I took the watch and chain and kept them, not until he gave me Miss Hacker's watch and chain—I had returned that one before I received Miss Haoker's, about a month before, I think; it may be more, it may be live weeks—he asked me for it—he came down in the kitchen one morning and asked me he said</p>

               <p>"Let me have that watch and chain, will you, and I will give you a smaller one; "I gave it to him, and I did not see anything of it afterwards—when he gave me Miss Hacker's watch and chain and eyeglass he came down in the kitchen and handed me a little box, and said "Here is a present for you"—I opened the box, and said "Is this for me?" he said "Yes, it is a smaller one than the first," he said "You will say you had it given to you by your uncle, the same as you said you had the first one from"—he said he had bought it—I did not know it was Miss Hacker's—he said "I bare bought this watch, but this one is rather large, you can wear that, and I may get the chance of buying a smaller one, and I will change that again; "that was all that passed that I can remember—I pawned the watch and chain, I think, in March—I remember taking the children to Hampstead when I saw Miss Hacker go to post a letter; I don't remember the day I went to Hampstead, but I think it was the Saturday after that that this conversation with the defendant took place; I know I received the watch on the Saturday; I cannot fix a date—it was before I pawned the chain that the defendant asked me for Miss Hacker's watch—I never saw that watch again after I gave it to him—he never handed me any money that he had received as the proceeds of the watch—he told me he had pawned it, I saw the ticket; he showed me a ticket, and said he had pawned the watch, and he would take it out again as soon as he could—he asked me to pawn the chain when he wanted some money—I first pawned Mrs. Bastendorffs necklet—there was some young person that had a child by Mr. Basteudorff—he gave me the necklet to pawn; he asked me if I would go and pawn it as he wanted the money—he said he wanted to pay her off, calling the girl by name, all at once, that she had had a child by him—I don't remember the girl's name now; she was a French girl; I had seen her at the house; she had been to the house; that was what took place at the time the necklet was given to me—it was about two days after the necklet was pawned that he asked me to pawn the chain, as he wanted to take the necklet out again, as his wife should not know it; he said so—I then pawned the chain—I never took it out of pawn—I gave the money to the defendant, except 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. that I bought a watch with—when he gave me the necklet to pawn he said I could buy a small watch for myself—the chain was pawned for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the necklet was pawned at Mr. Gill's, in the Hampstead Road, in the name of Barnett, I think; I did not give any other name—I pawned the chain in Drummond Street; I don't remember the name; it was near the Hampstead Road end, Thomas's, I think—I pawned it in the name of Bastendorff—the necklet was redeemed; I went and took it out myself; that was after the chain was pawned—what 1 have written at page 14 of the pamphlet about my preparing for confirma<lb></lb>tion and about the clergyman and the sermon is true; I was confirmed—I don't remember the parson's name; it was at Tothill Fields Prison—Peter told me that he and his brother were bad friends no longer; he told me that in Southwark Bridge Road when he came to me one night about half-past 12—I think it was after the second hearing at Bow Street on this charge—I have been down to Redhill with Mr. Armstrong to the place where the defendant and I bad some refreshment on the Sunday, and I recognised a woman there—when I returned to Torrington Square after being out for the first night with the defendant I found my fellow-servants flitting up, and they were very cross with me for having taken the key of the bedroom out with me.</p>

I am a domestic servant living with my friends at 18, Abbey Lane, Stratford—I am not in service there—in 1875 I was in the service of Mrs. Pearce, of 42, Torrington Square—Selina Knight and Han<lb></lb>nah Dobbs were my fellow-servants—I know the defendant; I remember him coming there one morning; I was in the dining-room, Selina Knight was in the room, and Hannah Dobbs was sitting outside the windows; the defendant was standing outside talking to her—I don't remember whether I saw him again that night—I remember Dobbs going up the area step about 7 o'clock in the evening—Knight, Dobbs, and I dressed ourselves that night to go out—I don't remember the time, but Hannah was to meet the defendant—at 11 o'clock we went and laid down and fell asleep, and the two policemen came in, and there was some coffee made and given to them—they stayed there about 20 minutes, I believe half an hour—on the following Sunday afternoon I saw the defendant downstairs in the kitchen about 3.30—I believe my mistress was out of town at that time—Knight and Dobbs were in the kitchen—I went out between 6 and 7 o'clock; I would rather say it was 7 o'clock—the defendant was there all that time—I returned at 9 30; he was not there then—I saw him again on another occasion one evening about 10 o'clock; I cannot say how long it was after<lb></lb>wards; it might be two or three nights afterwards, I believe it was; he re<lb></lb>mained about an hour on that occasion—I see that his beard is mush shorter now than it was then—I saw him at Bow Streeet on 31st October this year, and looked at him, and I believed him to be the same man that I saw in Torrington Square—I say he is the man; I say so positively.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had not seen him since the time in Torrington Square till the 31st October last—I did not know him at that time—I had not seen him before, I did not take much notice of him the first time—the first time I saw the man was when he came down into the kitchen a night or two after the window cleaning—I was in and out of the kitchen—I don't remember whether I saw him after that Sunday night or not—I saw him twice come into the house; first on the Sunday afternoon and then a night or two after the Sunday—I did not say at the police-court "I don't remember whether I saw him after that Sunday or not"—I said "A night or two afterwards he came into the house, but I don't remember whether I saw him after that or not"—my depositions was taken down, read over, and I signed it—I don't remember saying that; I might have said it, but it was a mistake—I believe it was in September when the window-cleaning was—Mr. and Mrs. Pearce and family were out of town—they did not go out of town together; Mrs. Pearce went first, and Mr. Pearce afterwards—there was only the little boy at home, the others had gone away with Mrs. Pearce—I believe so, I won't be positive—they were away with Mrs. Pearce; they were not at school then; they used to go to school; they went to school daily, not on Sundays; they were not at school that day—I left Mrs. Pearce at the end of November, 1875; Hannah Dobts left a month before me—the next time I saw her was at Bow Street; at Mr. Armstrong's office was the first time I saw her since I left Mrs.</p>

               <p>Pearce, that was before I went to Bow Street—I was ordered to go to Mr. Armstrong's office by a subpoena I had; Mr. Birley served me with it—I have seen Peter Bastendorff; I saw him at Bow Street; that was the frit time I saw him; that was after I had been to Mr. Armstrong's office, on the same morning that I came to Bow Street—I went with the other wit<lb></lb>nesses; I went there there to see Bastendorff I believe; to see whether I could identify him, to see whether he was the same man I had seen in the kitchen at Torrington Square—I had not been told that he was the man—I was told that he was the man that was in Torrington Square—I hare a pam<lb></lb>phlet; I bought it on the day that I came to Bow Street, that was after Mr. Birley had served me with a subpoena—when I went to Bow Street, I went and looked at the defendant—I don't know whether he saw me; he was quite close against me; he might have seen me—this is true: "The de<lb></lb>fendant took no notice of me when I looked at him, he could see I was looking at him. I noticed no change in his countenance when I looked"—he was allowed a seat in the Court, and I went and sat beside him—I was not there above 10 minutes—I did not notice any change in his counte<lb></lb>nance; he took no notice of me; his is rather a peculiar face; I should net want to see a man's face more than once to swear to him—I believe I could swear to the policemen if I saw them—I said at Bow Street "I don't remember the policemen, "but that was a mistake—this is accurate: "I had a good opportunity of seeing him in the kitchen; his beard is different; I noticed nothing particular about his voice"—I did not hear much of his voice then; he was a foreigner, I believe; it is true that I noticed nothing particular about his voice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> As far as I know I have never seen those policemen since—I did not hear the defendant speak at all at Bow Street—I have never heard him speak since he was in Torrington Square—I saw him on the Sunday afternoon for some hours, and after that, on another occasion, for about an hour—I was told that the man who was in custody was the man that was in Torrington Square—I don't remember where it was that I was told that—when I got in Court I said I believed him to be the man that I saw in Torrington Square—he was sitting on a seat.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. I said he had rather a peculiar face, because he had got rather small eyes—I believed him to be a foreigner when he was in Torrington Square; I was told so by my fellow-servant—I did not particularly take any notice of him—he did not have anything to say to me—he never had any conversation with me whatever.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cabinet maker, at 14, Charlton Street, Euston Road—I know the defendant; I think it might have been in 1874 that I first knew him, it might have been before; I Knew him in 1875, I am sure of that—I don't see any difference in his general appearance now; he might have his beard a little shorter—he has had a long beard—I know once he had to cut it out in the centre, what you would call a concave.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I can't remember whether his beard was cut at all in 1875—I have always known him with a fine beard, what I call a full beard; it has not always been the same as it is now—I can't say whether it was before 1875 that he had a long beard—I never put anything of that kind down or take any particular notice unless—there is anything that I should take particular notice of—I can't really say when it was that he had a longer beard—he is a friend of mine, so far, I have seen him frequently—he sometimes came to my house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wholesale cabinet maker of 30, Argyle Square—the defendant was once my partner from February to November, 1875; I think I saw him every day during that time, barring Sundays—his beard then was very much longer than it is now, it nearly covered his shirt front.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I first knew him about May or June, 1874; he then had a beard about the same length as when I was in partnership with him—he wore it long the whole time I was in partnership with him——our partnership ceased in November, 1875—I remember meeting him one night in Euston Square with Mr. Dicke some 18 months or two years after the dissolution—I don't know that it was in 1875 that his beard was cut—I should think it is more than probable that I saw him in the earlier part of 1877, but I cannot call to mind any date—I would not swear whether it was 1876 or 1877—I was about to say that I met him one evening with Mr. Dicke in the summer either of 1876 or 1877, and then I noticed that he had shortened his beard—it might have been in 1878, I could not tell.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> During the whole of 1875, when he was my partner, he certainly had a much longer beard, and I may go a little further than that—I remember meeting him at Messrs. Hewitt's, in Baker Street, in the early part of 1877, and then I noticed that he had altered his beard by cutting a little portion off the chin, and wearing what are usually called Piccadilly weepers.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I very seldom go out on a Sunday—I am at home part of the day nearly every Sunday, according to what my business duties allow me to perform; I have business duties to perform on Sunday—I was not called as a witness before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I have a particular reason for remembering this particular Sunday—I was unwell at home all that day.</p>

I do not keep a diary; as near as I can say it was about the second Sunday in October that I was at home; I won't be sure on that point—the two children would be about the house; they were not with me all the time—they were in my bedroom a portion of the time; in and out of my bedroom; that was at the top of the house—when they were not in my bedroom they would be in the dining-room downstairs—I could not specify any particular time of the day when they were downstairs; they were downstairs that day—I was not downstairs to see, but I believe they would be there as long as they were not with me—the second eldest child would go to bed probably about 7 o'clock, and the other probably a little later; I do not remember on that particular occasion—I really can't say what was the usual time; I should think about 8 o'clock; I can't say for certain—I was very seldom in the habit of going down into the kitchen—I did not go down on that Sunday.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, of 63, New Nichol Street—on 24th August, I was in Short Street, and heard a woman beating a baby—I went into the prisoner's room and found her beating a baby about sixteen months old—I remoustrated with her, and she hit me with a frying-pan—we had a struggle and the frying-pan fell on the bed—I struck the prisoner with my fist, and she took a bottle from the shelf and <hi rend="italic">heaved</hi> it at me; it burnt my arm and my dress—I don't know whether the cork was out; it was broken all to pieces—this is my dress—I have two scars on my arm where the bottle struck me—if the prisoner had not been in drink it would not have occurred—my niece Jane Hurst came in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had seen the prisoner about before, but I never spoke to her—I was never in her room before—I live quite close to her—I did not catch hold of her; I asked her not to beat the child—she said that she should do as she liked, and she would hit me—she did so with the frying<lb></lb>pan, and I bit her back in the face—we had a regular struggle, and while it was going on she reached the bottle and threw it—I have heard since that she is a bottle cleaner and uses vitriol.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my aunt—I heard a quarrel, went in at the prisoner's door from the street, and saw her with a bottle in her hand which she <hi rend="italic">heaved</hi> at my aunt—I then saw that her jacket was wet and all going into holes—the bottle did not break when it struck my aunt, but it fell on the floor and broke—I could not see whether there was any cork in it—I saw that her dress was wet—she was not touching the prisoner when the bottle was thrown.</p>

I took the prisoner and went back to the room and found the bottle, the top part was on the floor and the bottom near the window—the prisoner said "I wish to God it had been spirits of salts, I would have blinded you, you b----cow; wait till the morning and I will stick a knife in you"—she had been drinking; I did not call her drunk—I showed the bottle to the prisoner, and she said "Yes, that is the bottle, it contained vitriol; I use it for washing bottles"—I produce the prosecutrix's clothes—I saw them wet and saw a scar on her arm.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I made a note of those words while she was being charged—she was not drunk; she was very much, excited at first, but she got calmer before she used those words—people cannot walk when they are drunk.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The Prisoner's Statement before the Magistrate</hi>: "She beat me in the pas<lb></lb>sage, and I ran indoors. She ran after me. I took up the bottle and threw it at her. How I came to do it I don't know, but I suppose it was the first thing that came to hand. I did not know it was the vitriol bottle till I saw it at the station. I did not hit her with the frying-pan."</p>

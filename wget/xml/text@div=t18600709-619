                  </hi>. I am a widow, residing at 41, Fitzroy-square—on Monday, 18th June, I was in the City, and about half-past 11 I got into an omnibus at the Mansion-house to return to Regent-circus—it was quite empty when I got in—I seated myself at the upper end on the left hand side—I had occasion to take out my purse in Leadenhall-street; that might be about 5 minutes before I got into the omnibus, but not more—the prisoner was the next person that got in—she seated herself close by me. on the same seat—I had a paper that I was reading—a young man afterwards got into the omnibus; he seated himself close by the door—nothing occurred in the course of the journey which attracted my attention—the omnibus stopped first in Newgate-street, very near Newgate market—the prisoner got out—I immediately thought of my purse, looked for it and found it was gone—it had been in this side pocket—I got out of the omnibus as soon as I could get it stopped, and went along Wood-street in the direction I thought the prisoner had taken—I did not find her there—I returned, and in returning along Newgate market I saw her—I ran towards her—she immediately disappeared—when I came to the corner where I saw her go from, I inquired of a butcher which way she went, and he directed me—I next saw the prisoner in Fleet-lane, leading out of the Old Bailey, in custody—I said, "You have robbed me"—she said, <hi rend="italic">"No"</hi>, I have not; what had you</p>

               <p>in your purse?"—I said, "3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.," only meaning the gold, not the small change—she said, "I have a great deal more than that in my purse"—she took out her purse and said, "Is this your purse?"—I said, "No"—she was then taken into custody—I know that the purse had three sovereigns and one half sovereign in it—the silver was a half-crown and a sixpence, and either a threepenny or fourpenny piece—I will not say there was not more, but I can remember that there were those—when I was at Guildhall I did not feel quite sure about the half-crown, but after reflection I was then sure of that also.</p>

TINDAL ATKINSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> At what part of Leadenhall-street did you take your purse out? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In an office, just opposite the India House—I had it in the usual pocket outside the dress; merely a slit in the dress—it is deep—I could not say which side of the way I walked, but I walked along Leadenhall-street towards the Mansion-house—I did not see Mr. Alderman Mechi's shop with its attractive wares; I had no time to look at shops—I did not look at the jeweller's in Corahill—I was in a great hurry—I did not even glance at Savory's—I was so intent on my business that I made the best of my way—I do not remember experiencing the least difficulty in crossing the street—there are generally several omnibuses about where I got in—the prisoner had a bonnet on—I would not speak positively as to whether she had a fall over her face, but it is very likely—I saw her face very distinctly when she got out—it was after she got out of the omnibus that I looked at her—I do not know whether she had a fall on; but I believe that she had not one down—I do not know which it was that I had, a threepenny or fourpenny piece—I do not remember where I took the small piece of silver—I could not give the slightest inclination as to which it was—I had a doubt about the half-crown—since I have had time to reflect I have come to the conclusion that I had a half-crown—I did not count my money in Leadenhall-street—I looked at my purse there—I had it in my hand in an office; not in the street itself.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>, 255). I stopped the prisoner in Fleet-lane—she was running away as fast as she could, and a crowd of people after her—I brought her part of the way back, met the prosecutrix, and asked her what she had lost—she said that the prisoner had stolen her purse—the prisoner said, "Is this your purse?" she said, "No"—the prisoner asked how much her's had got in it—the lady said, "3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—the prisoner replied, "Oh! there is a great deal more than that in my purse"—at the station-house the prisoner had got the purse in her hand—she was taking some silver out from the gold and putting it in another part of the purse—I took the purse from her, and asked her what she was changing the place of the money for—in the purse were three sovereigns, a half-sovereign, a half-crown, five sixpences, and a threepenny piece, and 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper in her pocket—three rings were on her finger.</p>

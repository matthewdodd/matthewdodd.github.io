As the men pass by me, I rub them down; the prisoner fell shy of me I was going to proceed to rub him down, he passed me a few yards; I called him back to me, I laid hold of his collar and put him on one side until I had finished the rest of the men; when I had done that, I said to the prisoner what makes you so shy of me. from my experience I think you are a thief; he made me no answer, I searched him particularly close. I felt something in his breeches, I took him into the Elders accompting house, to search him, I searched him; I found seven cakes of Indigo in his breeches. I was told they weighed one pound fourteen ounces, I know he was at work on the premises, on what floor I cannot say; I knew the Indigo belonged to the East India company, when I saw it.</p>

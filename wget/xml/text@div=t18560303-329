               <p>Hine, and Thompson, and Jones were not on board—it was part of their duty to take the watch from the time I turned in till morning—I thick they all had their watch in that interval—when I was called, I found the life boat gone, and the two buoys—the life boat had been secured on the deck—the captain came on board about 7 o'clock the next morning—I communicated to him the absconding of those five persons, and that the boat and life buoys were gone—when I had made these disclosures to him he went to his cabin—he unlocked the door with the key which he took out of his pocket—I went in the moment afterwards and saw the ship's papers, and other papers, lying about the floor—some were torn, and some not—the writing desk was broken open at the lock and hinges, the chests were broken open in different ways, and every thing in the cabin wag broken open; and the cabin window was open.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Seeing that the captain unlocked the cabin with his own key, and the window was open, in what way did those who entered get in? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> By the window from a boat—the captain complained that he had been robbed—he first said of all the money he had—he said he had lost money, sovereigns and half sovereigns, and a diamond ring—I went and examined his desk with him—I found a paper stating the money—I found another bag which had money in it, and a paper which describes the money in that bag—the captain went on shore immediately to Pondicherry—two or three days afterwards I was with him, when he made a complaint to the principals—I did not accompany the captain to Madras—I did not go on shore at Madras after I had been at Pondicherry—the Veasel proceeded on her Homeward-bound voyage in five or six days, or eight days—we came round the Cape—before we came round, when we were about eighteen miles from Madagascar, the captain died, and I assumed the command of the ship—I have continued it ever since—the names of the owners of the <hi rend="italic">Berkshire</hi> are Toulman, Livingstone, and Co.—there was an official log kept on board the <hi rend="italic">Berkshire</hi>, as well as the ordinary one—the official log was made up on the day of this loss of the captain—the captain made it—it bears his signature, mine, and the second mate's—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "25th August, master came on board 6 A.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

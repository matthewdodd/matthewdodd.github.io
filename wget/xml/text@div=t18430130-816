                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week that you were to receive from him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was deficient 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. one week, and he was to pay it at 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, but he only paid one 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I forgave him that—the first item of 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the washhand-stand was on the 19th of Nov., and there is no entry of that—there are entries of other sales subsequent to that in this book, in his own writing—I did not know of that stand being sold till after the first examination—this book, in which it was his duty to enter every sale—on Saturday, the 3rd of Dec., I was there all that day—I took it away myself late that night, and brought it again myself from my other shop in the London-road early on the Monday morning—it remained there all that day, and Tuesday, but on Tuesday he was not there till late—on Monday, I sent him to Mr. Harding's about some prices—he came back with them very late, close upon twelve</p>

               <p>o'clock, and said he had been drinking with Mr. Harding's men—I saw no more of him that night, and the following morning I found my shop closed at eleven o'clock; when he came that day, he got out of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> two or three yards below the shop, just round the corner, he then remained at the shop half an hour—I told him to go home, and go to bed, as he was not fit for business—he came on Wednesday, remained all day, and in consequence of something I discovered, I spoke to him that evening—I first asked him about the glass—I looked in the book, and found there was no entry of it—I then spoke to him about it—he begged my pardon, and said he had spent some money, and lost the rest—he did not say anything about the carpet and rug, and it did not strike me at that time—I then looked in the book, and found they were not entered, and then on Thursday I spoke to him about them—he gave me the same answer, and he was 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in money deficient that he had not accounted for—he was given into custody on the Thursday, and taken before the Magistrate the same day, and remanded for close upon a fort<lb></lb>night—the Magistrate ordered him to be detained in Horsemonger-lane—I do not recollect that on two occasions the Magistrate said the Grand Jury were sitting—my attorney attended the examination.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable M</hi> 167.) I took the prisoner on the 8th of Dec.—Mr. Judd told him what it was for—he said he was very orry, and wished Mr. Judd to look over it, and come to some sort of terms—he said he hoped I would persuade Mr. Judd to be merciful to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you take a book from him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—he said he was very sorry he had spent Mr. Judd's money in a drunken frolic—he did not say how much it was—he had this book in his hand—he and Mr. Judd were together some time, and had some conversation about accounts—they were talking about some former balances, and the prisoner said, "I thought you would have taken this as you have the other"—Mr. Judd said he would do no such thing—they went to their books, and were some few minutes going through them—I did not see that Mr. Judd had his book in his hand—he had some papers.</p>

                  </hi>. I am attorney for this prosecution. I attended at the prisoner's first examination—he was remanded from Thursday till the following Saturday week to give me time to inquire—he attended then, and was remanded till the 7th of Jan. to give me further time—before the 7th of Jan. a Session was holden here—I came and preferred this bill by desire of Mr. Cottingham—I applied that the depositions should be taken, and the Magistrate said he saw no difficulty in the matter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you tell him for what you wanted time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I supposed there were further cases—I do not think I had one of the witnesses there at first—I did not enter into the several charges—I did not know of the washhand-stand then—it was on the Thursday evening—I rather think the looking-glass was the only charge that was then made—I think the others came out afterwards—I went again on the Saturday week following, and then the Magistrate did not take any depositions—the prisoner complained that I had not gone before the Grand Jury, and the Magistrate said, "I gave time to find cases"—the prisoner said the Magistrate had remanded him to give me an opportunity to go before the Grand Jury—on that occasion no depositions were taken—the Magistrate did not tell me that the Grand Jury would sit on the 5th of Jan.—he said he would remand the prisoner till the 7th of Jan. to give me an opportunity to go before the Grand Jury.</p>

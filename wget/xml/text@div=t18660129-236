                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-inspector, R</hi>). On 7th January, I went, about 12 o'clock, to the prisoner's house, the Beresford Arms beers hop, in Beresford-street, Woolwich—I heard some hammering, went up stairs, and saw a carpenter mending the floor—I had some conversation with him, and in consequence of what he said, I sent down stairs for the landlord—he came up, and I said to him, "How do you account for having this wood?"—there was one plank which the carpenter bad nailed down to the floor, and he was endeavouring to make it fit with the use of his chisel—there was another plank in the room, about six feet long, covered with sand, similar to what is used in the sewer works outside his house—I said, "It is evident that this wood has come from the sewer works"—he made no reply—I sent a constable for the foreman, who was just outside, and at the same time I directed a search to be made of the lower part of the house to see if any more wood could be discovered—I am not quite certain whether the fore-man went into the cellar, but he saw a quantity of other wood brought out—I also went to the entrance of the cellar, while two of the workmen belonging to Messrs. Hill and Co. the contractors, brought out altogether twelve planks besides the two which I had seen up stairs; some of them an inch and a half thick, and from five to six feet long, just like scaffold boards—I then charged the prisoner with having stolen them—he did not say a</p>

               <p>word, but trembled a good deal—I took him to the station, and locked him up—when the charge was read over to him he made no answer—after he had been locked up about an hour, the reserve man came to me, and said that Tyler would like to speak to me—I went to him, and he said, "Can you take bail for me?"—I said, "No; I can't; you are charged with felony"—he said, "I did not steal the wood; it was given to me by a man on the works"—I said, "By whom; was it the night watchman? I know they keep a man on there in the night"—he made no answer—I do not know that anything was said after that.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Who is there here to-day besides yourself, and Hart, and Lewis, as a witness in this matter? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Margetson—he was called for at the examination before the Magistrate, but was not present—Thomas is the name of the reserve man who told me that Tyler wished to speak to me after he was locked up—he is not here—there was no other officer present at our interview, but there might have been other prisoners in the adjoining cell—there is nobody present to-day to corroborate my statement as to what took place between myself and the prisoner when he was locked up in the cell—I have given a perfectly accurate account of what occurred—I have no memorandum of it, except a few words not necessary—I believe I stated before the Magistrate all that occurred between me and this man—I think I told the Magistrate that the prisoner commenced the conversation by saying, "Can you take bail for me?" and that I replied, "No, it is a felony"—I told the Magistrate that the prisoner then said, "I did not steal the wood"—(<hi rend="italic">The deposition being referred to did not contain any such conversation</hi>)—I also said that the prisoner stated to me that the wood had been given to him by a man on the works—the prisoner made no answer, as far as I could understand, when I asked him if it was the night watchman—I think I mentioned to the Magistrate with regard to that, that the prisoner muttered something which I did not understand, because he had a cold—whether that was written down or not by the clerk, I do not know—I think I told the Magistrate that in reply to my question whether it was the night watch-man—the prisoner said he did not know; or did not know the name, or something of that sort—I believe those are the very words I used—I did not know the object for which the prisoner wanted to see me, and, therefore, I did not think of providing a witness—what he said was perfectly voluntarily.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter—I was mending the floor of one of the rooms in the Beresford Arms when the policeman came up and saw me—I was mending it with a piece of wood which I got from the prisoner, who also brought up another piece with which I began working—he did not tell me how he got the wood.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">LEWIS</hi>. I live at St. James'-place, Plumstead, and am time-keeper for Messrs. Hill and Co. contractors for. the works at Woolwich—I saw the planks in the Woolwich police-court, and considered in my own mind that they were the property of my employers—the wood now produced is very similar to the timber we use for shoring—both of these pieces have been used, apparently, for what we call runners for the sewers—there were some stacks of timber opposite the prisoner's house.</p>

               <p>showed me a piece about five feet long—a piece of nine inch deal which they showed me, I said had not been used for shoring up—I do not recollect saying, "We have similar wood to this at the works, but I cannot be sure that any of these planks are the property of my employers—yes, I did say so—none of the wood is branded—the planks we generally use in the works are twelve feet long—those which were shown to me, as having been found in the prisoner's house, were only six feet long—they would be too short for our purposes, but they might have been cut in half after they were stolen.</p>

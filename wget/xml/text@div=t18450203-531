                  </hi>. I am constable of the East and West India Docks. On the afternoon of the 14th of Jan. I saw the prisoner coming from the West India South Dock, and going out—he had a pair of trowsers con<lb></lb>cealed under his frock, under his arm, and a bag in his hat—I asked him if he had anything in his hat—he told men no—I told him to take it off and I found this bag in it—I asked him what ship he had been on board of—he said he could not tell me—he said some person must have put the bag into his hat, and that one of the boys gave him the trowsers to make some patches to mend old trowsers—I desired him to show me the ship he had been on board, and he showed me the <hi rend="italic">Royal Sovereign</hi>, in the West India South Dock—I went on board—the mate said the prisoner had been em<lb></lb>ployed in that ship—I showed him these trowsers, and he identified them as belonging to <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi> Rollins—Rollins said that they were his, and had been in his chest—he is not here, nor the mate.</p>

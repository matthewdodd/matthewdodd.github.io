                  </hi>. I live in Ransby-conrt, Broadway, Ludgate-hill, and am a stone-mason. On the evening of the 8th of Feb. I was in Paternoster<lb></lb>row, and saw the prisoner there—as I was passing along sbe forcibly laid hold of me—I got from her, and proceeded down London-house-yard, to go to St. Paul's Churchyard—she followed me, and about half-way down the yard she again laid hold of me—I got from her—she got before me, detained me a minute or two, and I felt her hand leave my left-side trowsers pocket—I felt my pocket immediately after, and my purse, containing a sovereign and a half<lb></lb>soveign, was gone—immediately I felt her hand leave my pocket she drew it underneath her clothes—I charged her with taking my money—she said she had not—I laid hold of both her hands—she got one hand loose, to show me that the money was not in her pocket—I then took hold of both her hands again, and asked her to give me the money up—she said she had not got it—a man and woman then came up who seemed in concert with her, and pushed against me—the man wanted to quarrel with me—I called for a policeman, who came up—I gave her in charge—I held her hands all the time, so that she had no communication with the other parties—I looked on the</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, M</hi> 336). On the morning of 19tb Aug., about a quarter to 1 o'clock, I was on duty in the Southwark-road, and heard a strange noise and quarrelling—I went and desired the prisoner and his woman who were there to go away quietly, and not make such a noise in the street—the woman said they would make as much noise as they liked—I said she must not, she must go along quietly, or I should take her to the station—the prisoner, who was ahead, came back and said, "I will soon give you something"—he ran away, and fetched an instrument, which looked in the dark like a poker, and struck me on the head with it; here is the mark—I fell on the ground, and he struck me several times while I was down—I prevented the blows as well as I could with my staff—the female only abused me—as he was coming along with the poker, she got before him and tried to prevent him—I kept hitting at his legs—I saw three or four people making towards me—he saw them and ran away—I got up imme<lb></lb>diately, and followed him—I was within a few yards of him when be entered</p>

               <p>the door, which is about twenty yards off—he went in and shut the door; the woman went in also—I sprang my rattle—another constable came—we both sprang our rattles, to get more assistance—sergeant Golding came up, and I tapped at the door and shutter, and asked them to open it, but got no answer—a constable gave the door a push, and it opened; the latch seemed to fly back—he went in, and I followed—he caught the prisoner by the collar, and I by the left arm—I found his hand groping about my chest; it was dark—I could see nothing—he cut my coat through with a razor, made a strike at my hand, and cut my fingers—I called out to the others to look out, as he had got a knife, or something, and had cut my fingers—I immediately struck him on the head with my staff—I was bleeding profusely from my head and hand—I became faint from loss of blood, and left the house, and waited outside till the prisoner was brought out, when I was assisted to the station, and the surgeon dressed my bead and band.</p>

On Tuesday, 19th Aug., I was on duty in Southwark-bridge-road, and in consequence of information I received I went to Norfolk-street—I saw Coggins standing in the street, near a house, bleeding from the head—in consequence of what he told me I pushed the door open—it was fastened very lightly—I pushed against it with my band, and the door flew open—it was shut—I do not think there was any fastening—I did not see any damage done to the door when I pushed it open—I went into the front-room, which is a barber's shop, and saw the prisoner standing with an iron in his hand—I took him by the collar, and told him he must come with me to the station—Coggins followed close behind me, and took him by the collar on the other side—the prisoner resisted at first, until</p>

               <p>we got him out of doors, then he did not—I believe he struck Coggins with a razor—Coggins said he had cut his finger off—I cannot say whether Cog<lb></lb>gins then struck the prisoner; I did not see him; there was a light—I turned my lamp on when I went in—he did not strike him when my lamp was on—when he cried out, my lamp was out—I did not hear Coggins strike any blow—I struck at him, but I cannot say whether I hit him in the head or not—some other constables came up, and among us we took the prisoner to the station—a surgeon was sent for, who dressed Coggins's wounds.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon.

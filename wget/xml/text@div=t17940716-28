             got away; he forced the watch out of my hand; I was obliged to let him have the watch, and he brought the gentleman, and the watch, and Murphy, to his own house; I follows, when I went into the house I saw the watch delivered on the table to the gentleman; the gentleman said, that is not my watch, mine was a gold watch, and I will not take that. I insisted then that all should come to the watch-house, to the constable of the night, where the watch was delivered again on the table to the gentleman, and he denied that it was his, he said that his was a gold watch.</p>

On the 10th of February, about eleven, the prisoner came into the shop, and desired to look at some shawls; I stood a little distance from her; the porter reached them out; I came up just as he had reached them out; she asked the price of three or four different patterns of shawls; she asked me to cut her half a one; I told her we never did cut any; she then asked for a quarter of a yard of brown Holland, that lay on the other side of the shop; I turned round to come to the other counter, to shew her the brown Holland; as I turned round, she was crossing; about the middle of the shop I perceived something dropping from under her cloak; I could not tell what it was; I suspected she had stolen some shawls; I desired another person to shew her the brown Holland; and I went and examined the shawls I had shewn her; I missed some;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179102160023"></xptr>I cannot say how many; I told Mr. Cooper I suspected her; she had bought a quarter of a yard of brown Holland, and was going out; I laid hold of her by the arm, and desired her to walk with me into the other shop; I told her she had got some shawls; and upon taking her cloak aside, there were three shawls; I gave them to Mr. Cooper, and he gave them to the constable.</p>
               <p>Where was the porter? - He might be standing behind a minute or so; but I think if he had been behind when she crossed the shop, he would have seen her take them.</p>

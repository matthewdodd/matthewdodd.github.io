               <p>Beckles Booth. I was standing under the piazzas on the southside of the Royal Exchange, 31st of March, to hear the proclamation of war. I thought I felt something twitching at my pocket. I felt in my pocket, and my handkerchief was gone. The Prisoner was standing within half a yard of me, with his hand in his breast, and endeavouring to get into the crowd. Seeing him in that suspicious manner, I seized him by the hand with my handkerchief in his hand. Upon which I pulled him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174404040015"></xptr> along, and carried him cross the Exchange. The mob desired me to commit him to their management; which I did not care to do. I carried him to the Amsterdam coffee house, with my handkerchief in his hand, but could not readily get a Constable; but on Monday he was committed - The Prisoner said he found the handkerchief on the ground.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I went to see war proclaimed, and found the handkerchief upon the stones. I held it up, and called out two or three times whose it was; and kept it in my hand three or four minutes, but no body owned it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Booth. This is all false.</p>

            . The Prisoner is my apprentice - I follow the profession of making leather clogs. I gave the Prisoner leave to see was proclaimed. He has served me faithfully, justly, and honestly; and behaved well in my house. I go to bed about nine o'clock, and always see my apprentices to bed first. Please to ask Mr. Booth, if he did not desire the Alderman to commit him to Bridewel.</p>
               <p>Booth. I did desire he might be committed to Bridewel for correction, but the Alderman did not think it proper.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you find the Prisoner's hand in your pocket?</p>
               <p>Booth. No.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was the handkerchief dirty when you took it from him?</p>
               <p>Booth. It was in the same condition as it was when I lost it. <rs id="t17440404-26-verdict152" type="verdictDescription">

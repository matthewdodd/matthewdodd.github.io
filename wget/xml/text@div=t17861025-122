               <p>Can you say of your own knowledge, that the prisoner is the woman that cut you in the face? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Why how can you tell, she was behind you? - I know she was the woman that cut me; I saw the woman, but I did not see any thing in her hand; I am sure she was the woman that cut me; the young man run after her directly, and brought her back, and I searched her, and found the handkerchief down her bosom; I have two more handkerchiefs here, that came off the same piece; they were new; they were were the first time of putting on.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The gentlemen never mentioned any thing at the Justice's about being cut; what did I cut him with? - I cannot tell, but I mentioned it before Justice Walker.</p>
               <p>When you took the prisoner, was she sober? - She did not appear to be drunk.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The young man gave me the handkerchief to go with him; I will be upon my solemn oath, that I never was out of Mr. Russell's company.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On Tuesday the 25th of October, I was in Berwick-street, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, and saw both the prisoners in company, close by the pawnbroker's—they turned up a turning—I saw Williams give Clark something—she crossed the road, and he went down the other side of the way—Clark went into Green's shop—Williams stood right opposite the shop windows, on the other side of the way—she came out and walked about thirty yards, Williams followed her—he whistled, she looked back, and then he crossed over and joined her—I saw her give him something and both walked together to Brewer-street—I there met Chapman, another constable, and pointed them out—they separated again, and Clark went into Mrs. John's shop—Williams walked on ten or a dozen yards, and could not see what passed in the shop—when Clark came out she jointed him—they went towards Regent-street, and separated again—I then secured Clark—I heard something rattle in her month, in the Haymarket, and took a shilling from it, and she gave me two more—she said a man in a smock frock gave them to her, and begged me to let her go—Williams had a smock frock on—when I got to the station-house I found him there—I took Clark to Mrs. John and inquired what she went there for—she recognised the woman, and pointed out one of the three shillings as the one she had offered her for the sugar.</p>

                  </hi>. Stone pointed my attention to the prisoners in Brewer-street—I followed, and saw them separate apposite John's shop—I saw Clark go in there—after she came out they jointed—went down Sherrard-street, towards Regent-street, to the bank of the County Fire Office—I there saw Williams give Clark something, and then they separated—I took Williams into custody in Tichbourne-street, about twenty yards from the Fire Office—I had seen Clark go into the sugar-shop—he was about twenty yards from the shop, and could see her come out, but could not she what she was doing inside—she jointed him when she came out—I found two good sixpences in one of Williams's pockets, and sixpence and fivepence in halfpence, and an egg in his other pocket—I received a coun<lb></lb>terfeit shilling from Mrs. Green.</p>

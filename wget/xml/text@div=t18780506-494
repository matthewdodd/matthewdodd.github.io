I am a mariner, and now live at the Sailors' Home—I have a second mate's certificate—I was paid off at Marseilles and came through Paris to London—on 1st May I met the prisoner in the Minories in the evening—I remained with him some time and drank with him—we started for the Haymarket but stopped to have another drink—about 11.45 p.m. we were in a public-house—I then had my watch and chain, which are worth 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the prisoner asked me to put the watch in my trousers pocket—I did so, and then took it out and put it in my</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective</hi>). I followed the prosecutor and prisoner from Aldgate Street to the Minories—they went into the Fountain public-house—I waited outside about two minutes—the pri<lb></lb>soner came running out—I chased him to Vine Street, Minories—I said "What are you running for?"—he said he was only having a lark with a friend of his—I saw a watch and chain in his right hand—I took him back to the public-house and asked the prosecutor, "Have you lost a watch and chain?"—he said "Yes, and you have the man that stole it from my waistcoat pocket"—with great violence I succeeded in getting this watch, which the prosecutor identified—the prosecutor had been drinking but he could take care of himself—I have been in the force seven years—the prisoner gave me a wrong address.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. It is about 40 yards from the Fountain to Tine Street—I should do it in about a minute—the prosecutor was looking for his watch when I went in—four or five people were there.</p>

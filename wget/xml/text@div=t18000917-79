            ; upon my going into the shop, I asked Tarratt who was with him; to the best of my belief, he said nobody; I said I was sure he had accomplices, and I would detain him; he denied it; and afterwards, he said, if I would let him go, he would fetch the hat; I asked him who was his father, and he told me; I sent for his father; he told his father that Spikes was with him, and that he had the hat; the father went out, and brought Spikes with him into the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing at all to encourage them to say what they had done with the hat? - A. I did not; Spikes said he had given the hat to one Slack; Slack was sent for, and acknowledged that he received the hat from Spikes, and said that he had left it at Willis's; I went with Spikes and Tarratt to Marylebone watch-house, and when I returned home, Slack came back with the hat; the officer has had the hat ever since; to the best of my knowledge, it is my hat; I had finished it but half an hour before I went out.</p>
               <p>HENRY LOVITT sworn. - I am an officer: Slack, and the hat, were delivered into my custody at Mr. Fallon's house; I received this hat (producing it) from Tarratt's father.</p>
               <p>Fallon. To the best of my belief and knowledge, this is my hat; there is F marked in the inside; it is the manufacturer's mark; I missed the hat.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of that hat? - A.Ten shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that what you would charge to a customer for it? - A. It is worth more than that to a customer.</p>
               <p>Tarratt. The prosecutor promised, if we would bring forward the hat, he would forgive us.</p>
               <p>Fallon. To the best of my recollection, I did not, I believe; Mrs. Fallon said they should be forgiven.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time was that? - A. Before the hat was brought back; it was after Tarratt acknowledged that the hat was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that after he had said who had taken it? - A. I cannot charge my memory with that.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoners at the bar? - A. Yes, except the woman; I do not know much of her: I went with Tarratt and Spikes, on the 16th of July, to Mr. Fallon's; I went to St. Giles's to see for them; I heard that they were there; I found them coming out of a house in Dyot-Street; then we went to a house in Warwick-Street, to have a pot of beer; and then to Mr. Fallon's; Tarratt said, let us go into this shop; I went to buy a hat.</p>
               <p>Q.Had nothing else been said about going into the shop? - A. No; then we all went in; Tarratt asked for a hat; he looked at two or three hats; I staid a quarter of an hour there; I came out first, I thought they were all coming out, and then Spikes came out with a hat in his hand; Spikes gave it to me, and told me to take it to Mrs. Willis's, in Bird-Street, and leave it till he called for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you enquire whether he had bought the hat, and paid for it? - A. No, I did not ask any questions at all; I gave Mrs.

               <p>Q. Did you know her before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor the shop? - A. No; Spikes directed me to it; it is an old iron shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she ask you any questions about it? - A. No; I left it, and went home directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that you knew of no intention they had in going into this shop? - A. No; Tarratt said he wanted to buy a hat.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. (Counsel for Willis.)</p>
               <p>Q. You did not think he had stole this hat? - A. I did not see him take it.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you accused of stealing any thing with him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of you afterwards? - A. My father was sent for, and he took me to Mr. Fallon's shop, and from there I went to Mrs. Willis's, and asked for the hat that I had left, and Mr. Willis gave it me directly.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see the husband when you left it? - A. No.</p>

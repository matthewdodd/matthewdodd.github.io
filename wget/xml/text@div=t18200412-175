            . I live at Twickenham. On the 9th of February, I was going by some stables belonging to Messrs. La Costes', about two o'clock in the daytime, and heard some one say,</p>
               <p>"All is right." At that instant Mullard came out of the stable door, (I do not know of their being Messrs, La Costes') - Mullard opened it to come out; Tidey was at the door too, walking about. I saw Mullard with something in his apron, which upon my looking, I saw to be about a peck of oats. I knew him before; he is in the hardware line - he was going towards his own stables In passing by I looked down, and then saw the oats. I ran towards the King's Head, and was informed that Messrs. La Costes were the owners, and they knew of it. On the 26th, as I accompanied Mr. La Coste to the Magistrate, Tidey was going at the same time, I heard him acknowledge to Mr. La Coste, his stealing the corn, and selling it to Mullard.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. They were both close to the stable when,</p>
               <p>"All right" was uttered. Tidy was about three yards from the stable when it was said.</p>

Mullard said it was a very bad job, and acknowledged that he had been guilty. This he said was the first person he had ever wronged, but he had done this several times. The corn was kept in a sack, sufficient for the supply of the day, which was taken every morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. HONE. Q. What quantity of oats was daily sent to the stable - A. They ought to have taken about a bushel. I cannot tell what he did take.</p>

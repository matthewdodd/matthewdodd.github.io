About a fortnight before 14th September, on a Thursday or Friday, the prisoners came to the Belgrave tavern, Ebury-street, about 3 o'clock in the afternoon—Williams asked for a pint of porter—I gave it to him; he tendered me a florin—I tried it with my teeth, and told him it was bad—he snatched it from me—Hastings said to Williams, "I did not wish you to pay for this beer," and gave me some coppers; they then left—on Saturday, 4th September, they came again—Williams asked me for half-a-quartern of gin—I recognised them as the same men—Williams offered me a florin—I took it up and told him it was bad, bent it with my teeth, and told him he had been there a fortnight previous, and tendered a similar one—he said, "I have not been before"—it was soft metal—I gave it to my master—Mr. Anderson, who came back with me, sent for a policeman, and gave them in charge.</p>

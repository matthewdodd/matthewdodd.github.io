The prisoner's father watches meat there; between one and two in the morning of the 27th of July, the prisoner's father came and knocked at my door, in Stone-cutter street, and informed me that my slaughter house was broke open, and a sheep taken out. I went to the slaughter house, and then I heard that the constable had stopt the prisoner.</p>

            . I am a constable. I had been my round; the prisoner came by me with something upon his back; I asked him what he had got; he said he did not know; he had picked it up at the top of Field-lane; I caught him fast by the coat; he broke away, and attempted to make his escape; but I seized him again, and took him to the watch-house. The bag contained two hind quarters of mutton and a knife; he said he was carrying it to his father.</p>

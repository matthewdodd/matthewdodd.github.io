               <p>a certificate—[<hi rend="italic">This was dated Bristol</hi>, 4<hi rend="italic">th December</hi>, 1865, <hi rend="italic">from J. K.

The transfer was from Henry Ansted to Edward King, Esq. requesting him to transfer</hi> 100 <hi rend="italic">shares to John Hutchings, and an acceptance from John Hutchings to take the same; witnessed by J. K. Thomas</hi>]—I then referred to the transfer from Clift to the prisoner—this is in prisoner's writing—I have seen him write—my suspicious then fell on the prisoner—I believe the other transfers to be in his writing—I know his writing very well—the form of transfer was by the same printer, but the name had been cut off—the two transfers looked as if they had both been cut by one knife—the genuine and forged transfers were both cut—the name on the forms, was, "Tregaskis, printer, Redruth"—I communicated with the police—I received this letter from the prisoner in June—it is written by him—the water-mark on the paper is "Pierre and Sons, 1862," and it is black<lb></lb>edged—at one of the meetings, the list of the shareholders was placed on the table, and was afterwards missed—it contains the names and addresses of all the shareholders, with the number of their shares—this is the list; it contains the name of Wethered, 100 shares—this letter signed "H. Ansted," I believe to be in the prisoner's writing—the paper on which it is written, is impressed Rock and Co.—the call upon the shares was made at the last meeting, when the prisoner took the chair.</p>

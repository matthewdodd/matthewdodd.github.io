            . I am shopman to Mr. Taylor. On the 7th of February, the prisoner came to my master's shop, about half-past eight o'clock in the evening - I was busy serving some customers; when I had served them, they were going out, and I saw the prisoner going out with them. Mr. Taylor's two sons were in the shop as well as myself, one of them was serving the customers with me, the other was gone out for change; when the prisoner was in the shop, he did not offer to buy any thing-about a minute after he went out, Mr. Wyatt brought him into the shop, and called me as a witness. I saw him take a pair of shoes from under the prisoner's coat; they were my master's. I did not suspect the prisoner, when he was in the shop. I did not see him look at them. My master's sons were busily employed.</p>


               <p>Prisoner. Q. Were not Mr. Taylor's sons in the shop - A. I cannot exactly say, they might have been there part of the time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not ask you the price of the shoes - A. I do not recollect.</p>

            . On the 7th of February, about eight o'clock, I saw the prisoner looking into Mr. Taylor's window, I was in my shop which is opposite, he waited there about half an hour; I suspected and watched him. Two persons went into the shop to purchase some goods, and in two or three minutes I saw the prisoner go in; I still watched him. After some time the persons came out, and the prisoner came out before them. I did not see him take any thing in the shop. When he got out I thought he had something under his coat. I called him, and asked him to go into the shop with me, and told him, that I thought he had got something that did not belong to him. I took the prisoner into the shop, and took a pair of shoes from under his great coat. King claimed them as his master's property. I gave them to Chadwell.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM CHADWELL. I am a constable of the night. The prisoner and shoes were delivered to me.</p>

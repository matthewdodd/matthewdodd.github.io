                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective</hi>). On 9th November, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I was in Cheapside and saw both the prisoners together—there was a great crowd at the corner of Lawrence Lane, and I saw Owen put his right arm round a gentleman's waist, and with his left hand take this breast<lb></lb>pin from his scarf; Jones was shoving the gentleman behind—I immediately seized Owen by the collar, and saw him with the pin in his left hand—I was just going to get it from him, but he dropped it on the pavement, and Green, another officer who was with me, picked it up—I took Owen to the station, and Green took Jones—Owen wanted to be let go—he refused his name and address—the gentleman went with us to the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the office of the Albert Orphan Asylum, Cheapside—I was in Cheapside about four on this after<lb></lb>noon, going from the next house to the corner of Lawrence Lane—there was a crowd; I felt considerable hustling round me, and saw a hand grasp</p>

               <p>my pin; I immediately felt my scarf and found that the pin was gone—this is it—I cannot identify either of the prisoners.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Jones's Defence</hi>. The first time I ever saw Owen in my life was when I saw him standing in Cheapside, apparently reaching down to pick his cap from the floor. I stopped to look, and one of the policemen said, "Here is his companion." He was no companion of mine, I never saw him in my life. On going to the station I asked him whether he saw me speak to the other prisoner, and he said, "No." When we got to the station they said, "Of course, I suppose, you did see the prisoner speak to him?" and then he said, "Oh! yes, I saw them in company." I said, "What do you mean by telling such a falsehood? Not two minutes ago you said you didn't see us speak; I asked you that question just now, and what did you mean by saying 'Yes?'" He said, "Well, I do not exactly know, I didn't rightly understand you." I said, "I asked you distinctly about it." I said, "It's all very fine; didn't understand me."</p>

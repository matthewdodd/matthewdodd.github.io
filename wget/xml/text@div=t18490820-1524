                  </hi>. I am managing clerk to Mr. Meyrick, who was the London agent of the firm of James and Smythies, attornies, at Aylesbury. I attended to the conduct of a suit of Miles <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Miles in the Court of Chancery—Mr. Smythies, the defendant, was the attorney for the plaintiffs in that suit—Mr. James, his partner, did not interfere in the management of that suit in the slightest—in Oct. last year the plaintiff's solicitor was changed—this is the order of the Court for the change, it is dated 10th Oct. 1848 (<hi rend="italic">this was produced by James Fluker, managing clerk to Mr. Kirk, who was the attorney substituted for Mr. Smythies</hi>)—<hi rend="italic">after</hi> the change of attornies took place, a bill of costs was prepared by Mr. Smythies and carried into the Master's office—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is made out to Mr. Richard Soden, as debtor to Henry Smythies—the amount is 355<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and is signed Henry Smythies—it is the handwriting of Mr. Smythies—an action was brought against Mr. Soden for the recovery of that bill of costs—this is the <hi rend="italic">nisi prius</hi> record in that action (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—a bill of particulars is annexed—the writ was issued on Friday, 16th Feb. 1849—the plea was, "Never indebted"—an order was afterwards made for taxing the bill—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—in pursuance of that order an appointment was made before Mr. Baines, the taxing Master on 3d April: the bill of costs was then laid before the Master—Mr. Fluker, (Mr. Kirk's managing clerk), Frederick Miles, myself, and Mr. Smythies attended, and another assistant clerk of Mr. Kirk's, at the Master's chambers in Staple-inn—there is a charge in the bill of costs for taking the retainer of Mr. Soden in writing—there are no dates to the items—this date of 29th May, 1847, in the margin, is Mr. Smythies's writing—the item is, "attending you when you consented to become next friend, and taking your consent in writing, 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—when the Master's attention was drawn to that item, the retainer was handed to the Master, that was in consequence of the Master's asking when that consent was given, because on that consent Mr. Soden would only become liable from the date of that consent—Mr. Smythies pro<lb></lb>duced the retainer to the Master—the date was fixed as 29th May, 1847, by Mr. Smythies, and in consequence of that the item of journey to town to consult with Counsel, three guineas, and rail and expenses one guinea, was taken off by the Master, as being antecedent to the retainer—the Master, in my presence, marked the retainer as a document produced before him—these are his initials on it, and the date," 3d April, 1849"—Mr. Smythies did not give any account of it when he produced it, that I recollect, he merely handed it in—some observation was made by the Master as to the proof of the retainer being a question in the cause, and not to be decided by him there at chambers—Mr. Fluker had an opportunity of seeing the retainer; either I or the Master handed it immediately to him—Mr. Fluker handed it to Frederick</p>

               <p>Miles, and they both read it, and the assistant clerk also—at that time I was not at all aware whether there had been a written retainer or not—a letter of Mr. Soden's was also produced to the Master by Mr. Smythies—I do not know the date of it—on the back of the retainer there is endorsed "Richard Soden's consent to be next friend," in Mr. Smythies's writing—the body of the retainer is in his writing—the action stood for trial in the Exchequer on Thursday, 26th April—the record was withdrawn on that day—I attended a consultation of counsel with Mr. Smythies, and it was after that that the record was withdrawn—the papers in the suit and action were taken from Mr. Meyrick's office on Monday morning, 7th May, about ten o'clock, by Mr. Smythies—the retainer was among those papers—Mr. James afterwards came to our office, I think on the same day, he was then told of the removal of the papers—the letter that was produced to the Master by Mr. Smythies was, I believe, dated 12th May, 1847.</p>

From our first acquaintance, I placed myself entirely in your hands with the greatest confi<lb></lb>dence; there was nothing I concealed from you; even any private letters were opened by you at my request. The business and its connections, which I avoided representing even at 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, turned out to be double that amount; and as the returns came in slowly, I allowed you to take your share whilst I spent the money which I had earned elsewhere, and which I ought, in justice to myself, to have invested. Everything in the shape of money was under your control, almost exclusively; in fact, I treated you more like a brother than a stranger; and how have you repaid this confidence? After</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184908200027"></xptr>
               <p>involving me and two of the oldest friends the office has, in the meshes of that infernal Chancery suit, you, in order to secure the costs, substituted a retainer in your handwriting for the original, which you had lost. Now, was this honest between you and the client, or proper conduct towards me? I will not, Smythies, in memory of what has passed between us during the last two years, characterise such conduct in the terms it deserves. Your own character you may value as you please, and part with it how you please: but whilst you were connected with me you, had no right to compromise it; and thus reflect upon mine. For myself, I value honour more than life. In God's name what have I done, that I and my sisters should be recklessly rained, without my having an opportunity of averting the disaster? For even when you found that the plot had miscarried, and that you had fallen into your own snare, you deceived me, and the true state of the case was carefully concealed from me. But although I could write pages on the sub<lb></lb>ject, it is more than I can bear. But I cannot conclude without saying that the trust and confidence which I placed in you, relying upon you as a man of prudence and honour, is lost, irretrievably lost. The course I shall pursue will depend upon the advice my friends may give me; but I do not see that there can be two opinions on the subject. The only difficulty I feel is, in having to make so humiliating a statement to any man. I shall leave for town by the ten o'clock train from Aylesbury to-morrow; and remain yours, &amp;c., J. <hi rend="smallCaps">JAMES</hi>.—"The two oldest friends alluded to there were Mr. Henry Hay ward, who was to be receiver, and Mr. Neale, steward to Lord Carrington, who was one of the sureties—Lord Carrington is a client of mine, he is the lord-lieutenant of the county—at the time I wrote this letter I did not know that Mr. Soden had denied giving any retainer at all—by the expression," the true state of the case was carefully concealed from me, "I meant, that when he found it was necessary to withdraw the record, to prevent the expo<lb></lb>sure of the document being a false one, that he had told me an untruth about Mr. Hill and Mr. Fluker, I meant to express that—I received from him a lettter which crossed mine of the same date—this is it, it is his writing—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"Aylesbury, 5th May, 1849—My dear James, I think it due to you and myself to say that I agree in your remarks respecting the retainer, and have felt ashamed of the act ever since it occurred. I might, by stating the circumstances out of which it occurred, extenuate the act; but it was cer<lb></lb>tainly wrong, and ought not to have been done. It is very difficult not to do wrong sometimes, particularly under great provocation. I feel the more upon the subject, because, as partner, you are somewhat compromised by what I do. I will however be more careful for the future, and trust you will never again have occasion to be dissatisfied with me. Very truly yours, <hi rend="smallCaps">HENRY SMY<lb></lb>THIES</hi>.—"I received this other letter from him, and I suppose it was in answer to mine of 5th May—(read)—"Aylesbury, Sunday evening, 6th May—Dear James, I have just received your letter of this morning, which I must say was not wholly unexpected. I have long perceived that you were discontented, and I anticipated your taking this opportunity of expressing your feelings. It is not my wish to deny that, in some respects, your beha<lb></lb>viour towards me has been kind and gratifying, particularly with regard to pecuniary affairs. You remind me that you left me the entire control of the business, but you omit to state that you avoided every occasion of advising with me, and that when I have fallen into unforeseen error, you reproached me without mercy and without consideration. When you state that you valued the business at not more than 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, that was the average of the business during your father's time; and if during my time the business</p>

               <p>has doubled, surely you are in some measure indebted to my care and atten<lb></lb>tion for it, and must admit that I have ever acted with the strictest integrity and not abused the confidence you placed in me. I have always considered and so consider, that your charges against me relative to the suit of Miles <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Miles, are most unjust and ungenerous. Neither you nor your two friends have been injured in the slightest degree, nor are you likely to be so. You imagine evil, and then upbraid me as the author. You speak of the revela<lb></lb>tions made during an interview yesterday, but you were informed of every<lb></lb>thing by my brother three days since. You came into the office, knowing the whole facts, and you talked upon indifferent subjects. You left the office, returned, and again talked upon indifferent subjects, and this whilst you were meditating your attack. At length you entered upon the subject, proving by your questions that you were fully informed upon every point, and then gave vent to your indignation in terms of unsparing severity. How am I to understand this? I wrote a letter yesterday, addressed to you in town, so totally at variance with the spirit of yours, that I am under the necessity of recalling it, and shall expect it to be returned to me unopened. I shall also go to London to-morrow to have this matter fully investigated. I shall expect you at Furnival's Inn, at half-past twelve.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had there been, that you are aware of, any discontent exhibited by you towards Mr. Smythies previous to this letter? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, there had—I com<lb></lb>plained of his commencing the suit and altogether, and his conduct with reference to the articled clerk—I had not received any premium from him when we entered into partnership—I had been led to suppose that this was a copy—in May last I received a communication on the subject from Mr. Soden, through Ezra Miles—it was on the afternoon of the day upon which I gave Mr. Smythies notice of dissolution, on 15th May—before that I had no knowledge or suspicion that there had not existed an original retainer—in consequence of what I learnt from Ezra Miles, I went down to Aylesbury to seize the papers—I took a Mr. Aubertin with me—I broke open Mr. Smythies' desk, and removed every paper of every description almost in the office—I found this retainer in his desk, and also these seven letters—five of them were tied up together with a piece of green tape, and the other two were in the corner of the drawer—in the retainer the signature "Richard" has the small "d" after "Rich," and also in the five letters, but not in the two—in con<lb></lb>sequence of my breaking open the desk, I appeared before a Magistrate—I was not taken into custody, a warrant was issued—I came down to Aylesbury, and the officer came, and Mr. Huddleston insisted on his taking me into custody, and thereupon I walked to the Magistrate—the Magistrate at once dismissed the charge—I received this letter, dated 12th May, from Mr. Smythies on 13th—it was sent to me—a draft of it was found in the drawer—(<hi rend="italic">letter read</hi>—"Aylesbury, 12th May, 1849. Dear James,—I confess myself at a loss to understand the principle upon which you are acting towards me." <hi rend="italic">The following passage here occurred in the draft, but was omitted in the letter: "</hi> I know it is not in your nature to act unjustly to anybody, and I cannot think you would mark me out for a different course of treatment.") "I sus<lb></lb>pect you are not acquainted with the facts, I will therefore state them. Doubtless you recollect telling me to sue all the Miles' party for our costs, and that if we got only sufficient to pay agents' costs, it would be better to get clear of the matter. I proceeded to do so, and, upon looking up the evidence, I discovered that I had mislaid the retainer. Fully expecting to find it, and the wording of it being fresh in my memory, I re-wrote <hi rend="italic">it, and</hi>

               <p>laid the duplicate, together with the other papers, before my brother, to advise upon evidence—upon the taxation Kirk's clerk asked to see the retainer. I might have refused to show it him, for he had no right to see it; but as I had no cause for concealment, having the duplicate among the papers, I gave it to him, making no remark; he copied it, and returned it to me. Having failed to find the original, the document was left out of the brief, upon which my brother told me of the omission, and I said it was omitted purposely, I having lost the original. The circumstance was mentioned at the consulta<lb></lb>tion, but Mr. Hill being called into Court, the consultation was adjourned. Afterwards, and after I saw you, my brother advised me to withdraw the Record. I thought we could do without the retainer, as we had other evidence, but nevertheless took his advice, and after making terms with the defendant, and getting a positive assurance from him that the suit should be continued, and the costs paid out of the first moneys realized, I withdrew the Record. You charge me with having concealed from you the fact of my having lost the retainer. Call to mind the remarks. you had made to me when you only suspected me of trifling, and ask yourself what I had to expect if I informed you of so careless an act as losing a retainer; and can you be surprised at my not telling you? Having no papers in the suit in the office when I took the retainer, I no doubt put it somewhere by itself, and so it was mislaid. You wish me to dissolve the partnership; be it so, I consent to sell out, and leave Aylesbury altogether. You may say that having come in for nothing, I ought not to expect to sell. I reply, when you took me into partnership, you could not get any desirable person not only to purchase, but to take it at a gift. I have heard I was the last of sixty applicants; perhaps there is nothing to sell now; if so, I leave the business as I found it; but if there is anything to sell, it must be through me that it is so; and as you will not be prejudiced, you ought not to object to my reaping the full benefit of my own exertions; nor would you, I think, wish to send me into the world without giving me the chance of providing a fund to establish myself elsewhere. Of course I shall not sell to any one objectionable to yourself. I have not yet received my recalled letter.</p>

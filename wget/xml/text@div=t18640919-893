                  </hi>. I carry on business as agent and valuer at 4, Great Carter-lane—I bad the front office vacant—in April, a man named Montagna, appa<lb></lb>rently a foreigner, applied to me, and ultimately took it—it was arranged that the first month's rent, 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>, should be paid in advance—he took pos<lb></lb>session, and there was a Frenchman with him—about a fortnight afterwards I saw the prisoner Davis there, and he continued there from that time till Ibis charge was made—I did not see Cooper till six weeks ago—Montagna continued till the middle of July—the other foreigner left shortly after Davis came—the name of Montagna and Co. was painted upon the door—the second month's rent was ultimately paid—Davis was there before the third month became due—there appeared to be a difficulty in paying it, and it was arranged with Davis that it should be included in an account for which he gave me an acceptance—I got no money on account of that bill—I subsequently distrained twice; the last time was in August, when we seized a basket of new pewter-pots as they were delivered—the prisoners were both there then, and Davis informed us that it was by pledging goods that he obtained the money to pay out the first distraint—he said that it was by pawning a quantity of brooches and other things which we had sold him—he said that he expected Dawson and Co. would execute the order for him, as they were a pliable firm, and he should then be able to give me security for my debt—I saw no bona fide business carried on there—goods came in and went away again the same day, often in the evening—I never observed or heard of their making any sale of goods, and I have had frequent communications with them—the offices were opposite each other, on the side of the passage—if people came on business I should have seen them—I have seen people who had supplied goods come to make inquiries, and I have over<lb></lb>heard squabbles and difficulties about not getting payment for accounts—that was a very frequent occurrence lately—I seized some of the account-books for rent, and handed them to the officer Hann—Cooper was introduced by Davis, as a gentleman who was going to join Mr. Montagna as a partner.</p>

               <p>French—I saw a waste-book and ledger there—it was a furnished office—I am a draper's agent—I am not out a great deal—he did not give me a reference about the rent; he did mention the name of a house at the West-end—the first month was paid in advance, but the second we had to make a great many applications for, and they went into the second week of the second month—I have not got the acceptance here; it was for 37<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. being the rent, and the rest drapery goods and fancy jewellery, which we had supplied to Montagna before he left—the first parcel of that came to 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and Montagna paid half of it; that was for drapery goods—he had only been there a few days then—the other 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was included in the bill; it had to run, I think, two months—they also had blankets and coun<lb></lb>terpanes from me, but 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was all the money I received—the pewter-pots were not samples; there were three dozen of them, and they were the second lot that had been obtained from one house—there were also two straw hats, which were not worth selling—I have sold the pewter-pots.</p>

                  </hi>. I am traveller to Carlton Brothers, straw hat manufacturers, of 10, Gutter-lane—on 25th July, Cooper came and pre<lb></lb>sented this card, "G. Montagna and Co. importers of foreign fancy merchant<lb></lb>dize, 4, Great Carter-lane, St. Paul's"—he said that he came from that firm, and wanted to see samples of a certain description of straw hats—I said that we had a pattern of the goods in stock, bat not all—he said that the firm bad a shipping order for those goods—I said that I would select a few samples, and send them down to his place or go down myself in an hour—it I was then pretty near 3 o'clock—he said, "Unless the goods are sent down before 3 it will be little use, as our buyer, Mr. Davis, leaves then"—I made up twelve hats and twelve bonnets, and sent them by a porter—they were worth about 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I followed him, and saw both Davis and Cooper—Davis was looking at the patterns when I went in, and I said, "I have come down about those patterns"—he said, "Yes, the gentleman who is our client has left; you are a little too late; we shall see him to morrow morning, and then will send up the order with the patterns," but we did not receive either—I went to the office, and saw Davis—he said he was very sorry to trouble me, but his client bad gone to the Crystal Palace with Mr. Montagna, and would not be at business that day, but it would be all right; he would see his client, and very likely he would bring him, and the result would be that he would very likely buy a good parcel from us—I did net like being put off twice, and rather pressed him, but in quite a business-like way he said that since we pressed him he would try and see the gentleman that evening, and would come up with the money that evening—he did not do so—I con<lb></lb>tinued to go there till the 5th, and generally saw each of the prisoners—I again asked them for the samples—they promised faithfully to send them the next day, and on the 5th the order came for five different patterns of hate and bonnets, to the value of 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and also an order for further samples of goods, which were the most expensive we could produce—Cooper came with that order, and I referred him to the counting-house—next day I called at the office and saw both the defendants—I said that we had received the order for goods, which we had not in stock, but if he gave us the order we would apply to our agents and get them from abroad—Davis said he be<lb></lb>lieved there was no hurry, and we might take time—I told him our terms were a reference or cash; "cash" means on the receipt of the invoice—he said that he quite understood that, and their terms were cash; they paid cash for all the goods they bought, and when the goods were delivered he should be prepared to pay cash for them—I agreed to those terms—this was a shipping order—I said that it was necessary, before we could proceed with the order, to have the patterns back—Davis said that they had been sent into the country to his client—after this I went frequently for the patterns—I brought away a portion of them, seven, I think, but never got the rest—I did not execute the order, because I never got the patterns back—once when I asked Davis for the samples, he said that probably his client might keep two or three of them—nothing was said before we left them about their</p>

               <p>being sent back, because we never leave them, and Davis said that they should be returned the following morning with the order—about 18th August, I went to the office, and saw both the prisoners—I said that I was very dissatisfied with the way they made excuses, and I told Davis that one excuse was directly contrary to the other, and I was quite satisfied that it was an attempt to swindle us out of our patterns, and unless he was pre<lb></lb>pared to pay for the goods, or return them by a certain hour, I should very likely give him in custody—subsequently to that, an I O U was handed to me, and I went with it to the office—it was signed Chas. Davis—is it not here—I received it, in our office, from one of the partners—I showed it to Davis, and said, "This I O U is of no use, and I believe you are the principal party interested"—he received it back, crumpled it in his hand, and said, "You have no further use for this then"—I believe this to be it (<hi rend="italic">an I O U for</hi> 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="italic">signed "Chas.

I said, "Yes," and offered to show him some—after he had seen them I asked him where he came from—he gave me a card, and said that a customer wanted the clocks at once—I said that if he bought any clocks he must pay cash for them, as we did not know him—he said, "Oh yes, they will be all right, I have no doubt"—he said he wanted them for a customer, who wanted them as samples—he did not say how many be wanted, but he ultimately selected six—he said that if I liked to pack up the largest one he would help me to carry it round, which he and I did, and afterwards I took the rest—there was a brooch and a scarf-pin on the counter, and he said that he should like the brooch for himself, and his customer would want a gross of them—we took the clocks to 4, Carter-lane, and there saw Davis, who said that it was too good a clock, he wanted cheaper ones, about 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I then fetched the three smaller ones and a cheaper one—I did not take the shades—Davis said they looked much better with the shades, and told me to fetch them, which I did—he said that he expected the customer every minute, and that I was to make haste—I said that I should come and fetch them away in the evening with a truck, but instead of going that evening I went next morning—I saw Davis, and gave him this note (<hi rend="italic">This was from Mr. Jacobs, requesting to have the clocks back</hi>)—Davis read it, and I brought away two of the clocks, but never got back the other three—he pressed me to let them stay for the customer, who would not want the dearer ones—I took the scarf-pin and samples of jewellery on the first occasion to the value of 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Another letter was here put in, from Edmund Jacobs to Montagna and Co., dated August</hi> 4<hi rend="italic">th, stating that unless the goods were paid for or returned by</hi> 12 <hi rend="italic">o'clock next day, steps would be taken to obtain them.</hi>)</p>

I am salesman to Mr. Collins, manufacturer of artificial flowers, at 19, Gresham-street West—on 4th August I went to 4, Great Carter-lane, by his direction, and took twelve crinoline skirts as samples—I saw Davis, and I believe Cooper—I told Davis I had brought the sample skirts—he requested me to leave them for a couple of hours, as the parties who wished to see them were not in then, and would I call again for them in two hours—I left the goods; they were worth 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I re<lb></lb>turned in two hours, saw Davis, and asked him if the skirts were ready—he said that the gentleman had seen them, but had not decided, and would I leave them till next morning—I objected at first, but afterwards consented—I did not go the next morning, but on the Saturday morning—I saw both the prisoners—Davis said that the skirts had been sent back the day before—I said that we had not sent for them; he turned round to Cooper and said, "You sent them back, Cooper?"—Cooper said, "Yes; I gave them to a man dressed as a porter, who said he came from your house"—I asked whether he brought any order—he said, "No"—I said, "We should not send for them without an order"—Davis said that it was very foolish of Cooper to give them up without an order, and that of course we should look to them for the amount—I said that we should—he said, "Possibly they were given to Foster Porter's porter—I believe they deal in the same articles"—he said that they had had some goods from them, and very likely they had been delivered in mistake to them—Cooper came to our premises the same morning, and brought two orders for skirts; twelve dozen alto<lb></lb>gether—here are eight dozen on this order; the other order was returned because it was not accepted, as it was wanted to be returned by bearer, he wanted to take the four dozen back with him—this is the order (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)</p>

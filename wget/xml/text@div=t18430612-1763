               <p>of May, I was stationed at Tottenham, and had occasion to go to the Wagon and Horses inn about twelve o'clock—I saw seven or eight men coming out of the house, very disorderly and riotous—the prisoner, also Champkin, and Coleman, were among them—I ordered them away—they would not go away—I said it was after twelve o'clock—they were kicking up a disturbance, and using bad language—I said, "Come, you chaps, you must go off home; I cannot have you making a disturbance here"—they said they would not go, and used bad lan<lb></lb>guage—Champkin said he would not go, and used bad language—hes said, "Who the b----h—are you? you might be some one"—I was in my uniform—I then ordered Coleman on, and he then used bad language—he still remained there—all three of them, the whole of them remained—I then told Dolton to go—he said, in a sneering way, to the others, "Why the b----h—don't you, chaps, go home?"—there were seven or eight of them—they I had come out of the Castle—he then turned himself round, as if he was going to walk away, stepped a pace or two back, put his hand into his pocket, and drew something out, struck me on the top of my head, and knocked me sense<lb></lb>less—here is my hat—it struck through my hat before it touched my head—there were no holes in my hat previously—there are two now—Elizabeth Coleman caught me when I fell—I do not recollect receiving more than one blow, I became insensible from the first blow, but I must have received three on my head after that—when I came to my senses I found my head cut, and my face all covered with blood—I had this handkerchief in my hat at the time, and it was all over blood, which came from my head—the hat was also stained with blood inside—I went up Tottenham, about thirty or forty yards, to the turnpike, and saw Sergeant Guy and Sinclair coming down—I have suffered very much from the blows I received—I was confined to my bed for a fortnight—I am not able now to perform duty.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Wagon and Horses-lane, Tottenham. On Saturday night, the 27th of May, I went to the top of the lane to look after my son, who I believed was there—when I got there I saw my son, Bolsover, and the prisoner—I saw the prisoner strike Bolsover—I did not see what with, only his hand—before that I heard the policeman say, "Move on, three or four different times—when he was struck he fell on me, as I stood sideways, and caught hold of me to save himself from going on the ground—he clung to me—I was alarmed and called, "Murder" three times—some<lb></lb>body came to his assistance, and I went home directly—I looked at my arm where he had laid hold of me, and found one or two spots of blood on it, and also one or two spots of blood on my gown.</p>

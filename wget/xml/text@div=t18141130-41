               <p>Q. Is there a separate entrance - A. Yes, it is like a double house, I have got two lower rooms, and two one pair rooms. I have two rooms on each side of the house; the man that lives next door to me has the two upper rooms. I let out these rooms to seamen; in one room I have got a man and his wife, there is a passage and a pair of stairs; there is separate doors to the rooms on the staircase. They do not go through one another's rooms, they all go separate. I let out three of the rooms, and one I keep for myself for my bed-room. The room that I let to a man and his wife, they find their own goods. I let that room by the week, and lodgings by the week, or by the night. Bennett lodged in one the lower rooms, and paid me weekly.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he the whole room - A. No, I had two beds in it. Two men slept in each bed. Bennet slept with another man, and paid me so much weekly.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you at any time alarmed that any of the lodgers had been robbed, - A. Yes, on the 11th of November, between seven and eight in the morning I heard one of my lodgers say to Jack, you went out at one o'clock in the morning, and left the door upon; I had let him in at two o'clock in the morning, I said let me see what you got. One of the men said, we have got a robber, I sent for an officer; I said, see what this man has got. I give charge of him to you. I took one shirt out of the prisoner's hand, and one from under his arm. I sold these shirts to Bennett when he came from sea; I am quite sure of this shirt. I had washed it for seven years.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When I came into the passage, she picked up these shirts; she said, these shirts, you rascal, were under your arm. - Mrs. Young. - A. No, the white shirt I took out of your hand, and the coloured one from under your arm.</p>

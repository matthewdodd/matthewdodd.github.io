                  </hi>. I am a grocer and cheesemonger, at Keate-street, Spital<lb></lb>fields. The prisoner was a tenant of mine, he occupied a furnished room at 15, Keate-street, which is opposite my shop—on 18th June, I went to bed about half-past 1 o'clock—I was the last person up, and my house was then safe—I came down in the morning, a little after seven—I found tobacco strewed all over my counter—I looked in my jar, and found all the tobacco gone out of it—I missed a time-piece from the mantel-piece, a watch out of the table-drawer, a silver spoon, a pair of German-silver sugar-nippers, two German-silver teaspoons, about 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of biscuits out of a show-glass in the window, about 6 lbs. of butter out of a tub, and two half-quartern loaves; also an accordian, and a coral drop—these things had all been safe the night before—the street-door was fast, and the side-door also—there had been nobody out previous to my getting up—the back-door of my cellar had been opened—it opens into a small yard where there is only room to turn yourself round—the door had been shaken, and it had shaken the bolt out of the staple—I had seen it the night before, and bolted it myself—from the cellar you go up the cellar-stairs to the shop—there is a door there which was only fastened with a button—there is a little square of glass in it—the cellar-door is on the stairs, and I have a side-door; and as you push the cellar-door it goes against the side-door—the side-door was locked, so that a person coming from the cellar would only get into the shop by getting over the cellar-door—there</p>

I went with the officer to Keate-court, where a num<lb></lb>ber of rooms are let out, and the prisoner lived in one of them—I found the prisoner lived there with his son and brother.</p>

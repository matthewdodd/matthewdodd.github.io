                  </hi>. I am a police constable in the employ of the Great Northern Railway Company, at King's-cross—on the 10th November, at about a quarter-part 6 in the morning, I was standing opposite the Post-office, St. Martin's-le-Grand, with Samuel Adams—after watching I saw the prisoner, who is in the employ of the company, come up with his waggon—he then had three horses—the leading horse was taken off and led away by a boy towards the Bull and Mouth—I then saw the prisoner get on top of the baskets of fish, and pull out one from a basket, and throw it down between the other baskets—it required some effort to get it out—after this the boy returned, and they proceeded towards Billingsgate—I went there also, and saw the baskets unloaded—I then saw the waggon on its way back—I followed it into a part of Cannon-street, when it stopped, and the boy drove from Billingsgate, and then waited until the prisoner came—the prisoner got into the van and sat down, just underneath the boy—I saw him take up the fish—it was covered over with straw, which I had pre<lb></lb>viously seen him do, at Billingsgate—previously to his taking it up, I saw him take this apron (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) and spread it open—it is his apron—he tied the fish up in it, and tied it tightly round with this rope (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I then followed them to the Bull and Mouth, where the boy got the leader horse—I then called the prisoner out of the van, and said I was an officer</p>

I was with the last witness in St. Martin's-le-Grand—whilst standing there I saw the prisoner come up—I saw the waggon stop and the leader horse taken off—I saw the prisoner try to get a fish out of the basket—he was trying it very hard; it was fastened in—I was on the opposite side; not so near as Thoroughgood—I saw the waggon on its return from Billingsgate—I did not see the fish until the last witness was in the van—I saw it taken possession of by him.</p>

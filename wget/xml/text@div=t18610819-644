                  </hi>. I live at 66, East-street, Lamb's Conduit-street, and am a civil engineer—on the morning of 11th July, about 3 o'clock, I was in Long Acre—I had drank something, but could very well have taken care of myself—I met three or four men, and they asked me some question—I took no notice of it, but I was suddenly struck—I do not know the man who got into conversation with me—I was struck in the mouth, and I think I received a trip, whether it was the kerbstone or not I do not know, but I fell—I do not know who it was struck me—when I fell one of the party took my watch out of my pocket, and broke the chain—when I got up I got hold of Gavin, who was just opposite me, and kept him—the constable then came up and asked me what I had lost—the prisoners could hear him. ask that—I cannot say whether they did—I said, "My watch"—I had not seen it at that time—he said, "I have it"—he did not show it to me—I went to the station with him and the two prisoners—I do not think I saw the watch at the station, I did the next morning—my watch chain was broken, it was not left in my pocket—the key end was broken and lost—I. got a portion again that was on the watch—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my watch—I had it safe on I think the Wednesday evening, the day before this occurred—I felt it when it was being tugged away—when I was knocked down it was not more than an instant before I jumped up—Gavin was, I should Say, not more than a yard or four feet from me when I got up.</p>

               <p>recollection a number of persons came round—I cannot say whether there were any other persons besides these men—I was struck in front—I got a blow on the mouth—it was not a severe blow at all—something tripped me at the same time—I do not say that either of the prisoners struck me; I could not know—I believe I spoke to some of these men in answer to what they said to me—I suppose I turned round and looked at them—I certainly did not see Williams—I will not swear that I saw Gavin before I took him—I would not swear that I saw either—there was a little of the chain with the watch; the rest of it is lost entirely—I think Gavin was searched by the policeman—I did not notice the searching; but they showed me a key at the station, and asked me if it was mine—it was not mine—it was a common watch key—when I arose I took hold of one of the men opposite to me—I am not able to swear that he was the man who struck me, or that I had noticed him previously.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, F</hi> 32). On Wednesday, 11th July, between 3 and 4 o'clock in the morning, I was on duty in Long Acre—about a quarter to 4 o'clock I was coming down Long Acre, and saw three or four men striking at Mr. Donnelly the prosecutor—I saw John Gavin strike him—I am sure of that—he struck him in some part of the face—I saw him strike him several blows—after that I saw the prosecutor fall—after he fell, Gavin, Williams, and two or three others stooped down over him, and I saw Williams snap something from his pocket—Williams then got up, left the others, and walked off towards me, I met him and took him in custody and took him back to the prosecutor who had then got up and had got Gavin, and told me he would give Gavin in charge for knocking him down and taking his watch and chain—I saw this gold watch in the hands of Williams, and took it from him—I am positive that I did so—I took the two to the station, and the prosecutor came along with us—I am sure that I saw the prosecutor struck by Gavin.</p>

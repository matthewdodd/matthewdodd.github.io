            . The Prisoner's aunt recommended her to me as a very good hand at washing, and I took her into my house; for I thought she had been set in scorn by her friends, on account of her having a sweetheart, and the first or second of June she lay at my house. I ordered my maid to let her have some victuals, and go to bed. I talked to her a good deal, and spoke very simpathizing to her; and I said, if she had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174807060005"></xptr> done a fault, she was not a thief, and the Prisoner went to bed with my maid.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is your maid?</p>
               <p>Murphy. She has an impediment in her speech, and cannot speak in a Court.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she take of yours?</p>
               <p>Murphy. She took my new stays, and the other things in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her do this?</p>
               <p>Murphy. No, but they were found upon her.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got them again?</p>
               <p>Murphy. No, but I hope I shall with your good order, for they are in Mr. Noakes the constable's hands.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to find it out that you was robbed?</p>
               <p>Murphy. I heard a noise very early in the morning, and called to my maid, and asked her what she did up so soon, and she said she was in bed. I enquired after the <rs id="t17480706-2-deflabel7" type="occupation">chairwoman</rs>

               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Murphy. In the <placeName id="t17480706-2-crimeloc8">Temple-Mews</placeName>

When my maid said she was gone, I said, how could you be such a bear, as to let her go? And the door was left quite open, and the things gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find these things?</p>
               <p>Murphy. At a publick-house in Broad St. Giles's, at Mr. Noakes the constable's.</p>
               <p>Honner Obrian. I lived with Mrs. Murphy at this time, and lost two gowns, and several other things.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got them again?</p>
               <p>Obrian. They are all here.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find them?</p>
               <p>Obrian. The Prisoner had my gown and stays on.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I desire to know, whether Mrs. Obrian did not lend me the things?</p>
               <p>Obrian. No; I had my gown and stays on over night. I did not lend her any thing.</p>

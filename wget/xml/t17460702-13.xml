            .) What have you to say against the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Box. On the 14th of June I had been hard at Work in the Morning, and in the Afternoon went to drink a Pot of Beer or two: When I went home I call'd my Wife three or four Times; but she being big with Child, and heavy to sleep, did not hear me, so I sat down on my own Bench at the Door and fell asleep; I can't say how long I slept, but during that Time I lost my Hat, Handkerchief, and the Shoe and Buckle from my Right Foot; but on her endeavouring to take the Buckle from my Left Foot I awak'd and caught her on the other Side of the Way, with my Shoe and Buckle in her Hand. I call'd the Watch directly, who came and carry'd her to the Watch-House, where we had not been above half an Hour before a Watchman that went out to seek for my Hat brought it in and put it upon the Shelf; about Two or Three o'Clock in the Morning they lock'd her up in the Watch-House, from whence she escap'd and took my Hat with her, and I saw no more of that or my Handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say when you laid hold of her?</p>
               <p>Box. She said, I would have you take care what you do.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the Prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Box. I may have seen her, but never had any Conver sation with her.</p>

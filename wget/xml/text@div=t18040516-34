               <p>Q. Which of you had the key of the drawer? - A. We have no key to the drawer, the drawer pulls out with a slide; the drawers are pulled out by persons who are employed on purpose.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it in the power of the prisoner to take any out without your observation? - A. It was; but then it was his duty to have given them to me, if he had, I should have put it down in my book; I am certain no such draft came to my hands.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. I understand, any other person, besides you, might have access to it? - A. Yes, before I was there.</p>

Yes, in the yard of the foreign post-office at three o'clock; I knew him by the name of Oliver; he told me to meet a gentleman on purpose to get me a situation at three o'clock, and when he came out he asked me to go to Lombard-street to get the draft exchanged of 45 l. 12 s. and 7 d.

               <p>Q. How soon afterwards did you give any information? - A.

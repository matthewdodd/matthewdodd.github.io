             was under my care - she was about two years and seven months old. I first saw the prisoner about a fortnight before Cormack died; he came to me under the Piazza, at Covent-garden, where I sell soup in the morning - I keep a fire there to keep it warm, He told me that I lost my customers by not coming earlier; I said I could not get my boys up to help me out sooner; he said he would help me any morning; I told him where I lived. Next morning he came and helped me to market - he came three mornings running; I gave him his breakfast for his trouble. On the third morning I missed a brass cock from my water-but; I did not see him again until the night before the child was burnt - he then came. I asked him what brought him back to my place the last time that he left? I told him the cock was stolen, and I thought it was him; he said he returned for his stick, and he did not know what to do with a brass cock - I told him to come no more. Next morning, about seven o'clock, he came to me in the market, and said he had got some composition coal for me; I said I never heard of such coal; he said it was what gentlemen burnt in their parlours, as it made no smoke, and was like Kilkenny coal, and that it would make up a fine fire without any smoke. I told him to put it in my basket; he emptied my charcoal, and put it in my basket - there was about a hatfull of it in one lump; he had it in a butter-flat - he behaved as usual, and I gave him a bason of soup.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the stuff like - A. It was black, it did not shine like coal, it was soft, and not heavy. I went home about ten o'clock, and took it with me. I put the fire which I brought from market into the grate;

I put the basket about half a yard from the fireplace, and put a little piece of the stuff, which I broke off, about the size of a hen's egg on the fire; the moment I laid it on, it went off with the greatest report, and flew all about the place; it caught the rest in the basket which went off immediately, caught the childrens clothes, and mine was all on fire in a moment - our clothes were all blazing.

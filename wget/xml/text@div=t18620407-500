I live at Bromley-street, Stepney, and assist my father in carrying on business as a ship-rigger—on 19th February, about 10 o'clock in the morning, as near as I can say, Gray came alone, and said he had a quantity of rope to sell, and wanted us to purchase it—I told him we had bought largely, and did not want any rope, and had also entered into contracts besides—he said the rope was made for a person that had disappointed him, and my mther then called me into his office, and, after some conversation with him, he said, "Well, there is poor old Gray; he appears to be very much broken down in life; what does he want?"—I explained what he wanted, and then told Gray that if he liked to bring the rope I would look at it—I then asked him his price—he first wanted us to go and look at it—I did not ask him where it was—I told him we would not go and look at it; that if he thought fit to bring it we would look at it and value it, and tender him a price for it; that, in consequence of his condition, we should feel inclined to buy it of him—he then told us the price was 36<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I told him we could not give any such price—I know nothing further of it but that when I returned at a quarter to I, I saw the rope there—I then saw this bill and receipt (<hi rend="italic">produced,</hi>) and saw the price which was given for it—I saw about 12cwt. of new rope and upon yarn.</p>

I live at 11, Rose-lane, Commercial-road East, and am a dealer in tar and other articles—Gray called on me in February, and said there was a ropemaker over the water who was in difficulty, and had some rope which he wanted to turn into ready money—he asked me if I knew any one who was likely to buy it—I said, "I do business for Mr. Willis; he is a ready-money gentleman; he always pays ready money, and if he wants any I dare say he will buy some of you," and then he went up to see—I spoke to the foreman before the rope came, and introduced Gray to Mr. Willie's foreman—he came again the morning that the rope came, 19th February—he walked up, and said the rope would be there about 10 or 11 o'clock, and walked up to the Stone Stairs public-house, opposite Mr. Willis's—the rope came, and Evans with it—I do not recollect who fetched Gray out; very likely it was Evans—I think I went to Willis's door and said, "Well, you can see Mr. Gray and do business, because I know nothing about rope"—I then went to the public-house, and Gray came there to me afterwards, and gave me 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.

Hinchiffe, wholesale dealer in corn flour; Kempster, Parkers-road, Dockhead;" on the badt of it is, "4, Charles-street, Dockhead, total, 163cwt. 30th November, 1861, Clapton, Lea-bridg"—I also found on him this letter. <hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "18th February.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Stokes.</hi> If I never live another moment, you said so; you told me all throughout to do it; did not you put four cwt. on two tons of goods that went to Barking? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I can produce the receipts; Mr. Hewitt weighed them; I sent the weights perfectly correct.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Stokes.</hi> He put four cwt. on two tons, and said, "Weigh every coil separate, and make a mistake in the addition, so that if it should be found out I can copy off every weight, and send it down and say it was a mistake in the adding up." <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> The weights were all correct that I sent to Mr. Hewitt; I will admit there was a mistake in the adding up—I was aware when the bill went in that it was not correctly added up—some of the coils came back; that did not lead to the bill being set right—I sent down the weight of each coil separately—I can show it on my letters—I gave the weight at the office—I did not send the original bill; but I wrote a note to Mr. Hewitt—there were about 18 lbs, over in one, and 18 lbs. under in another, so that it came equivalent, and a little in his favour—I put down the weights correctly, but did not add it up right, and then that bill went to the office—(<hi rend="italic">The witness was twice asked the question by the Court, whether he added the bill up wrong intentionally, but gave no answer.</hi>)—Stokes first of all told me that he thought it would be practicable, and I mentioned it at the office, for I had only recently come up to London—I did not know what were the rules of the trade—I was only a clerk—I will admit that I did so to that lot; but I reported it the same as I did a previous lot.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Stokes.</hi> When he found I would not put weights on, he actually told me to make no notes, and he told a lad also the same. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I told him to put no weights on any ship's notes—it is not a usual thing—it is never done in any other house in the trade—when these goods were taken away there was nothing like ten or twelve tons of rope sent away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Bassett. Q.</hi> How can you tell that the two coils found at Kemp<lb></lb>ster's were the property of the London Ropery Company? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because I recognise them as being spun at Whitby—I saw the remainder of the spun yarn of which that was part—I said at the time it was spun yarn, and at</p>

               <p>the police-station they said it was a species of rope, and I said, "Yes, it is"—spun yarn is the yarn of rope not twisted; it is always sold with rope; it is the same price, and they are sold together—I recognised it imme<lb></lb>diately.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was that wrong addition which anybody who added up the account could find out? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had seen Mr. Hewitt before, and had actually told him, speaking of the rope-making trade, that it was the practice to do so, and in February we had a conversation about it, and I leave it to you to think whether it was probable he was going to be taken in in that way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Bassett's Defence.</hi> The first lot before Christmas, belonged to a man named Wood, and never came from the Ropery Company. We were ordered to sell for him if we possibly could. The parties were entire strangers to us; we sold the rope and had the money returned to us, and we gave it to Mr. Wood. There is no proof that that rope came from the Ropery Company; it never did come from them. The rope was in Kempster's place before we knew anything at all about it; I went there to look at it, and said I would see if I could get a customer for it, and I and Stokes went down to Mr. Leary's and bargained with him, and sold it to him and returned the money to this Mr. Wood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Stokes' Defence.</hi> One day before Christmas, a stout short man, came with rather a seafaring man to the gate, and asked if Mr. Morgan would buy any rope. I said, "I do not know; trade is very slack; I don't think he will;" he said, "If he will, we have got a lot we will sell cheap;" I said, "I am almost sure he won't buy it." I promised to ask him; that was in the afternoon. In the evening after dark he came again, knocked at the door of our house, and said, "I know a party that will buy that rope; they know me very well, but I don't understand representing in the matter of rope, like you; there is a Frank Leary down town; he don't buy it himself, but his partner Vare will advance money to any extent; we want 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the lot; it is a lot all put together." I said, "I don't know anything about it;" he said, "If you, will come with us, we will pay you for the trouble; you represent yourself as the seller of it." I said I did not mind, and they took me to Mr. Vare's, and he took us to Mr. Leary. Evans did not go there with us; I dont know why. Leary appointed to meet Bassett next day. I declare that I never saw the rope; a lad drove the van and met me going down; a gentlemen called for me after breakfast and told me to go down and get the money at the public-house this side of the Surrey Canal bridge. (<hi rend="italic">Stokes here asked the witness Ward if he remembered meeting him there, and Ward replied, "Yes, I think it was you".</hi>) I met Leary and Bassett, and they took me into a public-house; 46<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was what they agreed to take. Bassett not being able to write, Leary told me to write a receipt; I said I did not understand doing so, and he told me the words and I wrote them;</p>

               <p>that is all I know about it: and as for knowing about anything going off the premises, I assure you I did not.

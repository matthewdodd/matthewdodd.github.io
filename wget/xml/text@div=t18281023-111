            . I am a Thames Police-officer. On Saturday night, on the 11th of October, about half past ten o'clock, I saw a boat alongside of a lighter - I suppose half a mile from this barge; I was coming down the river at the time - I saw a man standing on the gunwale of the lighter in a stooping position; I put my boat alongside that boat, and saw Daley in it stooping down with his face on the rope; I said to him, "What have you got here?" he said Rope, and he got on the lighter where Haggerty was standing - I had them both into my boat; I then saw two lads, who, as far as I can understand, were Barrett and Dwyer; I asked Daley how he came by the rope - he said they picked it up in the river, and were going to sell it to get some beer; I asked Haggerty if that was the case - he laughed, and spoke in Irish; I took them to the office; I then went to the lighter and found two more bundles of rope - I went to the next lighter, No. 28, and there found Barrett and Dwyer asleep; I awoke them and took them - some more rope was found on board that lighter.</p>

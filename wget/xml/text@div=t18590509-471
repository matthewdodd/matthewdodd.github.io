I am a chemist, and live in Whitechapel-road—on Saturday evening, 2d April, the prisoner came to my shop between 7 and 8 o'clock in the evening she asked for two ounces of salts—I served her—they came to three-halfpence—she paid me a half-crown—I gave two shillings and fourpence-halfpenny change—I put the half-crown in the till—I had no silver there, but the two shillings I had given her—in about</p>

I had two bad half-crowns which I had received of another female before—when the prisoner was brought out and shewn to me, I did not express any hesitation at all—the prisoner said nothing when I said, "That is the woman that passed me the bad half-crown on the 2d April."</p>

I am a dairyman, and live in Prescott-street, White-chapel—on 8th April, the prisoner came about half-past six o'clock in the evening for half a quartern loaf and a quarter of a pound of butter—they came to eightpence halfpenny—she offered me a half-crown—I said, "This is a bad one; where did you get it?"—she said, where she worked—I asked her where she worked, and she said, "Any where"—I gave her in custody, and gave the half-crown to the constable.</p>

On Sunday, the 10th of October, I was in the neighbourhood of Wardour-street, and a little after four o'clock in the afternoon I came down Berwick-street, and found a riot had commenced at the bottom of <placeName id="t18301209-138-crimeloc787">Peter-street</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. What was the riot? A. Two women were fighting, and several others seemed to have been fighting - they had been in a commotion; I only saw the two women fighting - I swear the prisoner was setting them on; he was not endeavouring to part them - he struck one of them.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, was he not endeavouring to rescue one from the other? A. Not at that time - what he might be doing after I cannot say; I did not see him attempt to take one from the other - I do not recollect whether I told the Magistrate I saw him strike one of them; she was a stout woman - I have not brought her here; I have since understood one of them was his sister - the other officer did not stay there till I was beaten; I cannot say whether the person who gave the prisoner into Mace's charge is here - I have brought nobody here; I had not seen the prisoner commit any offence, or strike any body till Mace attempted to take him - I had seen him strike one of the women when I was attempting to part them; that was a quarter of an hour before I was injured - when I came down Wardour-street Mace was there; that was the last time I went there - when I went into the crowd I saw the prisoner; he was not doing any thing then, and I did not attempt to take him - when he was given into my charge I had not seen him do any thing to the person who gave him in charge - I am not aware whether he struck Mace or not; he received a violent blow in the eye in attempting to take him - who gave it I cannot swear; I defended myself with my staff, by striking their hands - so many blows were aimed at me by the party round, I was obliged to defend myself.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. You did not offer violence to anybody till Mace and yourself were struck? A. Not the slightest.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. There had been two or three hundred people? A. Yes, the last time; I had gone away a quarter of an hour before, part of the former mob had dispersed - there was a bustle when I returned, but they were not fighting; I did not hear any shouting.</p>
               <p>Q. Then they were not rioting? A. No; I should think if we had had officers enough we might have dispersed them peaceably, and no accident have happened - I told Mace there was a great disturbance, and we both went together; when we got to the corner, opposite Martin's house, there was a mob; I went into the heart of it, among them, to see what was the matter - I was not aware who had been fighting at that time; they were moving about and raising a sort of clamour about some one - what I do not know; there were a good many voices, but not very loud or vociferous - the party, whoever he was, told Mace and me to take the prisoner in charge, and pointed him out; he did not then say what he charged him with - Mace immediately attempted to take him, and received a blow in the eye; I then sprung forward to seize the man who had given the blow - three or four struck me, and knocked me down, and then the prisoner attacked me; as I got up I saw several coming on me - I struck their hands, which were uplifted, and then the prisoner sprung forward and struck me on the head; I was defending myself then.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I was in Peter-street; there were upwards of two hundred people assembled - they had apparently been fighting; the prisoner was given into my charge by a person whose face was beat, cut, and scratched - he was all over blood; the man said he was one of those who had assaulted him - I went towards the prisoner, to take him into custody, and received a blow from him in the face with his fist, in attempting to seize him; it caused a black eye - I received a blow from another person at the same time; I saw Sim there, but after receiving the blow I fell backwards, and could not see what passed - I had no staff at that moment, but was dressed as a Policeman; I was knocked on the ground with the blow, and when I got up I saw some men carrying Sim to the doctor's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long might you have been<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183012090072"></xptr>on the ground? A. About a minute - I got up as soon as I could, and had to find my hat; I had not myself seen the prisoner offer violence to anybody.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You say a man who was bloody desired you to take the prisoner for assaulting him, you attempted to take him, and then he and another struck you? A. Yes; I did not see what passed afterwards, but a minute after I saw Sim being taken to the doctor's - the person who gave the charge went to the watch-house for protection, and I believe gave his name there, but I do not know what it was; I have seen him before - I do not know him, nor where he lives; he was at the office - there were four persons taken.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I was in Peter-street on the 10th of October, about four o'clock, and saw a man give the prisoner in charge - I had seen the prisoner beating that man; they had not been fighting, but two girls had - this man began to disperse the mob, as no Policeman was by; the prisoner came and struck the man because he tried to separate the women - the man went after a Policeman; he met Sim, and gave the prisoner in his charge - there was a great mob together, who swore he should not take him, so they knocked him down three or four different times; I saw the prisoner strike him after he was down - I saw the prisoner kneel on him, pull the staff out of his hand, and knock him down dead with it; he knocked him on the back of his head - Sim fainted; he then moved the staff a little, and somebody came and told him not to carry the staff, for it was not right - he then flung it away; he only struck Sim once with the staff - the prisoner was apprehended at the corner of Peter-street the day it happened, but made his escape; I helped the prosecutor to the doctor's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You saw the prisoner strike some man? A. I saw him strike Sim, and before that saw him strike a man - that was not in the Policeman's presence; there were too many shoving about for me to tell which hand he struck the Policeman with - I was about five yards from him; I have seen the person who gave him in charge several times - I never quarrelled with the prisoner; I was not a Policeman at that time - I had been one, and was turned out for taking a man's cape by mistake, by my serjeant's advice, as I was going on duty; I have been reinstated since - one of the women who were fighting was the prisoner's sister; I knew the other well, but am not related to her - I do not think she has any certain place to live in; I saw her last about a month ago - the prisoner was endeavouring to get his sister from the women when they were fighting.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You are asked whether the prisoner was endeavouring to part them, and get his sister away? A. As I could understand it; he was in the act of doing so - it was

               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. The prisoner I believe had gone home after the man was struck? A. I do not know, but I had not seen him for some time - I did not see him do any thing from the time he struck the man till the officer took him, but the people had continued together.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a row was it? A. Passing words to one another - the place is always noisy, and I suppose the Police did not take notice of it; it was more noisy than common - I saw nothing done during the hour and a half, but they were talking; there were more people when the prisoner was given in charge - the numbers had increased.</p>

On the 10th of October I was sitting in my parlour, and heard a terrible noise; I ran out, about five o'clock, and as soon as I got out I saw the Policeman laying down and a man standing to pull him over - I said,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183012090073"></xptr>"What, do you want to kill the man?" as soon as he saw me he ran away - I pursued; he made a hit at me with the staff - I put up my left arm, and as soon as he saw me he said, "I am very sorry Mr. Nott, I did not know it was you; I won't hit you."</p>
               <p>Q. Who was this? A. The man who hit the Policeman - I saw him take the Policeman's truncheon, and strike him - he had hold of the Policeman round the waist, wrenched the truncheon out of his hand, and hit him; the prisoner is not the man who hit the Policeman, I will swear that positively; if it was the last word I had to say the man I saw strike him was not the prisoner; I did not see the Policeman knocked down; he was down - I saw the man take the truncheon from the Policeman's hand; I took hold of him, and tried to get him away from the Policeman - he ran off, and held up the truncheon.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. What are you? A. A tripeman; there was no more disturbance than there is every Sunday - I did not see the prisoner there; I cannot swear he was not there - on my solemn oath, he is not the man who went away with the truncheon, and afterwards threw it down; the man's name is Doherty - he is the prisoner's brother; he has been a pot-boy - he is rather bigger than the prisoner, I think; I never knew he was his brother before - I had seen him many times before; I did not see him throw the truncheon down - I did not see the prisoner there; I have known him about there for the last twelve months, but never spoke to him - he is not the man who struck the Policeman - I have never been a publican; I never kept the Barley Mow - I did not attend before the Magistrate; I knew he was in custody, but did not know it was for a capital offence - I thought it was only an assault.</p>
               <p>- GIBBONS. I live in Green-court, Peter-street; my husband is a marble-mason. On the Sunday morning in question I went to tea with a friend at a green grocer's, in Peter-street - I heard a noise, and went out, between four and five o'clock; I saw the Policeman Mace trying to take the prisoner into custody - the mob hallooed out "He shan't go," and rescued him from Mace; I saw the prisoner make his escape up Berwick-street, and on that another man took a staff from the prosecutor - he was knocked down first, then the man wrenched the staff out of his hand, and gave him a blow; I am sure the prisoner was away before that; I have known his person three years - I saw him run away before Sim was struck; one of the crowd knocked Mace down - he got up again, and while he was getting up one of the mob rescued the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Q. Then he had still hold of the prisoner, and the mob rescued him? A. Yes, and I saw him run up Berwick-street - I then saw a stouter man than the prisoner, in a short jacket, strike Sim; he knocked him down, and in attempting to get up, the staff was wrenched out of his hand; the person gave him a blow on the head, and ran off - Nott followed him; the prisoner wore a dark coat with skirts -Nott followed the man in the short jacket; I solemnly swear it was not the prisoner - I did not distinctly see the man's face, but I saw his dress.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Then Nott was close to you? A. I did not say so.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw Nott following the prisoner? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You have said he followed the man who struck the blow; if you said that was the prisoner, is it a mistake? A. It was a mistake - it was a man in a round jacket.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. There was a great crowd? A. Yes, and a great noise; there were two or three hundred people - I was on the the step of the door, and above the crowd, so that I could see them; I heard them say the Policeman was killed - he laid there for dead: I heard somebody say"Kill the bl-y Police!" and I was quite shocked; I was not in the road, but standing at the door - it was not the prisoner that struck the blow.</p>

             re-examined. Q. Do you remember what dress the person had on who struck Sim? A. A kind of light coat or jacket - I cannot say whether it had skirts; I was flurried - he would have knocked me down if I had continued to pursue; I know his dress was something very light; there might be fifty people round the man when I came up.</p>

            . I live in New-street, near Peter-street. I was standing by the side of Sim at the time he was knocked down, so close, that when he fell he came against me - I saw a man strike him on the head, and knock him down with his own staff, which he pulled out of his hand; I should know the man again if I saw him - it was not the prisoner; I have seen the prisoner several times before, and knew him - I should know him from one hundred men- on my oath he did not strike the Policeman any more than I did; I saw him in New-street a few minutes before it happened - it was some minutes before the Policeman was knocked down: he stood at my door, which is but a minute's walk from the place, and I saw him afterwards.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Were you near Mrs. Gibbons? A. No - there was a great crowd, and I could not notice every body; I first saw the prisoner at my own door, a few minutes before the Policeman was struck - I came out, and stood in the street, the same as another; I often go and stand there on Sunday evenings - I saw Mrs. Gibbons in the crowd, and Nott too; I saw him cross the street - I put my hands on his shoulder, and begged him not to follow the man, or he would get knocked down; I saw the staff in the man's hand - I did notice that he threw it down; I should know him again if I saw him - I cannot say what coat he wore; I have not spoken to the prisoner since - his wife desired me to come here.</p>

            . I am a plasterer - I live in Stacey-street. I remember the affray in Peter-street; I was standing outside Martin's public-house, between four and five o'clock, about three yards from the row; I saw Mace knocked down, and then Sim, and while he was down the staff was taken from him, and as he rose he was struck on the back of the head with it - the prisoner's brother is the person who did it; I knew him before, and am quite sure of it - I knew the prisoner before, and am positive it was not him.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. How long have you been acquainted with the prisoner? A. As long as I can recollect - he is a lithographic printer; I assisted to carry the Policeman to the doctor - I did not see the man carry the staff away; I was taken up as one of the rioters - I was there about a quarter of an hour, but was not taking part in it; the man was dressed in a white short jacket.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is the prisoner less than the brother? A. No, the brother is bigger - he resembles him a little in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183012090074"></xptr>the face; his nose is rather on one side - the prisoner lived in Mead's-court, not above one hundred yards off - he left that house about a week after the row; both the brother and the mother went away.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Was not the prisoner's brother taken into custody with you? A. Yes; the prisoner was taken a good time after we came out of prison - I was taken directly I had carried the man to the doctor's, and discharged in about a week.</p>

            . I am a labourer. I and Cosgrove were coming through Berwick-street into Peter-street, and saw the prisoner at the same time coming into Peter-street - my friend and him got into a quarrel about something, and my friend gave the prisoner in charge to a Policeman; I think it was Sim; it was the one who got cut on the head; I did not see the man knocked down - the prisoner and my friend got quarrelling in the street; both called the Police - I was trying to separate them, but before I could get assistance to get them asunder the Policeman was struck - at the time the Policeman was struck, the prisoner and my friend were struggling on the ground; I could not part them; they were not out of my sight before that; when I got them apart there were four men carrying the Policeman to the doctor's.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. You are quite sure it was Cosgrove who gave him in charge? A. Yes - I did not see the Policeman knocked down.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. To whom was he given in charge? A. To that man (Sim) to the best of my belief.</p>
               <p>Q. Why, I thought he was not out of your sight till that man was taken to the doctor's? A. My friend gave the prisoner in charge, and I think it was to that man; I do not know what became of the prisoner afterwards.</p>

            . I am a seafaring man, and live in Peter-street - I was standing at my own door, six doors from where Sim was knocked down; I saw a mob gathering, ran towards it, and when I got to the corner of the street, I saw the Policeman knocked down with his staff; I was six or eight yards off, and knew the young man who struck him very well by sight - it was not the prisoner on my oath.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Did you see the prisoner given in charge? A. I did not see him at all - I was there about five minutes; I do not know why the Policeman was knocked down - I only saw him knocked down once; I have been from sea about three months - my mother maintains me; I did not know the prisoner was in custody till this morning.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What was the first you saw? A. A parcel of people collected, as I stood at my door, and when I got up, the first thing I saw was the Policeman knocked down with a staff.</p>

They hustled me into a house there, there was nobody in the house. There were about four women together. One took me by the collar, struck me in the eye, and scratched my face, and the other two laid hold of my lame side - the prisoner took me by the shoulder with one hand, and with the other laid hold of my breeches, and said "Let us serve him out," using a very bad expression. They then all set on me, and in a few minutes got my money - some of it dropped on the floor; they began to scramble and pick it up - my pocket was torn in the scuffle. The prisoner was the last that I saw snatch at my pocket. I saw one of my crown-pieces, and some shillings and sixpences, on the floor. I had about 3 l., in my pocket consisting of one sovereign, two crowns, and the rest half-crowns, shillings, and sixpences. As soon as they got the money, they all ran out of doors immediately. In about ten minutes the prisoner returned to the house, and seeing me there began to pity me; she wanted to wipe my face, with her apron, but I refused to let her, and said she had done too much already; she then went away, smiling, and I saw her no more, till she was taken, the same night. I stated the case to my brother-in-law, we got an officer at Worship-street, and took him to the house, we found nobody there then; while he was making enquiry, two or three women came in and the prisoner with them, and I gave her in charge. I will swear she is the woman. I had only drank a pint of beer and a glass of peppermint. I received the money at the Dock-yard, that morning.</p>

            . I am the brother-in-law of the last witness. On the 28th of July he came to me, and shewed me the house - in a few minutes the prisoner and another came in - he said "That is the one who seized me by the side." She denied having been there that day, and said she had been out at work, for fourpence, to get her shift out of pawn. Gregory, an officer, asked her where she had been to work. She said next door, just round the corner. He said he would go and see, he returned and took her. She said she only came in after the robbery to wipe his face.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 14th of June, did you lose any thing from your shop. - A. The prisoner worked in the house. On the 13th of June, the prisoner brought a pair of shoes down to me that he had made; I was serving some customers at the time; and some more came in, I got him to serve them, and after he had served them, I perceived something in his pocket; another person came in, and while I was serving that person, he went up stairs into the workshop, where he and two others were working; he came down stairs almost immediately, that pocket appeared to be empty. While he was having his supper, I went into the workshop (he was the only lodger that was in the house then); I found five pair of shoes up the chimney. I let him alone till the 14th, which was Sunday; I watched him till about seven o'clock in the evening, I heard him come up stairs, and he went down almost immediately; he came up again and was some little time in the room, and he went down; instantly as he was gone I followed him; he went out of the door; a person that is here stopped him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he the shoes with him then. - A. Yes, they were tied up in a bundle; we examined the bundle and found the shoes. These were the shoes that were in the chimney piece; I looked there before I followed him. They are worth twenty-five shillings. The prisoner is a single man, and bore an honest character.</p>

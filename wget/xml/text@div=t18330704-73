               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). I was going along Fleet-street, in the direction to St. Katherine's Docks, with the intention of endeavouring to get myself a vessel; as I was proceeding along, I saw a handkerchief laying on the pavement, I looked round, and seeing no one to own it, I picked it up, and put it in my jacket pocket; I had not had it above two minutes before a gentleman came up and laid hold of me; he took it out of my pocket, and said it was his; he then gave me into the custody of a policeman, when I said that I had picked it up, not knowing to whom it belonged.</p>

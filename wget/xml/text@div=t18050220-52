             sworn. - On the 18th of last month, about two o'clock in the day, I went into <placeName id="t18050220-52-crimeloc317">the Rum Puncheon, in Old-street</placeName>

               <p>Q. Whose property were they? - A. The property of <rs id="t18050220-52-viclabel318" type="occupation">Captain</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18050220-52-victim529 t18050220-52-viclabel318"></join> Lovell, the captain gave them me to take home; when I entered the public-house there was a comrade of mine there drinking with the prisoner; he asked me if I would join in the company, which I did, and we drank to the amount of a shilling and a halfpenny in gin and beer; I laid my head on the table, and I believe I went to sleep; in the course of that time my bundle was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your comrade there then? - A. No, he was gone, and the prisoner too; I inquired about the bundle, but I could not hear any thing about it at the alehouse. I went to the landlord, and from what he said to me I searched for the prisoner, and found him the next evening; he denied seeing any thing of the bundle; by persuasions I brought him up to the same public-house; he denied every thing; the constable took him into custody that evening, and the next morning at eleven o'clock he confessed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever get your things again? - A. The boot-tops and the spencer I got by the prisoner's directions; I found the spencer at Isaac's shop, near St. Giles's; the prisoner told me he flung the sword-belts away, and the boot-tops I found at a porter's that lives at a bottle warehouse.</p>
               <p>- ISAACS sworn. - Q. Look at the prisoner - did you ever see him before? - A. No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you purchase that spencer of any body? - A. I bought it of a man for a shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. What man? - A. I could not take any notice of the man, I had a country-dealer in my house.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times did this man come to your shop? - A. Twice; he asked me three shillings, and I bid him a shilling; I locked my door, and went up stairs, as I had a country-dealer there.</p>
               <p>Q. Although this man came twice, you took no notice of him? - A. I was in a hurry, I had a country-dealer, I was obliged to have my goods packed up for him immediately; I had no person in the house but myself, my wife was out.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the spencer? - A. The officer has got it.</p>

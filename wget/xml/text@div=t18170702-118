On the 31st of May, I was serving in my shop; I went into the parlour to get change, and found the prisoner's hand in my drawers, taking out the money. I asked her what she was doing? she said, "Nothing." She was a friend who called to see me. I found some 3s. pieces in her hand; my drawers were locked. I saw her put the money down her bosom. I am sure I missed seven 3s. pieces - They dropped from her bosom.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. I cannot say what money I lost-there was a great deal of money there. The prisoner lent me 15l.; that was paid again.</p>
               <p>ELIZA RUFFY. On the 31st of May, I was in Mrs. Dyer's shop. Mrs. Dyer went into the back parlour, she then said the prisoner had opened her drawers with a false key. The prisoner said the money was her own. She laid some keys on the table, which unlocked the drawers.</p>
               <p>JOSHUA ARMSTRONG. I am an officer. I was sent for, and took the prisoner in charge. The prisoner said the keys belonged to her drawers at home. I tried the keys; they unlocked both her drawers and the prosecutor's.</p>

On the 23rd of December, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, I was behind the counter; the prisoner came in, and asked for some ribbon which she had left a little while before - she asked for some flowers, bought one, and paid for it; I saw her take this piece of ribbon out of the drawer, put it on the counter, and cover it with her pocket - handkerchief, and while I put away the ribbon drawer she put the ribbon into the handkerchief, and put it into her bosom; I gave her a bill for what she had bought, which came to 11 1/2d. - she gave me a shilling, and I went to get a farthing; I told Mr. Butt what I had seen - he came up and said,"What have you got in your pocket-handkerchief?" she said, "This is what I have got." and she took it out of her handkerchief - this is the ribbon.</p>

               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that she had bought the ribbon in question at the prosecutor's shop on the 19th of December , and on the day in question had taken it back to get it' changed , when she was charged with stealing it. She called three witnesses to her character, all of whom denied any knowledge of her having been in custody before .</p>
               <p>MR. WONTNER. The prisoner was committed here for felony, but was discharged by proclamation or found not guilty - that was three or four years ago.</p>

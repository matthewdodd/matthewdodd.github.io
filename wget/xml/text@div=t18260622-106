            . I am a police officer. I met the prisoner between twelve and one o'clock at night, on the 24th of May, near the Swan public-house, at Gold's-green, with a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182606220045"></xptr>large bunch of flowers in his hand - I asked what he had got - he said a nosegay - I asked how he got it - he said' Squire Byng's gardener had given it to him. I took him into custody, and was conveying him to the lock-up house - he had got a bag under his arm with some apricots and peaches in it, and, as he went along he opened the bag, and was dropping them; I returned and picked them up- I went the next morning to Mr. Byng's gardener to inquire if the flowers came from there - he said he had not such plants in his possession; the next morning I found they belonged to Mr. Johnson.</p>
               <p>ADOLPHUS PUGH JOHNSON. I live at Hendon. I have a garden which is enclosed - I missed the flowers in the morning of the 24th of May - they were all safe the evening before, growing in the enclosed ground - they are American plants, but not of much value.</p>

            . I am gardener to Mr. Johnson. These plants were his - I saw them safe on the evening of the 23d of May - they were growing in the ground, and I watered them - I did not miss them till the officer brought them - I have had them in my possession ever since, and can swear to them as being my master's; I should think they are worth about 7s. - we lost no fruit - I had never seen the prisoner before. The plants are quite destroyed.</p>

            . I am a constable. I saw the prisoner, about eleven o'clock in the evening of the robbery, go out of the Bell public-house, with a companion, as they would not let them stay there any longer: I was about to pursue them, to see what their intentions were, but I happened to meet a person who spoke to me on other business, which prevented me. I had seen them begging in the afternoon in the neighbourhood; the patrol called me up between twelve and one o'clock, to take the prisoner; he had this knife, which has still the marks of having cut the flowers. I put him into the cage; we found about a peck and a half of fruit in the morning - we made inquiries, and found it belonged to a Miss Waddy.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming home through Hampstead and met a man who had worked for 'Squire Byng - he had a bunch of flowers, and gave me some - when I parted from him I saw a bit of a bag in the road - I took it up.</p>

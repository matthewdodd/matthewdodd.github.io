On Wednesday the 27th of April, between one and two o'clock, I was in doors eating my dinner; my wife's sister said there is Mrs. Covey in the shop; I knew her before, she lived in Stepney parish; I said it was no such thing, for Mrs. Covey was in confinement; I directly arose from my chair, looked in the shop and saw Mrs. Covey going out of the door; she had not gone but a few yards be fore a little girl said that she stole a piece of pork; I said to my lad run after her and stop her, which he did; he stopped her in Anchor and Hope alley; at that time I came up to her; then she denied having any pork about her; I looked under both sides of her cloak and could not see any; my lad was then behind us, he caught hold of the pork in her hand, under her cloak; I insisted upon having the pork; she said she would give it me if I would forgive her; I then said that I ensisted upon having it directly; she then took it from underneath her cloak, and threw it on the ground; I gave the pork to my lad, he took it home, and I took her back into the parlour, and sent for Mr.

On the 27th of April I was sent for to take charge of the prisoner; while I went to get the pork, I heard the child say she had stole a spoon; I asked her where it was; she said she had not got it; I searched her and found a tumbler, a shift, three potatoes, and threepence three farthings; I gave her a shake and out dropped the spoon; I said are not you ashamed of yourself for stealing of it, I suppose you thought it was silver; yes, said she, I did; she said never mind you can do me no harm, you can only send me where I have been before. I have heard that she was convicted a few sessions ago; she was sentenced for six months confinement.</p>

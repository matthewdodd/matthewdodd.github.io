The prisoner was certainly near enough to me to have done it, but I cannot swear that he did. I then saw the watch fall on the stairs - it was parted from the chain - I took it up and seized a person who was near me, but I saw that was not the person who I thought had robbed me. I then saw the prisoner making his escape - I pursued and saw him run down Strand-lane - I took him, in company with a friend, and while I had him by the collar a person in the crowd gave me my seals.</p>

            . I am a labourer. On the 15th of August I saw Mr. Selby, between six and seven o'clock, while I was standing on the steps, at the bottom of Strand-lane; I heard the cry of Stop thief! and saw the prisoner running towards me in great agitation: he tried to pass me but I stopped him, and he threw a chain and seal from his left hand behind him - they were given to Mr. Selby, who claimed them as his. The prisoner was taken to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I make any resistance? A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did I throw the chain and seal away? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I certainly did run from the steps, but it was to see a few friends who had a cutter for the afternoon, and I saw them going down the river.</p>
               <p>A witness gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

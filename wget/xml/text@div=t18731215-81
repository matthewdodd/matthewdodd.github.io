Troup and Company, 36, Hatton Garden—on 10th December the prisoner came to the shop and asked to look at some signet rings—I showed him a case of signet rings—he looked at several of them and picked one out, and said he would take it—he asked the price—I told him 38<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he said he wanted his initials, "J. H.," put on it—I asked him whether he would pay for it—he said "No"—I shut the case up and referred to Mr. Troup, who was in the shop, to know whether he was to have it—Mr. Troup said "Not without the money," and I told the prisoner he could not have it without the money—he went away—the next morning a constable showed me these two rings which had been in the case when I showed the rings to the prisoner.</p>

On 10th December I was called to Attenborough's, the pawnbroker's in Fleet Street—I saw the prisoner there—young Mr. Attenborough told me he had offered two rings in pledge, and he did not like the look of them—while he was speaking to me the prisoner walked out of the shop, and attempted to run away; I went after him and brought him back—I asked him where he got the rings from—he said "They are all right, I had them from Mr. Payne; I bought them this morning in Westbourne Grove"—I told him I should have to detain him to see whether it was correct—I took him to the station first, and then to Mr. Payne's in Westbourne Grove—in the prisoner's presence I asked the manager if he had purchased any rings there that morning—I showed him the rings, and he said "No; neither have we any of that kind in the shop; we never keep them in stock"—the prisoner said "Oh, that is all right; I bought them of Mr. Payne, you know nothing about them"—he said "Mr. Payne has not been in the shop for the last seven weeks past—I searched the prisoner, and found a metal watch and chain, and 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in money.</p>

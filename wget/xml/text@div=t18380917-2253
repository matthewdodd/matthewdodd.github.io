The prisoner was in my master's service—she slept in the same room with me—on Wednesday, the 29th of August, I missed three sovereigns out of a small pocket-book in my box, in my bed-room—I had some thread-lace also in that box—this is it-(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—I can swear to it—no one ever went into our bed-room but our two selves—my master sent for the constable—the lace was found in my presence in her box—there was no money found.</p>

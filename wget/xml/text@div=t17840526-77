             sworn.</p>
               <p>Examined by Mr. Sylvester, Council for the Prosecution.</p>
               <p>Give an account of this robbery. - I was coming towards Islington from Ball's Pond in a phaeton, and we were stopped by three footpads, two of them had hangers; I did not immediately stop, and they made a feint blow at me; I told them not to use me ill, as I was very willing to give them what I had; two of them got into the phaeton.</p>
               <p>Court. Which two? - The two prisoners, they had both cutlasses, I cannot say whether the other man had a cutlass or not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You swore before the Justice that only one man had a cutlass. - One stood at the horses heads, they swore at us a good deal, and told us to pull our hats over our eyes that we might not see them, it was just day-light, the two men that were in the phaeton demanded our money, upon which I pulled out my purse which contained two guineas, three or four half crowns, and six shillings, I gave it to one of them in the phaeton; they took also from my waistcoat pocket one guinea and a key.</p>
               <p>How came you to have a guinea in your waistcoat pocket? - We were rather apprehensive, and I dispersed my money and hid it and my watch; they damned my eyes, and asked me where it was; the man that was robbing the other gentleman cried out, damn his eyes, Jack, cut him down, for he sees us; to the best of my knowledge the prisoners were two of the men.</p>
               <p>Can you swear to either of them? - I cannot swear to either of the prisoners, not clearly, but I think they are the two men that were in the phaeton; by their dress and by their aprons, I believe them to be the same by their red waistcoats: I have no other reason to think so but by their dress and their aprons.</p>
               <p>How soon were they taken after? - About two hours after: the other man was dressed in rather darkish clothes, with an apron on; the man who robbed me has rather a particular voice, and I knew the voice instantly, and he had a pale face; he went to make a blow at me and I fell back, and the boy at the head of the horses had an apron on; Mears was the person that robbed me.</p>
               <p>CAPTAIN TRYON sworn.</p>
               <p>I was coming to town with Mr. Heartley, passing Ball's Pond three men jumped out into the highway, apparently behind a post.</p>
               <p>Court. Was it light or dark? - It was after nine.</p>
               <p>What sort of night? - It was a very foggy night.</p>
               <p>Then it was darkish? - Yes; one went to the horse's heads, the other two came into the carriage, the man who came on my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178405260097"></xptr> side pulled my hat over my eyes, and asked me for my money and watch.</p>

               <p>Court. You must confine yourself now to the robbery of Mr Heartley: do you know the persons of either of the prisoners? - I do not positively swear to either of them; I observed the man that was next me had an apron on, I did not see him at Bow-street till several days after.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. My Lord, here is M'Manus who took the prisoners two hours after, he found some money on them, and aprons on them.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. This last gentleman cannot swear to them at all, and the other gentleman only swears to them from their dress, and having aprons on; he says one of them had a pale face, and a particular voice.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was the key found? - No, nor the purse.</p>

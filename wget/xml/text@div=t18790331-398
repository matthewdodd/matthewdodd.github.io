I am a dressmaker, of 10, Blenheim Street Bond Street—I occupy the house and let the ground floor—my bedroom is the first-floor back, and the front is used for business—on 4th February, about 2 o'clock, I had a customer in the front room, and went to my bed-room for a pen—the room was then the same as usual—I shut the door and went into the front room, and waited while my customer wrote a letter—I heard my bedroom door-handle move, and soon afterwards came out with the customer on to the landing, and saw my bedroom door open, and the prisoner standing at the foot of my bed—I stood at the bedroom door and said "What are you doing here"—he had a little book in his hand, and said "I suppose I have made a mistake and come into the wrong room; you are</p>

I am barman at the Duchess of Edinburgh, Great Suffolk Street, Borough—on 24th October, Page came in with two companions between 8 and 9 o'clock and asked for a pot of 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. ale, he gave me a bad 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I asked him if he had another, he said." Yes" and got a good shilling from one of his friends—I gave him 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change, they drank the ale and then had another pot and left—I kept the Is., marked it, and gave it to my employer and afterwards to the constable Walch—I picked Page out from 8 or 9 others at che station on the following Friday, and have no doubt he is the man—Chadwick came in the same evening at a little after 11 o'clock.</p>

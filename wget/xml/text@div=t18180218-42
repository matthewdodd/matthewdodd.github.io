               unlawfully procuring six pieces of false counterfeit money, resembling shillings, with intent to utter them
            </rs>.</p>
               <p>JOHN FRANKLIN. I am a cooper, and live in Bottle-alley, Bishopgate-street. On the 10th of January, I was calling oranges in Bishopgate-street - the prisoner came and bought some of me, and offered me a bad shilling - I told him it was bad, and returned it to him - He gave me another bad one, I refused it. A boy came up and told him it was a shame, be threatened the boy, and ran after him; both ran away - He was taken.</p>

            . I am a constable, I was near the place, and heard the alarm; I stopped the prisoner and told him I thought he was a thief - He tried to get away; the prosecutor charged him with passing bad money; the prisoner said he did not know they were bad. I asked if he had any more - He said he had not. I found six counterfeit shillings on him, in four separate pockets, and 6s. and 12d. good; the bad money was quite new; he said it was given to him in change for a half sovereign-he afterwards said, he sold two pair of pantaloons to a jew, who gave them to him.</p>

               <p>MR. POWELL. They are all counterfeit, and have never been in circulation - They are all off the same die.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I sold two pair of pantaloons, and took the shillings for them.</p>

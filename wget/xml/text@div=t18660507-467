I am foreman to Dalton and Morgan, wholesale I stationers, of Budge-row, City—the prisoner had been their traveller for twelve months at the time he left—there was no written agreement, to my knowledge—his duties were to travel for orders for goods, and bring the orders to me, and I executed them—the goods were sent by vans direct—we sent out statements quarterly, but occasionally the parties would pay the prisoner—if they did not do so I sent out the quarterly account, and they would pay our collector—when the sums were handed over to the prisoner, he brought them to me the next time he came to the warehouse—he had a book in which I entered these moneys, and took them in to the cashier, and got them signed for—he was credited with those sums—here is no entry on 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. February, of Mr. Richard Brushfield having paid 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the prisoner did not come on the 2d; he came on the 3d—here is no entry on the 10th of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from Charles Edwards, or of any other sums—the prisoner came on the 10th—there is no entry of 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from Mr. Fowke on 17th February—the prisoner has never accounted to me for those sums.</p>

               <p>from the prisoner, and take the book to the cashier to sign—I received this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from the prisoner (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "10th March, '66—5, Denmark-road—Gentlemen, I beg to give you a month's notice from this date—Yours respectfully, Henry Lymer")—he did not remain until 10th April; I think the last time we saw him was 10th March, but he ought to have stayed under that agreement till 10th April—when I next saw him he was in custody.</p>

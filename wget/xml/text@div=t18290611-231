On the 2d of May, about five o'clock, I lost a tea-caddy from my bed-room, and six spoons; I had seen them safe about three o'clock; I did not see the prisoner - this is my caddy and spoons.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you know a woman named Smith, who came to your house to see some one? A. Yes; I have made inquiries about the prisoner, and I have heard a very good character of her, and that her state of mind is such as to render her a very easy dupe to any person.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you observe any woman outside? A. No; she came with the caddy first, and asked 8s. - then brought the spoons, and asked for as much as I could give her, as she wanted to make up her rent; she gave her name and address - I knew her before.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to Mr. Cotterell's, at the top of that house, for an umbrella - I stopped some time with him, and when I came down I saw a woman in the passage; she followed me out, and asked if I lodged at Mr. Burton's - I said No: she asked me to go and get 20s. for these spoons - I went and asked them, and they said they would chop them up before my face - she then asked me to go to another shop, and I went to Mr. Clark's, where I was known; I pawned the caddy first, and then the spoons.</p>
               <p>JOHN CLARK. Mr. Brooks told me that a woman had been there to pawn some spoons, on which she asked 20s., and she would be there again to take something out.</p>

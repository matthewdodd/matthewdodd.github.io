             sworn. - I saw the prisoner take the great coat as I was standing at the door, about half past one o'clock; the coachman had just drawn the coach out; the prisoner stepped up to the coach, and took the coat off, and ran up Dorrington-street; to the best of my knowledge that is the same man, but in a different dress; I lost sight of him when he turned the corner, but I saw that man brought to the Justice's, and, as nearly as I can say, it is the same man; but when I saw him, he was not in the same dress as I see him now: I have no doubt but I saw the same man, at the Justice's, that took the coat.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You had seen other persons in Dorrington-street, as well as the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you lost sight of the man, do you mean to swear positively that is the person? - A. I did swear at Hatton-garden he was dressed different, and I cannot say whether that is the same person.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Weler.) Are you positive as to the man? - A. I have not the least doubt about the person.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Are you sure that is the man that had the coat? - A. I am sure it is the man.</p>

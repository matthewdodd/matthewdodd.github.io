                  </hi>. I live with Mr. Biggins (who mar<lb></lb>ried my mother) in Tom'ngton-place, St. Pancras. The prisoner is my brother, and lived in the same house. On Sunday, the 6th of September, about half-past two, we were at dinner—the prisoner was sitting at the table at the opposite corner to me—he took up a tumbler, and threw it at my head—I had said nothing to induce him to do so—I saw him take it up, and turned my head—it hit me on the right side of my head—after that I saw him take up a knife off the table—I then ran out of the room—my head was bleeding—MR. Hunter, the surgeon, dressed it—my brother had told me, about eight o'clock the night before, that he would murder me—I had given him no provocation to throw the tumbler at me—the tumbler was broken by the blow, and cut me—I had not said a word to him the night before when he said he would murder me—he was not in a passion, he was in earnest—I was not good friends with him—he had used me bad, and I ran away for two days before, and kept from home.</p>

                  </hi>. I married Mrs. Hollingsworth. I am a clerk in the City—I was at dinner on Sunday, the 6th of September—the prisoner came down from the bed-room to dinner in a suppressed agitated manner, with his lips clenched, and his countenance grinning as if he wished to con<lb></lb>ceal his agitation—he had not sat down five minutes before he took up the tumbler and threw it at his brother's head, with all his might, and he began to rave about murder and revenge—he vowed he would have his revenge while one of the family were left—he did not say for what—he then seized the carving-knife—I immediately rushed on him and seized both his hands, and his other brother disarmed him; his mother, in trying to seize the knife, had it drawn through her fingers, and she rushed out of the room—his brother Joseph assisted in detaining him—I thought he was going to stab his brother—there was no cause of quarrel—the prisoner is a medical stu<lb></lb>dent—I moved to this house in consequence of his not being satisfied where I lived, and that he might be near the London University—I have known him nearly four years—I always thought him half-mad, but am most de<lb></lb>cidedly of opinion that he is deranged now—I do not think he was of sound mind at the time he took the tumbler up—I offered him liberal terms to prevent this coming into Court, and he said he would rather it came into Court—he talked of going to church and addressing the congre<lb></lb>gation about me—he once held a knife to his throat, and threatened to cut it when we came from church—he once threw up the window and called the police, and said he would go to prison—I called a surgeon in on one occasion—he was apprenticed to Mr. Rayner, of Uxbridge—three weeks ago last Sunday, he said his mother must take a post-chaise and bring him to London—on the 5th of September the younger brother slept out from fear of him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Hart-street, Bloomsbury. On Sunday, the 6th of September, I went to Mr. Biggins's house, and examined the prosecutor's head—I found a contused wound on the right side of the head—the hair was saturated with blood, and the collar of his shirt deeply stained with blood—it was a wound very likely to be inflicted with a tumbler, if he turned his head to avoid the blow coming in front—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184009140071"></xptr>
               <p>I did not consider it a dangerous wound, being superficial—I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner on that occasion, and from what he said I can form a judgment of his state of mind—I can only judge of what he said from the evidence of other parties—I judged from what I saw of him—I consider his state of mind to be insane, with lucid intervals—I think him insane at that time—I asked him his motive for having attacked his brother in this atrocious way—he was dogged, and would give no answer, but said he would go to prison—I reasoned with him, whether it would not be better to remain in his father's house and behave better in future—he disclaimed all idea of good behaviour, saying he would do the same thing over and over again, and wished to go to prison—his look was not furious, but it was the look of an insane man, to my judgment—I have seen insane persons—he had that peculiar look which is indescribable, a coward-like quivering of the lip, and his face effused with blood—I was sent for by his parents again, to inquire if he would ask forgiveness, and engage that he would not attempt the same again, and they would provide for him to reside at my house—he refused—I saw him also in the hall, and again asked him to promise to behave better, and come and live with me, and give me a pledge that he would never attempt such things—he said, "No, I will give no pledge whatever—I will give no promise—I will do it again and again"—his mother said, "Will you give Mr. Hunter any pledge that you won't do it again?"—he said, "No, I will give no pledge, I will do it again and again, I will go to prison"—this makes me feel that he is labouring under a blind influence, which he considers he has no power to counteract, and that he is morally not guilty, because he says, "I cannot help it."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon at Uxbridge. I have known the pri<lb></lb>soner since 1838—I attended him when at school at Uxbridge—he is now about 21 or 22 years old—he was apprenticed to me—I attended him while at school for an affection of the brain of so violent a character, that I would not take the responsibility on my own shoulders, and urged the master to send him home instantly—I imagined he would have a brain fever—that is a disease which very often leaves a permanent affection on the mind—people do not recover their mind at all sometimes after brain fever—it was a very violent brain fever—he was then 13 or 14—it was a surprise to me that he recovered—he was apprenticed to me about six months ago or more, with the sole view that his education should be gone through with at Univer<lb></lb>sity College—it was a matter of convenience for him that he was appren<lb></lb>ticed to me, that he might effect his studies at the College—he was not to serve me as an apprentice for my convenience—I had him down at Ux<lb></lb>bridge in July—he left me, I think, in August—he was not with me more than a fortnight—he was occasionally at my house—I noticed that he was in a very excited, nervous, irritable state—I could not account for his con<lb></lb>duct—it appeared extraordinary to a degree—I formed an opinion as to the state of his mind-that he is occasionally out of his mind—perhaps I should mention that he always entertained the greatest affection for his brother, and it is a mark of insanity that that affection should turn to the most entire hatred.</p>

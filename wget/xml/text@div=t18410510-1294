                  </hi>. I live in Cateaton-street, City. On the 20th of April, about ten o'clock, I, accompanied by a female, went into a house in Black Horse-court, Fleet-street—it was an improper house—I am mar<lb></lb>ried—I paid what was required of me when I went into the house—I came down with the female, for the purpose of leaving the house—she was be<lb></lb>fore me, and quitted the house—after she had gone through the door, Brown interrupted me in the passage, and asked me, would I not treat them with something—there was Allen, and a man Brown called Allen's hus<lb></lb>band—I said, "Well, I don't mind much about it"—I gave her two or three shillings—Brown went out, and fetched some spirits—while she was gone I was sitting with Allen in the front room on the ground-floor—I had had one or two glasses of brandy and water, not more—when Brown came in with the drink I had a wine glass of spirits and water—the man went away in half an hour after the spirits were drunk—Brown then asked me if I would give her any more to drink—I gave her a half-crown, and at that moment there was a noise in the passage, as though some one came down —Brown said, "Go up stairs with Allen, I will bring the spirits to you"—I went up stairs, and waited there five or-ten minutes—finding she did not come, I said, "Well, I am determined to go," and Allen asked me something about * * * * with her—I said, "No, nothing of that sort, I am not in that way"—I had no intention of anything of that kind—I said I was determined to go—on coming down into the passage again to go out, Brown said, "Won't you step in?" or something of that kind—I just stepped in, and at that moment a man came in, who she says was her husband—she said, "Won't you treat my husband?"—I said, "No, I have no change, I am not going to get any"—they kept making the application five or ten minutes—I refused to do any thing of the kind—the man then went out, and I attempted to go out, Brown stopped me in the door-way and said, "You have 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to pay before you leave"—I said, "For what?"—she said, "For going up stairs with Allen"—I said, "It is exceedingly strange, I have not been with the woman—it was not on that account I went up"—she said, "You shall not leave the house without paying the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—she stood in the door-way—I was trying to get out—she put herself in an attitude to prevent me—Allen was standing at my right shoulder—I heard footsteps at the door—she then said, "You have got money"—I said, "Yes, I have a sovereign, I am not going to get change"—she said, "I will give you change"—she counted out 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I said, "No, you have fixed your demand, I will have 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or will take my sovereign, and go out"—she said, "You shall not go"—Brown then said, "Allen shall get you change"—she was in the room all the time—I said, "Can't you get the money?"—she said, "No, give me the sovereign and I will get you change"—after a minute I threw the sovereign on the table and said, "D—me, get me 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—Brown took it up and gave it, or pretended to give it, to Allen—I could not see it pass—Allen</p>

               <p>went out immediately—I followed her, and she went across the street to the Grapes public-house in Farringdon-street—when she got there she walked up to the bar, and I walked up after her—the waiter came up and said, "What do you want?"—I said, "The woman wants change for a sovereign"—she turned to me and showed me some halfpence and a sixpence, and said, "I am going to have a pint of ale"—I said, "Where is my sove<lb></lb>reign?"—she said, "Don't make a <hi rend="italic">row</hi>, these are all my friends"—I went back to the house in Black Horse-court—Brown said, "She has got your money, you must go and see after her"—I was coming out and saw a police-man—they were taken into custody, and taken to the station—Allen was detained in the first instance and locked up, but was allowed to go—the next morning I went before the Magistrate at Guildhall—Brown was in custody—I found Allen there—she made a remark that it was a d—lie to the—she evidence which I was giving, which caused the Alderman to call her forward said she had given me 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. out of the sovereign, and she was asked where she got it—she said Mr. Butterfield gave it her—he is the landlord of the Grapes—he was sent for and asked questions, and Allen was then given into custody.</p>

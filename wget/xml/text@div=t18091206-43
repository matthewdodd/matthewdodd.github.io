            . I am a patrol. On Thursday evening, the 16th of November, about half past six, I was coming from Petticoat Lane, towards the Bull Inn; I saw the prisoner, and two others with him, they were quite young lands; they immediately crossed the road when they saw me, I followed them; the other two took to the right, and the prisoner to the left, with the property. He went to a butcher's shop, he threw this coat down; I went in and took the coat, and then I went after him. He turned round and saw me coming, then he began to run; then I called out stop thief. He stopped himself at the corner of Petticoat Lane; I went up to him; he asked me what I wanted with him. I told him he knew what I wanted with him, he must go along with me. I took him to the watchhouse, I gave him into the charge of Kinnersley.</p>

            . I am book-keeper at the Black Bull Inn, Aldgate. On the 16th of November, I received a coat to take care of for Mr. Clark; I was to give it to the care of the coachman, as Mr. Clark meant to go forward, and to be taken up on the road; I placed the coat along with the other parcels going by the same coach. On the following morning the coachman applied for the coat.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On Thursday afternoon I was coming by Aldgate watchhouse. A gentleman was standing with this coat on his arm; he said, if I would take the coat to Somerset-street, he would give me a pint of beer.</p>

When I came to town four or five months ago he got into my wife's room to steal something, and I ordered him off the premises. I had no other quarrel with him. On the 9th of August, about two o'clock in the morning, I heard a great noise in my house - it was quite dark; I got up, came down stairs, and saw the prisoner in the parlour, with a candle, breaking open the door - the pannel of the first door was broken all to pieces; the parlour door was also broken. I saw nothing in his hand. He said,</p>
               <p>"I am the man that is come to murder you." I knocked him down, called for assistance, and some of my lodgers and neighbours came, and helped to secure him. I found nothing on him, no weapon of any kind. A spade was found in the house. The noise he made in breaking the door open alarmed my neighbours as well as me. I believe he was mad drunk.</p>
               <p>Q. You have known him a long time, had he his right senses - A. Yes, my Lord. He is a single man. I found nothing removed in the house, for I came down stairs immediately as he got in.</p>

            . I keep the toll-gate at South Mimms. About two o'clock on this morning I was awoke by a very great noise - I was at the toll-house, alone; the day had not begun to break. I opened the door, went to the corner, and the prisoner came towards the toll-house - I knew him before; I went in again, and bolted both bolts. He came, took hold of the fastening of the door, and ordered me, twice, to open it, which I did, and he came in, paced across the toll-house to where we keep the coals, seized the shovel produced, and then went out with it. I was going to follow him, but he ordered me to stand back. I heard the breaking of Wessen's door, which was about twenty or thirty yards off; I went in, and left my money and watch - he returned to the toll-house, and took a lighted candle - he appeared to me to be as perfectly in his senses as I am; he carried the candle away alight. I afterwards saw him in the prosecutor's house - he had broken open the door, and was trying to escape out; I seized him by the collar, pushed him in again, and saw him secured. The spade produced is mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I came home drunk one night, and went into his room by mistake, I laid my hand on his wife, she called out murder! I then went to my own room, and she said she would have her vengeance if it was five years after. Next morning (I owed her 12 s.) she took my waistcoat, breeches, stockings, and hat, and turned me out. About nine o'clock one night I went to his yard for my working tools, he said if I did not leave the premises directly he would put me in the cage. I went to the Justice, who was not at home. I got fuddled, came to this man's house, called to him for a quarter of an hour for my tools, he would not open the door; I was in a passion, got a shovel, and broke it open.</p>
               <p>JURY to WESSEN. Q. Were any of his tools in your house - A. There were two gravel sieves in the yard, worth about 2 d. He knew they were in the yard, and not in the house.</p>

            . On the 18th of December, about ten in the evening, I was going up from <placeName id="t17700117-12-crimeloc82">Ratcliff-High-Way</placeName>

I saw three men going the same way. I thought I could go very safe. I spoke not a word to them nor they to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light or dark?</p>
               <p>Brewer. It was not very dark. I came to the cross road that goes to the Half-way-house: the road goes to Stepney. I turned my head over my shoulder and saw they were just the same as they had been all the way up the road, walking single one after the other. I had not stepped four steps before one of them came up to me. He catched hold of my right shoulder and said, Sir, we have need of you to night. I said I hope you will not go to use me ill; take what I have got. He took my watch and put it in his pocket (a silver one): it cost me five guineas. Then he felt for my money, which was loose in my breeches pocket, as near as I can guess there were seven or eight shillings in silver, some half-pence and farthings: one of the other two came up and took my handkerchief out of my pocket. They were then all three abreast of me: then they bid me go along. I said I wish you all a good night. One of them up with a broom stick and offered to strike me; another said, Don't use the gentleman ill, we have took what he had got. I did not see any weapon the others two had. The first that came up to me was a short thick man, with a flapped hat and a sort of a blue coat on. The prisoner is the very young man that stood at my left hand: whether it was he or the middle one that took my handkerchief I cannot say. The prisoner is not he that took my watch and money. The prisoner's hat was neither flapped, nor cocked, so but that I could see his face.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before?</p>
               <p>Brewer. No, I did not. I never saw him before to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find your watch again?</p>
               <p>Brewer. No, I never did. I applied to Sir

He said, Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177001170011"></xptr> Brewer, I believe I can shew you the people tomorrow. It was so light that I could tell the colour of their clothes: one had a blue coat, another a white one, and the other a brown one. I went the next morning with two men: we saw the prisoner and another going down Lemond-Street. Robinson, that went with us, said, Do you think that is one of the party? I said I do not know till I get nearer. Said he, we will go and get him in at a public-house, and you shall come in and have a full sight of him. He went and took him down Mill-Yard, and asked him if he would have something to drink. I kept a little behind: they went into the Noah's Ark; I went in after they were in: after they had drank their liquor, Robinson stepped to me and whispered me and said, Is that any of the men? I said it is; I knew him directly. I said he might venture to take him. We let him go that morning; and the next morning he took him. We let him go then, thinking we might see them all three together. We brought him up to the Angel and Crown Whitechapel; there the prisoner denied the charge. I said he was the man that stood at my left side: it was a taller than he that had the stick.</p>

            . I live at the White Bear in Well-street. The prisoner was at my house on the 18th of December, in the evening. I was in my bar; he said, Landlord, have you any company up stairs? I said no; said he, Are you not to have some to night? I turned my head, and looked at the dial; it was almost seven. I said, please to go into that room, some gentlemen will come soon. There was another with him. They went into the room, and called for a pint of beer; before they drank that, in came five or six of the gentlemen; the prisoner and his comrade went up and stayed above half an hour, as near as I can guess. Then they came down and had two Welch rabbits for supper. The maid drawed them a pint of two penny. After that they both came up again, and never quitted the club room till the company broke up, which was about half an hour after eleven. When they came down, they had a glass of brandy at the bar; then the girl said, gentlemen, there are two Welch rabbits to pay for, and a glass of brandy. The prisoner said, You are right, my dear, and put his hand in his pocket, and had not money enough, and he borrowed a penny of another man. After the prisoner was taken, I went into the prison to see him; he told me he was innocent of the fact. There is now one confined that did the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that?</p>
               <p>Martin. It was mentioned in my house, that the young fellow would turn evidence, and clear the prisoner, but Mr. Fielding would not let him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Martin. He had been at my house twice before.</p>

When I went in about eight in the evening, he was there: I went away about twelve, when he and three or four more went away: I looked at my watch; I believe it wanted one minute of half an hour after eleven. I came down stairs once and saw him eating a Welch rabbit; that was, I believe, just after I got there. I never saw him before. I know nothing of his character in the least.</p>

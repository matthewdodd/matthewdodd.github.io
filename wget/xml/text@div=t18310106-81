               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Was any one else in the shop? A. No - our shop door is open; I do not think she could have got away - I called the servant down while I got in the officer; I do not think the prisoner took up the change - she took up the shoes, and put them down again; she did not say any thing when she gave me the half-sovereign - I believe four 5l. notes were found on her, and some rings and keys.</p>

            . I am a street-keeper of Newgate-street. I was called, and found on the prisoner a gilt sixpence wrapped up in a bit of thin paper; I had before asked if she had any more, and she said not - I found several little bits of paper on her, similar to the one this half-sovereign is wrapped in; I took her to the Compter, and thinking she might have some more I got the matron to search her, and these four 5l. notes were found within her stays.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were they good notes? A. Yes, and one good sovereign was found on her; I should think these papers are too thin for curl papers - these are good sixpences, gils.</p>

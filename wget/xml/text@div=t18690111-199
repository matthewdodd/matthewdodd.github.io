               <p>Miss Robinson, Miss Wilson, and George Bell were present on the night in question, 25th December, Christmas Day—we dined in the front kitchen—the prisoner sat beside me at dinner—the deceased was there, Mr. Wother<lb></lb>spoon, and several others—we dined between 4 and 5 o'clock, and were all happy and comfortable together—in the course of the evening the prisoner made himself rather noisy, and somewhat obnoxious to the company—I saw him have some words with the deceased, but what they were I don't know—he was in and out very often during the evening—at one time he put himself very abruptly between the deceased and a young woman, one of the party—some short time after that I missed my brother—Mrs. Wotherspoon came down and said something to me, in consequence of which I ran up stairs to the front room first floor—Mr. Archibald Wotherspoon was before me—I saw the prisoner sitting on a chair, and my brother lying on the floor in a corner right opposite to where the prisoner was, as I thought dead—I said to the prisoner, "Campbell, you know something about this, tell me all about it"—I suspected him, from his conduct during the evening—he said, "I have done nothing"—I pressed him a little further, and he said, "I liked Jack, and I don't mind swinging for him"—he did nothing, he sat coolly on the chair—Mr. Bell was present—a policeman and a doctor came—the prisoner was an old acquaintance—I can't call him an old friend—his father was an old acquaintance as well—the prisoner came to live with us about the end of September, and had been living with us ever since—he slept with the deceased and myself—the deceased was, as far as I knew, on friendly terms with the prisoner, and the prisoner with him—I always thought so—I saw a rifle when I entered the room—it was my rifle—I did not keep it loaded.</p>

               <p>to Scotland for a fortnight, and the prisoner came back and took up his quarters at our house—that was about the end of September—from that time down to the night of this occurrence, they were quite on friendly terms, as friends who find a pleasure in each other's company—I had been out on the morning of Christmas-day, not with the prisoner—aa I came home about 2 o'clock, I found the prisoner and deceased going out together—I said, "Where are you going I"—the prisoner said, "I am going out to get drunk"—I took it as a bit of fun—I laughed at the idea of it—they were quite sober, then—I could not say that the prisoner and my brother were not drinking together during the day—only judging from their appearance when they came back, I could not see any effects of drink on either of them—I don't know where they had been—something was said about wrestling—that was somewhere between 10 and 11 o'clock—I could not say what the words were about between the prisoner and my brother—I did not hear him say anything about wrestling, then—I can't remember Wotherspoon's leaving the room—I saw my brother leave—I fancy Wotherspoon left before him—I won't be certain about that—my brother had been singing, and the prisoner, too—they were going on all right enough, only the prisoner was rather noisy—I don't recollect my brother's saying anything about going to fetch A piece of music when he left the room.</p>

I am an upholsterer, and live at 42, Alfred Street—the prisoner had been living is the same house for three months, since September—we had a party on Christmas night—my father is the landlord of the house—the prisoner and deceased were present—there was singing and recitations going on—in the course of the evening, the prisoner asked me to go up stairs to Moir's room and have a drop of rum—I said no at first, but he pressed me, and I consented—I went up, the deceased followed us—I asked where he was going; he said he was going up to his own room for a Christy Minstrels' song-book—when we got up stairs, the deceased filled me out a glass of whiskey—there was a whisky and rum bottle on the table, and while I was drinking the whiskey the prisoner talked about wrestling—I am not sure whether he said, "I will bet you 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. that I can wrestle you"—that was to the deceased—the deceased said, "We did not come here to wrestle," and it passed off—there was no one else there but us three—this was in the front room—the prisoner put up his fists, in a sparring attitude, and the deceased said he would take him with one hand—that passed off—the deceased said, "We did not come here to fight"—the prisoner then walked round and took the rifle from off the cupboard; it was hanging up on a nail above the cupboard, and the bayonet beside it on the cupboard—the deceased took hold of the prisoner, to keep him from taking the gun down, and while he was holding him back the bayonet and case fell on the floor—while I was looking for the bayonet and case, the prisoner had the gun, and he walked round the table and went out of the room—he came back into the room again in about a minute and a half; he had the rifle in his hand—he walked near the window and presented the rifle in the usual manner—I was standing on the other side of the table, the deceased was standing nearly behind me—the room is about thirteen feet long and eleven wide—there are two windows to it, on the left<lb></lb>hand side of the door; the door is on the right—as you enter the room the windows arc on the right—the table was in the middle of the room—I</p>

I was at the police-station when the prisoner was brought there, about 11 o'clock on the evening of Christmas day—I afterwards went to 42, Alfred Street—I examined the room on the first floor—on the sofa I found this bullet—I also found a plug, with a portion of the bullet—I noticed a hole in the wall, by the side of the fire-place, 5 feet 8 inches from the floor; I compared the bullet with that hole, and it corresponded exactly—I went into the back bedroom (the adjoining room), and there found the pouch, cartridge box, cartridge case, and belt, hanging on the bed-post—the cartridge box was open, and the cap box inside was also open, where there are a number of caps, one whole cartridge, and a portion of two other cartridges which had been pulled to pieces; there were nine ball cartridges in the cartridge case—the distance from one room to the other is about seven yards, not from one door to the other, but from where the cartridge case was hanging on the bed-post to the inside of the room where the prisoner was supposed to have been standing at the time he fired the rifle—the doors are about three feet apart; it is a small landing—the lamp was standing on the table, on a small workbox—the height from the glass of the lamp to the floor was 3 feet 11 inches—from the door side of the table to the fire-place was 11 feet.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi>). This cartridge box, pouch, and cape are mine—the prisoner knew where I kept them; they were hanging on the same bed where we slept—I can't say whether he knew it contained ball cartridges; they were accessible to anybody who went into the room.</p>

                  </hi>. I was at the house on this evening—I went up into the room where the deceased was, after the shot was fired—Mrs. Wotherspoon was standing beside the prisoner; he took her hand, and said, "It is done now, and it <hi rend="italic">canna</hi> be helped, and the most that I can do is to swing for him," at the same time drawing his finger across his throat, and making an expression, "and I can meet him in eternity."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was that all he said? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Immediately afterwards, when the police had him in charge, he said, "Come away, I have had enough of this; I want to get out; I want to go"—I did not hear him say that he liked him very much; I was engaged with the deceased, to see if he was really dead—Mrs. Wotherspoon said, "George, he has been more than a brother to you"—he said, "I know he has' and then he made use of the other expression—I never wrestled with the prisoner—there had been some wrestling between the deceased and Bell, in a friendly way, about a month before.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I believe the prisoner and your poor son were very good friends, indeed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; always, to my view—they were very playful) and full of fun—we were all agreeable together—some six weeks or two</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186901110041"></xptr>
               <p>months before this, the prisoner took up the rifle from the cupboard, and snapped it at my son—I took it as a piece of fun; I thought it was just in diversion, like—my son was standing up, and he just snapped the gun, as I thought, in fun—I could not say whether there was a cap on it; I I don't think there was; there was no sound or explosion—we were all on good terms at the time—the last thing I should have thought of was that he would hurt him; I am sure of that—but he is of a changeable disposition; he is very easily put up, and very easily put down—he had come from his friends in Scotland, and he had all his things packed up that night for the purpose of starting back to Scotland next morning, all except two pairs of socks and a pair of drawers, which I mended that evening to have ready for him—there is one thing I should like to say: I had a little drink in the house, in case any person should call, but there was not a person that called, and I never gave a glass to anyone out of my hand that day, not even to the prisoner, and if there was any drink got extra, he went up and took it him-self; if he was excitable, it was himself that took it—there was drink up stairs—there is something the matter with the prisoner's right eye; he hurt it at one time—he is nearly blind, I think, with his right eye.</p>

I am the wife of Edward Upjohn, and am house<lb></lb>keeper at 2, Lower Belgrave-street—Mr. Harrington Balfour lodges there—on 14th May we had a dog in the house belonging to him, and it was missed on that day—on Monday the 25th, Kendillon called at the house, and inquired if Mr. Upjohn was at home; I said, "No"—he said, "I have called respecting the dog you have lost" (bills had been printed)—I said, "Mr. Upjohn is not at home, can I go with you to see the dog?—he said, "No, you had better not; it would be better Mr. Upjohn should come"—I said he was out of town, and would not be home till late, and we arranged that on the Tuesday morning Mr. Upjohn should go to 31, Regent-street, Chelsea, the address given by Kendillon—I understood him to give the name of Dillon, but it might be a mistake—I communicated what had passed to Mr. Upjohn when he came home—the next day, the 26th, Kendillon called again, and said he had called respecting the man who had previously called on my husband—I then said, "5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is a great deal of money to give without the dog being produced," and he said, "They are always sure to produce the right dog"—he then went away—on the 27th he called again, accompanied by the other prisoner—both of them spoke to me, more especially Crowley—they said they had called respecting the dog again—I told them Mr. Up<lb></lb>john had gone to 31, Regent-street, Chelsea, to see them still further about it, and I asked Crowley how long it would take him to go to Shoreditch (they had stated before that the dog was at Whitechapel)—he said, "Two hours"—they then said they would go away, and wait outside half an hour—at the end of that time Crowley came back alone—I sent Mr. Balfour's valet for him; Mr. Upjohn had returned in the mean time, and these was a police<lb></lb>man in the house—he heard anything further that took place.</p>

I keep the house, 2, Lower Belgrave-street—on Tues<lb></lb>day, 26th May, from what my wife said to me, I went to 31, Regent-street, Chelsea, to see Kendillon—I saw both the prisoners; I said to Kendillon, "I come to ask you respecting a dog, you called yesterday at 2, Lower Belgrave-street, and said you thought you knew were the dog was," or some<lb></lb>thing to that effect—he said, "If you come with me I will show you; here is a man here who knows a gentleman who has bought a dog for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. resem<lb></lb>bling the dog advertised, and no doubt if it is your dog he will let you have it for the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—I said, "I could not afford to give more than the reward—I had offered 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I would immediately see Mr. Balfour on the subject, and if he would allow me to take the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and go down to Shoreditch to see the dog, I was quite willing to go—Crowley had said the dog was at Shoreditch—Crowley was there all the time this conversation was going on—it was in the street—Kendillon said he would take me to the man who had my dog, and he took me up to Crowley, about thirty or forty yards from his house, I should, think, and then this conversation passed—on 27th the next day I saw Crowley at our house alone—Mr. Balfour was there at that time, and a policeman also, within hearing—Crowley said he had called respecting the dog, and I said, "I have sent Mr. Balfour's servant over to his father's in Eccleston-square to send for him"—he came, and I said to him in Crowley's presence, "This is the man who thinks he can find your dog, and if you will allow me to take the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and go down to Shoreditch with him, I will go, and if it is our dog I will bring it home"—Mr. Balfour immediately called in the constable, and give him in custody.</p>

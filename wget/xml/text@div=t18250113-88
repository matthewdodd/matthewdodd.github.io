On Saturday night, the 8th of January, I fastened up the shop, and about eight o'clock in the morning I found the wall broken down; and missed about 1/2 a cwl. of lead and tin mixed together; I saw it again that night, and know it to be ours. I know nothing of the prisoner. I found the wall at the back part of the shop broken down, by which means they had got in. It was dark when I locked the shop up. I was in the back parlour with my family till I went to bed.</p>

            . I am headborough of Poplar. On Saturday night, the 8th of January, about eleven o'clock, I saw the prisoner and another at the corner of Bow-lane, Poplar, nearly a mile from the prosecutors' - each carrying a pig of lead; they saw me, dropped it, and ran off. I secured the prisoner twelve yards off.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have been a hard working boy all my life. I was going to see after a ship, and in Whitechapel I met a man, who asked me where I was going - I said home to Bow-lane; he said he would give me 1 s. to carry a parcel; I said I could not carry both, and so he carried one - and when he saw this gentleman, he said,</p>
               <p>"There is an officer, drop it; and we must go away."</p>

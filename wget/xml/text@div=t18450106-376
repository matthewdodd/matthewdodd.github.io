                  </hi>. I live in Cambridge-street, Be thnal-green-road. I On the 14th of Dec. I went to Mr. Brown's to have a pint of porter, about I five o'clock in the evening—I saw the prisoner there, and I never missed him till a quarter to eight—I had no occasion to go out, and between five I and a quarter to eight I never missed him—he was drinking with another I person, of whom Mr. Brown has his tobacco—I was drinking by myself—I know the prisoner by his vending brooms about the street—he was never I out of the house to my knowledge till ten minutes or a quarter to eight—I he was not absent long enough to go to Sheffield's—Sheffield's is nearly a quarter of a mile from there—I did not see the prisoner with any steaks that evening—he had none dressed at the house—he had no meat with him.</p>

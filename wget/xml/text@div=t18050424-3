               <p>Q. In consequence of any information, did you go any where on Sunday, the 17th of February? - A. In consequence of this warrant, I went to the apartment of the prisoners, in <placeName id="t18050424-3-crimeloc13">Caroline-court, Saffron-hill</placeName>

               <p>Q. Who went with you? - A. Vickery, Mason, Kennedy, and one Bolt.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoners before this time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you all went to this Caroline-court? - A. Yes; the bottom door of the house was open, and I went up two pair of stairs and found the two pair of stairs room door open, where the prisoners were; when I came into the room, the prisoner Pagett was sweeping the room with a broom; the prisoner

             was standing by the side of the table; I went to read my warrant; Mrs. Pagett said, warrant or no warrant, you are welcome to search; the man being by, we searched him, but found nothing on him; I then proceeded to search the woman's pocket, and on her person I found nothing but good monies. In a place by the side of the window, I found this cannister, which I opened, and I found this bag, which I have in my hand, in the cannister.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look at the contents of the bag? - A. I did, it contained some file-dust and six iron punches; this I found by the fire-side; I found another bag; it is a leather bag, like a powder-bag which a hair-dresser uses.</p>
               <p>Q. You found these in the presence of both the prisoners and the officers? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What is that which you took out of that bag? - A. It is a quantity of counterfeited blanks.</p>
               <p>Q. They were in that paper then which you now produce, and in that last bag? - A. They were.</p>
               <p>Q. How many counterfeited blanks were there in that leather bag? - A. There were fifty-nine counterfeited blanks; they were not coloured.</p>
               <p>Q. If coloured, they would be called shillings; they were round blanks, not coloured; they were the size of a shilling? - A. Yes, they were small round blanks which would in time be coloured into shillings.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Which might be in course of time? - A. Yes: in the same leather bag was a small quantity of waste, or sissil; it has had these holes punched in them; this we found in an arm chair by the fire side; I found these two pair of pliers, a piece of cork, and some sand paper; this sandpaper has been used which I now produce.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Did it appear to have been recently used? - A. I could not discern that.</p>
               <p>Q. You produce the piece of cork, is there any observations that you can make from that cork? - A. It is an article that I have found at such places.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing particular respecting the seat of the arm chair? - A. We lifted up the seat of the arm chair (as a great number do), and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180504240005"></xptr>there I found the articles I have before described; these I secured in the presence of the prisoners and the officers, and I took them away; they are all which I found.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been an officer for a great many years? - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. You have attended upon the examination of coiners a great many years; do you know the use of the different articles? - A. The sand-paper is used to rub the metal; the sissil remains as it appears now, after the punch has struck out the blank from that sissil.</p>
               <p>Q. How many blanks appear to have been struck out of that sissil? - A. There are four or five appear to have been struck out of this.</p>
               <p>Q. What metal is that sissil? - A. It is a composition with some silver in it.</p>
               <p>Q. The cork is usually used - A. The cork is, I believe, used to smooth the blanks.</p>
               <p>Q. There is a quantity of file dust you produce? - A. That is from the edges of those blanks, I presume.</p>
               <p>Q. The pliers for what purpose are they used? - A. I should believe it is to hold them (to hold them this way) to rub them with either sand-paper or cork.</p>
               <p>Q. Do they appear to have been used? - A. I believe they have been used, by the brightness.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got a punch? - A. There are six.</p>
               <p>Q. There is one I would wish you to notice? - A. Here is one with the letter S.</p>
               <p>Q. You say there was a considerable number of blanks? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the letter S found on those blanks? - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. That does not correspond with those you now produce? - A. Not with my blanks.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen any blanks that your brother officers have, that correspond with that letter? - A. I believe they have some.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you produce any cup? - A. I have a cup; I cannot tell in what part I found it in the apartment, nor I cannot recollect whether I found it.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw it in the apartment of Rothwell and Pagett? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew them before? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you come acquainted that this was their apartment? - A. I heard Mrs. Pagett say, take care of my goods; I believe those were the words; that was after we had made the search; I think Rothwell said he was unlucky that he had just come up.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it that Rothwell said that? - A. During the time we were in the room; the man and woman knew me, and I knew them; they were very civil; there was not the least hindrance of our search.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. The place where you found this, the house is kept by a woman of the name of Bromage? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You found the door open below stairs, and the door up stairs also? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. No communication whatever appeared to you that they had been at work? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You examined her hands, you found no marks of aqua fortis on her hands? - A. No, I only examined the woman.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not find any aqua fortis? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Without aqua fortis they cannot extract the silver out of the metal to the surface? - A. No, they cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. That, therefore, is an indisputable ingredient in the process of colouring? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I find you do not produce any files? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are not files also a necessary instrument - a file is exceedingly necessary, that the instruments should be complete for the purpose of preparing these blanks? - A. The edges have been smoothed in a lathing wheel; the plate itself is sufficiently smooth; there was none there that I found.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Of course in the process of colouring, a file would not be necessary.</p>
               <p>Court. It would be necessary to render the edges smooth, for the purpose of circulation? - A. That is what Mr. Alley means.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. To be sure.</p>

               <p>Q. Tell me what you did there? - A Armstrong proceeded to read his warrant, after we went into the house; the first thing that I found was seven sixpences in the window.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Are they finished? - A.There were either three or four, at the time I took them, that were fit for circulation, and I believe they are now; I do not exactly know whether they were in this piece of paper; they were in a tea caddie in the window, in a piece of paper, but I believe I took them out of that piece of paper; after I had searched different parts of the room, I went to a little table that stood at the left hand side of the fire place; on that table stood an old looking glass, and in the frame was this little drawer: I took it out and found it contained a different quantity of bad coin; there were thirteen counterfeit half guineas and fifty two seven-shilling pieces; I think there were three counterfeit half crowns, two counterfeit dollars, and ten counterfeit shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. In what state were the counterfeit shillings? - A. Some of them were fit for circulation and quite finished, as I supposed; in the same drawer were seven counterfeited sixpences.</p>

               <p>Q. And you are one of the officers of Worship-street? - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us whether you found any thing, and where? - A. On searching the shelf adjoining the room door, I found this vial, containing vitriol; on this same shelf I also found this saucer, with blacking in it, and a pair of pliers; on the ground, under that shelf, I found this vial, covered with rags.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the contents of that vial? - A. Aqua fortis.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Is there any in it now? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Upon finding it, what then? - A. Under those rags was a great deal of dust and ashes, and upon all was a washing-tub containing dirty water; I shewed the bottle to the prisoner Pagett, and she said it was a medicine from the doctor; Rothwell tried to lay hold of the bottle; he put his hand out, and tried to take it out of my hands.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he express any thing when he put his hands out? - A. He did; he said, let me look at it, which I would not; that is all that I found.</p>
               <p>Q. On your refusing to let him look at it, did he do any thing? - A. He made an attempt to come towards me, once or twice; I told him I would not suffer it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that attempt made for the purpose of getting it from you? - A. I think it was; I refused to let him have it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You are not a chemist? - A. No, I served my time to a dyer.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you undertake to swear positively that it is aqua fortis in that bottle? - A. Yes, I have been in the habit of using it for ten years.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not produce any files? - A. I do not; there were none found.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. You are acquainted with aqua fortis perfectly? - A. Yes, I have tasted it, and the vitriol I have tasted; I know it to be vitriol.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You are another officer of Worship-street? - A. I am; I went with them on this occasion; I produce a block I found in the room, on the left hand side of the window.</p>
               <p>Q. What else did you find? - A. Nothing else.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any particular appearance upon that block? - A. Yes, there is, the corners are all worn, I presume, by the filing.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever been present at the apprehension of coiners before? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>(To Armstrong.) Q. That is a block? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. For what purpose is it used? - A. I should believe that the metal is held on it by pliers, and worked with either sand-paper or cork, or any thing as they please, in rubbing that way (describing the manner.)</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that produced by the other witness, the aqua fortis; is that aqua fortis? - A. I have no doubt but that is aqua fortis.</p>
               <p>Q. Would aqua fortis be a necessary ingredient for colouring? - A. Aqua fortis is what brings the silver out of the metal to the surface.</p>
               <p>Q. And without which the purpose of colouring could not be effected? - A. I should believe not.</p>
               <p>Q. There is some vitriol found likewise; is vitriol an ingredient necessary to be used in that case? - A. In that case, I do not know that it is.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You have not made any experiment upon those blanks? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore it is not possible for you to say, whether by a repitition of this vitriol and aqua fortis any thing could be produced, so as to give them the colour and appearance of silver? - A. I have not made any experiment with aqua fortis upon these blanks.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether these blanks, by the assistance of aqua fortis could have produced on them the colour of silver you cannot tell, as you have not tried? - A. I should be afraid to dare practise that without permission of the Court or the master of the mint, because I might bring a crime on myself.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. I believe you are clerk to Mr. Burnham, the solicitor of the mint? - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been so many years? - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you made any experiment, with respect to any of this money that has been produced? - A. I have on two of the blanks which I received from Armstrong, I have tried an experiment, and I found that there is a considerable portion of silver in the metal, and that aqua fortis alone will give them the appearance of silver.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You have tried them with aqua fortis? - A. I did; these are the two blanks (producing them.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Are these two you have put into my hands fit for circulation? - A. I did not not take pains to finish them, but merely to see whether aqua fortis would produce the effect; the files are not necessary in this case, the edges of the blanks, in the present instance, are turned with a lathe.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. That is in your judgment? - A. I have no doubt of it; nor would files be necessary<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180504240007"></xptr>for preparing the surface for colouring.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Why? - A. Because the metal is sufficiently smooth, by the operation of the flatting mill, in flatting the metal, from which the blanks are cut; the sand-paper and cork would be alone sufficient for the smoothing of the surface.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You say you made an experiment, and you found that aqua fortis produced this colour; you did not do it with the aqua fortis found at the prisoner's lodgings, but with some you got elsewhere? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Aqua fortis by itself, without a particular preparation, will not have the effect? - A. It is too strong without being diluted with a little water.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean nothing else but water? - A. Nothing else; it would be too strong of itself.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that cream of tartar is not necessary in raising the colour of silver on the surface? - A. Cream of tartar is often used in rubbing it to take off the blackness which is on the blank.</p>
               <p>Q. Without the assistance of cream of tartar or blacking, it would be impossible to give it the appearance of silver, so as to deceive the public? - A. It might be done with common salt only. I produce the two shillings.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fielding. Q. You, sir, are the monier of the mint, will you be so good as to look at the money that is produced? - A. I am now speaking of the silver and gold (looking at them) that is produced here; they are all counterfeits, I will not speak any thing of the dollar.</p>
               <p>Q. That metal has a quantity of silver in it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. I find that these shillings you have been speaking to are very bad indeed? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It is impossible that any man that has eyesight to take them for good shillings? - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you mean to say it is impossible to be deceived by them? - A. They might take them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Do you mean to say any man in his senses would take them? - A. Not if he looked at them.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. The question is whether a person might not take them without examining them? - A. They might.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. 
               <persName id="t18050424-3-person80">Fielding, Q.</persName>
             Did you let this apartment to the prisoners? - A. I let it to her and another woman.</p>
               <p>Q. To whom? - A. To Elizabeth Pagett, and I believe the other person's name was Brown,</p>
               <p>Q. How often have you seen that man there? - A. I have seen the man there, and other men there with him.</p>
               <p>Q.Every day? - A. No: I had not seen him there for a month or six weeks before.</p>
               <p>Q. How long ago is it that you first let the lodgings to her? - A. I cannot say; it might be eight or nine months.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he with her at the time of her hiring the lodging of you? - A. He was not, he came soon after I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Shortly after you saw him, he was not with her then? - A. No, it was only her and another woman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. She worked in the box making line? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not live there, he only came there to see her? - A. He came there; she was often out; I have seen him there at times when she was at home; I know nothing of the man living there; the room was taken by that woman.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q.(To Armstrong.) Produce the fifty-nine shillings? - A. There are fifty seven there, and two Mr. Powel had.</p>
               <p>Vickery. I produce this one I hold in my hand; it has the letter S upon it, and I have got the punch.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Which are the shillings that has been coloured? - A. Those three, they only want the blacking.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you found seven sixpences, and three of them finished? - A. There are the three finished sixpences, they were with the other blank sixpences.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. (To the Jury.) These, gentlemen, appear to have been coloured.</p>
               <p>Vickery. They all looked much better when taken than now they have been handled by the officers.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. I propose to shew the Jury the two shillings where the experiment has been made by Mr. Powel.</p>

               <p>Court. These two shillings were two of the shillings taken from the blanks, which have been coloured with aqua fortis; that is to shew you that aqua fortis will produce that colour of silver; not with the aqua fortis found in the lodging, but with aqua fortis of his own producing. (The whole of the articles found in the prisoner's lodgings produced in Court.)</p>

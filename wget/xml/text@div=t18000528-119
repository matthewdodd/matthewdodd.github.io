               <p>"I acknowledge that I have sold broken wood to Mrs. Smith before. On Tuesday night last, I took two of those deals now produced, to Mrs. Smith's cellar; a few days before this, I told Mrs. Smith I should soon have some deals to sell, when she told me to carry them into her cellar, and she would pay me for them; on the Wednesday morning, I took the other deals from Mrs. Taylor's wharf, and carried them likewise to her cellar, this was about five o'clock; I did not exactly know the number, but I called at Mrs. Smith's window, as soon as I had done, and told her what I had done, she came down into the cellar, and put them by; Mrs. Smith promised me, the Tuesday before I brought her any deals, that she would give me one and nine-pence for each deal, as the most she could afford, but she had not seen them then; after Mrs. Smith had put the planks by, I asked her for my money, she said, she had none at present; I then asked her to let me have two shillings, which I was to give to the watchman of the wharf that permitted me to take them from the wharf, saying, I must remember him, for his wages were so small, he could not live by them; I gave him one shilling and some purl; I am not the only person concerned in robbing this wharf of deals; there is one

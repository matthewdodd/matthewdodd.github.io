            . I live at White Webbs, Enfield. On the morning of the 1st of May I was called up, between six and seven o'clock, and went to my granary; I missed about three quarters and a half of black and white oats from a bin, in which seven quarters had been shot a day or two before - on the 13th of May some oats were sent to me; I compared them with those in the bin - they corresponded exactly.</p>

            . I am a jobber, and live at Enfield-highway. On the morning of the 1st of May, about three o'clock, I saw the prisoner near the shed where I live; he asked whether I was going down into the country, and how long I should be - he asked whether I wanted any corn; I said I did not want any - he said I could put it into the barn if I liked; I said No - he said he had three quarters of corn; a cart came down the street - Warren said some thing, but I cannot recollect what it was - the cart did make a bit of a pause, but he did not to say "Stop" - the prisoner went after it; as he was going out he said I might have it - I said I would not; I understood it to be corn - I said I would not have any thing to do with it; he asked how long I should be - I said twenty minutes, or half an hour; he came up again before the half hour was expired - just as I put the horse in the shaft he asked if I would go down the street and have a cup of coffee; I said Yes; I went to his house, and had the coffee - I saw about a bushel, or a bushel and a half of black and white oats in a tub.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.What did he say about the oats? A. He asked if I was a mind to have any oats or corn, I cannot say which he said - I said No; he asked me to go to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110083"></xptr>stable, and I saw a bag tied up; I saw some chaff and oats round the edge of the copper, but I was not near enough to see what colour it was.</p>

               <p>MR. DOWLING. Q. Did you see any black and white oats on his premises before the 1st of May? A. Yes, that I will swear - my house has been searched two or three times, but I am not always at home - I am a nurse; I will not swear that it has not been searched oftener - I called him about a quarter before three o'clock that morning; they had breakfast, and he started a little before four to go into the country with Grant - my husband lives at Enfield; I do not live with him - he has one room, which he could not give up, and he lives there about two miles from me; we did part in rather an unfriendly manner, but we are friendly now - he is not starving.</p>

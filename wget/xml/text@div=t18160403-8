On the 19th of February, she came into my service, and staid until the evening of the 9th of March following. I was absent in the morning of that day, and when I came home in the evening, I found my house open, with all my doors open. After I got in, I awakened my wife, she was asleep in the bed-room. I asked her if she had sent Susan out. I had a female lodger in the house, but not any other attendant. My wife<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181604030014"></xptr>said, she had not sent her out; and asked me if she was not in the parlour; I told her she was not, and she asked me to look on the table, and see if her gowns were there; I looked, and answered no. I then found the watch was gone from over the parlour mantle-piece. I looked in a drawer, in which I usually kept my business, and missed a gold watch-case; I looked farther, and missed several articles, such as trinkets. I then fastened up my house, and went to bed; it might be about twelve o'clock. When I came into the house, there was a pillow-case hanging over the fender alight; I put it out. The next morning being Sunday, I got up about five; I made further search of what I had lost, and immediately went to Lambeth-street police office. I gave information to Freeman, the officer; he and I went in search of the prisoner; she had lodged with her father and mother, but was not there. She was found in Whitechapel, near Essex-street, in the street-walking. I left the officer then, before she was taken, and when I went again to him, he told me he had got the prisoner, she was then locked up in the watch-house; part of the goods were found on her person, for she was dressed in them; they were found by the officer; his name is Freeman; he said he had found them on her person, and he shewed them to me; there was part of a gold watch-case, a tin box with trinkets, a silk scarf, a brown stuff gown, a black hat and feathers, what they call a chip hat, a white swan down ruff, those were the articles produced by the officer, when I called on him at his own house; the part of the watch-case that was found was worth four guineas; the tin box contained a neck-chain, a gold brooch, and a necklace, and I believe that was all the box contained at that time; the gold brooch, is worth ten shillings and sixpence; the neck-chain, is worth a shilling; the necklace is worth ninepence. These the officer shewed me as what he found upon her.</p>

               <p>FRANCIS FREEMAN. I belong to the police office Whitechapel. I searched the prisoner's person; I apprehended her about twelve o'clock, on the 10th of March; I searched her, and found on her head this hat and feathers; here is a scarf, a gown, which the prisoner was wearing; on searching her pockets I found this part of the gold case. I then asked her where she slept on the night of the 9th, and she told me she had slept in a house in Wingfield-street, Spitalfields, and that she had left her bundle there. I asked her how she came by these things; I charged her with having stolen them, and she did not deny it. When I went to her lodging where she said she had slept; I found a bundle, containing this tin box, containing a ring, a brooch, a chain, and a duplicate for a silver watch, pawned for one pound one shilling, at Mr. Richards's, in Brick-lane; here is also a stone apparently of a seal.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker. The prisoner at the bar came to our house on the 9th of March, in the evening; she purchased a pair of earrings. She pledged the watch for one pound one shilling, and paid five shillings for the ear-rings out of it. She gave me her name as Ann Brown, Brick-lane. I had not known her; I rather think, I had reen she before; but I am not certain; she did not pawn any thing else.</p>

               <p>(Watch produced.)</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. These things are all my property; the part of the gold watch-case is worth four guineas; there is a cornetian stone, with my initials on it it; it belonged to a seal, and the gold of it is gone.</p>

               <p>On the 18th of October the prosecutor called upon me, and I took charge of Fosgate, and I went and searched his lodgings, and in his room I found this silver buckle, which the prosecutor said was his, I found it on the mantle piece concealed with some dirt over it.</p>
               <p>(The buckle deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>I can swear this was among the plate taken out of my shop.</p>
               <p>Newman. At Wilks's lodgings I found nothing, these four tickets were at the bottom of a box that was found at Mr. Royall's, they are price marks of two dozen spoons.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. They are my hand writing.</p>
               <p>Mr. James. Who did the prosecutor give charge of to you? - Of young Fosgate.</p>
               <p>Who do you mean by young Fosgate? - The brother of the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This box is mine, it was in my shop with plate, it was in my possession the Saturday before, and there was a pin in the box very particular that I could swear to, it was in my possession on Saturday.</p>

               <p>I only know of the taking of Wilks this day fortnight at seven at night, I took him at the Rose and French-horn in Wood-street; I found nothing upon him I was not at his lodgings.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Who is there here that proves these things were taken on the prisoners, or delivered up by them? - There is nobody in Court but myself who saw some of the things brought into the Mayor's office at Bath.</p>
               <p>Court. That will not do, we do not know they were taken on the prisoner? - I have a letter from the Mayor at Bath.</p>
               <p>Court. That will not do.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Here is Royall the accomplice.</p>
               <p>Court. That will not do, here is nothing to reach these people at present.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, we are very sorry for it for the sake of public justice, it is a great robbery, but here is a very material gap in the evidence.</p>

               <p>Court to Prisoners. You have had the narrowest escape I have known, and I repeat it to you, if you had been convicted, one of you would have been certainly executed, and the other transported for fourteen years; therefore let this be a very serious warning to you, and bless the humanity of the law; you see your lives are saved by that law you are trampling on every day.</p>

            , I lost the money in his house, the first day of November, it was not taken in the day, but in the night, I lost six guineas, and a half crown; there was ten half guineas, and one guinea, it was all in one apartment, just over the kitchen, it was a ground floor, I lodged in the ground floor, I had my money in my pocket; I went to bed about nine o'clock, I am sure it was in my pocket when I went to bed; the prisoner lodged in one bed with me, I felt him rising at his own side of the bed about twelve or one o'clock, he came round the bed to my side, he took the breeches from under my head, I heard him opening a knife with a strong spring, and I was afraid of my life, he did not touch me indeed, I lay still till just the break of day, when I discovered it to the man of the house; the prisoner stayed till break of day; he came into bed to me just after robbing me; I got up first in the morning, and I discovered it to the man of the house, and he told me he would go and get a constable; it was Sunday morning, I could not get any money to get a constable, and he went off before I came back as I had not any money left to give, I did not think a constable would come, I went out to try to get somebody to get a constable, I went out about six o'clock, I stayed a couple of hours, or thereabouts, I suppose.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever got any of your money again? - I never did, I was looking for him since, and I could not find him till he was taken last Saturday night. I had lodged in this house about five or six months, he lodged there some part of the time; he used to say, when I used to live hard and poorly to save that money, he used to tell me that others would piss it against the wall, he told me that just before he robbed me.</p>

               <p>The prosecutor lives at my house, he hath lodged there better than three quarters<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179301090025"></xptr>of a year, and Ryan lodged there about a quarter of a year to the best of my knowledge, they sleep in a cellar on one bed both of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body else lay in the cellar? - There was the old man and Ryan, that is two, and two more, and my wife and two children, all in the same cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any noise? - About a fortnight before the 1st of November, I was sitting by the fire, and Ryan was with me, where he expressed the words as these, it is a pity that Old Rogue should eat a bit of dry bread, when he has got a purse of gold in his pocket, I will take his breeches one night, and take his money out, and have a bit of fun with him, says he, we will have a bit of fun out of it; on this Saturday night, Ryan went out about eight to go to pay table, he came in about twelve o'clock, I let him in, and came into bed, then afterwards, I did not fall asleep for a long time; about an hour or an hour and half after, I heard a man getting up, and getting the other side where the other man used to sleep, I thought he was troubled with something, I did not take any notice, about six o'clock in the morning, this same old man, that lost his money bawled out, I jumped out of my bed, and asked him, what was the matter? says he, this man that lay by the side of me, has taken away my money, all that I have in the world, and has had his knife over me all of the time, says he, I was afraid of my life, that he would run me through.</p>

               <p>Jury. Was your bed there without a partition? - It was, there were three beds in the room, I jumped out of bed, and says I, what do you bawl for? and the old man went out to get a constable, and as soon as the man was out, Ryan slipped out, and I never set sight of him any more; Ryan went away about a quarter after six, I never saw him till last Saturday, I was ignorant about the law, I did not know whether it would allow me to take hold of the man without a constable.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did I leave your house at six o'clock? - You did, or a little after.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Saturday night I went to pay table, I was kept till eleven o'clock before my master paid us, I stayed out about an hour longer, and I came home about twelve and one, and went to my bed, I went to my bed, and lay there till about six o'clock in the morning, and then the old man said he was robbed, and he goes and gets a book, and they handed it to me, and I took my oath; I stayed there till eight o'clock, I never left about the place till twelve o'clock, when I went to get my dinner then, the next day I was ordered to Battle-bridge, where I have worked ever since, till such time as he came last Saturday night and took me; and Corbutt's wife said, his breeches were cut by a knife before he went to bed. I have no witnesses.</p>
               <p>Jury to Prosecutor. Was the prisoner in the house when you came back again? - He was not.</p>

My wife lay dead, and I had 192 halfpence, the quantity of 8 shillings, and I suppose more, which I locked up; the neighbours contributed and raised it for me, in order to pay the expences of burying my wife; I locked them up in a cupboard, and went to sleep; there were none knew of it but the prisoner at the bar,

            ; when I awoke my cupboard was broke open, my lock lying on the ground, my shuttle, shears, and hat, were taken away; I went in quest of him, and found him with my hat on his head; he had absconded the place from the time the money and things were missing, and my place was his place of abode; he made a great resistance when I took him, I was obliged to buy a cord to confine him.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the house were your things taken from?</p>
               <p>Whalan. The money was taken from out of a corner cupboard, the shuttle and shears out of a chest of drawers, and the hat was in my room.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you miss them?</p>
               <p>Whalan. On the 21st of August last, and I found the hat upon him the 23 d.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. How did you come by that hat; the hat is mine.</p>
               <p>Whalan. First the hat was his hat; my wife was sick, and I had a good hat, and I pledged it to support my wife and children in her illness; he had pawned his hat; and I wanted one to go out about my business, so he desired me to release his hat, which I did; I paid my own money for it, so I think it is my hat till he gives me the money again.</p>

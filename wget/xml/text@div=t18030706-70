             sworn. - On Friday morning the 17th of June, as I was walking in Oxford-street, I was accosted by the prisoner at the bar; he came to me, and made beckons to walk with me; I made motions to him to go away.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he speak to you? - A. No; he still persisted, and I thought he wanted charity; I offered him some halfpence, and he refused them; he walked with me till we came to the corner of Duke-street, Oxford-street; we there met a carpenter with some tools over his back; the carpenter stopped the prisoner at the bar, and I stopped also.</p>

               <p>Q.What caused you to stop? - A. To ask the carpenter if he knew the prisoner at the bar; he said, he did, and he was a carpenter by trade, he pointed to the stars, and then to the ground; I told him I did not want my fortune told.</p>

               <p>Q. What time was this? - A.About half past four in the morning; he made motions as if he was not well, and wanted something to drink; I went in with him to the corner public-house, and called for a quartern of gin, he would not have any beer; I sat down upon the bench; he wanted to come near me, and I said, my friend, I wish you would go on the other side, I don't know any thing of you, and then I gave him a glass of gin; I found myself not very well, and went out at the door, and came back again; I laid my head down on the bench where I fat; he was at a distance from me; I fell asleep, and when I woke, the landlord touched me on the shoulder, and said, you have got sixpence to pay; I paid him the sixpence; I then went to feel for my watch, to see what o'clock it was, I found it was gone.</p>

               <p>Q.When had you seen your watch? - A. I looked at it when I went into the house, to see what o'clock it was.</p>

               <p>Q.You were not very sober I fancy by your own account? - A. Yes, I was perfectly sober; I had taken some saloop in Oxford-street, and it had not agreed with me; then I found I had got a hat upon my head not worth sixpence, and my own was gone; then I gave information at Marlborough-street.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Watson. Q. You had been up all night? - A. No, I had not.</p>

               <p>Q.Had you been at work at all that morning? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q.How many people were there in this public-house? - A.Three besides the prisoner, but there was only him in the box with me; one was a soldier; I have seen the soldier since, and he said he was not there.</p>

               <p>Q.Though you saw him there? - A. Yes.</p>



               <p>Q.What public-house was this? - A.The King and Queen public-house I think it is.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180307060049"></xptr>Q. Is the publican here? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. You did not apprehend the soldier? - A. No.</p>

               <p>JOHN BETTS sworn. - I am a watchman: On the 17th of June, when I went on duty at night, I heard that a man was robbed, and on the 18th my serjeant called me a quarter before five in the morning, to take the prisoner into custody; I found him at the King and Queen, standing in the taproom; I took him from there to the watch-house; I put my hand into his fob, and took out a watch, which the prosecutor swore to at the Justice's. -(Produces it.)</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Watson. Q.Were you on your beat the morning before? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. You did not see the persons at the public-house then? - A.No.</p>

               <p>Q. You could not understand any thing this poor creature said? - A. He made signs, that if I would give him the watch, he would give me something to drink.(The watch was identified by the prosecutor.)</p>

               <p>For the prisoner.</p>

               <p>EVAN VAUGHAN sworn. - Q.What are you? - A. I am in no business; I have known the prisoner nine years.</p>

               <p>Q.During that time has he not had the power of speech? - A. He has not; his brother worked for me, and he for his brother, as a carpenter.</p>

               <p>Q.How did his brother make him assist him? - A. He used to make motions; he understood his motions.</p>

               <p>Q.During that time could he hear at all? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q.Did he ever shew any thing dishonest in the course of that nine years? - A. I never heard any thing dishonest of him.</p>

               <p>Q. What has been his general character as to honesty? - A. He used to be under the guidance of his brother; he could not walk alone; he used to walk with him. <rs id="t18030706-70-verdict387" type="verdictDescription">

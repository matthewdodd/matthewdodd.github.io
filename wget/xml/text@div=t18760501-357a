                  </hi>. I am district medical officer to St. Olave's Union, South<lb></lb>wark—on 7th April I went to the house of Mary Davidson who was being nursed by Mrs. McCarthy—I found a small incised cut on her head about an inch long and a <hi rend="italic">little</hi> behind and above her left ear—erysipelas in the face had set in, and I continued to attend her till the 16th when she died from erysipelas caused by the wound—this teapot would be a likely thing to cause the wound if a blow was struck with it—I did not see the prisoner till after the woman's death—I then said to her "How did you come to strike your mother?—she said "Ido not know that I did, we had a scuffle, we were all drinking together"—the deceased was a very unhealthy woman, I have known her seven or eight years, she was an habitual drunkard and a wound would be more likely to lapse into erysipelas in a person of those habits—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination, the liver and kidneys were very much diseased from drink—a similar cut would not have been dangerous on the head of an healthy person—it might have been produced by a fall on the floor, or against the sharp edge of a chair, a step, or anything short.</p>

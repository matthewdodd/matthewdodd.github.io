                  </hi>. I live at 4, Swan-yard, Whitechapel. I have known the prisoner by living in the same house with her, about four years ago—three families live in the same house with me—the landlord does not live in the house—the prisoner was invited to our house on the 4th of May, for a day's recreation—she was there the whole of the day—she had no money in her possession—I saw a handkerchief and some money drop from her bosom—I saw five sovereigns and a good deal of silver, but what quantity I cannot say—I did not suppose it belonged to me—she put it in the handkerchief, and put it in her bosom again—I did not charge her with it till my wife went to the drawer and missed it—I went to her that evening—she was very insulting and saucy—she had her brother come home afterwards—me and my wife were in danger of our lives, and we came down stairs again—she was taken up between nine and ten o'clock next morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Manners. On Monday, the 4th of May, I put from six to seven sovereigns away in a drawer in a coarse towel—there was a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, as a piece <hi rend="italic">of</hi> waste paper,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184605110053"></xptr>
               <p>lying in one corner—the prisoner did not know whether it was a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note or not, for she could not read—the towel was rolled up the same as this old hand<lb></lb> kerchief, in one corner, and my sovereigns doubled up in the towel and laid in the drawer—I did not lock it—the key was in it—I put it there at eight o'clock in the morning, before the prisoner came—she came about nine—while she was in the room I had occasion to change a sovereign—when I was going to bed that night, I had occasion to look for my night<lb></lb>cap, and laid hold of the cloth and missed my money—my husband got up—the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note was safe—when I was at supper I saw five sovereigns and some silver fall from the prisoner's bosom, and she searched for them with a candle—they were picked up and put back in her handkerchief—I had left the prisoner and her husband in the room where the sovereigns were that afternoon, and her husband and my husband went out together for a short time—my daughter and the prisoner were there when I went out.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the daughter of the last witness, and live at 55, Great Wild-street, Lincoln's-inn. I passed the day in question with my mother—the prisoner was there in the afternoon—my mother went out—the prisoner, her husband, and my father-in-law, were left alone in the room—I left for about a quarter of an hour to seek for my mother—the prisoner was then quite alone in the room—she was sitting next my mother-in-law, who dropped a handkerchief—the prisoner said, "That is my handkerchief"—I said, "I beg your pardon, it is my mother-in-law's, you have your's in your bosom, I saw you make use of it"—I consider she was intoxicated—she put her hand in her bosom, snatched out her handkerchief, when out dropped her money on the floor—she said, "You should not have snatched my handkerchief out of my bosom, Mrs. Clarke"—I said, "I did not do so, I only told you you had it in your bosom"—I helped her pick the money up—five sovereigns and several half-crowns and shillings—she took the candle, said she had not got all her money, and searched about the floor after it—I said to her husband, "You ought to know what money your wife had"—he said, "I don't know, I did not know she had any"—that was in her presence—she said her husband never knew what money she had.</p>

I apprehended the prisoner in High-street, Whitechapel—she sells fruit in the street—I told her what she was charged with, and she said she knew nothing ahout it, the money she dropped on the floor was her own—I took her to the station, and found on her one half-crown, two 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. pieces, and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in copper—I searched the room where she lived—I found two sovereigns and some silver in a box which her</p>

               <p>husband had—when she was asked what she had done with the sovereigns that were on the floor at the house, she said she had twenty sovereigns at home, which she could show.</p>

On the 19th of April, last Friday, I went to see a comrade of mine, between three and four in the afternoon, he was going into the country, on parting he and I agreed to have something to drink, he gave me a bottle to go and fetch something to drink, on my return the prisoner stood at the door of her own apartment, for what I know, <placeName id="t17940430-77-crimeloc412">No. 44, Cable-street</placeName>

I said yes, and she took me into her apartment, it was a lower room, on the ground floor; in the mean time I was pouring out the liquor, she took the opportunity of snatching the handkerchief off my neck, it was tied on my neck, she untied it, and snatched it off my neck.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it silk? - Yes. With that I asked her what right she had to take the handkerchief from me, and she made an abrupt answer, and said, that she knew nothing at all of it; she concealed it; with that she had an acquaintance of her's come in, a young woman, and she asked what we were disputing about? and I said, that that young woman had taken that silk handkerchief off my neck; with that the prisoner replied she would give me the handkerchief, if I gave her some gin? I asked her how much? she said, half a pint, as there are three of us, it could not be less, putting my hand into my pocket, pulling out half a guinea and a shilling, and some halfpence, to pay for the half pint of gin, she took the opportunity to snatch the half guinea out of my hand, and ran back, and concealed herself, and the other slapped the door in my face; with that I applied to a constable, Mr. West.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that you had the half guinea in your hand? - Yes, I had the half guinea, shilling, and some halfpence. The constable not being at home, I was advised to leave it till the next morning, which I did; when I came the next morning, both that prisoner and her acquaintance were in the watch-house, for some misdemeanor, but what I don't know, she was cleared of that, and Mr. West, the constable, took her into custody for my offence, she was examined before the magistrate, at Shadwell, she was not searched in my presence; I have neither got the handkerchief nor the money.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask my prosecutor whether he did not come over to my door as I sat, and told me that he had been along with a woman down Murphy's-alley, and he had been robbed, but he did not tell me of what? - No, no such word.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He told me he would give me a glass of any thing to drink, if I could tell him of any officer, with that he went away, and I never see any more of him till the next morning, between nine and ten o'clock, and when I was in the lock up room at six o'clock at night, he asked me if I would give him five shillings; I asked him for what? he said if I would give him five shillings he would not send me to gaol; he then went away, and brought another man with him, and said, if I would give him five shillings that man should be witness, and he would not hurt a hair of my head; and he asked me if I would give him a glass of any thing to drink? I said no, I had had part of a pint of beer, and would not have any more.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Did you offer to make it up for five shillings? - Never saw the woman after she was committed till now; it is not true what she has said.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober at the time you was there? - I was indeed.</p>

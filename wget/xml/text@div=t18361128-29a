                  </hi>. I keep an eating-house, and live in Great Wind<lb></lb>mill-street, St. James's—the prisoner has been in my service—but left nearly two years ago. On the 10th of November I went to bed about half-past eleven o'clock—I was the last person up—the street door, and all the doors and windows were fast—about five o'clock in the morning an alarm was given, I went down stairs and examined the premises with the policeman who was in the shop—I found the till broken open, and missed about 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in silver, and 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in copper from it—the silver was in 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. parcels—the copper had not been counted—the policeman came in at the street door—I found the door between the shop and passage open—it and only been latched the night before—on the Sunday following the prisoner was sent for to my house—his father came also—his father told him he had better speak the truth, if he had taken the money to confess it.</p>

                  </hi>. I own about four acres of inclosed ground, at Harmonds-worth; it is planted with fruit-trees and vegetables. On March 29th they were safe; on Sunday, 31st, I heard something, went to the garden, and found 131 apple and pear-trees, value about 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., cut down, and pulled up—the prisoner had been in my employ—I discharged him in November last—I had seen him about three weeks before this—I traced footmarks on one side of the trees, and out of my garden into another, and then into a meadow, and up to the prisoner's lodging, 200 or 300 yards from my garden—it is not a public way—I went with England to the prisoner's house—he said, "Mr. Philp has a suspicion that you have been cutting his trees down"—he said he had not, and knew nothing about it—we took him to the garden—England told him to put his foot by the side of the footstep—he did so, and made a mark which exactly corresponded with it—the marks where the trees were cut, corresponded throughout in the same way—England then gave the prisoner back his shoes, and we left—we met sergeant Duggan, and went with him and tried the pri<lb></lb>soner's shoes to the marks in the next garden—they exactly corresponded—there were only the steps of one person—the shoes were then given to the prisoner again.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, of Longford, near Harmondsworth, and know the prisoner. On Thursday, 28th March, I was working with him for Mr. Fletcher—he said Mr. Philp had turned him away, and he would be <hi rend="italic">one</hi> with him before the summer was over—on Saturday evening, the 30th, I was with him at West Drayton between two and three hours—we parted betweeen six and seven o'clock at night at Wyatt's-bridge, about half a mile from Mr. Philp's garden—on Monday morning, between eight and nine, he came to my house, and said, "Have Mr. Philp and Sergeant Duggin been to you?"—I said, "No, but I have seen them"—he asked what I had told them—I said, "I told them the truth, that you left me at Wyatt's-bridge, and I came here to my home"—he said, "They will be sure to think it was me now."</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Longford; the prisoner lodged with me. On Saturday night, 30th March, about ten minutes to ten o'clock, I was in bed in the adjoining room to the prisoner's—I heard footsteps go from his room and down stairs—I then heard the rattling of the door fastenings, as if they were being undone—in about two minutes the steps came up-stairs again—they remained in the room about a minute and then went down again, went to the door, and I heard them walk towards the high road, in the direct road to Philp's garden—my son, aged eighteen, sleeps down-stairs; it was not him—I afterwards saw the prisoner's shoes fitted into one track over the wall of my back garden—they fitted exactly, as far as my judgment goes—the steps</p>

On Sunday, 31st March, I went with Mr. Philp to his garden, and saw several trees cut down, and the foot-marks of one person only—I traced them into the adjoining garden, and from there to the back of where the prisoner lived—I went there and asked him if he would accompany me to Mr. Philp's garden, as he suspected he was the person who had wilfully destroyed his, trees—he said "Yes," and went with me—he had the shoes on to the gate, and I fetched another pair for him; he changed them before he went into the garden, but I noticed the marks the first pair he had made, and compared them with the other impres<lb></lb>sions—they corresponded in my judgment.</p>

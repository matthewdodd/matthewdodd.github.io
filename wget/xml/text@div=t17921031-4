               <p>I came from Gloucester to do a job of work for the Margrave of Anspach; I went to him at Hammersmith, and I met my master the Reverend Mr. Fearon; he took me to town to the Old White Horse Cellar, the 16th of last June; I asked for some victuals and a pint of beer, and went out of the Old White Horse Cellar about a quarter before five; coming out at the door I met the prisoner; I never saw him before; I asked him the road to Albemarle-street, he said he was a stranger just come into town, but knew Albemarle-street very well, and in walking down he asked me what countryman I was; he said he was going down there, and we walked together; I told him I was a Gloucestershire man; he asked me if I knew Stroudwater, in Gloucestershire, I told him I did very well; he asked about several other village places which I did not know; he asked me about one Hickman of Gloucester: in walking 200 yards, or not so much, he was on the left hand side of me, there was a fine lady's purse on a step of a gentleman's door; he whipped round me; at that time I saw the purse; he got hold of the purse in his right hand, and slapped it into his waistcoat pocket; then he took me athwart the road, and said, as we are strangers just come into town, God, we have met with a fine prize; he took me to a publick house to have one pint of beer; I do not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179210310006"></xptr>know that landlord's name; a stout lusty man in a blue coat came in, and then the prisoner pulled out the purse, and a note that was in the purse, and mentioned in the note that it was bought of a Mrs. Smith, a jeweller, a locket valued at 135 l. there was a locket in the purse, in a tortoise shell case; he said he had a friend living up higher in the street, and he asked me if I had picked it up would I have given him half? I said I should; he said he would go to his friend and fetch 20 l. and give it to me for my share, and he would take the locket; then we three went to Mr. News, the Crown in Silver-street, there he called for a quart of porter, and went into the parlour, and then he said he would step and fetch the money; the other man said he was a stranger to both of us, he thought he had a right to leave this locket, with him; then the prisoner pulled the purse out of his pocket and gave it to his companion, and went out of the room for the valuation of ten minutes, then returned, saying his friend was not at home; and he asked me what money I had in my pocket, I said I had five or six guineas, I did not know which; I pulled out my purse; I had but five guineas and three shillings; he asked me what sort of a watch I had, I told him it was almost a new one, I had just bought him, and given four guineas and a half for him; I put down the watch on the table with the five guineas, in the mean time the other man spoke to me, and the prisoner took my watch and five guineas off the table and walked off, and I never saw him any more till I came to swear to him.</p>
               <p>Court. Before he took up the watch and the five guineas had you agreed that he was to take the watch and five guineas as part of the bargain? - No, I had no thoughts of his having my watch and money when he when out; the other man then pulled the purse out of his pocket and gave me the locket, and said he would be with me at nine o'clock, at the White Horse Cellar; he walked off, and I never saw him since; I took the locket after the prisoner was gone; nothing was said about his having my watch and money; I did not observe him take it, the other man was on the other side of the table; I saw the prisoner's hand upon the watch and money while I was talking to the other man: I went into the country and was sent for; I never saw him till he was in custody in Bow-street, about three weeks ago, since the 16th of June; I know him again; I never saw my watch and money; I have no doubt but the prisoner is the man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Had you not the locket from me? - No, I had it not till after he was gone off with my watch and money.</p>
               <p>Did you say the locket was left with you as a security? - No, the other man gave me the locket to meet me again at nine o'clock (the locket produced); I did not know what it was till afterwards they said it was a diamond stone.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Does she rent the house too, or you only? - A. Myself; I am the only tenant: On the 17th of February, about six o'clock, I lost a gravy spoon, four table spoons, six tea spoons, two salt spoons, a pair of silver tea tongs, two pounds of tea,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179604060005"></xptr>and a pound of coffee, they were taken from a closet in the drawing-room, there was a mustard pot with them, and that was left behind; I had used them in the afternoon.</p>




               <p>Q. What was the value of the gravy spoon? - A. The silversmith that bought part of them, valued them yesterday at Clerkenwell; it cost me 3l. 5s; and the prisoner came and took lodgings of my sister for his master and mistress; he was footman to a family that visued a gentleman that had a part of our house; he lived with Mrs. Coles of Highgate; I have seen him come with his mistress very frequently, for this year and an half; he dined at our house that day, and said, his master and mistress would come in the evening.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. How late did he continue after dinner? - A. He went for his master and mistress between six and seven, and never returned; our servants set up for them till one in the morning; the next morning, the lock where the plate was, was broke, and I missed the things I have before-named; I gave the information at Bow-street; he was taken by a gentleman he robbed in London-street.</p>
               <p>- DONALDSON sworn.</p>
               <p>I apprehended the prisoner on the 18th of February, in Duke-street, Lincoln's-inn-fields; upon going to Duke-street, with a gentleman of the name of Williams, that had been robbed, I searched him, and found a pair of silver tea tongs, a silver tea spoon, and this parcel of tea, (producing them), twelve guineas and an half, 8s. 6d. in silver, and 4d. in halfpence.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Aldridge. The spoon don't belong to me, the tongs do, and the tea.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How do you know the tea belongs to you? - A. Only from my grocer's having sworn to it.</p>

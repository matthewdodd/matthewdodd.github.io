            . I am a Police-officer. I was informed that the prisoner and another were dragging the truck down Brick-lane, about three-quarters of a mile from the prosecutor's; I stopped them with it, about six o'clock in the evening - the prisoner said he had borrowed it of a man, that he knew his name, but not where he lived, and if I would let him wait ten minutes the owner would come for it - I waited half an hour, and as no owner came I said I must take them to the station-house; I took the prisoner, but the other ran away; I took the prisoner before the Magistrate, but as the owner did not appear he was discharged, and when I found the prosecutor I took him again.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. There was another man with him, and he said he borrowed it? A. Yes; he did not attempt to run away - I could not get hold of the other; I sent a man for the prisoner the second time, and he came to me.</p>

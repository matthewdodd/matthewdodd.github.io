About the 5th of November last I had been out, and when I came home I missed two pair of pumps which I had put out at the door for sale. About a fortnight after came a man from Bridewell, and asked me if I had lost two pair of pumps. I went according to his direction to Justice Welch, there I saw the prisoner: he said I should have them again: he ordered two journey men bakers to go and get the pumps from pawn, that lay one pair in the name of

They came back to the Justice, and told the prisoner the pawn-broker would not deliver them to them, they not being the persons that brought them; but if the Justice would send an order, they would send them. An order was sent, and one of the pawn-brokers came with one pair; they were marked to be sold S S, my mark. I do believe them to be mine. The answer they brought from the other pawn-broker was, there were no shoes pawned in such a name: then I went to the pawn-broker, and asked if he had a pair pawned in the name of

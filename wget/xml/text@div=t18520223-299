                  </hi>. I am a chemist, of Margaret-terrace, Paddington. On 5th Feb. The prisoner came, about half-past 3 o'clock—she asked for 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.-worth of hair-oil, and 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.-worth of Epsom salts—I served her—she gave me a shilling—I gave her 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change, and she went away—she had scarcely got outside the door, when she returned, and said I had given her a bad sixpence—I was not aware that I had a bad sixpence in my possession, but I gave her another sixpence for it—I had left the shilling I had given change for, in the drawer, and the bad sixpence I put into my pocket—the prisoner returned in two or three minutes, and asked for another ounce of salts—she tendered me another shilling—I said, "I have no change; you had better go and ask for two sixpences for the shilling"—she went out, and soon after came in again, with Mr. Gurr; he asked me if I had sent her for change, and he said, "This is a bad shilling"—I said, "It is very strange; she gave me a bad sixpence just now"—I pulled it out, and said, "This is the sixpence"—I looked into the drawer—I had only one shilling there, and I found that to be bad also—I said, "This is bad too"—the pri<lb></lb>soner was given into custody—I gave the bad shilling and the sixpence to the officer.</p>

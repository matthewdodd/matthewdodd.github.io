               <p>I am a harpsichord maker.</p>
               <p>What do you know of the death of Conway? - I was at home. I heard a quarrel in Fetter-lane. I went out of doors, and saw Conway was in the street making a noise. Conway was a <rs id="t17790915-68-viclabel346" type="occupation">hackney coachman</rs>

Conway said to Barker he would fight him, he would go to Gough-square. Barker was in doors; he laughed and said he would smoke his pipe first. Barker laughed at it, and thought it was only fun. Conway was in liquor. They went to Gough-square. I followed them. When they came into <placeName id="t17790915-68-crimeloc347">Gough-square</placeName>

Conway went to Barker, and struck the first blow, and there were several falls, and terrible ones. Conway in general gave the falls, and rolled over Barker; he was the heaviest man. Conway gained the battle; the prisoner gave out.</p>
               <p>Conway had some bad bruises? - Yes; but I did not observe it then.</p>
               <p>When was this? - I cannot say.</p>

               <p>The 13th of July? - Some time thereabouts.</p>
               <p>What day of the week was it? - I cannot say; I came home with Conway as far as his house; I thought he was very well; he asked me to drink; I left him and saw no more of him afterwards; I heard of his death, but never saw him.</p>
               <p>What is the prisoner? - A captain's clerk of a ship.</p>
               <p>Mr. VALENTINE JONES sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a surgeon. I reside at St. Bartholomew's hospital. Conway, the deceased, came to the hospital, about eleven o'clock on Tuesday the 13th of July; I enquired what was the matter; he said he had fallen from the coach, and bruised his arm. I examined his arm, but found no bone broke. I asked him if he had any other bruises; he said none. The next morning I saw him, and asked him if anything else was the matter with him (he being intoxicated the night before); he said no; his wife said he had been fighting. I knew nothing of it. On the Saturday he was seised with a violent fever, and died on the Monday.</p>
               <p>You attended him all the time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you see any other bruises, thought he did not complain? - No; nothing more than his arm; his wife said he had a bruise in his side; he never complained of that to me.</p>
               <p>Now as to your own observation what do you think might occasion the fever? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Did you see any bruise that might cause his death? - No, I think not; his arm was swelled, but not broke.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I was a lodger in the house of the deceased at the time. I came home on the 13th of July, between eight and nine o'clock at night, I went to the window, and took a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177909150074"></xptr> pipe, and smoked. The prisoner came out of his own room into mine; he was disguised in liquor; the deceased's wife called Barker to come down and take his wife's part. It was Conway's house, and Barker and myself lodged there. The prisoner went down stairs, and I followed him. The prisoner stood near the shop-door, and I saw the deceased in the street, with his coat, waistcoat, and shirt off; he came up to the door, and challenged the prisoner to fight several times. I went between them. I thought the deceased would strike him. The prisoner had a pipe in his mouth; he came into the shop. The deceased came into the shop and said, come into Gough-square and fight; he said go, and I will follow you; the deceased went into Gough-square. I went into the square, and found him stripped. The prisoner came into the square; the deceased struck him in the face, and made his mouth bleed; he threw the prisoner several times; the prisoner gave out, and the deceased went away rejoicing, with most of the people who were in the square; the prisoner and I staid behind. When we came to the house the deceased's wife came to me and said O Lord, my husband's arm is broke. We took him to St. Bartholomew's hospital. Mr. Jones said it was not broke, it was only very much bruised. I saw him on the Sunday after, and he seemed out of his mind. I did not see him any more till he was dead. The deceased was troubled with a dropsy, and turned out of St. Thomas's hospital incurable, which occasioned a blackness in his side.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jones. At the time this man was in the ward there was a very bad fever. I have a patient that is bad with the same fever who is delirious, and the prisoner was in the same state. After a person is dead it is very common for the blood to coagulate and appear black, when there is no bruise of any consequence.</p>
               <p>Whether you think the deceased died by a fever occasioned by the bruise of the arm, or a contagious fever? - I cannot positively say, but I should think from the fever that was in the ward.</p>
               <p>He was taken with the fever on the Saturday; on the Friday did the bruise appear likely to occasion such a fever? - No; on the Friday he had very little fever; when I saw him on the Saturday I was surprised to see it.</p>
               <p>Was the fever the sort that are occasioned by bruises? - It was not.</p>

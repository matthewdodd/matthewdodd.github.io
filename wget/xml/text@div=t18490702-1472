I left some property of mine and my sister Ann Flintoff's in the care of Captain Bowker at Green<lb></lb>wich; at his death they came into the care of Captain Moubray, and at the latter end of last year part came into my possession, and I found a box belonging to my sister had been broken open, and a great many things were gone—I had never seen them in it, but I knew it ought to have been full—when the prisoner was taken a month ago she had on this shawl, belonging to me (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I went to the pawnbroker's, and found two crape shawls of mine and a satin dress—I swear to them.</p>

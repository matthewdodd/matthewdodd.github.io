I am a china and glass dealer, of 19, Skinner Street, Somers Town—the prisoner has done odd jobs for me, and knew that I kept my money in a small tin box in a cupboard in my bedroom—on Sunday night, 27th February, the prisoner came up to mo at the corner of Seymour Street, Euston Road, and asked me if I was satisfied that he had not stolen the gas-fittings which had been taken out of the shop, and asked me to let him have a pennyworth of tobacco—I said, "If you want tobacco you had better pay for it"—he said that he had no money—about two hours after<lb></lb>wards I went home, and found my cupboard open, and my money gone—someone had climbed up the shutters, got on the fascia, and gone in at the window—the window was shut at 11 o'clock, and my money, five half-sove<lb></lb>eigns, was safe.</p>

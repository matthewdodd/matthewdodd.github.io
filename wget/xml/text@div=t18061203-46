On the 15th of November he went out under pretence of going to the Bank to draw some money to pay me what he owed; he did not return all the Saturday night, nor until Sunday noon; we took him up, and put him in the watchouse till the magistrate sat, then we returned and broke the door open, and found these articles missing.</p>

               <p>Q. Was she in the lodgings when he was taken up. - A. Not to my knowledge. I cannot exactly say when she left it. When we returned she was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. When you opened the door you found the things gone. - A Yes; the officer looked in the drawer and found a quantity of duplicates; the prisoner at Bow street gave me three duplicates, he said these were the remains of my property.</p>

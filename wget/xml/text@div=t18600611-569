                  </hi>. I am the wife of Edward Palin of Cross-street, Charlton—on Saturday evening, 27th April, my eon Thomas brought the prisoner home with him; he was a stranger to me—he came again on Sunday about 11, and stopped and dined—my son showed him two concertinas which were there—he left with my son after dinner, and came back by himself about 6 o'clock, and said that he wanted one of the concertinas, the highest noted one—I was up stairs, heard all he said, and came down—my youngest son said "Do you know which it is?"—he said, "Get them out and I will tell you"—Edward said, "Did my brother <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> tell you where to get it"—he said, "Oh yes, it is all right between your brother <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> and me, I am going to have one and my mate is going to have the other"—he went away with it, and in about ten minutes came for the second concertina—I said, "<hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> said he would not sell it; did my son <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> say you were to have it?"—he said, "Yes, it is all right; my first lieutenant is at the corner by the public-house; he is going to give me 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the concertina, and I will give Tom 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and keep 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for selling it"—I said, "Very well," and let him have it, believing his statement—my son came home about an hour afterwards and I mentioned what had taken place to him.</p>

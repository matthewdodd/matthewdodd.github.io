I am of both trades; I served my time to them, and am a freeman of the city of London; my shop is the corner of Eyre-street, in Leather-lane, part comes into Summer-street, and part into Eyre-street; our house was broke open and we lost the things mentioned in the indictment. By information given by my nephew. I had reason to suspect the prisoner Mealing had the goods. I was at the prisoner's house several times; I made a minute of the times I was with the prisoner. My nephew told me they went to Mailling's the night before the burglary, and bought the instruments to break the house open with, and that they were sold to Mailling; I went to Mailling's house with Dinmore the constable; and Mailling confessed that he bought the goods for a guinea of

He acknowledged that he knew they were stolen from No. 13. but that he did not know that it was my house; he acknowledged the same thing to me the next day, and promised me to return the patterns; he made these promised me to return the patterns; he made these promises five different times. I was willing to make up the matter on receiving my goods; but finding he did not keep his promise, but put me off from time to time from the month of March to the month of May; I at last got an indictment against him. The patterns were fairly worth 100 l. and if melted down would be worth three or four pounds. The prisoner acknowledged not only that he had received the patterns, but that he had received the other goods mentioned in the indictment.</p>

               <p>What is Mealing's trade? - I look upon him to be an infamous man, a buyer of stolen goods.</p>

               <p>This man keeps a good house does he not? - He appears to keep a house there.</p>
               <p>He deals in old iron? - Yes, I believe him to deal in stolen goods; I have made it my chief study to watch him day and night.</p>
               <p>Perhaps you knew? - Not before this affair.</p>
               <p>Did you know him before you went to America? - I did not.</p>
               <p>This man was free in confessions, he made no secret of it to you or any body else? - Possibly he might; if he had been an honest man he would have done it at first; my opinion is he is as great a rogue as any existing; if it were not for such men as he very<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177909150069"></xptr> few I believe would come to an ignominious death.</p>
               <p>You have been at America I believe? - When my lord judge pleases to ask me I will solve it. I have nothing more worth your hearing.</p>
               <p>You have been at America? - I will not solve you; I have never been there for any thing that is bad; if my lord judge will ask me I will solve him.</p>
               <p>You say the gentleman in black that is by me came and offered you forty pounds, was it not you that offered him forty pounds? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Did not he tell you he sent for you to go before the justice, and that the justice would not take bail without you? - No. Would not take bail! I do not know your meaning.</p>

               <p>"I am come from the justice and he desires you will attend, for he will not take bail for the man without you are present?" - Not to my remembrance.</p>
               <p>You did not offer him forty pounds? - No, it was beneath me.</p>
               <p>Did not you make an appointment to attend at six o'clock? - It was between eleven and one, I was casting; I said I could not attend then; I told him I should be done casting at six o'clock; he said his watch was with the Horse Guards, as true as the sun; that he would be there at six.</p>
               <p>Do you know one Bartum? - Give me your reason for asking that question; I will not answer that question, it is not a fair question. I do not owe Bartum a farthing; I do know him.</p>

He asked Walker where they came from; Walker said out of Eyre-street. Walker said I hope you will keep them safe, as Penticross is a man that knows things, and this is his nephew; I am afraid we shall come into trouble. He told him where they came from in my hearing. He was an older acquaintance of Mealing's and could converse with him better than I could.</p>
               <p>Where did he put the things? - They were on the counter when we came away.</p>
               <p>Have you had any conversation with Mailling since? - No, only at the Castle and Falcon in St. John's-street; he said to me, now you have confessed the robbery you shall be hanged.</p>
               <p>Did Walker tell him they were stolen? - He knew the place was to be robbed before it was robbed; the tools to break open the house were bought of him; he made some old keys at the time; the tools were straight, and he made them red hot and bentthem, fit to break the house open; I was present at the time.</p>

               <p>When you was taken up did you tell the constable you sold these things to Mailling? - Dinmore said, Stumpy, where are these things fenced? I said they were at Mailling's.</p>
               <p>Did not you say the property was left at Walker's, under the bed? - No, I said the bags were there; the property was at Mailling's.</p>

            ; he said to Dinmore, I cannot see this Mailling, he will not come near me; and he desired him to frighten him, and said if he could get thirty pounds he and his partner would have twenty pounds, and he should have the other ten. One night, prior to that, he sent for me and asked me if I had seen Dinmore, and told me if I saw him to tell him to let Mailling know he had indicted him, and desired him to come to him and settle the matter.</p>

             was present; I went to Penticross; when I knocked, he opened the door himself; he was in a hurry, and asked me to come in; I saw a publick-house opposite, and asked him to go over the way, that I wanted to speak to him; he said he was melting, if I would go down stairs it would be the same. The partners were there together; he said he supposed I was come about Mailling's affair; he said there was no occasion to go on in that nonsensical affair; that he need not be afraid to come to him, that he would settle it; I told him he could not do that now there was this indictment hung over his head, that that was not my business, if he would meet me at Mr. Blackborough's his time should be my time; he showed me several patterns, and said they were of great value; I asked what value; he said fifty pounds, and if he would pay him forty-seven pounds he would settle it.</p>
               <p>Did you offer him forty pounds to settle it? - Not a halfpenny.</p>

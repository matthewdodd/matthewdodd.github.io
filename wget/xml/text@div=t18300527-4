            . I am an officer of High-street, Marylebone. On Thursday, the 22nd of April, at a quarter to six o'clock, I saw the prisoner in Salisbury-street, near Lisson-grove, about one hundred and fifty yards before me; I think he caught sight of me as soon as I did him, for he kept turning his head round to look at me, and as soon as I believe he convinced himself it was me, he turned down Little Exeter-street, and ran as hard as he could - I ran down Earl-street; both streets lead into Exeter-street; he turned to the right at the end, and I to the left, and met him; I asked what made him run when he saw me - he said he thought I was going to beat him; I asked if I had ever beat him - he said No; I searched his right-hand coat pocket, and found this flute in it, and in his left-hand waistcoat pocket this snuff-box, and inside the box this brooch; I asked how he came in possession of them - he said the flute was his father's, and he had brought it from home; I asked how he accounted for the snuff-box - he said he bought it in Marylebone-lane, and gave 1s. 6d. for it, and the brooch he bought of a boy who works on the dust-heap, and gave him 2d. for it- I then locked him up; I had no information of this robbery at the time, but took him to the office on suspicion that evening - he was examined, but the prosecutor did not appear till the Tuesday, as he was remanded till then.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then he did not see him for five days? A. It was Tuesday - the robbery was on the 22nd; I stopped him at a quarter to six o'clock in the afternoon - there were two boys in his company when I met him in Exeter-street, after he had run away - I saw nobody with him when I first saw him, but there might be; I saw nobody else running away - he was not running when I met and stopped him; I found no knife or housebreaking implements on him - a pane of glass could be broken without a knife.</p>
               <p>THOMAS JOHNSON. If the glass was broken and pulled out I have no doubt the putty and all would come out together, as it is a new house; any one might have pulled it out - it had been put in about twelve months; I call that new putty - this property is mine: here is the box the flute, and brooch.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The sixteen handkerchiefs are not found? A. No; I have seen the prisoner about the neighbourhood - his father is a razor grinder: I know the flute by having it in my hands many times and the maker's name; the glass is out of the brooch in the centre.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going across the green about four o'clock; there were a lot of boys playing at spy boy - I asked if I might play; they said Yes - I was going along, and went into the carcase of a house; several more went in - a boy pulled out these things; I said,"Let us look at them;" he said, "You may keep them," and I went home with them; a lot of boys looked at them besides me.[Thursday, May 27.] <rs id="t18300527-4-verdict32" type="verdictDescription">

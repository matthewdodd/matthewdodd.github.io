                  </hi>. I am a costermonger, of 9, Turk's Road, Chelses—on Saturday, 24th February, I was passing by the corner of Commercial Road, coming towards home—I saw a mob of people; the prisoner was among them, he had his guernsey off, and was going to fight with some other man—I said to him "Don't fight, I think you are the worse for drink"—he turned round and said "You have nothing at all to do with me"—he shoved me and I shoved him, a constable came up and separated us, and he and the chaps he was with went away—I went on about 150 yards, and saw him standing in-the middle of the mob—I stood looking at him; I had hardly time to do so before he rushed at me and struck me in the breast as if he was going to punch me—I did not see any<lb></lb>thing in his hand—I felt the blow, and cried out "He has stabbed me"—I went to the station-house and then to the hospital—I felt the knife go out of me—I have on the same guernsey now; there is the hole in it, and in the waistcoat also.</p>

I live at 9, Marlborough Street, Chelsea-—about half-past 12 on the night of 24th February I saw the prisoner and prosecutor fighting—they were closing on one another and fell to the ground—a policeman came up and separated them—I saw them five or six minutes afterwards and saw the prisoner strike Exall in the breast, who cried out that he was stabbed—I saw the knife hanging from the prisoner's lanyard and swinging in front of him—I broke it off and produce it—it was open—the prisoner was very drunk.</p>

I am a brazier, of 10, Park Place, Chelsea—on Sunday morning, 24th, I saw the prisoner and prosecutor having a struggle—the constable separated them—I went across the road along with Exall and five or six others, about 150 yards, and I saw the prisoner turn on Exall and put up his hands as if to fight, and I saw him strike Exall in the left breast as I thought with his fist—Exall said "I am stabbed"—I saw something in the prisoner's hand—I closed with him and called on Simmonds, who came and took the knife away from him—I took Exall to St. George's Hospital—the prisoner was very drunk.</p>

               <p>were fighting—amongst them were Exall and the prisoner—I sepa<lb></lb>rated them and dispersed the mob—in about five minutes I heard a man exclaim "I am stabbed"—on running to the spot I found Exall holding his hand to his left breast—he said he had been stabbed by a sailor—the prisoner was there—I saw nothing in his hand—Simmonds handed me this knife—it was closed—the prisoner said "It was a return blow, Exall struck me first"—he was drunk—Exall is a drunken, disorderly character—he has been convicted several times.</p>

                  </hi>. I was house-surgeon at St. George's Hospital when Exall was brought there on the morning of the 24th—I examined him—he was suffering from an incised wound about an inch long over the left breast—it was in a dangerous place, and if it had been deeper it would have been very dangerous—I did not probe it much—he was rather faint from the shock—he was in the hospital six days; when he was discharged the wound was all but healed and he seemed in good health—a knife like this would be likely to inflict such a wound.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I was going home on Saturday night about half-past 12. I met another sailor. There were a lot of chaps standing in the King's Road. They stopped me. They saw I was top-heavy. They began insulting me and pulling me about. Exall pulled me about. We fell in the road, and that is all I remember about it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Defended</hi>. <hi rend="smallCaps">HENRY NETTLETON</hi>. I am a driver in the Royal Artillery, Woolwich—on Saturday, 16th November, about 8 p.m. I saw the prisoner in a public-house in Woolwich; we had some beer, and I asked her to take me home with her—she took me to her house in Punch Bowl Alley about 10 o'clock, where I remained with her about 10 minutes, for which I paid her 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; we then went back to the public-house, where we stopped* half an hour, and I paid for a drink of ale—I had then in my purse in my jacket pocket better than 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there were four half-sovereigns, and the rest in silver, but I did not take my purse out the second time I went to the public-house—I paid with money from my trousers pocket—I then said I would stop the night with her, and we got back to her house* about 10.30—after we had been there a short time I gave her 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from my trousers pocket to fetch some rum, and while she was away I took the rest of my money out of my trousers pocket, put it into my purse, and counted it—there were four half-sovereigns and the rest in silver and 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in coppers—I took my jacket off while she was away and put it loose on a chair—we got into bed and stopped there half an hour or an hour, when she said she would go out and fetch some <hi rend="italic">shandy gaff</hi>—I was undressed—I asked her if she wanted the money, she said "No," she had got some, and she got up, dressed herself, and as she went out she knocked my trousers down, and two or three coppers fell from them on to the floor—I was a little bit <hi rend="italic">jealous</hi> at seeing the money fall out of my pocket, and got up after she had gone and looked in my jacket pocket, and my other money was not there—I got dressed to go out but found I was locked in—two men then opened the door, who swore at me, asked what I was doing there, and ordered me out of the house—they did nothing to me—they opened the door and drove me out—I could not find the prisoner and told Stewart and another policeman.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. The public-house is in Warwick Street—I had been out from barracks on leave all the evening—I had about three pints of beer with the prisoner—I did not take off my jacket the first time I went to her house—I said before the Magistrate "I said I would give her 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for beer to stay there the night, and I did not go out to the Warwick after that," that is correct—I did not go to the Warwick after I went to her house to</p>

               <p>stop the night—I did not go to stop the night the first time I went—when I went back to the Warwick I drank some <hi rend="italic">shandy gaff</hi>—I never took my purse out in the public-house—having had the beer I did not drink the rum she brought to the house, I only just put my lips to it—I gave her the 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it from my trousers pocket, and from my purse—up to that time I had not taken my purse out at all, not to give her anything out of it—I do not remember saying before the Magistrate "I had taken the purse out when in the house, and gave her 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to get some beer with," I said "rum;" I never gave her anything when she went for the beer—I do not remember much about it—there was no light in the room when she went out for the <hi rend="italic">shandy gaff</hi>, it had been put out when we got into bed, but I lit it after she went out—I was quite sober, I had not been to sleep at all—I have not seen my purse or money since.</p>

About 11.30 on this Saturday night Nettleton spoke to me—I went to the prisoner's house and said to her "I shall take you into custody on suspicion of robbing an Artilleryman"—she said "I have not had any Artilleryman home with me to-night"—on the way to the station she said "I took two Artillerymen home, and I had 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., one gave me 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—she said that without my saying anything to her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi> I told her that there was 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the purse—when I went to her house it was locked—I apprehended her on the Sunday morning a little after 1—I said before the Magistrate that the prosecutor came and said that a woman he described had not returned with his money—I could not tell that he had had any drink at all.</p>

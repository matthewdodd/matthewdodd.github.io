Last Monday morning, I was called up by the police between 3 and 4 o'clock—I. got up, and found the yard door open, and the kitchen window forced up—this bowl, which contained silver, was put on the counter, and this till was outside the bar—I missed some coppers, and 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of silver—I was the last person up the night before—I went to bed about 1 o'clock—the kitchen window was then secured by a bolt, and the yard door was shut and fastened—a person could get in by forcing up the window.</p>

I was called up by the police at five minutes past 4 o'clock last Sunday morning—I went into my kitchen, and found the back door bolted; it had not been bolted when I went to bed—I went up stairs, and found the prisoner in the top room—I did not know him before—Iasked him what he came there for; he said, "I followed a man from Lime-house gas works," but what else he said I do not know, as I was in a fright, and shivering—the police came and took him.</p>

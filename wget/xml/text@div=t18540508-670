                  </hi>. I am an ostler, at the Green Gate, Plaistow. On 22nd March, I left two pairs of trowsers, a waistcoat, two handkerchiefs, a watch, and some money, in my bedroom—my money was in a carpet bag, and so were most of these things—the coat and trowsers were in the press—I saw them all right on Wednesday night, 22nd, at half past 11 o'clock—I was called in on Friday night, the 24th—my carpet bag was empty, and some things were strewn about—I gave information to the police two or three minutes after—in the afternoon, part of the same day, 24th, I had noticed the prisoners at the house—that was long before the servant called me to my room—I had not seen them for some time—those things (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are mine—they are the things I missed.</p>

I am a dealer in second hand clothing—those things was brought to me on the 25th, early in the morning, by Dore—he was accompanied by the other, but he had nothing to do with it—he stayed at the door—I asked why he wished to sell his things, and he said he did not want them, he was about to go to Portsmouth—I asked his name and his residence, and he stated to me that his name was Carthy, that he came from Deptford Broadway, No. 69, Queen's place—I entered it in the book—I asked him what he wanted for those clothes, he said, "Eight shillings," and I gave him eight shillings—a few days after, Metcalfe came and asked if I had bought such things, and I referred to the book—the two pri<lb></lb>soners were in my sight five minutes—it might be ten minutes—they are the parties.</p>

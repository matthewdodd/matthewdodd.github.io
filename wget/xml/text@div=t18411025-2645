                  </hi>. I am a green-grocer, and live in Strutton-ground; I have a partner. The prisoners lodged in my house—I used to keep my money in a closet in my bed-chamber—I missed some of it—in conse<lb></lb>quence of that I packed up eight packets of pence, containing 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth in each—I marked one penny in each packet, and put them on the shelves in the closet, at half-past seven o'clock in the morning of the 2nd of October—I went there about half-past eleven or twelve, and four of the packets were gone—the cupboard was locked—I watched Johnson out on the Sunday morning, and stopped her, about twenty yards off—I called a constable—he found on her 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2 1/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper—one piece had my mark on it—I searched Pearson's room, about half-past four the same afternoon, and found 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of penny-pieces there, on a cross piece of the bed-stead, under two gowns, and one was a very conspicuous penny-piece, which I had tied up—Pearson returned home about eight o'clock in the evening—she said the coppers found in her room were not hers, and that when she left she had not any coppers—there were two other persons in the room.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. Pearson was brought to the station on the evening of the 2nd of October—she said she had no money, and she had sent her daughter to the mangler's without money, and she was afraid she would not get the things.</p>

I then went to work, leaving my niece in my room; her husband came to her; he had some money, and she gave the child 6rf. to get the things from the mangle, and to buy some cotton.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I believe he boarded and lodged with you? A. Yes - I allowed him 5s. a week besides; he was to find his clothes and washing - I never charged him with being deficient in his accounts, and afterwards found I was mistaken; I once gave him time to pay a sovereign, which he said he had lost - he never paid me money in advance for customers; I did not promise to give him time to make up these sums - he was apprehended on the 2nd of March; I settled with him on the 1st of March - I call over from the book the names of persons he has been to, and he states what he has received; when he came home on the 14th of February he said Mrs. Jones could not pay.</p>

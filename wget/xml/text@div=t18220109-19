            . I am a boot-closer, and live in Golden-lane. The prisoner was my apprentice - I was before the Magistrate on the 17th; the prosecutor said the robbery was about dusk, on Wednesday - he was with me from two o'clock till nine that night, working by my side. I know it, because he asked for leave of absence on that day, and I could not grant it, as I had particular work for him. I do not know that I stated this to the Magistrate - I recollected it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How came you not to tell the Magistrate so - A. The business was hastily done. I had it ready to speak, but did not - I ought to have mentioned it.</p>

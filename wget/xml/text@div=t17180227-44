That being sent for to view the Deceas'd he found the Wound was 7 Inches deep and a quarter of an Inch broad; that it penetrated into the Left Lobe of his Lungs and into the Heart, and was satisfied it was the Cause of his Death, and that the Wound was not given with a hollow Blade, but with such a Sword as was produced in Court, and sworn to be the Prisoner's.</p>
               <p>The Marquess when he came to make his Defence, having an Interpreter allow'd him (who was sworn for that purpose) pleaded total Innocence as to the Murder of John Niccalo, saying, he had no Ill-will against him, nor had any Cause; and if he had, he had another way of punishing him, which was by Martial Law, he being his Servant and a Soldier of his own Troop. He then owned they did go out together in the Morning; that they went to the other side of the Water, and coming back in the Evening went to a Tavern near Lincolns Inn Fields and supped, about 8 of the Clock; that they went away together, and Niccalo went along with him as far as home, and asked him at the Door to let him step some where and he would return presently, so he went to bed without Niccalo's putting him to bed, and never saw him since. Being ask'd by the Court, why he told the Maid that Niccalo put him to bed? He denied he ever said so. Being ask'd by the Court how he came to go so suddenly to bed without Attendance, Light, Fire, or his Bed made? He answer'd there was a Fire that gave him Light, and that the Bed was made. Tho' the Maid being examined again as to that Matter, she swore the Bed wasnot made, nor was there any Fire that gave any manner of Light. But at last he grew unsatisfied with his Interpreter, affronting him, so that he frequently desired the Court to excuse him from the Office, saying, that he did not like him because he did not make an Appearance great enough for him. But the Court being very well satisfied with his Capacity for the Office, thought it needless to do, till at last by the unhandsome Carriage of the Prisoner, and the frequent Request of the Gentleman who they had appointed to be his Interpreter, they did condescend to gratify them both, and prevailed with a Worthy Justice of the Peace to humour the Marquess so far as to be his Interpreter, with whom he seemed to be a little better pleased, and made the Defence following. That had he not been innocent of the Murther of Niccalo, he would not have staid to be taken, for that his Sister the Dutchess of Shrewsbury sent him 50 Guineas and some Jewels to have made his Escape, and added, that when he and his Man came from the other side of the Water they went to the Tavern in Lincolns Inn Fields, and that there he sent out for some Gentlewomen, and that he went along with them in a Coach, and being about half way his Man Niccalo desired him to let him go somewhere and he gave him leave, and he never saw him since. And some other Questions being put to him by the Court, he said he did not know what became of his Man; for the People of the Tavern in Lincolns Inn Fields well knew that his Man Niccalo was enquired for there, and went away, and they knew better what became of him than he did. And thus he contradicted himself three or four several times. At last he would have and his Tryal put off, saying, he had not had time enough to produce Evidences, but was answered by the Court he had sufficient Notice, having been committed fourteen Days, and that he himself had desired the Court by Mr. Lorrain that his Tryal might be brought on at that time. Upon the whole. his Defence being trifling and contradictious, the Jury considering the matter, brought him in <rs id="t17180227-44-verdict231" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Q. Did you apply to the prisoner first, or she to you - A. I enquired for a lodging, she offered to be my companion; and I being a single man had no objection. We went to the house and she called to this man to light us into the room; he brought the light, unlocked the door and let me in the room, he padlocked it after I was in; then I thought I was safe; I pulled my clothes off and went to bed and she along with me; I fell asleep; when I awoke I missed her.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was that after you went to bed - A. About half an hour; I put my hand out for my clothes, they were gone; I rushed to the door and the door was locked; in about ten minutes this man brought me a light and let me out of the room; I then found my clothes at the foot of the bed, they were removed from the upper part end of the bed to the foot; my silver watch was taken away, two shillings and my pocket handkerchief; I dressed myself, went out, and got a constable and took the young woman to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the young woman before you went out of the house - A. Yes, she was stopped in the gallery of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen the watch since - A. No, nor none of my property.</p>
               <p>Q. Then all that you know of the man is that he unlocked the door to let you in - and locked you in - and when you gave the alarm he unlocked it - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in liquor. - A. No, I had only a pint of beer and a pennyworth of bread and cheese.</p>

            . I am a patrol. On the morning of the 5th of June, as I was going on my duty in Dyot street; this man came up to me and told me he had been robbed; I went up stairs and took the woman in custody; this man endeavoured to make his escape by running down stairs; I ordered the watchman to let nobody go down till we had made a bit of a search; I took the woman to the watchhouse; I went back to take the man, he was gone; I waited for an hour and a half, he came back with a bottle of gin; then I took him in custody; nothing was found on either of them.</p>
               <p>Berry's Defence. I am certain he had not a watch, nor any thing of the kind, only a half crown; he gave sixpence for the room, and two shillings to me; he had not a watch nor a handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Hambridge said nothing in his defence.</p>

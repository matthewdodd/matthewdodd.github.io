I am a stockbroker, of 3, Craven Street, Strand—my chambers are on the third floor; two rooms—I shall have been there 14 years in August—I had two portmanteaus in the office, one was full of my property, linen and wearing apparel, the other was empty—the door was locked—the key was usually kept in my room on the mantelpiece—I was in the room about three weeks previous to the 19th of March, and saw the portmanteau there, but did not open them—the contents were worth about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I also had some black boxes in the attic containing household linen to the value of 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on Friday, the 19th March, in consequence of what the housekeeper said to me, I went to the attic, about 7 p.m.; I found the two portmanteaus had been taken, away as well as a portion of the contents of one of the boxes, and the whole of the contents of the other—both boxes were burst open—the attic door was unlocked and opened—I also had a packing-case on the third-floor, on the landing outside my room—it contained cotta ornaments and other articles to the value of 20/.; that was gone—I saw it safe on the landing that morning; it had been there a Jong time—I had packed it myself—I left the house that morning about 10.30—I locked my rooms, and took the key, so that the key of the attic was locked my room—the housekeeper has also a key to my room—my total loss was</p>

                  </hi>. I am housekeeper at No. 3, Craven Street, Strand—I-am the wife of John Wright—Foghill occupied two rooms on the second floor for about five months—he was a general merchant—Mr. Lawrence had rooms on the third floor, also property locked up in the attic—on 19th March I saw the packing-case on the third-floor lobby, about 3.45—it was in its usual place—I also saw the portmanteaus and the black boxes safe that afternoon—I went through the attic to shake some carpets—I took the key from Mr. Lawrence's room—I locked the door of the attic, and took the key back—I first missed the case from the landing about 5.30—in the meantime I had been down in the basement doing my work—my own rooms are downstairs—I noticed that a carpet broom which I had left on the stairs above Mr. Lawrence's room had been removed; I then tried the attic door, and found it unlocked; I went in; I missed the portmanteaus, and saw that the boxes had been forced open—I had not seen the prisoner that day—he came to his rooms at all hours—he had no usual hour—I went in his room as I came downstairs at 3.45—his letters were then on the table unopened, and as I had placed them in the morning—when I missed the things I again went into his room—one of the letters had gone—I saw a key hang<lb></lb>ing in the prisoner's room by the cupboard—I did not know whose key it was; I afterwards tried it to the attic door; it would lock and! unlock it—the attic was not occupied—I had an empty box in it—I had seen the key hanging in the prisoner's room nearly as long as he had been there—I had not delivered it to him—I cannot explain how the things were taken away—I could hear in my rooms downstairs, people going up and down—I assumed they were going to the offices—the case was about 1 1/2 feet by 1 foot in size—I do not think one person could carry it.</p>

I live at 43, Craven Street, Strand—I am employed there—it is nearly opposite No. 3—on the afternoon of Friday the 19th March, I was looking out of the third-floor window at 4.45; I saw a pony and trap at No. 3, a man was sitting in it—I then saw Foghill, with the assistance of Hudson, bring out a packing-case; it was put into the trap, and the man in the trap drove away at a walking pace towards the Embank<lb></lb>ment—I have seen Foghill go in at No. 3—I am sure he was one of the men—the prisoners were dressed in the ordinary way—Foghill walked in an opposite direction to what the trap was going—Hudson seemed to be getting into the trap, but I could not say he got it—I know what a deed-box is—it was not a deed-box—I could see that the packing-case must be resting on something in the trap, but what it was I do not know—I called it a red horse; the trap was polished, not painted—it was a small trap, a kind of dog trap—the case was</p>

                  </hi>. I am a commercial traveller, and live at Brixton—I was in Foghill's service in November and December of last year—I was present when the key was picked up in Craven Street, Strand, by a lady—it was given to me or another gentleman to see if it belonged to anybody in the place—Foghill was not present when it was picked up—I took it to the office and put it on the mantelpiece—it was there all the time I was—it was an ordinary key; I cannot swear to it—it was not rusty—it was taken up once or twice in mistake, but did not fit any door in our office.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. POLAN</hi>. Mr. Goodall was with me when the key was picked up—the lady handed it to him—I have no idea what she said—I saw Mrs. Wright the next day, I believe—I did not take it back to the office till the next morning—I asked Mrs. Wright if it belonged to anybody in the house—I did not notice her answer—I told Foghill the cir<lb></lb>cumstances—I do not recollect what he said—I heard Foghill was in custody—I was subpœnaed at Bow Street, but not called.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The Magistrate said he would commit Foghill, and Mr. Besley said that he would not take up any time.</p>

I knew Mr. Cole, who has been ex<lb></lb>amined—he never showed me a key, nor said he had found one in the street—I never heard of it—there was only one key to this attic and that was in Mr. Lawrence's room—the key was on the mantelpiece first and then hung up afterwards.</p>

Payne. Mr. Poland contended it was against the practice of the Court to allow a prisoner to make a statement when he was defended by Counsel The Court, after consulting Baron Huddleston and the Recorder, ruled to admit Foghill's statement, but stated it ought not to he taken as a precedent.</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">Foghill</hi> then said that he was innocent of the robbery; that he borrowed the trap, which he had previously sold to Mercer; that he met his friend Hudson, who went with him to hie office, where they stayed only about five minutes; that Hudson assisted him to take away his deed box with papers which he wished to take to his solicitor, and that he made other calls; that the key was picked up by Cole, his clerk, or his friend Mr. Waller, and although in the morning he was told of it he paid no attention and it was hung in his room for some time; the housekeeper acknowledged she had seen it hanging there.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Duke of Clarence public-house, at Charing-cross; the prisoner has been in my service; I suspected him, and on the 28th of July, in consequence of something, I called him into my drawing-room when a policeman was present—I said to him I had reason to believe he had been robbing me—he said he had not—I asked if he had any objec-tion to produce his money—he sayl, "Certainly not"—he produced some silver, and put it on the table—I said, "Are you sure that is all?"—he said, "Yes"—I put that question to him again, and he still said that was all—I said, "Have you no gold?"—he made no answer for some time—I again asked, "Have you no gold?"—he said, "I am sure I have not, but if I have any it is up stairs"—the policeman went up stairs, and on hit coming down he said they had searched the room, and could not find any for some time; but just as they were about to leave the room, he saw the prisoner try to throw away a purse, which be produced to me—it con<lb></lb>tained two sovereigns—I said to the prisoner, "To whom does this be<lb></lb>long?"—after a good deal of hesitation, he said, "It belongs to you"—no promise or threat was made—I said, "Where did you get it from?"—he said "I have taken it at different times from your till"—I gave him into custody—I had missed a sovereign in May, and other money since.</p>

The prisoner was in the service before me. I went there between nine and ten o'clock on Saturday night. The family dined out on the Sunday. The prisoner was house-maid; I was cook. She took my things up in the garret after I came. The blue cloth mantle I wore when I came to the place, I took up stairs, and put by the bedside, on a chair. When my things was taken away that was taken away with the rest.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a velvet spencer - A. Yes, and two white dimity petticoats, one new shift made and one unmade, and a cotton gown. I had all those things in the garret. On the Sunday after the family were gone out,

             sent me out to get some porter. I staid about two minutes, and when I came back I went into the kitchen to dinner. The prisoner appeared as if she heard something up stairs; she went up stairs. Presently she called out, cook. I answered, what is the matter. She answered, there is a man gone out with a bundle. I asked her to open the door, to follow the man. She shut the door again, and insisted upon me going up stairs to see what was lost. I went up the stairs, and the first thing I saw was the coverlid of our bed was on the two pair landing, and my things were in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Were all your things in the coverlid - A. All that were left.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there the blue cloth mantle, the spencer, and the things that have been mentioned - A. No, they were gone. Some of the other things were in the coverlid; the petticoats, cotton gown, the new shift made up, were gone; the shift not made was in the coverlid. I suspected the prisoner, and got a search warrant.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the day when the things were taken away - A. On Sunday the 3d of April, I applied for a search warrant on Monday the 4th of April. On Wednesday morning, the constable came with the search warrant and searched the prisoner's box; he got the key of the box from the prisoner, and in the prisoner's box was found my silk handkerchief folded up in her own petticoat; nothing else of mine was in her box; on a shelf by the bedside was found a shift marked in my own name, and under the bed I found the remainder of the articles that I lost; my master then desired I would leave the house, I being a stranger in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. What country girl are you - A. I came from Ireland.</p>

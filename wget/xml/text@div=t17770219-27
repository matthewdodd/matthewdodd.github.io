               <p>I am a peace-officer: upon the 18th of January last I had a warrant against the deceased at the suit of the prisoner, on suspicion of her having robbed him; Mr. Gosler and I took her about six o'clock in the evening, at her lodgings in Berwick-street, Soho; we took her in a coach to justice Blackborrow, in <placeName id="t17770219-27-crimeloc127">Clerkenwell Close</placeName>

               <p>When you saw the deceased after she was dead, did you observe where the wound was? - Just upon her right shoulder; the knife went in at the neck and slanted downwards; the prisoner stood behind her when he gave the stroke; the wound was about an inch wide.</p>
               <p>Did they speak before the justice as if they were angry with one another? - He seemed to speak as if he was angry; she as if she was laughing; she was quite a young woman.</p>
               <p>Was there any man with her at her lodgings? - No; she came in, she had been out to market; an interpreter that could speak English came with her in the coach; he was in the kitchen of the house she lodged at, with the woman of the house; he did not belong to the deceased; the woman of the house desired him to go with her because she could not speak a word of English; this is the knife, (producing a sharp pointed knife, the blade about six inches long) I have had it in my custody ever since.</p>
               <p>How long might it be after you came out of the justice's before the wound was given? - It could not be a minute; after I put the prisoner into the coach I searched him; the sheath of the knife was found the next morning by a gentleman who is present.</p>
               <p>Have you rubbed the blood off? - When I shewed it before the coroner's jury the coroner touched the knife and rubbed some of the blood off; I desired he would not; it was bloodier when I took it up than it is now.</p>

               <p>I went with the deceased, the last witness, and the interpreter to the justice; the prisoner was at the justice's when the deceased was brought there; the prisoner charged the deceased with being accessary to his being robbed and having in her possession in a purse some medals which he would swear to; she was searched before the justice in the prisoner's presence; but the prisoner did not claim any thing that was found upon her; and the justice discharged her; the deceased and Davey went out of the office; I followed them; when I got to the steps the deceased took hold of my arm; the prisoner and deceased had each an interpreter; her interpreter came out behind me; when we had gone about 20 yards, I from behind heard the word sacre; I turned my head and saw the prisoner's hand come upon the deceased's shoulder, and she dropped on her knees giving a shriek; Davey and I endeavoured<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177702190039"></xptr> to help her up, but she dropped again; I quitted her and seizing the prisoner by the collar, called to Davey to assist; and we carried the prisoner to the justice's; there I saw the prisoner was bleeding; I went back and took the deceased to the Oxford Arms; we laid her on a table; she was to all appearance dead; she died almost immediately; the wound was over the right shoulder; it slanted into the collar bone: Davey came to the Oxford Arms and shewed the knife which was bloody.</p>
               <p>You said the prisoner charged her with being accessary to the robbing him; did he charge any body as principal? - No; he said he had been robbed, and he had seen the things he had been robbed of in her possession.</p>
               <p>What is the meaning of the word sacre? - A foreigner on the Jury. It is the same as a curse or damn.</p>

               <p>I am a surgeon: upon Tuesday the 21st of January I was called upon to view the deceased; I did so; in the upper part of the collar bone I found a large wound, and by the direction of my probe I apprehend it penetrated into the cavity of the thorax or breast; I imagine the circulation of the blood was thereby soon stopped, and a suffocation ensued; it certainly had that effect; I compared the instrument with the wound, and it appears to me that is the instrument that caused her death.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt whether the wound was mortal and occasioned her death? - I imagine it was.</p>
               <p>To GOSLER. You say the woman smiled at him before the justice; did it appear that she made use of abusive and scurrilous expressions to him? - No; they both spoke together at one time, but that was soon over; when silence was called.</p>
               <p>Did she say any thing just before she went out? - No.</p>
               <p>What countrywoman was she?</p>

Whether from the manner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177702190040"></xptr> of the woman's behaviour it appeared to you that she did use the prisoner with all that scurrility he suggests? - There was some quick discourse between them at the first, afterwards that subsided, and when the woman was discharged she was going off perfectly quiet.</p>

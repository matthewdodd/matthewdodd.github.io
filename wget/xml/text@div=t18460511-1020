                  </hi>. I am serjeant of G division of police. On the 20th of April, about three o'clock in the afternoon, by direction of the Mint, I went to a house in New-court, Duck-lane, Westminster, with Tate and White, policemen—we were in private clothes—I forced my way into a first-floor front room there, and found a man in the act of casting counterfeit half-crowns—I proceeded to secure him, and handcuff him—whilst so doing, a number of persons assembled in the court, and I saw from the window the prisoner Laurence, throw a brick through the window, which it broke—it hit White on the face, and knocked him down—the window was up, but the brick came through the glass—I found the window open when I got into the room—I called out to Laurence, "I am a police-sergeant, and shall have an opportunity of knowing you another day, young fellow"—I cannot say that I had ever seen him before—there were from eighty to 100 people in the court—I called out that I was a police-sergeant loud enough for them to hear me—I noticed the prisoners Morris and Smith there at that time, and they each threw a brick or stone through the window, one of which struck me on the side, in the room—a great many bricks and stones were thrown into the room the floor was nearly covered—we could scarcely walk on it—from eight to twelve people rushed in at the window, and at the same time others rushed in at the door—there were twenty or thirty there—they overpowered me and the officers after a desperate struggle, and got the man out of our custody—I sprang down stairs alter him, but he escaped with the handcuffs on—I was knocked down at the foot of the stairs, and stunned—I recovered myself shortly after, and went staggering out into the court—as I staggered down the court I received a blow at the back of my head from a brick or stone, which felled me into the kennel—I was stunned—I knew nothing more till I found myself in a baker's shop, bleeding profusely from a wound in my head—I received many kicks and blows when I was knocked down at the foot of the stairs—I was confined to my bed several days from the injuries I received, and am now under medical treatment—Laurence, Morris, and Smith were outside the house when they threw the bricks—I did not notice either of them inside—the mob outside cried out, "Give it to the police, give it to b—Brannan." <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant G</hi> 9.) I accompanied Brannan to New-court.

               <p>aimed a blow at me with his fist—I warded it off with a small crow-bar, and said if he did not stand back I would hit him with it—he immediately stood back in the doorway, and I went up stairs—I assisted Brannan to force the door—we found a man there whom we secured—he had resisted at first, and we put on handcuffs—he was crumbling something under his feet when we went in—it turned out to be chalk or plaster of Paris, as if it had been a mould—there were three chairs with three galvanic batteries, a quantity of plaster of Paris in paper, and a file—a quantity of men rushed in at the door, headed by Davison—I should say a dozen came in at the window—there were about twenty altogether—as many as the room would hold—Davison made a blow at me with his fist, which struck me in the breast, and knocked me over a chair—I do not recollect his saying anything—there was a general noise—we had a desperate fight, and I could not succeed in keeping him—we fought our way out of the room—I and White were fighting among the mob for five minutes after Brannan got out—I can swear to nobody but Davison.</p>

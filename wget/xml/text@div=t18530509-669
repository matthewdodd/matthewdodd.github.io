                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, and live at No. 42, Southwark Bridge-road. On 28th March I called a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> in Cheapside, about 9 o'clock at night—it was by the pavement—I had a parcel and a bag with me—the bag contained two coats, a pair of boots, and other articles—I drove to Southwark Bridge-road, where I was going to reside—I was perfectly sober—the prisoner drove the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I have no hesitation in saying that—immediately after the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> went away I missed the articles stated—I had two boxes on the outside of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—the prisoner took them in doors for me, and I think I assisted him in doing it—when I missed these articles I went in pursuit of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I could not see it, and very soon gave it up—I went to the police station, and I went afterwards to the Hackney Coach-office, in Broad-street—I was on the look-out for the man who drove me till the 1st April, when I was in</p>

               <p>Lothbury, and saw the prisoner on the coach stand—he was at the head of the rank, walking in front of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I recognised him in a moment—directly I spoke to him he drew his upper coat over him, and my coat was on him underneath—when he attempted to hide my coat I told him it was not worth while to do that—I said, "You know whose coat that is; it is mine"—that was the first thing I said to him—I looked at him first—he said, "It is my own"—I said, "It is not worth while for you to tell any untruth about it; you know very well whose coat it is, and where you had it"—he still persisted in saying the coat was his—I spoke to a policeman, who was passing, and gave him in charge for stealing the property left in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—this is my coat, and one that was in my parcel—I saw it taken off the prisoner at the police office—I am quite clear it is mine—I had had it about two years—there are several marks on it—here is one; a piece was taken out to repair it—originally the cuffs were turned over, and that has been cut off, and the pockets are lined with a peculiar kind of stuff.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>, 144). The prisoner was given in my charge on 1st April—he was taken from Lothbury stand—he was wearing this coat—he said he had bought it in Petticoat-lane twelve months before—the prosecutor pointed out the marks on the coat after it was taken off the prisoner—articles that are left in <hi rend="italic">cabs</hi> should be returned to the Excise-office in Broad-street—I searched the prisoner's lodgings at No. 14, Gloucester-street, Curtain-road, in the back room on the first floor, but found nothing relating to this case.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 1, Hare Court, Temple, and am a bar<lb></lb>rister and professor of Hindoo law—on Saturday evening, 25th August, or the morning of the 26th, about half-past two o'clock, I was in Oxford Street, on my way home, and saw a fire—I was anxious to see if it would affect the locality of the British Museum—I turned a little way down Broad Street, and found it was in Museum Street—I stood looking at the fire not many seconds—the crowd appeared rather thinner at one place, in consequence of a plug being drawn—I skirted the crowd, and, seeing an opening a quarter or half a yard wide, I went along it about nine feet, when I found the people in advance of me were stopped, and I thought I had better go back, as the people were rather restless—I had taken my chain off before going into the crowd, and put it into my waistcoat pocket, so as not to offer any attraction to them, and I put my handkerchief in my hat—I had a silk umbrella in my hand, of which this is the handle—I</p>

               <p>turned round and took two steps in retreat, when a man on my right said, "Now then," and seized my umbrella—I saw the prisoner there, but whether he actually seized me I cannot say—one man said, "Give it to the governor"—another said, "Go in, go in"—five or six others advanced to me—the man pulled at my umbrella with great violence, and left the handle in my hand—I found that they were feeling my waistcoat, and said, "That is your game, is it?" and struck blows out, which kept them away about a yard, but somebody came behind me and bonneted me—I turned round, and I believe I hit that man with my left fist—the prisoner then came behind me and gave me a violent blow on my hat, which I should have felt if it had not been for my handkerchief—I turned round and saw the prisoner behind me, and saw 113 F a yard and a half before me—three or four people were trying to prevent him coming—he said, "All right, sir, I see him," and pounced on the prisoner, caught him by the collar, and held him till another constable came—the prisoner said, "Do not take out your truncheon, I will walk quietly"—113 F pushed him out of the crowd and took him to the station—I then missed my emerald shirt pin, which was worth, I should think, considerably more than 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. I had never been there before. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. When the prisoner was asked his address he said that he came from Bethnal Green—his assault might have been simply to get something if he could, and he may not have been joining in a concerted robbery; I should therefore feel very pleased if the verdict was for assault and not robbery—he has pleaded guilty to the assault.</p>

About a quarter to two o'clock on the morning of the fire I was on duty at the end of Museum Street, to keep the crowd back from the fire—I saw Mr. Wood enter the crowd, and five or six men set on him—I distinctly saw the prisoner bonnet him—he was among the other people pushing Mr. Wood backwards and forwards—I made my way through, and he crouched down in the crowd—I seized his collar and called for help, but it was five minutes almost before the other policeman got to me—I was kicked on the leg, and the prisoner bit my thumb when I had him by the collar.</p>

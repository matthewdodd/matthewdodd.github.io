                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Johnson, of Chelsea. On Tuesday evening, the 29th of July, about nine o'clock, I was with my husband at Clark's show, at Battersea fair—the prisoner stood by my side—I felt something fumbling at my pocket, and I saw his hand come out of my pocket with my purse—there were six half-crowns in it—he put it behind him—I called to my husband to hold him whilst I got a policeman.</p>

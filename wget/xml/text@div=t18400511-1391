                  </hi>. I occasionally play the violin at Lawson's, the Hoop and Grapes public-house, in Whitechapel—the prisoner is a fiddler, and is quite blind. On Saturday, the 11th of April, I was at the Grapes between five and six o'clock in the evening—the deceased Richard Fleming was there—the prisoner came in, and was going away again, when Fleming told him he would be a pint to his pint—he then came back, and it was agreed to take a pot between them, but I cannot say which proposed tossing—they were both quite drunk—they tossed up—a dispute arose about it—the prisoner said he had won, and Fleming refused paying—the prisoner went to lay hold of him, but he <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> him away—the prisoner had a dog which was fastened round his body—he unloosed him, and tied him to the leg of the table—he then went to lay hold of Fleming, and Fleming <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> him away—it was not a violent push—he laid hold of him at the corner of his jacket—there was a struggle—they pushed about from one side to the other—there was no blow struck—the deceased fell undermost—the prisoner kept hold of him when he fell—I did not observe whether he fell on him till the last—the prisoner helped him up, and appeared the more powerful man of the two—they did not leave go of each other till the landlord came—there were three falls, and all before the landlord came in, and Fleming was always undermost—the prisoner did not fall on him the second time, but the third time he fell on him with great force—his knees I believe struck him in the lower part of his stomach—that was in falling—I saw no blows or kicks given by either party—there were several tables in the room—I did not see whether they struck against a table—when the prisoner helped him up, he appeared hurt then, having his hand on the</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant at the Hoop and Grapes. I recollect the scuffle between the prisoner and Fleming—I was not there when they tossed up—when I entered the room they stood by the fire very peaceable and quiet, and the boy, who carried the pot of beer in, stood waiting for money—the prisoner undid his dog, and fastened it to the table—Fleming asked the prisoner to pay for the pot of beer, as he had won it fairly, and then he attempted to leave the room—the prisoner felt for the collar of Fleming's coat—Fleming pushed him away—they caught hold of each other, and there was a struggle—I saw no blow struck by either—they fell three times—my master came in at the time of the second fall—the first time they fell on the table, not on the floor—the second time they fell on the floor, and the third time against the corner of the table, both of them together—Fleming went on to the seat, the table turned between them, and from there they both fell on the floor violently—Fleming in falling pulled the prisoner down with him—the prisoner was uppermost, and he fell with his knees on the deceased's stomach, I believe—after Fleming got up from the fall, he complained of being hurt—after that there was no more scuffling, but Fleming attempted to strike the prisoner, and a woman told him not to strike a blind man, that was after they got up from the second fall—they were both drunk.</p>

                  </hi>. I saw the roan on the Tuesday—he was labouring under considerable pain of the abdomen, vomiting continually, with great prostra<lb></lb>tion of the whole system, and symptoms of fever—there was no external injury—I ordered a large number of leeches to the abdomen—in all about 140 or 150 were applied, which slightly reduced the inflammation—on the Thursday a small tumour made its appearance on the groin—it was a hernia—there was some doubt respecting the nature of it at the time, and I performed an operation—the operation itself was a dangerous one—the hernia had been of long standing, but I had not observed the tumour before that day—he died the evening of the day the operation was performed—there was a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination, and I discovered most excessive inflammation of the covering membrane of the bowels, and a rupture of the small bowel, to the extent of three quarters of an inch, from which the contents of the bowel had escaped, and were diffused through the belly—there was the mark of a bruise near the rupture on the intestine—there was effusion, as the result of the inflammation, at various parts—there is a knob opposite the part where I had performed the operation, which was also the result of the inflammation—I have not the slightest doubt the rupture had been caused by external violence; and I suppose the violence was opposite the part itself, the lower part of the abdomen—a fall against a table, or on the ground, would occasion it, or a man falling with his knee against it—any external violence would have produced it—there was no disease of long standing, there was disease the result of the inflammation only—I do not think the rupture in the bowel could be occasioned by anything operating internally, without external violence—I consider the inflammation arising from the rupture was the cause of his death—I have not the slightest doubt of it—I think the operation performed had not the slightest thing to do with his death—I never knew a man who lived so long after a rupture of an in<lb></lb>testine, assuming it to have taken place on the Saturday night—I attribute his living so long to the active treatment he was subjected to, the applica<lb></lb>tion of leeches—I consider it a mortal injury—I suspected it from the first, but could do nothing but what was done.</p>

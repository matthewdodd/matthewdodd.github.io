                  </hi>. I am an engine driver on the London and South Western Railway. On Friday evening, 27th April, I was driving the 5.45 train from Waterloo to Windsor—I stopped at the Feltham station—after leaving there I had proceeded about a quarter of a mile; I had not got</p>

               <p>into full speed—I observed an iron chair on the up line—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was placed on the rail itself—the effect of that might have been to throw a train off the line, or it might not; I cannot say—it would be liable to have done so; it is a very dangerous thing—there would have been an up train in about half an hour—I stopped directly, and sent a man who was at work on the side of the line to remove it.</p>

                  </hi>. On Friday evening, 27th April, I saw the prisoner in a field near the line, minding birds—I saw him there for some time before the arrival of the train—I did not see him on the line at all—he was playing about in the field close to the line—I should say I did not see him nearer than a dozen yards to the line—I afterwards picked up the chair off the line—I had seen the prisoner a dozen yards or more from that place—Dixon beckoned to me, and told me to take the thing off the line, and I did so directly—it lay quite upon the line, with the broken part towards Windsor.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where were you when you were beckoned to by Dixon? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was at work by the side of the line, digging, I should think, 200 or 300 yards from the chair—I should have seen the prisoner if he had gone on the line—there is a regular footpath at that part of the line, a regular thoroughfare for persons—if I had been looking I could have seen any person putting it there—he might have done it without my seeing him.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you see three men go across? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, about half past 5 o'clock—that might be about an hour before Dixon called to me to take this off the line—no up train passed between the time of those three men going across, and Dixon calling to me—I know the prisoner; he lives at Hanworth, about two miles and a half from the place, with his mother and father-in-law—he was employed at bird minding in the field adjoining the line.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of the A division of police, and am employed by the Railway Company. In consequence of something I heard, I went down to the Feltham station on the Saturday—I found the prisoner there—I told him I should take him into custody for placing the chair on the line—he cried, and said, "I am very sorry for it; I beg your pardon; I will never do it any more if you forgive me"—I said I could not forgive him, I must take him into custody—I had not said anything to induce him to state this—I have made inquiries about the boy—he has a father-in-law and a mother—he cannot read or write; he is quite ignorant—he seems a steady, good tempered boy—I brought him to London, and he seemed very good tempered, and a very good disposition—he did not give me any reason for doing this.</p>

On the morning of 28th April, Anderton told me something about the boy—he was brought into my office—I said to him, "Well, my man, what if it?"—he began to cry, and said he would not do so any more—I said, "What have you done?" (I knew at that time what he had done)—he said, "Placed that piece of iron on the rail at Mr. Harris's station," pointing to the iron which was lying on the office floor—I asked him why he did it—he said, "I don't know"—he told me he was working for farmer Harris, and was minding the birds—I communicated to the authorities in town, and the officer came down.</p>

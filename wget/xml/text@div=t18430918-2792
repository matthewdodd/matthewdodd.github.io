I saw the prisoner coming from Richmond-green, towards King-street, with a sack on his back, rather bulky—he went up a court leading to the back of his house—I waited till he came out again, and the sack looked much less—I after<lb></lb>wards communicated with Mr. Drew, and went with young Mr. Drew to the prisoner's house—we there found three lumps of whitening, some ochre, come plaster-of-Paris, three tiles, and one slate, which I produce.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my father, William Drew, as bricklayers and plasterers, at Richmond. The prisoner was in our employ sixteen years, at 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—I found these articles at his house, in different cupboards in the same room—the slate was in a cellar—I did not authorise him to take them—we had things of this description—they are worth 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

            . I am a servant at the Horse Shoe and Magpie. I saw the prosecutor at our house last Wednesday night rather tipsy; the prisoner and another soldier were with him, and they drank together.</p>
               <p>FERDINAND JOHNS. I am a constable. On Friday night last I saw the prisoner intoxicated in the street - I took him into custody, and found this duplicate on him; the prosecutor had given notice of this robbery at our watch-house - he said it was a young man in a military undress.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was at a house in Brownlow-street; I left a quarter before nine o'clock, and came straight down to the barracks - I had not been at that part of Westminster the whole day. On Friday a man in a red jacket came to me and said, "Soldier, I will sell you a bargain;" he took me aside, showed me this watch, and said he would sell it for 1l. - I said I had not 1l., but I would give him 15s. for it, as I was no judge of watches; I had never had one in my life - I bought it, and then, as I had to go on furlough, I pawned it to get the money.</p>
               <p>ROBERT DUFF. I am pay-serjeant of the company to which the prisoner belongs, in the 3rd regiment of Foot Guards - he was present at the roll call in the King's`mews barracks, at nine o'clock on Wednesday night last; he has been above four years in the regiment, and had a good character for honesty.</p>

            . On the 27th of July I was at my stall, in the Evening about a quarter after nine o'clock the prisoner came and pick'd my pocket of 1 s. 6 d. I catch'd his hand in my pocket, he snatch'd his hand away, and I miss'd the money directly; he ran away, no body followed, he came back the same way in about a quarter of an hour; he jostled up to a gentleman near my stall: I said to my husband, that was the person that had pick'd my pocket of 1 s. 6 d. just before; then my husband took him by the collar, and carried him to Mr. Green the Constable, who searched him and found two handkerchiefs on him; he was carried to the Counter that night, and on the Monday carried before the sitting alderman. He would not confess any thing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and keep a boot-shop at 39, Church Street, Woolwich—I employ the prisoner as a boot-maker—on Tuesday, 15th January, I missed a pair of boots which he had made the Saturday before—I had put them on a shelf over the counter; and near the window—a person coming into the shop could take them, but the parlour is close to the shop and there is a window looking in—the pri<lb></lb>soner has not been in the shop to my knowledge.</p>

I could easily find the man, and Mr. Morgan told me he would find the man, but he did not.<hi rend="smallCaps">

             came to my house, he said he came for a tea-pot, I asked him what tea-pot; he said a silver, tea-pot; I asked him who brought the pot, he said a boy left it, commonly called cribbage face; I asked him the reason why he called him cribbage face; he said, because he was pitted with the small pox, which the boy is certainly pitted with the small pox; I asked him the dress the boy was in, he said a brown jacket, which he certainly had on; I asked him if he could describe the nature of the pot; he said, certainly, he could a shopmate of his a polisher, gave the boy the pot, he described the pot very exact.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say whose boy had left it - A. Yes, he said Mr. Stroud's, he said he came from Mr. Stroud as Mr. Stroud's servant, and as he was able to describe the pot so accurately I believed he did come from Mr. Stroud; I asked the reason he came so early for the pot, as it was promised on Monday; he said, that the people came from Mr. Ellis in Oxford-street, and Mr. Ellis's customer would not wait untill Monday for it, and therefore he came from Mr. Stroud for the tea-pot.</p>
               <p>Q. This appeared to you to be a very probable story - A. Yes, and upon which I delivered him the tea-pot in consequence of his story, believing what he said to be true.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181107100054"></xptr>Q. What is the worth of the tea-pot - A. Ten or twelve pounds. The prisoner took the tea-pot away with him. After I delivered their tea-pot, before the prisoner could turn the corner of Monkwell-street, my wife looked out of the window and saw the prisoner, and in consequence of what my wife said, I went up to Mr. Stroud, he lives in Burleigh-street, Exeter Change. I told him what I had done with the tea-pot.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of what Mr. Stroud told you did you look after the man - A. Yes, I did not see the prisoner untill the 6th. I saw him in Featherstone Street, Bunhill Row. I had an officer with me, and took him at a chandler's shop, in Featherstone-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find the pot again - A. No, when the officer called me up stairs I gave charge of him. I told the prisoner that Mr. Stroud had not given him authority to come for the tea-pot; he said he was very sorry, he had known me some years. He did not deny the charge.</p>

On Thursday morning I went up stairs first, the prisoner was in bed when I entered the room. I told him I was coming to take him in charge; I called Edmonds, he came up, and the prisoner said he was sorry for it. Going to the Compter he confessed that he had sold it; I said what have you done with the tea-pot; he said I do not want the people of the house to know. He told me coming along, that a young man had sold the pot to Mrs. Lack, in Long Lane, for five pounds; the man made him drunk and robbed him of the money. He had about two-pence half-penny when I took him.</p>

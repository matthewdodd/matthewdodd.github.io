                  </hi>. I live at 5, Box Street, Bow Common, and am a ship's caulker—on Wednesday, 6th February, I was at the Moor's Arms, Bow Common, with Henry Dean—the prisoner was there—there was some quarrelling about donkey racing—the prisoner said to Dean "I have got you set," and I saw him shove a sharp instrument into him in the lower part of the stomach and run out at the door—Dean said "Oh, he has stabbed me"—I took hold of him and took him to the doctor's, and after<lb></lb>wards to the London Hospital—I afterwards saw him dead.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I went to the Moor's Arms about 7—there were a number of men there—they were all chaffing one another about donkey<lb></lb>racing and drinking—it was about 25 minutes to 12 when the blow was struck—I saw Dean make a bit of a hit at the prisoner—I could not say whether he hit him—that was just as he was shoving the instrument at him—they were all under the influence of drink, but they were as sensible as I am now.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a costermonger, of 19, Eastwood Street, Bow—I was at the Moor's Arms—I was making a match with the prisoner for a race with a donkey for half a sovereign—the deceased was there and joined in the conversation—after that they tossed for beer, and got chaffing and laughing, and the prisoner said "If you don't leave off I will stick a knife in you," and about 20 minutes afterwards he pulled his knife from behind him and ran it into Dean in the lower part of his belly—Dean shoved him in the nose with his open hand as he was pulling out the knife—Dean said, "Oh, I am stabbed," and fell down against the door—the prisoner ran out, I ran after him, and he said "If you don't go away I will serve you the same."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. The conversation about the donkey race was about 7.30—the blow was after 11—we had had a little drop of beer, but we were none the worse for drink—we had a little drop of whisky.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. I saw the knife on two occasions—at first he took it out of his pocket and said "If you don't leave off I will run it into you."</p>

                  </hi>. I was at the Moor's Arms—I saw the prisoner draw some instrument from the right side of his coat or his pocket and take two steps towards Dean, and I saw the flash, as it were, of a knife, and then he turned and ran out at the door.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. He came to the station to give himself up—I have made inquiries about him, and as far as I have ascertained he has borne the character of a quiet, honest, peaceable man—he has a wife and family.</p>

On Thursday, 14th, I was at the station when the prisoner came there—he said he came to give himself up—he heard we were after him and he was tired of his life—I asked him if he knew the serious position he had placed himself in—he said "Don't mention it, it is too great to bear"—I then told him he would be charged with causing the death of Dean by stabbing him—he said "I went to the Moor's Arms with about 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in my pocket—they set on me, Dean striking me on the nose," pointing to a mark there as if from a blow—I asked him where the knife was—he said "I don't remember having one; this is a bad job and I hope you will do the best you can for me."</p>
               <p>

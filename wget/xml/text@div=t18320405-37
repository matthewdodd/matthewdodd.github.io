On the 23rd of March the prisoner came to our house, with a note and a pattern of linen - she said she came from Lady Auckland, of Grosvenor-street, for some more of the same linen as they had last week - I am not aware that they had had any the week before, but in consequence of the note, I sold her the articles stated in the indictment; this is the note - it was in consequence of her producing this that I let her have the things; I did not know that there was such a person as Lady Auckland, but I believed there was, and I dealt with the prisoner as her agent - I did not give her credit; she gave an order for some other goods, to be sent for her ladyship to see the following morning; she said she had been in Lady Auckland's family ever since she was a child of six years old - we have ascertained there is no such person; the goods she had amounted to 14l. odd; I made the bill in the name of Lady Auckland - I gave credit till the following day, when these goods were to be paid for, with some others which were to be sent; the prisoner gave her name as Maria Perry, No. 12, Aldersgate-street - I had suspicion, and sent a person to watch her, and she went to the Grafton Arms, Grafton-street; I found her there the following morning; I met her coming down stairs, and I told her I had ascertained the note was a forgery, as I had been to Lord Auckland's; she said it could not be the case, and she would go with me to Lord Auckland's; I said, "You had better come with me to the Police-station" - I sent for an officer, who took her; she had had all these goods away, but I found them all at the Grafton Arms - I had been there the night before, and they said no such person had been there, but I got up early the next morning, and found her; she had cut up one or two of the articles.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Every thing he states is correct but the name - I said Mary Perry, No. 13, Aldersgate-street.</p>

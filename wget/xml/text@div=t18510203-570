                  </hi>. I am a guard, on the London and North-Western Railway. On 4th Jan. I came with a third-class train from Birmingham—I saw Williams walking on the platform at the Blis<lb></lb>worth station, but I did not see him get into the train—at the Wilsden station I saw the back of a person getting into a carriage—I cannot say who that was—the train stopped about a minute at Wilsden, and then came on to Camden-town where the tickets are taken—I there saw both the prisoners deliver a ticket to William Penson, who collected them—I had received a communication for the man in charge of Wilsden station, and had cautioned Penson—immediately they gave up their tickets I put the ques<lb></lb>tion to the prisoners, and demanded distinctly where they came from, and they both said from Wilsden—I told them I should detain them, and Wil<lb></lb>liams said, "Oh! very well"—I told the collector to get into the carriage and ride down to Euston-square with them—there was not room, and he got into the next compartment, rode to Euston-square, where they were given in charge—at Euston-station they both said they were from Bir<lb></lb>mingham—the fare from Birmingham to Wilsden is 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or thereabouts, from Coventry to London 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and from Wilsden to London 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Williams. Q.</hi> When your attention was called by the station-master to some person having obtained two tickets, did he point out the compart<lb></lb>ment? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I saw a person get in there—I was two carriages off—that was the same in which I afterwards saw you and Brown, No. 61—the person was stooping, in the act of getting in—I cannot say whether he wore a hat or cap—his head was in the carriage—he had a black coat—I could not see his face—I have not seen him again to my knowledge—I will not swear Brown is the man—the ticket-collector went away after col<lb></lb>lecting your tickets—he was not away a minute—it was while I was talk<lb></lb>ing to you—I do not know that when he returned he asked who had come from Wilsden—I do not think he appeared at all doubtful as to who he had received the tickets from—he did not speak to me alter he had taken the tickets till he returned—he only went on collecting the tickets—when he returned he did not ask who had come from Wilsden—it was me who asked.</p>

                  </hi>. I have known Williams between six and seven years—I had some conversation with Williams at Coventry, on the morning of 4th Jan., just previous to the arrival of the third-class train from Birmingham—I have a knowledge of the ticket system—I cannot say that it is invariably the case, but whenever I have been at Rugby every person has produced their ticket—it it a usual thing—I know that Williams has travelled many journeys between Birmingham and Coventry—I do not know whether he has travelled more journeys than any one since Christmas, there are some that go two or three times a day—no person is allowed to leave the platform without having the usual ticket, unless they have a platform pass-ticket—when I have been there, Williams has always given up the proper ticket—he would not be allowed to pass unless he did—I knew him when he was in the Birmingham police force—I never knew him charged with any discreditable action—I know nothing against his character.</p>

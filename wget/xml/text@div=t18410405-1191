                  </hi>. I am a dentist, and live in Newington Causeway. I had a show-case on the door-post, containing artificial and natural teeth—it was secure on the 24th of March, about half-past eleven o'clock in the morning—I missed it at three the same day.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the 24th of March, I saw the two prisoners in company together in Belton-street, Long-acre—I saw them leave No. 18, Belton-street, which is a marine-store shop, pass some little distance down the street, and join a boy, who appeared to have been waiting for them—I followed them to 3, Short's Gardens—I then met another con<lb></lb>stable, and we took them into custody—I asked Denny what they had sold in the shop they had just left—he said, "Nothing"—I took them to the station, then returned to the shop, and received this show case from Mrs. Shelly—I found eleven keys on Penny, and four pieces of wire on Winni<lb></lb>cott—I was in company with Weston the same evening, and found the teeth exposed for sale at a shop in Drury-lane.</p>

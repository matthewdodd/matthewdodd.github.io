             sworn. - I am a watchman, in St. Mary-le-bonne parish; on the 14th of August, between three and four o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner pass with something, and I ran after him.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it? - A. In Wigmore-street; he said, they were coach glasses he had to carry to Hatchet's in Long-acre, that he was to have carried them over-night, but had got up early to carry them that morning; I took them from him, and took him to the watch-house, he made no resistance; I went to Marlborough-street in the morning, and he was committed for further examination; in the mean time, I heard that Mr. Ram had lost them. (The coach glasses were produced and identified, by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. A man asked me to carry them for him and he would give me a shilling.</p>

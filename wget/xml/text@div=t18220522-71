On Saturday morning, the 18th of May, about a quarter past five o'clock the prisoner came into the shop with another man, and bought a knuckle of pork each, at two-pence each, and one penny-worth of bread. About six o'clock a young woman came and gave me information; I went out and overtook the prisoner about two hundred yards off, dragging a truck, with two tubs on it full of skins; it was my master's truck and tubs; I laid hold of him and asked where he was going; he said a young man had asked him to drag the truck, that the man had white stockings on, and he was to have one shilling for his job. I said the cart was my master's, and told him to take it back; he said he would take me to the man. I gave him to a man to hold, while I fetched a constable. I saw the cart safe at ten o'clock on the previous night, locked up in the stable, which is one hundred yards from the shop; he must pass the shop with it; the stable was up a court, which is a thoroughfare.</p>

            . I live about twenty yards from the stable, on the opposite side. On the 18th of May, about twenty minutes past five o'clock, I saw the prisoner against Osborne's stable, with another man; they stood there twenty minutes, close by the door. I saw the prisoner help the other man over the wall; he then came and opened the stable door, and let the prisoner in; they came out in a quarter of an hour, shut the door, and looked up and down the passage several times till the clock struck six; then both went into the stable, and threw open a pair of large doors, and the prisoner was hauling the truck out, and the other one pushed behind; he shut the doors, they then trailed the truck down the passage. I ran across and told Wiskin, who took the prisoner.</p>

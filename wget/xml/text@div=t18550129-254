                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. Knott, an outfitter at Poplar.

I took the prisoner, and received these two half sovereigns—when we got to the station, Mr. Lee said that the prisoner had been to the shop on the 9th, and purchased a pair of stockings, and he took of him a half sovereign, which turned out to be bad—the prisoner said he had been to the shop on the 9th, and purchased a pair of stockings, and had given him a half crown, not a half sovereign; and the second time, he said he did not think it was a bad one.</p>

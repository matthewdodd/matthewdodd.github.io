               <p>MR. JOHN SAMUEL STOREY. I am one of the executors to the will of the late Mrs. Margaret Dolway, and, in consequence of that, on Monday, the 28th of August, I went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182609140055"></xptr>to Mr. Moss' house, at Kensington, where she lodged, to take an inventory of her effects; she died on the 23d. I saw the prisoner there, and, in consequence of a communication which was made to me, I sent for her, and asked if she knew the object of my sending for her; she said she did not, unless it was in consequence of some papers being taken from under the bed (she had left the house at that time); I said that was not my object, and asked if she did not know she was sent for in consequence of Mrs. Dolway's money being missed - she said she did not - I asked if she had not been told that morning what was my object; she denied it, and I sent for Mrs. Moss and others; I repeated the same questions, and they said, in her presence, they had told her it was for that; she then admitted that was the fact - there are other executors to the will.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Who is Elizabeth Hillyer? A. An old lady, who lived in the house with Mrs. Dolway as a sort of companion, and had the care of her property; the will has not been proved: I have acted upon it, but not taken out a probate - the offence was committed before I began to act; Hillyer was a sort of confidential servant, who had lived with her, and had the care of her property for thirty years - it would be in her possession till it was delivered up to me.</p>

               <p>The clause in the will, vesting the property in Samuel Storey and others, in trust, was here read.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH HILLYER. I lived with Mrs. Dolway twenty-six years, in the house of Mr. Thomas Moss, at Kensington - he lived there himself - Mrs. Dolway died on the 23d of August; I always had the care of her things before her death, and after her death took charge of the property left; she used to keep her money in the celeret drawer in the day time, and at night she always took it out and gave it to me to put under the bed - in the morning I used to take it out, and she herself replaced it in the celeret - that was her invariable custom for years; but on the Tuesday night, the day before she died, she gave me but two parcels of money instead of three, and, in the morning, while she was alive, I them out and put them in the celeret - then I saw a third took parcel there, which she had not taken out at night; she died between 2 and 3 o'clock on the Wednesday afternoon; I saw the three parcels in the celeret on Thursday morning: the prisoner came to the house about an hour before Mrs. Dolway died, and continued in the house till the Monday morning following; she had the care of the room and corpse day and night; the celeret was in the sitting room, but on the Saturday I removed it into the bed room, where the corpse lay - nobody was in the bed room except the prisoner and her niece - the celeret had a spring lock; I never opened it after Thursday morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You were <rs id="t18260914-71-viclabel431" type="occupation">servant</rs>

               <p>Q. When you say you saw three parcels of money, you cannot say what sort of money it was? A. It was wrapped in paper - I was always informed there was gold; I did not open the parcels, but she always kept her money in that way.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. When did you miss the parcel? A. On the Monday morning when Mr. Storey came - the prisoner had then left the house about an hour - the prisoner was only sent for to take care of the body; I never left the house - her business was to set up with the body; she had no possession of the property.</p>

            . I am servant to Mrs. Matthews, of No. 10, Haughton-street, Kensington. I know the prisoner - she lived in Newland-street, about five minutes walk from Mrs. Matthew's; I lived two years with her as servant, and she got me my place at Mrs. Matthew's. On Tuesday, the 29th of August, between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, I was looking out of window, and saw her in the street, and when I came down she gave me this parcel, and said, "Take care of it for me;" she did not tell me what it was; I put it into my box without opening it, and delivered the same parcel to Ellis on the same day as I received it.</p>

            . I am a principal officer of Bow-street. In consequence of information I went to Mrs. Matthews', and received from Rust this parcel, containing twenty-four sovereigns, and a 10l. Bank note, No. 8048, dated 9th of June, 1826 - they were in a silk glove, and afterwards put into the leg of a silk stocking, and tied round with ribbon- Kensington is in the parish of St. Mary Abbotts.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you certain this house is in that parish? A. Not positive; I afterwards took the prisoner into custody, and asked if she had any means of getting her living, except going out nursing - she hesitated, and, at last, I said I was an officer, and that where she had been sitting up with and old lady, who was dead, some money was missing; she said she had some property coming from a mortgage - that her brother, when he came to town, usually brought her the money, but she had received none for a considerable time - that he was in town in May, but brought her none then, nor had he sent her any since; I asked whether, when she went out nursing she left her money at home, or took it with her, or placed it in any other person's hands; she denied a dozen times having ever placed any money in any body's hands; I then took out this parcel, and asked if she knew it; she said she did, and she had given it to Rust.</p>

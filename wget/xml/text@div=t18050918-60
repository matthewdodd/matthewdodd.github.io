In the evening, when the prisoner was going home from his work, I told him I must search him; I found in his two waistcoat pockets one pound and half an ounce, and three quarters of a pound wrapped up in paper in his breeches; this bag he had taken up stairs to grind some snuff, he tore this bag up to put part of the tobacco in the paper; I know it to be mine positively, by my hand-writing on it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had he lived with you? - A. Two months and one day; I have not the least doubt but the tobacco is mine, I have compared it with the other; the officer found some more on him.</p>

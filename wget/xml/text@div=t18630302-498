                  </hi>. I am a member of the firm of Cross and Gordon, tea merchants, 27, Rood-lane, City—there are several partners—the prisoner entered our service some time in October, 1861, as a commercial traveller—he travelled in the ordinary way, got orders for us, and we sent goods—he bad no fixed salary at that time; we advanced money to him from time to time, to try the trade as it were, to see whether he could make a business—he continued in that way until this agreement (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was entered into, on 11th March, 1862—it is signed by him—he was to act strictly as a traveller within the terms of that agreement—we owed him nothing then; the accounts were settled up to that time—the prisoner kept this book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>); he took it with him on his journey—it was his duty, on the receipt of money, to enter it in this book, and to enter on the other side the money he forwarded to us in London—if he paid any money to us on his return from his journey, he would have to enter it into this book—the agreement speaks of 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for salary, and five guineas for travelling expenses—that was almost always sent to him by post-office order if he was in the country, and if he was in London it was remitted to him regularly—that was perfectly distinct from the money he received—he returned from one of his journeys on 23d or 24th January, and handed over to our cashier the sum of 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was entered in this book—on 27th January he called at our place of business—I saw him—this book was pro<lb></lb>duced and made up—463<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was the gross amount he had received since the last settlement; it credits 429<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the prisoner merely said, as to the balance, that that was all the money he had got—I think there was one week's salary and travelling expenses owing to him at that time; that is entered there—we asked him what he had done with the re<lb></lb>mainder of the money—he said he had spent about 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in horse-hire—we allowed him that, we could not help ourselves—he also said he had spent 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for Christmas-boxes, and he said something about having to pay some rent—we said we should want to talk to him before he went on another journey—Mr. Cross spoke to him in my presence, and went through the ledger with him, in order that he might give explanations of the money owing which he had not accounted for—I think he called again on the fol<lb></lb>lowing</p>

               <p>was—we should have looked at If Mundle's account—if he did not send us the difference, we should presume that when the prisoner went on his next journey he would receive the balance—I am quite sure I did not receive the difference between 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 33<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—you must ask the cashier whether the prisoner paid any money about Christmas-time, I don't know—he paid this 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in one sum—I can tell that the difference between 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 33<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. is not included in that, because he has not put it on the other side of the book—I knew that Kent was indebted to us 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and Tilley 33<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I cannot tell whether the prisoner sold on the last journey as much as five tons of chicory and coffee; I should think not—he was not to have half the profits of the sales of coffee and chicory unless his earnings were over 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week, the date of the agreement—he said he had spent the money in travelling.</p>

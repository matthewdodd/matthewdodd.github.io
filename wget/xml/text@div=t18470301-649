                  </hi>. I am a constable of the City of London. I was watching the warehouse of Messrs, Cousins, in Sharbourn-lane, on Wednesday, 24th of Feb,—about seven o'clock that evening I saw the prisoner come out of the warehouse into Abchurch-yard—I stopped him there, and asked him what he had got in his pockets—he said, "Nothing"—I searched his pockets, and he had nothing there—I took off his hat, and found in it this tea in this bag—it is fourteen ounces of green tea—I went to his lodging, and found 1/4 lb. more of tea—this is it—on the road to the station the prisoner said he only took it for his own use.</p>

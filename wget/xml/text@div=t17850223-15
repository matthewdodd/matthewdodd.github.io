               <p>The prisoner being a foreigner was informed by the Court, that he might have a Jury of half foreigners, but he said, he chose to be tried by a Jury of all Englishmen.</p>
               <p>Court. Give the interpreter the indictment, and let him read it to him in French.</p>
               <p>Mr. JESTERMAN sworn Interpreter.</p>
               <p>Ask him if he is guilty? - Not in any ways.</p>
               <p>How will you be tried? - By God and this Country.</p>
               <p>(The Jury sworn.)</p>
               <p>The indictment opened by Mr. Garrow of Council for the prosecution.</p>
               <p>The witnesses examined apart at the request of Mr. Silvester and Mr. Parke, Council for the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding, of Council for the Prosecution, opened the Case as follows:</p>
               <p>Gentlemen of the Jury, when I get up after my young friend, Mr. Garrow, it must necessarily surprise you to see two of us to support this prosecution, and two of my learned friends appearing as Council for the prisoner; but Gentlemen, as you have already collected that the parties here are both foreigners, you will expect from us a particular regard to our duty, you will expect from us a regulated conduct, that we on the part of the prosecution should be careful not even to attempt to enflame your passions, nor to aggravate the conduct of the prisoner at the bar: you will expect likewise from my learned friends on the other side, a regulated decorum in the cross examination of the witnesses: in this country Justice is always administered to the admiration of the world, in such a way as to extort approbation even from the prisoners themselves; the prosecutor is a man of public character, he is a man of great literary same, and well known in France; the prisoner was his secretary. Gentlemen, in consequence of feeling that I am engaged in a particular duty out of the common track, it is that I assure myself I shall not be chastised by his Lordship in going a little out of this case, in order to account for the conduct of the prosecutor, and the manner in which this prosecution has arisen. The Compte, when he came over to this country, in August last, had packed up a number of very valuable effects; and when I tell you that he had lost a manuscript, which he valued infinitely more than the most precious jewel he ever possessed, and which was no less than the correspondence between Voltaire and a gentleman of great literary same, a Monsieur D'Alembert; and attributing this loss to the carelessness or neglect of the man at the bar, he became a little angry with him; there was a woman in the family of the name of Champante, she was dismissed, and then several things were missing that were brought to England, and amongst the rest the subject of the present inquiry; there were some shirts, these were afterwards found in the box of the prisoner at the bars, therefore, Gentlemen, it is on this circumstance alone, that you are to bestow your consideration; you will hear from the witness, from a Lady who saw these shirts in England, who knew them to be the Compte's property, she will tell you the manner in which they were found, and where they were found; and it will be clearly established in proof to you, that these being the Compte's property were found the possession of the prisoner; and it will then become him, to give a clear account he came by them. I should not have stated the other circumstances, but I thought it necessary to assign to you the sole motive for this prosecution: the lady shall stand forth here, and tell her story; you will from<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230049"></xptr> there is sufficient proof of the felony, and of the guilt of the sure you will do by him, all that he can with, if he is clearly proved to be guilty, you will pronounce him so; but if on your not satisfied of that guilt; you will more cherfully discharge the other past of your duty, which upon you acquit him.</p>

               <p>Have you these handkerchiefs here? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Look at them, and tell us whether you are sure those are the handkerchiefs you had England, and that you lost? - Oh! certainly.</p>
               <p>Do you know them by the mark or by the hemming? - By the hemming as well as by the mark.</p>
               <p>Are you sure them are the handkerchiefs you found in the prisoner - sure.</p>
               <p>Who marked the Compte's shirts found in that box? - I cannot tell, somebody whom I do not know.</p>
               <p>Have you seen those shirts in England? - I have seen these and twenty-five more that are missing.</p>
               <p>Who was present at the time when you searched the box? - I and the Compte examined it first ourselves, then we found out, then I called up a girl that was in the house, and that girl saw me find the other handkerchief; I was alone with the Compte when I found the two shirts, and the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Was you present at any thing when the prisoner was told that these things were found in his box? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did he say? - He said, appearances were against him, but that he must be heard go and then he was asked, why did you go out to give notice to Madam Champante, that she was suspected to which he answered, when I think any body<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230050"></xptr> is in danger of being hanged, I must infor them.</p>
               <p>Did he say any thing about these handkerchiefs shirts being found in his box? - He said, it might be a mistake of Madam Champante, when she own linen was brought back; and when the change of the mark was observed to him, he answered nothing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Baron Perryn. Do you know who washed the Compte's linen? - She is here, I do not know her name.</p>

               <p>Mr. Fielding. Your Lordship will forgive me, being Council for foreigners, if I am a little more attentive than I should perhaps be an another trial, I should hope that any attempt to throw any imputation on the prosecutor, will be corrected by your Lordship.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Buller, I cannot correct it, if it is evidence; because that God, we live in a country, that whether a man is a native or a foreigner makes no difference.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. I certainly will ask no improper question, nor any question I would not ask any English person, standing there; Why did you leave Paris? - The Compte said, he was tried of being is I wished to see England.</p>

               <p>By what way? - We took the pacquet boat, which was to bring us from Deipe to Brighton, but it brought us from Deipe to Shoreham.</p>
               <p>Do not these pacquet boats go from Deipe every day, and every hour in the day? - We asked, and received for information it was not so, therefore we hired a pacquet of our own.</p>

               <p>What was the occasion of the hurry, that you was obliged to hire a pacquet of your own, and not wait for the pacquet? - Because we feared winds.</p>

               <p>This box that was examined was the room in which it was open? - It was open, because Mr. Hardy had run away in such a hurry to Champante, that he had not time to shut his room.</p>
               <p>How did you know it was his intention to go to Champante? - He had asked the Compte's leave to go, who had forbid him, nor withstanding that he went, and was followed by Mr. Dawes, who saw him go to Champante's lodgings.</p>
               <p>Did not the Compte order him to go to Champante? - He forbid him to go and said he would go himself.</p>

               <p>Was it in the one pair of stairs or two pair? - In the garret; the house is three stories high, and garrets over, this was in the third pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Did not you mark your linen with the first letter of your name? - With nothing but an H. because it is my family name.</p>

               <p>Mr. Fielding. Sir Gilbert, I believe you the Justice? - I was there at two examinations, but not at the first.</p>
               <p>Was you there at any time, which any question was asked the prisoner, relative to house and handkerchiefs? - Yes, was, I think he said of the shirts, it must be a mistake of the washerwoman's the handkerchiefs, he said they were his own, that the Compte never had any such.</p>
               <p>Mr. Parke. Did not you understand either from the Compte, or this lady, that they had left Paris in a great hurry and confusion? - I have heard from the Compte an history of his own life, I have been acquainted with him.</p>
               <p>Court. It certainly is not necessary to go into ay from Paris but that he certain.</p>
               <p>And that she or no reason that should go back, the of</p>
               <p>Did not he come to avoid a letter t? - No, Sir, such a thing might and he had had times with the keeper</p>

               <p>Sir Gilbert. I am sure every think I honour, that there is nothing in his conduct reproachable.</p>

               <p>When they were examined they gave evidence of several other things; besides the set that were lost? - At the third examination and justice thought proper to put the handkerchiefs out, but he reserved only the shirts, on him shifts were Compte's.</p>

               <p>Court. What reason did the Justice give? - This reason; he asked a friend of mine, in whose custody they had been? he said, in the custody of Champante as her maid, he said that for that reason he thought that they could not be considered as a theft.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. The Justice was mistaken, the custody of Champante was the custody of her mistress.</p>

               <p>What things did the lady take out of the box? - There were some shirts and stockings, I did not take particular notice; she took a handkerchief out, which she said was hers, it was marked P. H. I saw the mark.</p>

               <p>Look at these handkerchiefs, were these the sort of marks? - It was such a mark as that, it was marked with red silk.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. All that you know is, that it was a white handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. In what way did the lady communicate this information to you? - No particular way, I cannot understand her, only I went up along with her, she shewed me by some action, it was hers.</p>
               <p>Court. Did she say any thing to you that you understood? - No, she took and opened it, and bid me take notice, that was her handkerchief.</p>
               <p>What word did she make use of? - She bid me take notice, she shewed it to me so.</p>

               <p>The oath translated into French to him by the Interpreter.</p>
               <p>Examined by Mr. Fielding.</p>
               <p>Ask the Compte, if the prisoner lived with him as his secretary, and when? - Yes, about fifteen months, but I cannot ascertain the day upon oath.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect when your female servant, Champante, was dismissed? - About six weeks ago: there are several witnesses here that can prove the days, I do not recollect the days.</p>
               <p>How soon after she was dismissed was it, that you, in company with the lady, went up to search the box of the secretary in his room? - The next day.</p>
               <p>What led to that examination? - The circumstance of Mr. Hardy going to the Bell Inn, in Holborn, to let this Champante know that she was suspected, and that I meant to search her things, which circumstance induced me to suppose Hardy to be an accomplice, and was the reason why I went up stairs in order to search.</p>
               <p>What passed when you went up stairs in company with the lady, and examined the box? - Almost upon opening the box, at top, under a very thin covering of linen that were there, two shirts were discovered, that were mine, these are the shirts that were taken out of the box.</p>
               <p>Was there any thing else taken out of the box? - I was not present at the time when the handkerchiefs were found.</p>
               <p>When did you see the prisoner after this? - The moment after and the moment before; for I had found him at the Bell, in Holborn, where I had forbid him to go.</p>
               <p>What passed between you and the prisoner after this discovery? - I told him of the circumstance of his going to give notice to Mrs. Champante being suspected, after the positive orders that I had given him, and the circumstance of finding afterwards the effects in the box persuaded me he was an accomplice in this theft, of which Mrs. Champante was suspected, and therefore I ordered him to go out of the house directly.</p>
               <p>What answer did the prisoner make? - The prisoner said, with respect to the notice which I have given to Mrs. Champante, appearances are against me, but Monsieur Le Compte, if you was to see any body likely to be hanged, you would tell them to make their escape; with respect to the shirts that have been found in my possession, you know very well the neglect of Madam Champante, and her disorder, it might have happened from neglect of hers, or a mistake of the washerwoman's.</p>
               <p>How soon after this was it that you applied to the Magistrate on this business? - At that time I did not intend to prosecute the prisoner, and so far was I from such an intention, that I told him to come to my house, when certain boxes, which we expected to arrive from France, were come, in order that he, the prisoner, might ascertain what effects there were that belonged to himself, and what effects Mrs. Champante claimed, and what were belonging to me, if they could be found; accordingly Mr. Hardy came several times to me after that, in order to enquire whether the boxes were arrived, and at each time I asked him where he lived, and his answer at each time<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230055"></xptr> I asked the question, was, that he did not know the name of the street; it was only from the time that this box arrived, that the prisoner ceased coming to my house; the box came on Saturday, and the Sunday morning after I saw the prisoner at Mr. Spilsbury's; there I told the prisoner to come to me on the Monday following, because I had a letter to give him; he asked me what that letter was, and if the box was arrived, to which I answered in the affirmative; he promised to come to me the next morning at nine, but never made his appearance, and it was only through the prisoner's not coming to his appointment, that I was convinced of his bad intentions towards me: I went to Bow-street, on the Monday.</p>
               <p>What day of the month was that Monday? - I do not remember, but it may be known by the warrant itself.</p>
               <p>Was you present when the prisoner was searched, when he was apprehended on the warrant? - I was not present when he was taken, I was then in the House of Commons, but I was present when he was examined.</p>
               <p>Did you see any property of your's of any sort taken from him? - Upon examination, the prisoner produced two pacquets of a singular nature, which persuaded me, there was some manoeuvre going on against me at Paris; and this paper together with a small book that belonged to me, was found in the prisoner's pockets, and were delivered to the Justice of Peace.</p>
               <p>What was that book? - A number of the Journal of Monsieur - the King of France's brother, of which I have other copies by me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. A number of a book called Journale de Monsieur? - The Justice ordered the pacquet to be sealed, and delivered to the constable who had the prisoner in care.</p>
               <p>Mr. Parke. Was not Madam Champante dismissed the night before you spoke to the prisoner about the shirts? - Madam Champante was sent away before ever I spoke to Mr. Hardy about these shirts.</p>
               <p>Had not Madam Champante the sole charge of your linen, and Madam

             had expressed herself, that every thing was right? - When Mrs. Champante was sent away, I and Madam

             doubted not, nor do we now doubt, Madam Champante had robbed us.</p>
               <p>Did you then express your suspicions to the prisoner of that? - Often times, and so much the more particularly, as at that time I did not suspect the prisoner, I spoke to him rather in con fidence than suspicion.</p>
               <p>What was your motive for suffering Champante to go away, when you suspected she had robbed you? - What do you mean, by permitting her to go.</p>
               <p>Discharging her? - She was dismissed merely because she was thought a thief.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You are not quite correct in that answer; he says, in France it is the principal to turn away a thief.</p>
               <p>Court. If you was at that time convinced that Champante had robbed you, as you now say you was, why did not you prosecute her? - At the time I had no intention to prosecute her, nor had I any intention to prosecute the prisoner, or any body for such triffling things as shirts; the business of this prosecution is of much more importance, and if not of such importance, the prisoner would not be supported in his cause.</p>
               <p>The next morning after Champante was discharged, what did you say to the prisoner? - It was not discovered till the next morning, that the shirts were missing, when I told the prisoner of it; that these shirts were there, and that there were several other shirts and effects to a great amount missing; I was so far from suspecting the prisoner's probity then, that I told him that Champante had committed the theft, and that if she concealed these things any where, or if she had pledged them any where, he should<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230056"></xptr> take them out; the question had preceeded the discovery, and therefore the prisoner said at once, she lives at the Bell; as soon as the prisoner was acquainted with the discovery of the shirts, then he said, he did not believe she was at the Bell, and that she was gone away that day; I then proposed to Hardy, to go to see whether she was at the Bell, and then I several times after forbid him to go, and it was then that the prisoner went out, and was traced to the Bell, from which circumstance my suspicions of the prisoner were founded.</p>
               <p>Before Hardy proposed going to the Bell to Champante, did not you propose to him, to go to the Bell to ask where these shirts were? - No.</p>
               <p>When you came to the Bell, you found the prisoner there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you ask Champante about your shirts, and what did you say to her? - The first thing I said, upon coming into the room, and seeing Hardy there, was, what are you doing here, Sir? the prisoner answered, I came here to see whether your shirts were here, I told him I had forbid him; when I came to speak to Champante, I told her I missed a great many shirts, and asked what was become of them.</p>
               <p>How many did you say? - I think seven and twenty, but I cannot be sure.</p>
               <p>Did not Champante in your presence, and in the presence of the prisoner, say that you had but sixteen in England? - No, so far from saying that I had no more than sixteen shirts in England, she excused herself, by saying, at the house where you lodged every thing was open, what would you have me say to the matter, look and examine my things.</p>
               <p>Did she then offer to open all her trunks for you to see whether any thing was there? She did say look into my boxes, because she had none, she had parcels: but I am not arrived to this time of life, without knowing that when any body says, look into my parcels or boxes, I am to understand that nothing is to be found there.</p>
               <p>Tell him he is only to answer to facts, without making his own deductions? - If I am called to speak the truth, I must say the whole truth.</p>
               <p>Did not the prisoner return with you to your lodgings? - He followed me, but I do not know whether he came into the house the same time with me.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner come to your lodgings after you? - I cannot say upon my oath, whether he came in at the instant, I believe I saw him a little time after.</p>
               <p>After the prisoner returned to the lodgings, did not he of his own accord, produce his box before you and Madam

            ? - He did not offer his box to be examined by me, the things had been examined before, and his effects were then upon the stairs.</p>

               <p>But he did produce his box? - No.</p>
               <p>That day you discharged him? - That day, and that instant.</p>
               <p>Did you pay him his wages? - I paid him nothing, because I owed him nothing, he was indebted to me.</p>
               <p>How many months had he served you? - I cannot ascertain upon oath the precise time, but I arrived in England in the month of August, and he was from thence.</p>
               <p>What had you paid him? - I do not think I am bound to answer that question, neither can I do it, unless I look over my books of my stated expences.</p>
               <p>Had you given him money? - Yes, before witnesses.</p>
               <p>How much? - I do not think myself bound to answer that, neither can I do it upon oath, at this present moment.</p>
               <p>Did you give it him for wages? - Yes, that will be seen by the civil action, that is to be tried.</p>
               <p>When was that civil action commenced by the prisoner? - By way of recrimination, three or four days after he knew that the warrant was issued out against him, as appears by the writ.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Desire him not to make a speech, but to say the dates? - The writ will certify much better than my memory.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230057"></xptr>When was you served with that writ, when was the prisoner taken up? - More than a week after.</p>
               <p>After the writ was served upon you? - Yes, but was obtained three days before.</p>
               <p>Court. For what sum was you arrested? - He claimed thirty pounds.</p>
               <p>Mr. Parke. Did you say what wages you give him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. We are trying the right of the man to recover on the assumpsit of the civil action.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. It is very unfortunate that this gentleman the Compte, makes a speech on every question that we ask him, by which means our questions lose their effect.</p>
               <p>Did the Compte before he took out a warrant against the prisoner, ever see him at the house of Mr. Spilsbury his printer? - Yes, I saw him on the Sunday morning, I only got the warrant on Monday.</p>
               <p>You said nothing at that time, as to the dishonesty of the prisoner to Mr. Spilsbury? I told Mr. Spilsbury before that, that I had strong suspicions against him, and as Mr. Spilsbury was printing my work at that time, and the proofs came through the prisoner's hands, I cautioned Mr. Spilsbury's son, not to trust the prisoner with the proofs any more, because the prisoner was turned out of my service.</p>
               <p>You said nothing to Mr. Spilsbury's son about the prisoner having robbed you? - I did not know at that time Mr. Hardy had robbed me.</p>
               <p>But it was after the prisoner had left your service? - I never thought of prosecuting the prisoner, on account of this trifling master of shirts, I never thought of denouncing the prisoner as a thief on that account, but when the box came, which certified to me that I had effects of much greater consequence, then it was I determined to prosecute him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I refer my defence to my council.</p>

               <p>Do you mean that lady? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was that the name she used to go by? - I went into her service, when she bore that name at the hotel.</p>
               <p>What name did the lady go by in England? - I never knew her by any other name, than by Madam Nara.</p>
               <p>In what manner did the Compte, and Madam Nara leave Paris? - The Compte made his escape from Paris, and was near a league from Paris, at a friend's house.</p>
               <p>Who was with him there? - He went from the house by himself, in a street called Rocquesde Loyue.</p>
               <p>What orders had the servants when he was gone? - The Compte had no domestick but myself, the other domestick he had, he had sent off at twenty leagues distance, that he might not know he was leaving Paris.</p>
               <p>Did you leave Paris in a great hurry? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you time or leisure there to pack up all your things? - No, we had no time, we put up the linen together which the boxes would not hold, we put it in a sack, we had orders to deposite it with Monsieur Goddard, a friend of the Compte's</p>
               <p>Did you take care of the Compte's linen, as well as the ladys? - At Paris the Compte had a servant who took care of his linen, and I never had the care of the Compte's linen in particular.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect what linen was packed up? - I cannot tell the quantity of linen, but Madam Nara took an account of it.</p>
               <p>Do you know the quantity of linen the Compte had in London? - I never knew it.</p>
               <p>Who gave it to wash? - The lady herself.</p>
               <p>Who gave out Hardy's linen to wash? - He used to give it to me, and I used to give it the washer-woman.</p>
               <p>Did you give the Compte's, and Madam Nara's linen to the same washer-woman? -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230058"></xptr> Yes, the same washer-woman, and made out a bill for Mr. Hardy's linen, and the Compte's.</p>
               <p>The Court and prosecutor's council conferred some short time, then the Court said.</p>
               <p>Sir Gilbert, the prosecutor has consented to drop this prosecution, but only on condition of the reason of this perseverance being made public; he thinks that necessary? - I am able to give that information, because this prosecution was begun and persevered in by my advice; the Compte dined at my house at the time he received the first information, that his boxes returned from France empty; he asked me what he had best do, I advised him immediately to arrest Hardy, as the best chance; he took that advice from me, and immediately took out a warrant; some days after, he was arrested at the suit of Hardy, which certainly appeared to me and to him a recrimination: now this public explanation is necessary, because it has been insinuated, that this is a malicious prosecution: but the reason for my advising the prosecutor at first, was to recover the property, and the reason for persisting in it, was this, that at the public examination of the prisoner in Bow-street, some of the prisoner's friends were present at the time, and he was advised to reserve his defence, but he asked whether he might not make his defence then, because he said he would shew the Justice, that the Compte was not a person, that was to be believed on his oath; when I heard that, I advised the prosecutor to persevere in this prosecution, as I had then known him a great many years, and had been his school fellow, and had as full a conviction of his honour, as I have of my brother.</p>
               <p>Court. Sir Gilbert, you will take the trouble, to tell the Compte from the Court, there is nothing has dropt, that throws the smallest imputation on him, he has acted very wisely, and his honour is not in the least degree impeached, by any thing that has occurred in this prosecution.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. I must tell you one thing, that two persons whom you do not know, applied for the money before the arrest.</p>
               <p>Court. The attempt to throw a stain on the Compte's honour, was very improper, because it is not the same thing for a Frenchman to run away, as it is in England; but Sir

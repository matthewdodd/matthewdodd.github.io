                  </hi>. I live at 6, Dorset-place, North, Clapham-road, and am a biscuit-baker—the prisoner worked for me about ten weeks, and had left me five or six weeks—on Thursday-morning, 6th November, about twenty minutes past 5, I was called up, and found that the house had been entered from the staircase window, which is about fifteen feet high from the yard—there was a pair of steps there, but they would not be high enough—two persons could manage to do it—the window had been secured by a cross bolt, which had been forced up by a knife—I had fastened it myself—I missed a time-piece, four or five coats, a dress, three or four umbrellas, a riding-whip, and some things out of my wife's work-box, which they had forced open, value altogether about 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., also 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, and some packets of coppers; two bottles of port wine, and some brandy, had been consumed, and some old Curacoa had been opened, which they did not seem to like—I had seen the prisoner loitering about my neighbourhood for three or four days—these articles are mine—they were all safe the previous night.</p>

I am in Mr. Tidd's service—I do not reside on the premises—on the morning of 6th November, I went to work about twenty minutes to 5 o'clock—I let myself into the bakehouse, and then went through into the house—I have to ring the bell usually, and have the door opened, but I found the back door open, went into the back kitchen, and found the gas burning, and the place strewed with things—the liquer frame was brought down there, but finding that it was not silver they had left it behind—my master keeps a fuxrious dog, which usually runs about the bakehouse—he was loose on this morning, but I found this handkerchief (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) tied to the table leg, by which he had been tied up—I have seen the prisoner with this handkerchief—he showed it to me once, and said that if was one which he had <hi rend="italic">naited</hi>—I have seen him about the Clapham-road, but he works there.</p>

On Thursday, 6th November, I received information of this robbery, and about half-past 5 o'clock saw the prisoner standing at the end of the mews—he appeared to have been drinking, and asked me the way to Clapham-common—I said that I would show him—he pretended to be French, but I knew too much French for him, and knew that he was not French—I took him in custody—he was wearing this coat, containing a silver thimble, and in his trouser's pocket, these tweezers, button hook, and a table napkin.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. David William Wotton and another; they are gun-manufacturers, in Great St. Helen's—the prisoner was their warehouseman—he had a cupboard to his bench, which is usually kept locked. On Thursday night., 24th Feb., I bad his cupboard unlocked, after he was gone, with a key that we had to fit it—I found in it thirty-one bayonet-springs—I locked the cupboard and left them there—I made a report to the foreman next morning—I had the cupboard unlocked every night after that, and still saw the springs there—on the Monday night following I told one of the servants to unlock the cupboard—I did not see it opened—the servant told me something—I went to Bishopsgate-street and overtook the prisoner—I asked him to come back, and he did—he had a parcel in his band, which was three dirty aprons—I asked him to unlock the cupboard, and I saw him do so; the springs were not there</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185103030011"></xptr>
               <p>—asked him for the thirty-one bayonet-springs—he seemed confuted, and walked about; he did not say anything—I said if he did not give me the springs I should give him in charge—after a short time he took twenty-five springs out of one of his pockets, and six out of the other—I told him to go about his business, and to come the next morning to see his employers—these springs were usually kept in a floor over his head—I do not know these springs at all, but I had missed some for some weeks—the prisoner did not come back on the Tuesday morning, but, he came on Wednesday—he said he was innocent, but be said he had gone up to my floor and taken the thirty-one springs.</p>

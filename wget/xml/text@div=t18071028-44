               <p>Q. On the 14th of October did you lose any money, and how much. - A. Eight and six pence it was. Between eleven and twelve o'clock I was in <placeName id="t18071028-44-crimeloc239">Fox-court, Brook-street</placeName>

One of the women came up to me and took the money out of my breeches pocket; as soon as she took it she gave it to the other; it was dark; I cannot say which of the women took it.</p>
               <p>Q. You could have prevented the woman from taking it out of your pocket. - A. No, not at first I could not.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you sober. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they both close to you. - A. I cannot say which was nearest to me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been drinking. - A. I had not been in the public house an hour, we had two shillings worth of brandy and water between three.</p>
               <p>Q. You say she put her hand into your breeches pocket; why did not you put your hand down and stop her. - A. I did not feel it soon enough.</p>
               <p>Q. What was passing at the time. - A. Nothing but what I have told you.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you retire to any place with her. - A. No; this took place within the court.</p>
               <p>Q. When she said are you good natured, will you give me some gin; did you try to rush by her. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you stop till she came up. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What become of them after one had taken it and handed it to the other. - A. I took it out of her hand; she called the watchman, and gave charge of me. I gave charge of her next and we all was at the watch-house all night.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that you were quite sober. at that time. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be out so late at night. - A. I had been at a public house in Cow Cross putting up two lamps.</p>
               <p>Jury. Can you tell me the public house, or else you must be very drunk. - A. I think it is the White Horse, I will not be positive.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever been paid for the job. - A. I was paid at that time; I do not recollect the sign, nor the man's name.</p>
               <p>Q. You lost nothing, you took it from the woman immediately. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. If this woman had not given charge of you, you would not have taken any notice of it. - A. No, I should not.</p>
               <p>Court. Who do you work for. - A. Mr. Tarbuck, facing Shoe-lane, and Mr. Gardner in the Strand.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I saw the women go by my box, I thought, not two minutes before they called out watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any man call out watch, - A. No. The women called out, one was standing up and the other was sitting, they gave me charge of him for knocking them down; then he gave me charge of them for picking his pocket. I sprang a rattle, got assistance, and took the whole of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the man apparently drunk or sober. - A. Perfectly sober.</p>
               <p>Hamilton's Defence. About twelve o'clock I and Smith met that gentleman at the corner of Fox court, he asked her if she would take a walk; she went up the gateway with him, he made her at present of some silver; the patrol come past, he said he would not stop any longer, he insisted upon having his money; she would not give it him; he knocked both of us down; we charged the watch with him.</p>
               <p>Smith's Defence. I met this man in Brook-street; he asked us if we would go under a turning with him; we went under Fox court, he made us a present of some silver; he said he could not stop any longer; when the patrol came by he insisted upon the silver again; we would not give it him; then he knocked us down, and we charged the watch with him.</p>

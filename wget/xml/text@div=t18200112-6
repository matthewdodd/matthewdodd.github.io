On Wednesday, the 8th of December, about half-past three o'clock in the afternoon, I was in St. James's-square, between King-street and York-street - there was a number of people there - a man ran against me with violence, I pushed him from me, and as he fell I felt my watch go from my fob. I am sure he took it, he was the only man close to me, and I saw the watch in his hand. The prisoner is the man, I endeavoured to lay hold of him, but received several blows from the people round me, they hustled and struck me, which prevented my securing him. I pursued him to the corner of King-street, and said he had robbed me - he escaped. He had a grey coat on. On Friday morning Dorrell fetched me to Bow-street, and my watch was produced - it is a gold watch. I produce it. The case was lost in the scuffle.</p>

            . I am a brushmaker, and live in Bird-street, Manchester-square. On the 8th of December I was in St. James's-square, saw the prisoner run against Mr. Davis, and snatch the watch from his pocket, the gang was round - he stumbled and fell to the ground. I pursued him to the bottom of King-street, there took him into custody, and found the gold watch and seals, without the case, in his right-hand breeches-pocket. I am sure he is the man. I delivered it to Mr. Davis on the 10th, at Bow-street.</p>

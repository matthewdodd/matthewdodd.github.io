It is my duty, in the absence of Mr. Billing, to walk in front of the counter, and see that the customers are attended to; on the Saturday previous to the 24th of August, the prisoner was missing; I called him, and he did not answer, but presently he came out of a window, where there are a quantity of woollen goods, where he had no business to go - I saw him putting something into his pocket, and from the confused manner in which he appeared, when I told him to serve a customer, I had some suspicion, but I let it pass on till the next Tuesday, when I wanted a particular handkerchief, bearing the representation of His present Majesty; I inquired and they were not to be found; there had been two of them - all the young men denied having seen them; I then named it to Mr. Billing, and likewise the circumstance of the prisoner coming out of the window; in the evening he went to search all the boxes - the prisoner unlocked his box, took out his linen, and opened it, to show that there was nothing there; he went on till he came to a bundle; I asked what was in that - he said nothing particular; I told the Policeman to take it, and there were two handkerchiefs, with the shopmark on them; here is a length of silk which was found, but I cannot swear to it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Where did you see him come from? A. From the woollen-drapery window; there are silks there sometimes, but I am not sure there were that day - I am sure the prisoner's box was locked; it was a common box, in the room to which others have access; I had not suggested to the prosecutor the propriety of searching the boxes - we have not been on bad terms, but, from my filling the principal situation, perhaps some words might pass; I never said I would do for him the next day.</p>

            .

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. They were not tied? A. No - there was no bundle that he opend; when I took it out he said he did not care at all about it, were it not for his mother - he gave no acount of them; this third hadkerchief was on them - he asked what I thought he should be done to.</p>

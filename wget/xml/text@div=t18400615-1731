                  </hi>I live at Islington. On June the 8th, about ten minutes after seven o'clock in the morning, I was at work in Pocock's<lb></lb>fields, and. saw the prisoner and Charles Hay ward fighting on the grass—I did not know the cause of the quarrel—I saw them fight more rounds than one—Hay ward was a little in liquor, hut very trifling—it was a fair fight—they fought about twenty rounds—I saw, Hayward receive a blow on his chest—the prisoner got hit several times on the eye—I saw the de<lb></lb>ceased fall in the last round on a lump of hard ground—he received a blow on the right-side of the neck from the prisoner, which made him fall—I think it was the right-side—it was below the ear—I saw him fall down, and strike his head on the ground, at the same round as be received the blow on the neck.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Was he struck down by the prisoner, or did he fall? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. They closed and fell—as soon as he, got up I saw him put both hands to the back of his head, and say he had fallen on a stone—I did not see a stone there, but the ground was very hard—when he got up he said he had shook hands with the prisoner at first, and he would shake hands with him again—the fight lasted about twenty minutes—that ended the fight—I saw the deceased leaning on a person's arm—I saw him about a quarter after twelve o'clock, in a cottage in Pocock's-fields, on a bed—there were lumps of hard clay on the spot where he fell.</p>

                  </hi>I am a surgeon. On the 8th of June I went to Hatch's cottage, and saw the deceased—he was dead then—I the not attend the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi>examination.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">ALFRED LORD.</hi>I am a surgeon, at Islington. About ten o'clock on the afternoon of the 8th of June, I went to Hatch's cottage, and found a man there dead—he appeared to have been dead perhaps an hour—it is impossible to say how long—I examined his body the next day at the workhouse, at Islington—I opened his head and body—he died from ex<lb></lb>travasation of blood all over the surface of the brain, and between the lobes of the cellular membrane—that might be occasioned by a blow on the back of the neck, or by falling on the ground and striking against a hard substance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined, Q</hi>. Do not you think, if the extravasation was caused by a blow, the vessels would have ruptured at the instant? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. That does not follow—the smaller vessels would be ruptured, and they might gra<lb></lb>dually flow out their contents, which might not be visible for ten mi<lb></lb>nutes or a quarter of an hour—it is impossible to say how long—he might, after receiving the blow, be able to walk to the cottage, and ask leave to lay down—extravasation of blood may be caused by strong passion—I should say, in this case, passion and intoxication were the predisposing causes, but the injury received was the immediate cause.</p>

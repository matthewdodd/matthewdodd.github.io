                  </hi>. I am widow of the late St. John Mildmay, and live in Belgrave-square. The prisoner had been in my employ—I had her brought up, and paid for her education—I left my purse in a reticule in my drawer in my bed-room—I am not always in the habit of counting my money, but I thought I had left more money into it than I found in it—in consequence of that, on the 8th of February I counted five sovereigns, and put them in the purse, and put the purse into a bag in the drawer as usual—when I came home I missed two sovereigns—the next day I marked five, and put them in the purse—there were none but them—I examined the purse the same evening, and missed one—on Monday morning I marked four more, and put them into the purse with the four others—I came home at night, and missed two—on Tuesday I desired the boxes of all the servants to be searched—the prisoner was called up, and my daughter said, "Mary, we will look into your box"—she said, "Oh, there is nothing there but rags; I have not a sixpence in the world"—my housekeeper's name is Phillis Martin—she produced ten sovereigns to me that day—among them I found these two marked sovereigns, which I had put into the purse on Monday—a handkercheif was found, which was my property—I was present at the examination of the prisoner's box, and saw the sovereigns produced from it.</p>

In conse<lb></lb>quence of hearing that my mistress had missed her money, on Tuesday morning I submitted my box to be examined—after that I went to where the prisoner was—I said, "Mary, has your box been looked into?"—Miss Mildmay said, "No, poor girl, she says she has not a 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the world"—her ladyship said, "Poor girl, she can't find the key"—I said, "Mary, you must look for the key, your box must be opened; if you can't find the key, you must go down stairs for the chopper"—she went down for the</p>

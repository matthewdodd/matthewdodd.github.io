                  </hi>. I am manager to Mr. William Peck, a manufacturer of leather goods, in Nelson Square, Blackfriars. On 2d April, Barrow called on me about manufacturing some goods, which he wanted as part of a shipping order; he had a folio paper in his hand, which I presumed to be the order—Iundertook to manufacture and deliver the goods—he asked me how long I should be about them—he read what he wanted—I said if he would allow me I would take a list of them—I got the order book, and entered them—I asked how long he could give me to manufacture them; he said a fortnight, and I undertook to have them ready by that time, and he went away—I had a little more conversation with him, but nothing material—he read them from this paper, and I copied them into the order book—I cannot positively swear it was this paper—he read a list of things which I entered—he said, the order was particular to time, because he wanted it for a shipping order—on the morning of 3d April, which was the morning the goods ought to have been delivered, Hammond came and asked if the goods were ready; I told him yes, or nearly so—he asked me whether I could oblige him with the invoice of them; I</p>

               <p>said, yes, and brought it—I said they were a good parcel of goods; he said he was very glad of it; I said so was I, as it was for an export order; he said yes, they were going to the West Indies—the goods were sent to their factory, and I have seen them since at the pawnbroker's—I should have fur<lb></lb>nished the goods just the same if he had not said they were for a shipping order.</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on business at No. 58, Watling Street, and am a dealer in fancy leather goods. On 26th April, Barrow called on me about some goods; he told he was going to leave town for Birmingham—he made a selection of goods, and wanted them sent in by 2 o'clock, as he was going to leave town that evening, and he wanted to mark them before he left—they sent again for the goods, as we had not delivered them at the time—I sent them in; I saw them again at the pawnbroker's.</p>

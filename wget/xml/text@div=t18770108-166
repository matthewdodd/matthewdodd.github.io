Malvin &amp; Co., of Edinburgh—the prisoner was in the habit of calling from time to time for the ale—he called on the 11th of October, 1875—the signature on the cheque produced is mine—it is dated 11th October, 1875, and is in payment of an account for 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and is made payable to Messrs.

                  </hi>. I am manager for Messrs. Malvin &amp; Co., brewers, Edinburgh—the prisoner entered our employment in 1870 in a subordinate position—there was no agreement in writing—he was appointed clerk and manager in 1872—his duties would then be to solicit orders and collect the money—our firm had an account with the Lambeth branch of the National Bank—it was his duty when he collected money to pay it to the credit of the firm into that bank, but if he received a cheque as in the present instance, payable to "Messrs. Malvin &amp; Co. or order" his duty was to send it to the firm—Mr. James Malvin is the only person authorised to endorse cheques—the signature on the cheque produced is the prisoner's—he had no authority to endorse cheques—we suspected there was something wrong at the end of 1875 and called upon the prisoner to make an explan<lb></lb>ation, and in February, 1876, in consequence of explanations which he made</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187701080025"></xptr>
               <p>we arranged to place someone over him—we sent accounts to our customers and as the amount due to us from Mr. Stephenson was not remitted we commenced an action—the trial came on in November last, when Mr. Stephenson produced this cheque endorsed as it now appears—we then took the present proceedings—the prisoner made a statement in February, 1876, of sums he had collected, solemnly declaring them to be all—he afterwards added others, collected by a traveller named Trigg, which he admitted having got, and again solemnly assevrated they were all—we had not ascertained the amounts then, but believed what the prisoner said—he had no authority to endorse cheques—I did not know then he had put the name of the firm to any cheques at the time of the arrangement—we did not know the amount of his defalcations, and we pitied him and thought he had been led astray—had we known all we should have made no arrangement—we found out about the cheques when they were produced at the trial in November—the prisoner has never accounted for the 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in any way.</p>

I engaged the prisoner prior to his taking up the management of the London Branch, he had been employed a couple of years in London—I am the acting agent in London; Mr. Malvin has been to London about twice during the prisoner's management, but not specially with reference to the business—he may have had interviews with the prisoner, but I cannot say what took place—the prisoner was told to go on as Mr. Stephens, his predecessor, had done—I do not know that Mr. Stephens endorsed cheques—I have had special power given to me on particular occasions to endorse cheques—the one produced is a guaranteed endorsement—I do not know if the account there (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), amounting to 1,062<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., does not include sums paid in cheques—I have not inquired; it may have done so—I had an interview in Islington with the sister of the prisoner to tell her what had happened—I made no proposal for a settle<lb></lb>ment, neither did she, and none was come to—I got a bill of exchange from her for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we had a bill of sale on the furniture, two policies, and other bills amounting to 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we did not discuss the matter—I saw the prisoner write from our office to ask his sister for the bill of exchange; I was no party to it—I accepted it for Messrs. Malvin; it is not yet matured—I did not say to her "There are some further very unpleasant features in the case, your brother has remitted wrong accounts to our head-quarters in Edinburgh, and has falsified his London books and accounts, and done other things," and on her asking what we intended to do, say "We must make the best of it; we have already taken a bill of sale on all bis personal pro<lb></lb>perty and effects, and he has assigned life policies for 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to the firm, we now, however, require two sureties, each in the sum of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., making, a further sum of 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in all, as further security required"—I did not say that the prisoner was going about trying to obtain securities, and if obtained further proceedings would be desisted from.</p>

I am the prisoner's sister—I recollect Mr. Hannan calling at our house in Islington on 8th February last—he asked if I had been told of the arrangements that had been come to about my brother's defalcations—I said that I had not heard—he said it was very serious, and the sum was over 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and that there were other serious offences, such as tearing leaves out of the books—he said also "We have taken a bill of sale on the furniture for 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and have two life policies for 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he is now going about all to-day to find two sureties in 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, making 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," and I asked "Do you mean to say if he obtains these securities there will be no prosecution," and he said "I am justified in saying so;" in the result I gave him a bill of exchange for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I wrote to Messrs. Malvin on the 10th, saying "I am willing to assist my brother as far as lies in my power, provided the arrangements are satisfactory, meaning the arrangements that Mr. Hannan had told me of, that there would be no prosecution, and that he would be continued in his situation—I afterwards received a telegram from Mr. Hannan, "Send your accep<lb></lb>tance for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I did so and Messrs.

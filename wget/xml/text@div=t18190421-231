On the 15th of March, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, I missed the sheets off the railing at the back of the house, where they hung to dry. The persons must have climbed over a high wall to get them. They were safe an hour before. I saw nobody in the yard. The officer brought them to me about a fortnight after, and I knew them to be our's - the marks were taken off. Only four were found - I lost six.</p>

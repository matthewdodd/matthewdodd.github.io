             5 l. 8 s. I had it in my pocket; thirty-four-guineas and 4 s. I was to go down into Kent, to lay it out for oysters, at a place called Whistable. It was all in a bag. I received it at Masey Island, in Essex, within nine miles of Colchester. I received it on Monday the 25th of last month, and lost it on Tuesday the 26th. I came up in a hoy, went on shore, and went to the Beehive in Nithtingale-lane, about two o'clock, where these two girls met with me. They inticed me to their lodging, a few doors from thence. I never was there in my life before. I was carried into a room, I do not know how high, I believe only up one pair of stairs. There was a bed in it. I did not pull off my clothes. When I was in the room Smith went out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to bed?</p>
               <p>Blois. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to sleep?</p>
               <p>Blois. No. I had been in the room perhaps half an hour, or thereabouts. Then Davidson took my money out of my left hand breeches pocket, and hastened out at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know she took it?</p>
               <p>Blois. There was nobody in the room but she and I; and I mist it as soon as she flew. I was going after her, and Smith stopped me at the door, while she got away.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you had your money when you was in the room?</p>
               <p>Blois. I am sure I had. I felt it, and had it in my hand. I was upon the bed with her, and she flew from me at once, and ran down stairs. When she was got away, I went and acquainted my friend with it, and the two prisoners were pursued and catched in a coach.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your pocket buttoned?</p>

               <p>Blois. No, there was never a button on it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was you upon the bed with Davidson?</p>

               <p>Blois. I do not know. I was not in the room above half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. What liquor had you?</p>
               <p>Blois. I believe we drank two or three pints of beer. I was not fuddled, but I was a little in liquor. The bag had

            . I first heard that the man had been with two whores, and had lost his money. About six o'clock we went and got information of one of our officers that the girl was in a coach. I went and stopped the coach by the May-pole. There were five people in it. The two prisoners were two of them. Blois only swore to Davidson. I took her to the watch-house and she was searched. The purse, eight guineas, and a nine-shilling-piece, were found upon her. He swore to the purse. (Produced in court, with the name

             and I went into the Beehive. I went to the fire to broil some bacon. She sat down on the right-hand side, and this man came in and called for a pint of beer. He sat down in the same box with her. They drank a pint of beer together. After I had done the bacon, I sat down in that box. He said, You may drink this pint, and we will have another. After that I called for a pint of beer and paid for it.

             and he sat still, talking together. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176910180050"></xptr> kept reading a paper. After that they asked me to drink a glass. Then they wanted to go home together, and asked me to go with them. I went. It was to No. 19, in Redcross-street, St. Catherine's, up one-pair-of-stairs. He gave me a shilling to go and fetch six-penny-worth of liquors. I went for it, and returned him the six-pence. I went about my business, and shut the door after me. I went to the washer-woman to get me a clean cap. Then I washed myself to go to Dr. Lioney, to have my face dressed. I then went up into the room. The man began to laugh and joke. He never took any notice of having lost any thing. He said, Where is the girl gone? I said I do not know. Then we went to this public house again, and called for six-penny-worth of liquor. Then he said I am going to Mr. Cockbourn's, and if you hear of such a girl, I should be obliged to you if you would let me know. I saw no more of him till about dusk in the evening. I was going to a sister of hers to buy her some cloaths. She called for a coach. We went together, and were stopped, and we were taken out, by whom I do not know, for I was a little in liquor. This was at the top of the Butcher-row in East-Smithfield. After that they searched me. I pulled off every thing I had. They found nothing on me. I was carried before the Justice in New Gravel-lane. There I saw a bag, and a quantity of money turned out upon the table. I never saw it before.</p>

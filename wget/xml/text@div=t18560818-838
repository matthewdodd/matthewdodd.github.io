                  </hi>. I was manager of the Crystal Palace Hotel, Norwood, up to 24th June. On 19th June, about 10 o'clock, I fastened the hotel up—I fastened the door leading to the verandah with a bar, and not considering it quite safe, I put an iron table against the shatter—it is a French window—the doors were fast—I went to bed at a little after 10 o'clock—next morning, at about half past 5 o'clock, I heard a heavy fall, but did not take notice of it on account of having a number of porters about the house—I know that it was; before 6 o'clock because I was called at about twenty minutes past 6 o'clock—I came down stairs, and found the French window wide open, the table thrown down and broken, and the marble slab thrown off it—the table weighed 80lbs.; the iron legs of it were broken—there were no marks of violence on the window—the iron bar had slipped off, it did not catch properly, but it was quite shut to—I missed about 26lbs. of wire, and several books, and this table cover (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this is the wire, and these four books I saw before I went to bed—I found all the property I lost—it is worth 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I was put in as manager, by the assignees of Thomas Masters—I carried it on for seven<lb></lb>teen months—I was appointed by Mr. Pennell, the official assignee, and by the trade assignee—it is now closed and given up to the mortgagee—it is part of a bankrupt's estate.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bath proprietor, of Anerley-road. On Tuesday, 20th June, about 6 o'clock in the morning, I heard a noise in the shrubbery in front of my house, and then saw the prisoner pass my door with this wire in this handkerchief—I asked him what he had in the bundle—he said, "Only a little wire; I am going to work"—I said, "You de not go till I see what you have got in that bundle"—he said, "Do not get a fellow into a row; it is only a little wire, you may take it"—(my premises are about twenty yards from the hotel)—I held him, and called a policeman; I then went to the hotel, called the porters up, who went to the back of the premises, and saw the window which had been entered—a marble table was overturned and broken, and the shutter bar was broken.</p>

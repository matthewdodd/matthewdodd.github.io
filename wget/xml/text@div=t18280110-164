               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, which, among much extraneous matter, contained the following statement: - On the day in question, I was passing along Marlborough-street, and went into the auction-room, where I saw the ink-stand on the table, and was looking at it, when a gentleman, close by me, said he had given 4s. for it, and I should have it for 1s. more - I paid 5s. for it, and took it away, in the presence of several people - I had scarcely proceeded towards the door, when the porter in the room stopped me;" and concluded by stating, that he was a foreigner, in comfortable circumstances, and could have no inducement to take an article of such a trifling value. <rs id="t18280110-164-verdict864" type="verdictDescription">

                  </hi> I am the wife of William Wilkinson, of 23, Port<lb></lb>land Road, Notting Hill, professor of music—in May last my husband was sued in the County Court by a person named Manton for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, and 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. costs—the first instalment, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., was paid by my husband on 5th June—I had some conversation with the prisoner about the payment of the second instalment—he called accidentally at my house the day before it ought to be paid into Court—I was ill at the tine, and did not see him—I sent the money down to him by my daughter into the drawing-room—I gave her 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I saw the prisoner that same evening, or it might have been the next—I asked him if he had paid it in—he said; "Yes, it is paid in and all right"—I then asked him for my receipt—he said he had it at home, and I should have that likewise—I gave him this paper at the time I sent the money down by my daughter—an execution was afterwards put in from the County Court—I saw the prisoner again that evening or the day after on my door steps—I called him to me at the window, "Mr. Boland, a pretty mess you have made of the County Court summons; you have never paid it in; the consequence was that, as we were going to dinner to-day, an officer from the County Court came to put an execution in, and I have had to pay the money over a second time"—he said that it had been paid in, and that it was a mistake of the clerk's, or a mistake of the County Court—I asked him if I could have the receipt—he said yes, it should come</p>

               <p>in with other receipts—he afterwards remarked that we were not to inquire at the County Court, as the clerk would get into trouble, perhaps lose his situation—he afterwards brought me this paper, in the same state in which it is now—I paid the amount of the execution—it was 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., it is dated 23rd July—when I gave it to the prisoner there was no signature to the second instalment (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>:—"June 4th, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., W.

                  </hi> I am a clerk in the Marylebone County Court, Middlesex—this paper is an order for payment by instalments in an action of Munton <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Wilkinson by consent of the parties—the first instalment was paid on 5th June—my signature is to that payment—I signed it when the money was paid—the "W.

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi>). My husband was indebted to the pri<lb></lb>soner at this time upon certain bills—there were two bills, and likewise at the time of the County Court affair a loan was obtained to meet a bill, for which Mr. Boland drew or signed as security—there were three bills then, but nothing like the amount of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—my husband had received the money upon two of the bills for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, not on the third, the prisoner was at that time trying to get us the loan—I never paid him a sixpence for anything he did—I have often asked him how we were to pay him back, and he has said, "I shall never charge you anything; wait till all is finished and then we shall see"—my husband had two sums of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each—the prisoner got nothing out of that to my knowledge—we did not get the whole 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he brought me rather less—if I remember right the bilk were drawn for that amount.</p>

                  </hi> I am a clerk—I am out of employment at present—I was employed by Mr. Boland for about eighteen months—he is a general agent, and negotiates many transactions for persons who are in want of it—I know a person named Channing who was in his service—he used to serve writs or anything of that sort, or do his business in any shape or form that was required—early in July I remember seeing Channing at the prisoner's—we were there together—I saw the prisoner hand him some money—I can't say exactly the amount, but money passed, with instructions for him to go to the County Court and pay it—I believe Chan<lb></lb>ning left for that purpose—he absconded some time after that—I don't know where he is—I had known him there between four and five months—I have seen him write—I have no belief about the signature of Bed<lb></lb>well to the second instalment; I don't know the writing at all—it is very similar to Channing's writing; there is a little alteration from his general writing—he generally joins his initial to his surname, the same as this is—that is the only thing I can recognise in it—the figure 6 bears a strong resemblance to his; he always made a 6 with a long stroke, the same as this.</p>

               <p>not so long as six—it was on 12th July that this money was given to Channing—I remember the date because we were there together at Mr. Boland's office; we were not always there together—Channing was not there long; he was between four and five months in Mr. Boland's service—I could not say exactly the time he came, not the month—he was not constantly going to the County Court to pay money; I don't remember his going many times—I was not before the Magistrate; I was there, but not called—a solicitor appeared for the prisoner—when he gave the money to Channing he said, "Take this money to the County Court and bring me the receipt"—I know what money it was—it was 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, or about 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or something like it; I could not say exactly—I know money was paid to him by Mr. Boland; I could not say exactly the amount—I was busy making out papers—it was the Marylebone County Court—there a little similarity in the signature of Bedwell to Channing's writing, not much—I know Channing's genuine signature—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a paper</hi>)—that is more like his writing; I believe that to be his—the only similarity in Bed well's signature is the joining of the initial of the Christian name to the surname—I know the prisoner's writing; I see no similarity in it to his.</p>

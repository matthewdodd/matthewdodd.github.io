                  </hi>. I live in Abchurch-lane; I am a lamplighter, in the employ of the City of London Gas Company. On 27th May I was on London-bridge, to put out the gaslights, about 20 minutes past 3 o'clock—I met a female on the bridge—she had a white straw bonnet on, trimmed with white ribbon—there was no one with her—she was on the west side of the bridge—I passed her—she was coming towards London; I was going to the south—I met her about the sixth column of the bridge—she had just got on the bridge from the south—I returned in about five minutes, and when I came back near the spot I saw the same female standing on the outer ledge of the bridge—that was further on towards London, fifty or sixty yards from where I had seen her before—when I saw her on this outside ledge, the prisoner was standing on the seat in the recess—he had hold of her wrist—I did not take notice which wrist it was; she was standing still—I noticed a man lying on the seat of the recess apparently asleep—the prisoner let go the woman's wrist, and I heard him say, "Jump in, go in, I will follow you"—on his saying that, she walked a small distance from him, and then dropped herself over—I went to the prisoner, and said to him, "You vagabond, you have murdered that girl"—he said, "My God! I did not think she would do it!"—I saw the girl in the water; she was floating up towards Blackfriars-bridge—I heard her call out, "Help! help! save me!"—that was when she was in the water—I gave an alarm, but she sank before the boats could get to her—she sank as near off Calvert's as could be—a person named Broom was on the east side of the bridge; he came over to the recess where the prisoner was standing, and laid hold of his collar—the officer took him.</p>

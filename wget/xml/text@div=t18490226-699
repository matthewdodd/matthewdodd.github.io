                  </hi> I shall be thirteen next birth-day. On 31 st Jan. I was out with a chaise with my master's two little children in it—his name is John Rawlings—one of the children is Sarah Rawlings; she had a whittle on—the prisoner came up and told me I was not to go too fast, for if I did I should get run over—she told me to wait till all the carriages and horses were gone by, and then I might cross, that I must walk np and down while the children's mother was getting ready to go out—she then took a shawl off Sarah Rawlings, put it at her feet, and said she would carry the chaise across the New-road—she then said I was to go down that street, and my mother was coming down Horner-street—she then said, "You mind the chaise before, and I will mind it behind"—I kept looking back, and she said, "What do you keep looking back for, I can mind it behind"—we went on to the corner, and there was a valentine shop—she said, "Will you like to look at them"—I said I had seen them before that day—she said, "Well, we will cross; I do not see her coming"—she said, Sarah's mother was going to Rotherhithe to tea—I said, "How very strange she never told me, I suppose that is what we had the chaise for"—she then said, would I have any sweet-stuff—I said, "No; I did not want any"—she took the chaise, went on a little way, and ran a little way; she then dropped the handle of the chaise, and ran on with the whittle—I ran, but could not see her any more.</p>

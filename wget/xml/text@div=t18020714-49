I came on shore at seven o'clock in the evening; I called the prisoner, who is a waterman, and told him I would give him sixpence and a pot of beer; he put me on shore at Deptford; I went to a public-house, and I went to the bar to pay the mistress for a pot of beer, and the prisoner left the house while I was paying for the beer, they waited for me next to the windmill; he had a stick, about half the length of his arm, and the first rap he gave me with it, was on the right side of my neck.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before you left the public-house, did the prisoner leave it? - A. In a minute, the second rap he gave me over my side, then he struck me on the head, then he collared me, and put his hand into my trowsers pocket, and turned it inside out, he took out the notes, and from my waistcoat pocket he took the two half-guineas, and two-pence; there was a man with a brown coat with him, that man collared me and took my silk handkerchief from me, which cost me two Spanish dollars; I had had a drop on board the ship, when the captain paid me my money.</p>

               <p>Court. He describes it to be at Deptsord, but in that he is certainly mistaken, from his description of the place, it must have been the Poplar side of the water.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Bevil. Q. Is not the public-house where you landed, called the King's arms? - A. I do not know.</p>

               <p>Q. But why are you thus positive? - A. I went that day to give warning to my landlady to quit the house; I had been to give warning before, but my landlady was not at home.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did he come to your house? - A. The clock struck seven as he sat down in the chair.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to notice the time so exactly- does he not frequently come to your house? - A. He and his wife came every night.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to remark the time? - A. On account of giving warning.</p>
               <p>Q. But how are you able to state the hour of the night so exactly? - A. I took particular notice, that when I came home, the clock struck seven, but not the yard clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did he come into your house the night before? - A. The night before, I think it was nine.</p>
               <p>Q. What makes you think it was nine o'clock? - A. He told me his wife was poorly.</p>
               <p>Q. His wife being poorly does not prove it was nine o'clock? - A. My husband came in from work about the same time.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember at what time of night of the 13th he came in? - A. I cannot say.</p>

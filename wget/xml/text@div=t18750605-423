                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector K</hi>). On the 25th April, about 3 o'clock in the morning, I went to 3, Charles Street, Bromley—I found the prisoner there, he was asleep or professing to be asleep—he had his trowsers and boots on and was standing leaning over the bed—I roused him up and told him I should take him into custody for stabbing one of my constables—he made no reply, a sergeant was with me—I took hold of him by the wrist and the sergeant the other arm and we were bringing him down a very narrow steep staircase, where he began to struggle and I had to release my hold—he made a kick at mo and caught me in my left thumb, which dislocated it—he kicked me in the shin and took the skin off my right shin in two places—when we got him in the street he made a grasp at my testicles, but instead of catching hold of me there he caught hold of my skirt and trowsers—I was obliged to press him back on the ground, I went down with him and remained with my knee on him till a constable released his hold—I saw him make one or two kicks at Sergeant Buck—we got him to the station at last with assistance, he was obliged to be carried part of the way—he had the appearance of a man who had been drinking some few hours before—I was in plain clothes, the constables were in uniform.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman K</hi> 54). I went with the last witness to take prisoner—as we were going downstairs he was very violent, he kicked me on the right side just below my belt and he made a second kick at me, I had my truncheon drawn, I struck him with it across the knee and that stopped it, otherwise it would have caught my privates, I should have been injured for life if I had not struck him—I had my truncheon out to knock at the door as we could get no answer at first.</p>

I was with the other constables—on going downstairs the prisoner kicked me twice on the leg and he also kicked at the inspector and Sergeant Buck—when we got outside he threw himself on his back and kicked violently, indiscriminately at any one near him—we had great difficulty in getting him to the station.</p>

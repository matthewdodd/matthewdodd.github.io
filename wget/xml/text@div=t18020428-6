               <p>THOMAS BROWN sworn. - I am a smith: On the evening of the 12th of March, I was going up John-street, I saw the prisoner standing at Mr. Evans's door; I then saw a tray fall, which the prisoner took up, and walked away with.</p>
               <p>Q. How near the door was it? - A. It was partly in and partly out; I saw James Evans go after him, and take him; the tray was brought back to the shop; this is the same tray.</p>
               <p>PHILIP SIMMONS sworn. - I am a butcher: I had been to Newgate-market, I was going up John-street home, and saw the prisoner looking at a tea-board; it was hanging at the side of the door; I waited, turned myself round, and saw the prisoner walk away for the space of five yards; he came back again, and looked at it a second time, and turned it over; I thought to see in what manner it was fastened; I desired a young man and a young woman, that was coming by, to take notice of that man, for I did not think he was after any good; and, as I was speaking to them, I heard the tea-board fall; he went away with it, and young Mr. Evans came out, and I told him to go round the corner directly; I had a load upon my head, that I could not go after him myself; I waited there till the man and the board were both brought back.(The tray was identified by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I have very little to say: I think they have aggravated the business in two instances, to make it a capital offence. In the first place, charging it to be in the dwelling-house; and, in the next place, in the value of the article; but I leave it to your Lordship and the Gentlemen of the Jury. GUILTY, aged 58.</p>

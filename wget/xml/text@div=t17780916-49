On the 11th of August the prisoner and another man came to my master's shop, and asked to look at some handkerchiefs; they looked at several; while the shopman was serving them, as I was going into the back parlour, I looked over my shoulder and saw the prisoner putting these handkerchiefs in his left-hand-pocket; I came back into the shop; the shopman desired me to cut off a handkerchief for the prisoner; while he went to the door, the prisoner, suspecting as I imagine that he was discovered, took an opportunity to draw the handkerchiefs out of his pocket. I said I thought he was come on such an errand as that; he then ran away as fast as he could; I cried, stop thief! and he was pursued and taken. When he was brought back, and was in the back parlour, I heard the prisoner desire the other man to put some books which he had into his inside pocket, where I said he put the handkerchiefs, that it might appear there was not room for the handkerchiefs.</p>

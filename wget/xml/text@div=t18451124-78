                  </hi>. I am in the employ of George Cottam and another, ironmongers, in Castle-street; the prisoner was their porter. On the 6th of Nov., about half-past eight o'clock, I saw this set of fire-irons in front of a stove in the shop—I took them up and looked at them—in about half an hour I missed them—I inquired if any one had seen them go out, and theysaid no—I found them behind the same stove that they had been in front ofwhen I first saw them—they had the same mark on them that I had seenbefore—they remained there about half an hour—the prisoner was then sentout, and I missed the fire-irons—I went after the prisoner, and he had themin his hand in Castle-street, and two fenders besides—he saw me, and wentdown a mews—he came out without the fire-irons, which were found in thestable—I am sure I saw them in his hand.</p>

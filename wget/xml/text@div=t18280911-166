               <p>Prisoner JONES. When the watchman had hold of us, you said I had your handkerchief. Witness. I said one of you had it.</p>

I was coming from the English Opera, and must acknowledge I did speak to the prosecutor; I had not been speaking to him above three minutes, when a person told him his pocket had been picked; I turned, and saw Maloney with a handkerchief in his hand, in the act of giving it to Jones - they were then about a yard from the gentleman, but seeing me look at them, the handkerchief was dropped between them; they crossed the road, and I took up the handkerchief, and sought for the owner - I spoke to a watchman, who took me to the watch-house, and there I found the prosecutor and the two prisoners.</p>
               <p>Prisoner JONES. She said she was along with the gentleman arm-in-arm. Witness. No, I had not hold of his arm.</p>

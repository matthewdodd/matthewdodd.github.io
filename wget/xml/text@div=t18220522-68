Another was behind me, the prisoner made a violent snatch at my chain; in doing which, I put my left hand down to save my watch, and found the chain broken, it was gone before I touched it; the watch was left. I immediately pursued the gang, they all dispersed immediately I pursued them across Moorfields, to Long-alley, and finding my watch was safe, I did not go. I heard on Saturday there was a gang of three people taken up, I went to Worship-street, the officer took me into a room; I immediately pointed out the prisoner, the moment I saw him. I had no doubt of him whatever.</p>

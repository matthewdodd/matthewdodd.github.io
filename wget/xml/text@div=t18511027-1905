                  </hi>. I am a boot and shoe maker, residing at 1, Hanover-place, Vincent-terrace, Islington; I have lived in my present house four years, and in the vicinity about seventeen. I am frequently in the habit in the course of my business of attending at the Clothes' Exchange, chiefly for the purpose of buying old boot backs—I remember Tuesday, 9th Sept., perfectly well—I heard of the prisoner's wife being taken into custody before he was—I saw Mr. Jones in the market on 9th Sept., I was in Fill's-buildings, which is an entrance to the market, between 11 and 12 o'clock in the morning—a man came into the market with a basket on his head, and asked some man standing there <hi rend="italic">to</hi> assist him down with it—the man did so—he then opened the lid—Mr. Jones, myself, and several others, congregated around to see the contents of the basket—(Wolf I met as I was leaving—I am not personally acquainted with Woodruff)—it contained a quantity of ladies' boots and shoes—I think they were similar to those produced—some had black bottoms, and some had white—I took hold of half a dozen pairs of the boots, and asked the man the price of them—he said, "I don't sell them in parts, they all go together—Jones was then standing there—he laid his handkerchief down on the pave<lb></lb>ment,</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did you first hear of this transaction afterwards? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I heard them talk of it in the lane some time after, perhaps a month ago—I heard the Jews talking of Jones being in custody about some boots and shoes—I did not hear of it till after he was in custody—I did not hear that he was not to be found—I did not go to the police court—I told this story about the man in the velveteen coat about a fortnight or three weeks ago to some parties, and they introduced me to Mrs. Jones; I told her what I knew of the affair, and she asked if I would have any objection to go to her solicitor's, and state to him what I had told her—I said I would go with pleasure, if it would do her any good; and I went with her to the solicitor, and made my statement, which he took down in writing; that was last Monday week—I did not know anything of Mrs. Jones before; I had only known the prisoner by seeing him, and his name only by hearing it, nothing more—when I heard of his being in custody, I remembered the circumstance occurring, and I made it known, as soon as I could make it convenient to go down again among the Jews—that may be more than a week ago; it may be a fortnight—I had my work to attend to; I went as soon as I could—I heard about three weeks or a month ago that the prisoner was in custody on a charge of having some boots in his possession, which had been stolen—the first time I again went to the market, I mentioned to the Jews there what I have stated to-day—I cannot say whether I mentioned it on the first or second occasion, but I did men<lb></lb>tion it.</p>

New boots are brought up from the country in great quantities—I have constantly been in the habit of buying them there—I was there on 9th Sept., about half-past 11 o'clock in the morning—the place was crowded—I saw about a dozen persons assembled round Mr. Jones, who was purchasing, and a man who was selling—he was a man about five feet nine in height, or he might be taller—he was dressed in a velveteen coat, with a kind of cape—he had the appearance of a countryman—he was selling women's cashmere boots with black bottoms—they were very similar to those now lying before me—they were in a rather long brown basket, similar to what boots come in from the country—I know Lambden—I saw him there—he was going away at the time I came up—he called my attention to the boots, and said, "Can you buy that lot?"—I cannot say exactly the words, but something to call my attention to business—I then looked at the boots—Jones had put a handkerchief on the ground, and was putting them out of the basket into the handkerchief, looking at them—I took up a pair, and asked the price; and he said, "Put them down; the lot go together;" and the prisoner said, "Don't you see I am <hi rend="italic">on,</hi> "meaning," I am about to buy"—it is a general understanding in the market, when that is said, that others are not to interfere—I then walked away, and heard no more.</p>

Q.</hi> Do you often go to this market? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I recol<lb></lb>lect very well that I was there on 9th Sept.; I was there on the Friday previous—the 9th was on a Tuesday—I bought two pairs of Wellington boots on the Friday—I have been in the habit of purchasing there for the last twenty years; not new boots; I go principally to buy old Wellingtons, to re-foot—I have purchased new and old—I looked at the man with the boots—I should know him again—he had on a dark velveteen coat, something between a brown and a black, a dark dingy velveteen coat—I did not notice the cap—I have known the prisoner three or four years, or more, by being in the market—he is a different buyer to me—it was generally stated round that there were about 100 pairs of boots in the basket—I heard afterwards that the prisoner was apprehended—I read the account in the paper—I did not see him from the 9th until he was apprehended—I did not know where he was, or that he had been away—I did not immediately, on reading about this, go and tell what I knew—I read that he was taken for receiving a large quantity of boots—I first told this story when Mrs. Jones called on me—I do not say I might not have mentioned to some one in the market about Jones buying these things; it might have occurred between Lambden and me—I have known Lambden sixteen or seventeen years—I think we had a con<lb></lb>versation about it—we talked it over at the time I was called on by Mrs. Jones—I do not say we might not have spoken about the matter before, but not about being a witness—I cannot recollect when I first spoke to Lambden about it, or whether I spoke to him before Mrs. Jones came to me—I often see Lambden in the market, and away from the market as well—I did not know that Jones was keeping out of the way after 9th Sept.—I knew nothing at all about the matter till I read it in the paper—I did not go to the police-office—I mentioned nothing particular to any one that I know of till Mrs. Jones called on me—I left before the bargain was completed—when he</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clothier, and have lived at 12, Carlisle-street, Portman-market, fifteen years. I am in the habit of attending the Clothes' Exchange every Hay—on Tuesday, 9th Sept., I was there—I do not remem<lb></lb>ber seeing Mr. Jones there; I might have seen him—I saw a man in the market with boots, about 20 minutes or half-past 11 o'clock—he had a country appearance—he had on a dark velvet coat—he had a basket lying on the pavestones, full of females' boots—I took up some of them to look at—I cannot positively say whether Jones was by at that time—I did not see a handkerchief on the ground—a person who was kneeling down in a stooping position, said, "Can't you put them down? don't yon see I am looking at them?"—I then threw down the boots and left, or I would have bought a pair or two for my wife.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Have you known the prisoner long? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Between five and six years—I very often see him at the market—my attention was drawn to the man with the boots as I entered the market—I remarked him—I should certainly know him again—his coat might have been a dark brown, or a black faded—I am positive he had a cap on, not a hat—I did not notice the colour of it—all descriptions of goods come to this market, daily and hourly, boots, shoes, watches, earrings, jewellery, and all descriptions of wearing-apparel, and pawnbrokers' stock—it is usual for a man of that appearance to come into the market with a large quantity of boots and shoes—I have often seen it: I cannot say when—I have seen it invariably, in the course of the twenty years I have been dealing there—I have, on various occasions, seen boots and shoes brought in by a man of that description—I do not know what quantity there was—I would sooner say fifty pairs than ten—I have seen larger quantities than fifty pairs brought, not by a country<lb></lb>man, perhaps—I cannot say when—there was nothing strange in a man of his appearance having such a quantity of boots and shoes to sell—I cannot be certain that I saw Mr. Jones on the 9th—I have not seen him since—I heard that he had got into trouble about this—it might be two days after<lb></lb>wards, or it might be the next day—What did you ask me, Sir?—it might have been a fortnight after—I first heard that his wife had got into trouble, not him—I first heard about his getting into trouble three weeks or a month ago—I did not then mention what I have stated to-day—I did not tell it to any one till I was applied to by Mrs. Jones—it might have been last Monday week that I first heard of the prisoner getting into trouble—it might have been three weeks or a month ago that I heard of Mrs. Jones getting into trouble—Mrs. Jones must have heard that I saw the boots, she came to me first, and then I told what I had seen—no one was with me in the market that morning—I went there to purchase, and I did purchase—I came away before the bargain was completed—there were seven or eight persons standing round.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a glass-dealer. On Tuesday, 9th or 10th Sept., I was at the Clothes' Exchange between 11 and 12 o'clock—I saw Mr. Jones there, holding the handle of a flat basket, in Fill's-buildings—it was a long flat basket, apparently about three feet long—there was another man there—the prisoner requested me to assist that man with the basket, and show him where he lived—I did so, and went with him to the prisoner's house—he was a tall man, about five feet nine or ten—he had on a velveteen shooting-coat—the basket apparently contained woman's boots—I and the man placed it on a table in the prisoner's house—the prisoner came in a minute or two</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185110270084"></xptr>
               <p>afterwards, and gave the man twelve sovereigns—he said he had paid dear enough for the articles he had purchased—his wife was present, and some of his children—Mr. Jones was about taking the boots out of the basket, and several of his children came round him, and he said, "I am afraid these boots will be soiled, I had better take them up-stairs," and he and the man took them up-stairs—I saw the man come down with the empty basket in his hand and go away.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was that the man in the velvet shooting-coat? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I am quite sure of that—it was a dark coat—he had a cap on—I saw Mr. Jones count the twelve sovereigns on the table—I have known him about five years—I go to the market occasionally, once or twice a week—not to purchase, I merely go there as a near cut—I live in that direction—I heard of Mr. Jones getting into trouble about this, about seven weeks ago; at least Mrs. Jones—I believe it was the day after the boots were bought that I heard of Mrs. Jones getting into trouble—I heard of the prisoner getting into trouble about three weeks after—this is the first time I have seen him since the purchase—I heard that he was away from home—I did not go to his house to see—I heard it was on account of those boots—I did not mention what I have stated to-day till Mrs. Jones came and asked me if I recollected the circumstance about bringing the man with the boots to her place—I am very seldom in the habit of going to the prisoner's house—I had been there before, Mrs. Jones knew where I lived—she did not call on me about this till after the prisoner was apprehended.</p>

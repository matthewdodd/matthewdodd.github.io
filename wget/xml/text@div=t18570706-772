                  </hi>. I am a carter, in the employ of Henry Budd, of Little Stanmore. On this Tuesday morning, between 2 and 3 o'clock, I went into the yard with my master's horses, and saw the prisoners run round the rick; one had a black coat, and the other a smock—I jumped off my horse, ran down to the stack of beans, and it was just on fire, and had only been burning a minute or two—I ran after them a little way, and then tried to put it out, but could not—I then ran after the men—they ran into a field and parted, one went towards Edgware, and one towards Harrow; I followed Dawson and took him—I saw Gardner in custody about 7 or 8 o'clock in the morning—the rick was burned down.</p>

                  </hi>. On 16th June, about half past 3 in the morning, I was on duty in the neighbourhood of Edgware, and saw Gardner coming up a lane nearly a mile and a half from the prosecutor's house—I said, "Stop, my man, I think you are a deserter"—he said, "No, I am not"—I said, "I believe you are," and asked him whether he had ever been in the army—he admitted that he had, and was discharged for bad conduct—I said, "Where is your discharge?"—he said, "I have torn it up"—I said, "You must go with me"—he said, "Well, it is no use my hiding the fact, I have been at Edgware, and me and my mate set fire to a rick by lighting our pipes"—I said, "You are mad to talk like that, as I have only just come from Edgware"—I afterwards went to Edgware, and found that a rick was burned.</p>

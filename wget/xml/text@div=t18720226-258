                  </hi>. I live at 9, Raven Row, Mile End—on 26th January, between 6 and 7 o'clock in the evening, I went into the Roman Arms, Roman Road, at the back of the New Model Prison—the prisoners came in after me, and Maney struck me at the side of the temple—it had not power enough to knock me down, but he cuddled me round the arms and we both fell on the floor, and the other prisoners fell, one on the top of me, and the other pulled my coat open—I had a purse in my breast pocket, containing three sovereigns, three half sovereigns, and 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. pieces—it was safe in the purse, because I took 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. out when I went in there and put the purse back in my breast pocket—the prisoners ran away, and I walked to the door and called a policeman—I had met Maney that afternoon in the cattle market, where I sold a horse—the three prisoners were present—the money I lost was not the proceeds of the sale—I went there intending to buy a pony, and offered money for one in the prisoners' presence—I saw them all three together next evening at Mr. Hicks' public-house—I am sure of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had had a pint of half-and-half before that—I was going to buy a pony, and took my purse out, but nobody saw me take it out except the man belonging to the pony—I missed my money when I got to the railway station, which is next door to the public house, but I knew before that that I had been robbed.</p>

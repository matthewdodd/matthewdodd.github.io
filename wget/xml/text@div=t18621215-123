                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor in this case, and a merchant carrying on business at Great Tower-street—I was formerly at 14, Little Tower-street—I have known the prisoner for about three or four months; I think I saw him first in August or September last—he called several times at my office; the first time he requested me to give him a commission for the sale of tea in the west of England—I told him I was not then wishing to extend my business—he either at that time, or on one or two subsequent occasions, mentioned the names of several London grocers and tea-dealers, and asked if I did business with them—with some I said I did,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186212150024"></xptr>
               <p>with others not—he said they were friends of his, and if he should get orders from them, would I pay him for them—I said I had no objection provided I approved the names—he mentioned the names of several he said were friends of his; he said that he had got some Chancery business, and that his wife was near her confinement, so that he did not care much about going out into the country; he was not entirely dependent on it, but if he made a little money it would help him on—I said, "If you get orders from names that I approve, those that you mention particularly I shall be most happy to execute them, and will pay you for your trouble"—he called several times between that and entering the order on which I am prose<lb></lb>cuting—he called on the 23rd October, and entered an order for two half-chests of tea, to be sent to Grainger Brothers, in the Walworth-road—he made an entry in a book; that book was produced before the Magistrate, but it has since been burnt in the fire which took place at my premises in Little Tower-street—he did not make an entry in my order book; every one had a book specially for himself—a book was given to the prisoner which belonged to a traveller who had left us; it was a book that was kept at our office.</p>

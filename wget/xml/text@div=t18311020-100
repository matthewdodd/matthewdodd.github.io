On the 5th of October I arrived from the country- I took a hackney-coach at the Bull and Mouth, to take me and my family home; the prisoner was the driver - I put a small parcel in, and took the number of the coach; I had two cloaks on my arm - I put them on the seat of the coach- when we arrived at home I took my wife and children out; I then took the luggage from the prisoner, and handed it to my young man, but I did not receive the cloaks - I forgot them for about ten minutes; I then went to see for the coach, but could not find it; it was then about nine o'clock in the evening - I went the next morning to the office in Essex-street: they gave me the address of the proprietor of the coach - I went there, and saw a lady, who said she should see the man in the morning, and no doubt my cloaks would be forthcoming, but I have not seen them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Was it in the evening that you arrived? A. Yes, by the Shrewsbury coach- I had not seen the prisoner before; I waited four days after I made the inquiry; there were four boxes in the coach, and one paper parcel, and I believe an umbrella - they were all given out but the cloaks; I am positive he is the person - the gas was burning in the shop when I paid him his fare; they were two blue camblet cloaks, one lined with scarlet and one with blue.</p>

            . I am horsekeeper to Mrs. Halfpenny - she is the proprietor of the coach; the prisoner drove it - he had been in her service two or three weeks; he went out between nine and ten o'clock on the 5th of October, and was to return between one and two o'clock in the morning - when I went to the yard the next morning the coach and horses were safe, and the prisoner went to work the next day, as usual; this was on the Wednesday, and he worked on the Thursday - as he came home with short money my mistress sent him out again.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you tell the Magistrate that he did not come back the next day? A. No, Sir, I did not; I was examined- I can write - this is my signature; what I stated was correct.</p>
               <p>Q. Then what did you mean by this - (read) - "The last day the prisoner was at work was last Wednesday week - he did not come next morning?" A. He did not come without being fetched; I went for him - he came on the Thursday, went out with the coach, and did not return- I did not state, to the best of my knowledge, that he did not return.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then he did come? A. Yes -I told the Magistrate he was short of his fare on the Wednesday, and on the Thursday he did not return; he would have had to make up the money which he was short; that is the usual way with those who have been but a short time - I was present when the prosecutor made his last application to my mistress, and I went for the prisoner; I found him standing against the first coach in Aldersgate-street - I did not know the business rightly; I asked him for my mistress' key and money, and said a gentleman wanted to speak to him; he, I, and two or three more then went and had something to drink - we then went back, and the prosecutor went and spoke to him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The gentleman came and said, "I left two cloaks in your coach;" I said it was more than I knew, and I would go where he pleased; he then went into a shop - I could have got away, but I knew myself innocent.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS to MR. BALDWIN. Q. Did you go to the coach-stand and speak to him? A. Yes - I told him I left two cloaks in his coach - he said he knew nothing about it; I said he certainly had them, and if he did not give them to me I should give him in charge - I went into Mr. Matthews's shop, close by, to inquire for an officer, but I looked through the window at the prisoner all the time; I was there while Mr. Matthews sent for an officer, perhaps ten minutes - he made no attempt to go away, but I told him I would take care he should not.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. How was the coach left when the prisoner came into your house? A. The coach door was shut, as I believe.</p>

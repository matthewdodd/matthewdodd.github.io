                  </hi>. I am manager to Barbara and Anna Reeves, pawn<lb></lb>brokers, 13, Red Cross-street—on 10th July, about 11 in the morning, the prisoner, who was a customer, came and offered a pair of men's boots for 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had some silver out of the till for the purpose of paying her, when one of the Misses Reeve knocked at the door at the back, and asked me to give her change for a sovereign—I took the sovereign, threw it on the counter, counted out 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and gave it to Miss Reeve—a youth, named Astley, was assisting in the shop, but there was no other customer—when I turned to the counter Astley almost immediately said, in the prisoner's hearing, "I saw Mrs. Riley take a sovereign off of the counter"—the prisoner said, "It is the half sovereign you gave me for the boots I have just pledged"—I had not then made any advance on the boots—I made no answer, but gave her 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., the advance on the boots—she then said, "This is one of several half-sovereigns my housekeeper has to keep for me," holding it in her hand—she did not appear to know that it was a sovereign, but I could see it in her hand—she said, "This sovereign I brought out to buy a shawl with"—one of the young men who then came into the shop showed her a shawl—she purchased it for 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and paid a deposit of 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on it and went away—when she was gone a calculation was made.</p>

ATKINSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is the young man here who howed her the shawl? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; he has left us—there is no glass door at the back of the shop—I do not remember that the till was open to get silver out when I threw the sovereign on the counter; it might have been—I have never found sovereigns pitch on the edge and roll on the other side—I have not almost persuaded myself into the belief that I put the sovereign into the till—I said that I endeavoured to persuade myself so, but I did not succeed—when the boy told me that he saw the prisoner pick it up I did not immediately charge her, because I endeavoured to get it back by other means; and being a customer, I did not believe she would be dishonest enough to do so—I did not even ask her for it—I had not paid her for the boots, and I actually paid her for them afterwards, knowing at the time that she had a sovereign of my mistresses in her possession—my memory is not in a haze in the slightest; what I have stated I believe to be the truth—I believe she said that she had got a sovereign belonging to her husband sewn up in her dress—I actually had doubts in my mind whether she had taken the sovereign or not, as 1 know her as a customer—she priced the shawl before she went—she said that she had sewn the sovereign up in her drew unknown to her husband, and that her object was to buy a shawl with it—the young man left the service a fortnight ago, through illness; it had nothing to do with this—I could find him—the prisoner's husband was somewhere in the street while she was pledging the boots—he came in before she left, and she gave him the halfpence—I do not remember his taking the half-crown—the prisoner held out the sovereign, and said, "Here is the sovereign; but give me the shawl first"—about a quarter of an hour afterwards she came back with her husband and brought six half-crowns, which I took possession of, and would not give up—she told me she knew nothing whatever about my sovereign, when she said that she had sewn it up in her dress to buy a shawl.</p>

                  </hi>. I was assistant at the pawnbroking establishment of the Misses Reeve, on July 10, but have left—about 11, on that morning, the prisoner came—there was no one else in the same box—there are four boxes which run along in front of the counter, and there is also a certain space free from boxes—I do not think there was anybody else in the other boxes, or in the part which is not boxed off—when Bassett was engaged serving the prisoner, somebody came to the door—he then went to the door, and threw a sovereign on the counter—it did not roll off; but while he was engaged in counting the silver and taking it to the door, the prisoner took the sovereign up—I directly said to Bassett, "That woman has taken the sovereign off the counter that you have thrown down"—the prisoner held it in her hand, and I said, "The sovereign you picked up does not belong to you"—she said, "It is the half-sovereign the foreman has just given me</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186108190046"></xptr>
               <p>for the boots"—I had not seen her receive any money for the boots-a shawl was afterwards shown to her, and she left the shop—I then gave further information to Bassett.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was the till open at the time the sovereign was thrown? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Half way—it is not very large; there is a bowl in it, but quite at the back—I saw the till before he pitched the sovereign—he pitched it over the top of the till—I left after the other young man—both he and Bassett served the shawl, I believe—I spoke to the prisoner twice—it was four or five minutes after that that I told Bassett again—the prisoner went round and came to the other part of the shop—she told me to fetch her husband in, and I did so—I said nothing to him about the sovereign—I thought it was no business of mine to speak to him—I did not see the husband give half-a-crown towards the deposit—I was standing at the other end of the shop, and do not know what he said—I did not bear the prisoner say that the sovereign she had in her hand she had sewn up in her dress—when she came into our place she said that it was one of a great. many her housekeeper was minding for her.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You thought it quite absurd to be looking? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; but I looked very carefully to satisfy him—I did not look particularly carefully—I did not see the foreman find it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Thomas Mackness, a baker—the prisoner was in his employ as a journeyman. On the 17th of Dec. I missed a quartern and two half-quartern loaves, from a shelf in a spare room behind the shop—in consequence of that I marked a quartern and two half-quarterns, and placed them there again on the morning of the 18th—the prisoner was on the premises at the time—he went out about two hours after to serve his customers with bread—about two minutes after he left I went into the spare room, and missed the quartern and two half-quarterns that I had marked and placed there—I went for a policeman, went after the prisoner, and brought him back—he had the quartern and two half-quarterns which I had marked, in his basket—when he receives his bread for delivery, he places the quantity of loaves he wants on the counter, and I take account of them, and when he returns from serving his customers, he has to give me an account of them again—he takes those loaves from the shop, not from the spare room—there ought not to be any bread put into the spare room—it was finding the three loaves there the day before that created my suspicion.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman.</hi>) I was sent for after the prisoner—I saw him go out from the shop with a basket, and go some little distance—he then put his basket down, and went to serve a customer—while he was gone I found these loaves in his basket—I had seen them previously marked in the shop—I asked him who he was going to supply that bread with—he said, "What?"—I said, "Who are you going to serve with this bread?"—he made no answer, and I took him to the shop.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I went to serve my customers, and came in again, and put my basket down; I put my jacket and waistcoat on, and went to serve my customers again; I did not know the bread was in my basket; it was bread that had been counted out to me; I had a good character; the witness knows I left a place close by to come to Mr. Mackness.</p>

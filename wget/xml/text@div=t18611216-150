                  </hi>. I am forewoman to Thomas Welch and others, at their manufactory in Southwark-bridge-road—I have to receive goods when they are brought into the machine-room, and make an entry of them in this book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I find here an entry in my own writing of a gross of collars, called Oxfords, No, 275, on 29th October, 1860—I mark the collars when I enter them, with the number of the gross—I find my mark on these collars (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) 275—all the gross were marked 275—they also have on them the stamp of the owner, "W and M," the usual stamp that we place on goods—after I have entered and stamped them, they are passed over the counter for some of the hands to sew—each of the workpeople has a book in which I enter the goods given to them to work up in the work-room—this is one of the books—after they are stitched up they are brought back to me, and are then given back to be tacked—they are then brought to me again, and are again given to another person to stitch again; they are then button<lb></lb>holed, and sent to the laundress to be dressed—I do not find in my book any entry of the receipt of these collars back again after I first gave them out—I did not have them again—this gross has never been finished—some of the collars produced are Paragon collars—they also belong to Messrs. Welch and Margetson—none of these are finished goods a; they are—not in a state to be sold in our establishment.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employment of Messrs.

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Charles Vass, a labourer, at 47, Bickleigh-street, Lambeth—I work as a needle—woman—I know the prisoner—I went to his shop in the early part of October; it was the Sunday morning before I went before the Magistrate—I went there for the purpose of leaving a parcel; the shop is termed a leaving shop—he advances money upon things—he puts a ticket on the parcel, but does not give any ticket—while I was there a man came in to buy a collar; after he had left, the prisoner asked me if I was not a collar maker—I said "Yes"—he said he had got a lot of collars that wanted finishing, would I take them and do them, and I said T would as I was slack of work—he said it was not convenient to show them to me then, would I call again—I did call on the Monday morning—he said he had not got them ready—I called on the Tuesday, and he then showed me the collars; there were five dozen and a half of one kind, two of another, and a dozen and a half of another; they were the same collars that were after<lb></lb>wards shown to me by the officer—two dozen were entirely finished, and the rest were unfinished—he asked me what I would do them for—I said I would do them for a shilling a dozen—he said he could not afford that, they were not worth that to him, he wanted them to sell in the shop—I told him they were worth 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a dozen—he said if I liked to have them he would self them to me for what he gave for them—I told him I did not want any—I was going out of the shop and he called me back—I do sot remember what</p>

               <p>he said, but I took up the collars and looked at them a second time, and I saw Mr. Welch's mark on them—I looked at a dozen separately, and saw they were all marked—I asked him who he bought them of, and he said of a tall, thin woman—I said, "Do you know they are stolen collars; that Mr. Welch's mark is on them"—he did not make any answer—I told him they belonged to the firm I worked for, and I would not have anything to do with them—it was before I found out the mark that he offered them to me at a shilling a dozen—I went directly to the firm, and told them.</p>

I left Mrs. Courtenay to take some of them; I ran a few yards, and secured the prisoner - the other man ran off; the prisoner said "What is the matter?" I charged him with robbing me of my watch, which he denied, but said he knew the person who did it - I gave him in charge to the watchman. I missed my watch instantly as I was jostled against; it was safe shortly before. I am positive he is the man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. You told the Magistrate you was sure I did not take it - A. I said I could not say he took the watch, but he was one of the party. He said he knew who took it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming down Holborn, two young men jostled against me, and ran down Field-lane, I turned round to see what was the matter, heard no cry, and was going on, when the prosecutor came and laid hold of me. It is not likely I should have let him take me without resisting, if I had been one of the party.</p>

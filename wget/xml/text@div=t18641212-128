                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Blanchard, a linen<lb></lb>draper, of 2, Church-street, Greenwich—about 15th September, the prisoner purchased a silk dress, and, paid for it—she then ordered another dress, and took one with her, and ordered thirty-two yards of silk for Miss Harvey, who she said liked the dress she had purchased for herself, and wished one like it, and she ordered thirty-two yards and a half of black silk for a pupil of Miss Harvey's—that was distinct from the dress—thirty-two yards would be enough for two dresses—I procured that silk from the City, and sent it to Miss Harvey's, Ashburnham House—on Saturday 24<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, the prisoner came again for silk she had seen on the day she purchased the others—she said that it was for Miss Armstrong, who was leaving town for the vacation, and asked if I would allow her to take it with her, which I did, and it was entered to Miss Harvey—she had an invoice in Miss Harvey's name—the value of it was about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—we have not been paid for either of those articles—I believed what the prisoner told me about Miss Armstrong, or I should not have sent the goods—I believed the silk was for Miss Harvey who we would trust to any amount—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the first dress we sent to Miss Harvey—this is the dress we sent the day after, and this is the one she took with her—we have not been paid for any of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Before she entered into either of these transactions, did she pay you for a silk dress? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, about the 14th or 15<hi rend="italic">th</hi>—she came alone—I did not know her name—I knew she was a pupil of Miss Harvey's—she paid me about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we do not supply the young ladies at Miss Harvey's school, only Miss Harvey—she did not tell me her name on the second occasion—I gave her her own bill receipted, but it was made out to Miss' Harvey—they always are—if I had known her name I should still have made out the invoice to Miss Harvey—we never trust the young ladies—I knew</p>

               <p>her again when she came the second time—on the first occasion she merely called to have the silk sent up, which she had seen when she had purchased her own—that was for Miss Harvey, not to Miss Harvey—if she had given me the name of Miss Horsfall, I should have entered it to Miss Harvey—I sent the goods home invoiced to Miss Harvey, and addressed with our business label—she came again on the 24<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, and said that she came for a check dress which she had seen for a young lady who was disappointed of her holiday dress, Miss Armstrong, but her mentioning Miss Harvey's name was the reason I let her have it—when pupils of Miss Harvey come and give orders I do not expect to be paid at once—she pays it afterwards—if the prisoner had said, "I want this dress for myself as a pupil," I should have allowed her to take it away, knowing her to be a pupil of Miss Harvey's, if it had been booked to Miss Harvey, and I did so.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a watchmaker and jeweller, of London-street, Greenwich—about 24th August, the prisoner came with Miss Harvey, who" was a customer of mine, to have some initials engraved on some spoons of the prisoner's—on 27th the prisoner, came again, but I was not present, having gone up to Miss Harvey's about a watch and chain—I was at home on 28<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, when the prisoner called, I was alone—she selected a gold chain, which she said she was going to make a present of with the watch she bought of me, to her cousin, the M. P. 'snephew—the chain was 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and the watch 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—before I let her have it, I went up to Miss Harvey to ask whether I should be justified in letting her have it—I saw Miss Harvey—I also saw the prisoner, but did not say anything to her—she afterwards came to my shop with Miss Olley; I cannot say the date—it was to make an excuse for not paying for the watch and chain, which she promised to do next day.</p>

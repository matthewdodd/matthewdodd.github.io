On the 27th of February, between eight and nine o'clock at night, I was at a watering house in Smithfield, and had drank rather too much; I thought it best to go home; the prisoner spoke to me - I told him I lived at Pentonville - he said he lived that way, and would see me home; we both got on my coach box, and he drove; he drove me to Shoreditch church - I objected to go that way, and he then said he lived at Shoreditch church, and it was not much out of my way - when we got to Shoreditch he asked me into the Gun public-house, to drink - I said I had no money, and would rather not - he said he had money, and would treat me - we had three half quarterns of gin; I did not drink a glass of it; the deputy waterman drank with us; the prisoner paid for the liquor. I went back to my coach - he wished me to go back, and we again went into the public-house; he laid hold of my collar, and I went back with him; he ordered another quartern of gin - the publican said I had had sufficient, and would not allow them to give me any more, and I refused myself; he laid hold of my watch-chain twice while I was in the house, fumbling, as if he was playing with it- I buttoned up my coat, saying, "I won't give you half a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182604060006"></xptr>chance;" we went out to the coach again - it was then eleven o'clock; the coach was in the rank alone - the prisoner went out with me, and asked if I could spar any - I said, No, not that night; he immediately struck me in my left breast, and knocked me down; my hat fell off - I found him pulling at my watch-chain; I laid hold of my watch pocket - he pulled me along, knocked my head on the stones, and I became insensible. When I recovered I found myself on the ground; he had then absconded, and my watch was gone; the waterman and two gentlemen helped me up, and I went home in my coach - a man drove me home. I described him at the office, and he was taken on Good Friday. I am sure he is the man.</p>

            . I keep the Gun public-house. On the 22d of February Hughes came there, with the prisoner and the waterman - I am sure of the prisoner - they had three half quarterns of gin, which the prisoner paid for; Hughes had part of one glass; he appeared to have been drinking a little; I thought he knew what he was about but if he drank more he might not - they went away in about ten minutes, and returned in about half an hour - the prisoner called for another quartern - Hughes refused to drink; the prisoner drank part, and the officer, who sat in my bar, the rest. The prisoner attempted to spar with Hughes, who did not wish him to do it; they left together- Hughes then appeared to know what he was about; I thought him able to drive home; he came next morning, and asked if I knew the man whom he drank with - I had seen him at my house two or three times before.</p>

            . I am a patrol. I was at the Gun, and saw Hughes, the prisoner, and another man come in; they had three half quarterns of gin, and then went away- returned in half an hour, and quartern of gin was called for - the prisoner wished Hughes to drink it very much, but he refused; the prisoner tried to pour it down his throat; I stepped up, and took it out of his hand - they went away together; Hughes appeared able to take care of himself; I went away in quite a different direction; I have seen the prisoner many times before. When Hughes came in the second time I saw the prisoner dragging him by the collar, and I thought I heard something jingle when he was pulling him about.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I saw his coach in Smithfield he had nearly a hundred people round him; a person offered to see him home - he said "No, you will rob me;" at last I got on the box with him, and went with him as far as Sutton-street; he fell off the box six times - he would go down Sutton-street, saying it was his way home- he drove to Warburton's mad-house, as he would go there; it was no thoroughfare - he turned back, and drove to Shoreditch church; he was called for a job, and would not go with it; I bid him good night, and went home.</p>

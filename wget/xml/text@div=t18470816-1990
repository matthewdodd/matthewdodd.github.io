                  </hi> I am a surgeon, in Tooley-street, Southwark, In July last I was called to see a child of the prisoner's, it was just dead—I ex<lb></lb>amined it—I understood that it had been strangled—there were some crease-marks about the neck, in the situation of the cap-strings, which appeared to have been tied rather tightly, but not sufficient to cause death—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination, next day—I discovered nothing particular externally—on removing the scalp I found extravasation of blood on the right side of the head—I immediately examined the scalp, and then observed two or three small bruises on it, very slight, not sufficient to be observed before—I then examined the skull, and found it fractured to the extent of about two inches on the right side—in my opinion, that was sufficient to cause death, it might be caused by a blow, or fall on any hard substance.</p>

                  </hi> I am a window, and live in Bull-court—I know the pri<lb></lb>soner. On the 6th of July, about twenty-five minutes past ten at night, I saw her in the yard—she had taken a drop, but was not too far gone then—she was able to walk—she had the child in her arms, holding it round, close to her—I took it out of her arms, and said, "Take care of your child, and yourself too"—she did not seem satisfied to part with it, and I gave it her back again, settled it to her in her arms, and closed the shawl up—she was not holding it in a dangerous way, but the shawl was hanging down, and I settled it about the baby—she then went towards the Bull public-house, and I lost sight of her—I saw her again in about five minutes, going by the thoroughfare that there was—there is a drain there, she missed her footing, and fell down with the baby in her arms—the baby happened to come on its head; it fell under her—I went towards her, she picked herself up imme<lb></lb>diately, and went through the thoroughfare—I heard the child groan after she rose—I did not see her again till the Tuesday morning following.</p>

On the 4th of December, in the afternoon, the prisoner came into my brother's house, I was in the shop, my brother was in the accompting house. The defendant came for a hundred lemons, which I sold him for three shillings, he gave me three shillings which I took to my brother, my brother came and told the prisoner they were all bad, and told him he must send him to the compter, the prisoner then ran away, my brother followed him and brought him back. I went for the beadle. I am quite sure that the three shillings that I had of him, I took to my brother, and they were not given back to him.</p>

I went into the shop to the prisoner and threatened to send him to the compter, he ran away, I pursued him and brought him back. I delivered him and the three shillings to the beadle. The beadle asked him whether he had any more, he replied he had not, I perceived there was something in his breeches pocket, the beadle told him to pull them out, he did, they were three more bad shillings, the shillings were all of the same appearance exactly, the beadle got a constable and he was taken before the Lord Mayor.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Stebbendalo Street, and am a miller—on the 7th September I was outside of the Pier Tavern, Manchester Road—the deceased, who was a milk man, came in with a can in his hand—he was followed by three dogs—he was in there from ten minutes to a quarter of an hour—I saw him come out—he looked round and went back a second time—the prisoner <hi rend="italic">followed</hi> him out, walked deliberately up to him, struck him in the face with his fist, and knocked him down on the pavement—the prisoner held his head down and said "See what the old beggar has done, he has cut my head with the milk can"—I saw him bleeding down the back part of his neck—he then made another attack on the deceased and knocked him down again on the road—he got up again and the prisoner went at him, struck him, and knocked him down a third time, and while he was lying in the road he kicked him—the deceased got up, placed his hand on his hip, and walked away—I saw that the deceased had a cut over his left eye the second time he was knocked down—I judge his age to be about fifty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> This was between 7 and 8 p.m.—I don't know what happened in the public-house, but he told me that the man had struck him on the head with a milk pail—I can't say whether Chant heard that.</p>

                  </hi>. I am barmaid at the Pier Tavern—on this evening Chant came in to deliver milk, I saw one dog with him—the prisoner was in the house and was teasing the dog in some way, and as Chant was going out the prisoner touched him on the head or on the hat with his hand, in play I suppose, and Chant turned round and struck him with the milk can—Chant went out and the prisoner followed him.</p>

I am an iron-bolt maker—on the evening of 10th September, between 7 and 8 o'clock, I saw the prisoner and Chant and several more in the Pier Tavern—there was a dog there—some words passed between the prisoner and Chant and the prisoner struck Chant on the top of his head with his hand—he did not say anything then, but afterwards he said "You b——y old <hi rend="italic">sod</hi>, you have cut my head"—that was after the milk can—the prisoner followed him out—I went out and the prisoner knocked him down on the pavement, and then he knocked him down in the road, and then he knocked him down a third time and kicked him, I think in the stomach—somebody said "The old man is dying," and I helped to carry him into a surgery—I saw him dead on the Monday following.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Chant had a straw hat on—it might have been two minutes after the blow with the milk can that the prisoner struck Chant outside, he followed him out and pushed him out and struck him at once—he never returned to the house.</p>

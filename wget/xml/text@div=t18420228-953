                  </hi>. I lodge in Weymouth-street—the pri<lb></lb>soner was cook at the house—we had missed some lace when we arrived from the Continent and unpacked the luggage—it is my wife's lace—I am sure we had it in England—this now produced is part of it—I believe it to be Dresden lace.</p>

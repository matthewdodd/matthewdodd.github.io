On the 27th of July I was dis<lb></lb>charged from the ship <hi rend="italic">Science</hi>—I met the prisoner that afternoon by the Jolly Sailor, in Ratcliffe-highway—he spoke to me as I passed, and I told him I was going on board the ship after my things—he asked if I should want any assistance to bring them ashore—I said, I should be glad of assistance—he offered to go with me, and did so—he did not go on board—be stopped there till I got my things together—I took second thought not to bring my, things with me, and only brought a shirt and a pair of trousers—we went to the-Kettle Drum—I saw Caroline Robinson there, and gave her the bundle to take care of for me—there was a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> in the house, and I afterwards missed the bundle—Robinson came to me—these are my trousers and shirt.</p>

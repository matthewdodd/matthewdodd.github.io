The prisoner was given into my custody on Saturday the 19th—Mrs. Frowd gave me a shilling, which she said the prisoner had passed—I requested her to mark it, which she did—she then said. "I have got two more, one of which the prisoner passed yesterday"—she went and brought two shillings from a box, and she said, "There are the two shillings, I don't know which the prisoner passed"—the three shillings were given me together, but I have kept them separate—this is the one she gave me first, and marked—I had marked the other two differently—when it was said that the prisoner had passed one the day before, the prisoner said she never was in the house before—I asked where she lived; she said she had no particular residence.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my mother, at No. 49, Queen's Road, Bays<lb></lb>water. On Monday, 2nd Nov., I was passing Miss Brown's house, and saw Tubbs in the front garden, putting his hand in at the window, which he pushed open as far as he could—I did not see what he took—Bromley was standing outside the gate—I passed the house in about an hour, and asked the servant if she had lost anything; it was about a quarter past 11 o'clock—I did not think there was anything the matter.</p>

                  </hi>. On Monday, 2nd Nov., at half past 12 or a quarter to 1 o'clock, I saw the prisoners and another person in Holborn, walking very fast—Tubbs had a basket on his arm—I have known him nearly four years; I went down Middle Row, and turned round to Tubbs, to see whether he was the person I knew, and saw Bromley lift up Tubb's pocket, from which I saw a silver spoon or fork projecting—I followed them down Holborn Hill to Snow Hill, and through Smithfield to Bishopsgate Street, till I saw a constable; I told him what I had seen; he crossed over, and got on fifty yards; I then spoke to a sergeant, who took hold of Tubbs, and the other two made off towards Shoreditch—I saw Bromley that evening in Bishopsgate Street, and collared him—a constable took him, and told him that it was for being accessary to stealing some plate; he said, "All right."</p>

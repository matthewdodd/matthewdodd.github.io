                  </hi>. I lodge at Mrs. Craig's, by Bell Wharf-stairs. On Saturday, the 23rd of January, I was passing Angel-gardens, Shad well, and saw the prisoner—she took hold of my jacket, and asked me where I was going—I said I was going home to go to bed—she said would I not go along with her—I said, "No"—she put her hand into my right-hand trowsers pocket, and took out two shillings and three pence—I had just felt my money safe—I had my hand in my pocket when she met me—I took it out to get rid of her, and then she put her hand in, and took the money—she ran away, and I after her—she got up to some coal-heavers—one of them interfered, and said she was his sister—a policeman came up—the coal-heavers went away, and the policeman took the prisoner into custody.</p>

I took the prisoner—at the station I asked if she had any money—she said she had not a farthing of money in her possession—a female was sent for to search her, and in the mean time I saw her turning something about in her mouth, which she attempted to swallow—we caught hold of her neck to prevent her doing so and found two shillings in her mouth—on further searching her a penny was found in the waist of her clothing—she said it was some money which had been owing to her by her sister, and which she had paid her that night.</p>

               <p>23rd Oct. last year, at a quarter or twenty minutes to nine o'clock in the evening I went to a public-house near the Whitechapel-road—I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner and another man at the bar—a young man about twenty-two years old, who I saw when he was examined at the police-court, came in, and called the prisoner by the name of <hi rend="italic">Froggy</hi>—they stepped on one side and talked—I sat there some time hearing the examination of the Mannings read—the prisoner and his friend asked me to drink, and I took what I expect was gin—I saw it taken from the bar—I lost all recollection from the time I drank it; I do not recollect parting with the glass—I came to myself about four in the morning, and found myself at Leman-street station, and about 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. mis<lb></lb>sing; all I had but 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it was safe three or four minutes before I went into the public-house, and I sat there ten minutes—I also lost a blue silk handker<lb></lb>chief.</p>

On 23rd Oct., last year, I was in Brick-lane, Spitalfields, and found Dickinson there, apparently drunk; he was stupified—the left side of his trowser-flap was half down, so that I could see his pocket—I took him to the Leman-street station, and found 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in his right-side pocket; nothing in his left—before I found Dickinson I had seen the prisoner, whom I had known some time, coming down Thrall-street, in a direction from where I found the prosecutor, and about 300 or 400 yards from him—the prosecutor came to himself next day, and gave me a description, in consequence of which I looked out for a man named Norris, and also the prisoner—I knew where the prisoner lived, went there for three months, from time to time, and could not find him.</p>

On the evening of 23rd Oct., last year, about half-past nine o'clock, I was on the pavement in Brick-lane, and saw the prisoner, two females, and a man named Norris, who has been convicted—Dickinson was between the two males, and the females were in advance—as they passed me I heard one of the females say, "Take him round to the chandler's shop"—they passed me six or seven yards, made a full stop, and I saw Norris step behind the prose<lb></lb>cutor, and saw the prisoner lift his arm while Norris put his hand into his right-hand pocket—I then saw him take his hand from his pocket, and hold it up to the light—they said some few words I could not hear, and ran off together—Dickinson reeled across the street, and fell down on the opposite kerb—the police came, and I went to the station with them—I knew the prisoner before—I lived 200 or 300 yards from him.</p>

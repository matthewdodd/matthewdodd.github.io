                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Daniels and Payne, of 29, Upper Thames-street, iron-merchants—Clark was in their employ—he was to deliver iron according to the papers or orders that came in—before he delivered it he had to enter it. On 6th Dec. an order was brought from Perry and Sons by Rackham—I did not see it delivered—I was in the shop-when he came—I saw Clark have the order—in five or ten minutes afterwards Clark sent me to fetch such iron as was wanted for Messrs. Perry's order—I brought various sizes, and put them in the scale—Clark helped me—the iron was put in the cart—I cannot say what it weighed—it should have been entered on the board—I cannot say whether Clark entered it—Clark then sent me for eight bars of mitre-iron—it was brought, put in the scale, and then in the cart—Rackham was then standing against the scale—I saw the cart driven out of the place by the carman—Rackham did not go with it; he went in after his bill—I cannot say what became of him then—after the eight bars were put in the cart I went down to fetch up other iron that was on the orders—I went the next day to the Vine-yard, Bishopsgate-street, and found eight bars of mitre-iron—I could not say whether they were those I had put in the cart—they were the same size, and had the mitre mark on them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Daniel and Payne. On 6th Dec. I saw this order on the file when it was executed—it was the duty of the man who weighed the iron to put the order on the file, and chalk it on the board—Clark chalked this order on the board—the order is in the writing that I have always understood to be Perry and Sons—I saw a cart which came from Perry's with iron on it, driven by the carman they had hired—I did not see Rackham when the cart was driven away—I saw him while it was there standing by the scale, and some iron was being shifted from the scale to the cart—I did not look at it—the iron chalked on the board corresponds with the iron in the order, with the exception of one size—7-8ths was sent for 7-16ths—there was no entry on the board of eight bars of mitre iron, either on that day or the next, as being sent to Perry and Son—it was the person's duty who brought the order and took away the iron to sign a receipt for it—this book is signed by Rackham.</p>

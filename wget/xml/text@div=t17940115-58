               <p>Mr. Garrow to Court. It is stated in the indictment to be the 21st, when he committed the act of bankruptey.</p>
               <p>Mr. Russell. I think it is perfectly immaterial which is mentioned in the indictment, if it is after the act is committed, the same is in the case of an indictment for murder.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. The indictment states it that he committed it on the 21st of August, and the witness has proved that he did not commit that act until the 23d of the month of August.</p>
               <p>Court. In the way the indictment is drawn it can be no objection.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I own this transaction is mentioned in the indictment under a perfectly satisfied with the court's judgment, but I am never satisfied with my own.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he say any thing more to you? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was he absent when he went away the second time? - I cannot say how long he was absent; to the best of my memory, I saw him before he came home, I met him I believe the first time at the Green Man and Still.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sent for to come there to him? - I was.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was this after he had gone from his house? - About nine days, he still said that his affairs were unsettled, and he hoped he should get them settled soon.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not go back to his house from the Green man and Still? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him next after this time? - I see him almost every two days, after that at different places, not at his own house.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before he returned to his own house? - I don't know that he was in it except of Sundays after he went.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember any application being made there during the time he was absent for any money? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who applied? - Mr. Lowry and Mr. Grickson, both at the same time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they apply more than once? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the application made to you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell them where your master was? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any other creditors that you remember apply that wanted money? - There may be persons coming for him that I did not know their busines.</p>

               <p>Q. Consequently you record in the course of a year a great variety of transactions that don't go perhaps through your own hands but through others, not your own personal acts? - Certainly.</p>

               <p>Q. Of course you take in order to make your entry in the ledger from the day book, the journal, the bill book, and so on? - Each person keeps a memorandum book and I copy in the ledger, each person has a separate memorandum book which he keeps, from which I collect into the day book once a month.</p>

            Is your day book the same thing as journal? or an antecedent book to the journal? - We keep only the memorandum book, journal and ledger, the articles are posted from this day book into the ledger.</p>
               <p>Q. Now the ledger is so made up as you have just been stating. The book itself is made up in the manner that you have described it, made up of all the various six or seven persons accounts who do the business? - It is so.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you tell us how many facts recorded in that ledger to the prisoner's credit are out of your own memorandum book? - I cannot positively say without looking at the book.</p>

            As to all the other transactions, except your own, you know nothing about, more than seeing them entered in their memorandum books? - I kno  that except I possibly stood b  it was done.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether the particular parcel is delivered or no you cannot ten?</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Court. I submit to your lordship that he cannot look at his ledger, I agree that he has a clear right to look at his own memorandum book.</p>
               <p>Beck. I have the original memorandum books here, and part of them are my own.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I can have no objection to his looking at his own or any other that he knows the facts of his own knowledge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Russell. Do you turn to your own memorandum books and see what is there writ down to Mr. Pitt's account.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Will you be so good as to name the date of the first transaction and you must at present confine yourself to the joint debt of Hudson and Lowry? - It is all on the joint account, the separate account is all settled.</p>
               <p>Mr. Russell. Have you any time delivered to Mr. Pitt a bill of parcels? - I have of goods that I sold him in his own shop.</p>

               <p>Q. To what amount can you say that you have delivered to him goods with bills of parcels? - I have applied to him to settle the account, the last account I settled with him was the first day of August, sixty-nine pounds, the bill was not paid, that was the only sum that was due, there were various other sums that were not due.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at any other time apply to him for the payment of any other money than that sixty-nine pounds, and when? - I cannot positively tell.</p>
               <p>Q. What goods can you undertake to prove from your own knowledge came to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150153"></xptr>the hands of Mr. Pitt from Hudson and Lowry? - I cannot prove but a very little quantity of my own delivery, because I am not in the habit of delivering goods.</p>
               <p>Q. Well begin with what you can first of all prove and then we will come to the rest? - There is no more than fifteen shillings and nine-pence, that I can speak to the delivery of them myself? there is a man of the name of Hatton who is constantly in the habit of carrying out goods.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at any time deliver any goods to be conveyed to Mr. Pitt? - I cannot say; I should imagine I have, but I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any delivered to him for that purpose? - I am in the habit of doing it every night, but I cannot positively say.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the sixty-nine pounds was the only sum that was due, had you any conversation about what was not due? - I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you state to him the amount? - I did, one hundred and forty pounds one shilling and four-pence.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say about that? - He said according to the agreement it was to be put in after Midsummer, which is an additional credit, and that it was to be paid three months after the usual time, the 24th of June, and consequently would not be due till the 24th of September; he said that it was not to be settled that time but in the next account.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Was you privy to the agreement, or do you know it only from your master? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Mr. Russell. What did he say on that occasion? - He said according to agreement Mr. Hudson was to put these goods in after Midsummer, and then they would be due at Michaelmas. We go from Midsummer to Michaelmas.</p>
               <p>Mr. Russell. He contended that by the agreement, he was to have three months extraordinary beyond the usual credit? - The account of these goods, according to custom, were to have been settled on the 24th of June, and he said according to the agreement, it was to be on the 24th of September.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. At any rate they would not be payable for till after September.</p>
               <p>Mr. Russell. Do you know what was the consideration of this note of Clayburn's of your own knowledge? - No, I only know by hearsay.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of Pitt yourself? - No, I had no transaction on this note.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Court. My lord I should think that this cannot be included within the statute.</p>
               <p>Mr. Russell. A debt not due is not only proveable under a commission, but it may be proved.</p>
               <p>Court. The statute of Charles the first and second will not extend to that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Russell. At present we have proved more than a hundred pounds due upon notes, one of which he is the indorser of sixty-nine pounds four shilings, and forty-five pounds, they constitute a debt previous to the commission for they were both due at that time; and the witness states that he gave notice to Mr. Pitt, that Clayburn's note was not paid.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Beck. This note of Clayburn's was put in in order to else out a sum to convict a man of a capital offence. On your oath don't you know that every farthing of this money is paid? - On my oath I know nothing at all about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe, on your oath, that there is one guinea, or one shilling due on the note? - I never heard that it has been paid.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you believe? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150154"></xptr>Q. You don't know that Clayburn was arrested and paid it? - On my oath I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know that on an arrest Clayburn paid every shilling of it? - I never knew that on my oath.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear it? - I never heard it. (The bill read by the clerk of the court.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. They must go a great deal further than this.</p>
               <p>Russell to Beck. Do you know of any application to Mr. Clayburn for the payment of this note at the time it became due? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Court. When did it become due? - The 27th of August.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What day is the act of bankruptcy proved? - On the 23d of August.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow here objected that this bill of Clayburn's, was not within the meaning of the statute of bankruptey as they had not proved a default in the case of Clayburn, which the court allowed.</p>

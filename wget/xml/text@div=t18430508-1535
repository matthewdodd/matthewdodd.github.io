                  </hi>. I live with my mother, Mary Simpson, a widow, in Charlton-street, Fitzroy-square—she is an upholsterer. At the end of Jan. the prisoners took a lodging at my mother's—after they had been there a few</p>

               <p>weeks, they introduced another woman, and ultimately a fourth—I noticed Donney removing boxes and bundles from the premises, and on one occasion I followed him—Quantrill was with him, and the second woman whom he introduced, and who he stated was his sister—they went into the house at No. 3, Middleton-buildings, and Donney took the box which he had with him into the house—when their rent became in arrears, I went into their room, and missed two flat irons—I then gave Donney in charge—I went the same evening to the house, No. 3, Middleton-buildings, and there found several boxes, which were opened in my presence—I found in them several pieces of damask and velvet, which were my mother's cuttings, after she had been at work—the damask had been in a bottom drawer in the room occupied by the prisoners—I also found a chair at Middleton-street, which is the property of Mr. William Bassett, a lodger at my mother's.</p>

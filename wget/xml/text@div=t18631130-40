                  </hi>. I am a licensed victualler, in Bull-court, Tooley-street—on the morning of 14th November I was with my wife, going home across London-bridge—when we had got about half-way across, we met the prisoner and two others walking arm-and-arm or hand-in-hand together—my wife had hold of my left arm—they surrounded us—the prisoner tried to put his legs between mine to throw me down, and the other two hustled and shoved me about against the side of the bridge—in a second I felt one of their hands, I can't say which, coming out of my right-hand trousers' pocket—I afterwards missed from there 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I called for the police—the other two ran away—I stuck to the prisoner—I could not see what he did to my wife, I had quite enough to do—the officer came up, and I gave the prisoner in charge for attempting to rob me—I had not at that time dis<lb></lb>covered the loss of my 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's wife—on the morning of 14th November, about half-past 12, I was going with my husband over London Bridge, and saw the prisoner with two others—they came up to us either hand-in-hand, or linked arm-in-arm together—it was near the middle of the bridge—we were on the left-hand side going over—the men completely surrounded us—the prisoner put his leg round mine, and tried to throw me down—I had hold of my husband's arm—I had a small bundle in my left-hand, and the prisoner took hold of my bundle, and tried to wrench it out of my hand—I let go of my husband's arm and caught hold of him—I did not see what the other two were doing; I was frightened, and was quite entangled with this one—I called out, "For God's sake let me alone"—a policeman came up in about a minute—he appeared to be close on the spot—I had not loosed hold of the prisoner—I kept hold of him till the policeman came up—the other two men went away—the prisoner was secured, and my husband charged him with attempting to rob him—I lost a button from the top of my clock in the struggle.</p>

I was on the bridge, about half-past 12, on this morning, and heard some parties having some high words—I went to see the cause of it, and saw the prosecutor, and prosecutrix, and the prisoner together—the prosecutor complained of the prisoner's assaulting him, and attempting to rob him, and gave him in charge for so doing—after I got him to the station the prosecutor charged him with stealing twenty-five shillings—I searched him, but found nothing on him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you see the other two men go away? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; the prisoner gave his correct address—I did not know him before—I believe he said he had been somewhere in Tooley-street—he made no attempt to escape—he went very quietly—he denied the charge of attempting to rob—he did not appear to be excited from liquor—there were not many persons on the bridge at the time—I was about fifty yards off when I heard the words which caused me to come up—there are plenty of lights about there—there were no persons between me and them—I was walking up in the direction in which they were.</p>

                  </hi>. I am attached to the fire brigade—I went with a fire engine at 12.41 and broke the front door open—I went through the front shop into the back parlour, which appeared all on fire—I got a stand pipe and hose and played on it and reduced it—I afterwards found that there had been two distinct fires; the first in the centre of the floor of the back room, indicated by this red spot on this model (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was about 4ft. from the grate, where the fire was still alight, but there was no communication with the fire in the grate and that in the centre of the room, because there is a hearth-stone—the edges of the boards were charred, and between the joists there were four or five bundles of firewood, hardly burnt, just slightly scorched—the opening was about 18 in. wide—it was all open, some part of the flooring had been taken away; it was very old flooring—I could not find the pieces—joists number two and four were quite exposed, and number three partially so—pieces of board appeared to have been nailed on the floor—it appeared to be an old breaking, no other portion of the floor could be taken up without force—an iron gas pipe came from towards the shop, along the inside of the fifth joist, I think it was—I did not notice whether the gas was turned on—the other fire was at the top of the stairs, going down to the basement, under the landing—the fire was under these two shelves, the upper parts of which were very much burnt, and the three top stairs were burnt right away—the ceiling which runs under the shop floor and under the landing of the stairs was burnt—there was no communication whatever between the two fires, in fact, one was 5 ft. or 6 ft. from the other—there was a hamper of straw burning under the shelves, I kicked it about and helped to put it but—I was present when Langham cut through from the hole in the flooring to the basement ceiling to see whether there was any more fire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The gas pipe ran from the front of the house to the—back, along the joists—my attention was particularly attracted to it, but I could not tell whether there had been an explosion or not—there was no hole in the kitchen ceiling till Langham cut it through, standing underneath it—there was no hole till one of my men, who Trent across the room in the dark and the smoke to open the window, stepped with his foot through the floor, and made a hole in the <hi rend="italic">ceiling</hi>—I was there at that time—that was before it was cut away—I then went down to the basement with Langham, who began to cut away the ceiling—there must have been a hole there, because the man's leg went through it—I had not been down there before that—there was no hole except where the man's leg went through—the hose was brought in through the front of the house and poured into this room with very considerable force—there was a small portion of leaden pipe on the iron pipe, and I saw that it had absolutely been melted—the fire under the stairs was the larger of the two—the tamper was not on the shelves, it was on the ground, exactly under where the fire was on the stairs—there were no doors to the shelves—I saw nothing on the shelves that would be a likely place to stow away old hampers and rubbish—the hamper might have caught fire from the stairs when they were on fire, or the stairs might have caught fire from the hamper—the first floor was filled with water from the hose.</p>

                  </hi>. I am superintendent of the eastern division of the salvage corps—my experience as a fireman extends over a period of 26 or 27 years—I went to the house on the 26th February between 6 and 7 o'clock, and in the back parlour, between the second and third joists, I found four</p>

               <p>or five bundles of firewood not burnt—the strings remained on three of them, and between the third and fourth joists there was a quantity of fire<lb></lb>wood and some fat or dripping—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is some of it—there is a little fat adhering to it—there had been no fire whatever between the second and third joists, which were the nearest to the fireplace, between 5 and 6 feet from it—I am only speaking from memory, and hare not got my measurements with me—it is over 3 feet from the fireplace to the com<lb></lb>mencement of the third joist—part of the ceiling under the fire had been cut away, and these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are some of the laths which hung down-some of the fat is adhering to them now—between 2 and 3 feet of the ceiling was fatted or greased under the third and fourth joists—I should say, by the remains I saw, that there were between 3 lbs. or 4 lbs. of fat or dripping—I have some of the fat here which I found between the third and fourth joists—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was the only piece which was among the fire; wood, the rest had run through—an iron gas pipe runs between the third and fourth joists, away from the direction of the two fires—the joists ran from front to back of the house—the gas pipe came from the main through the fifth joist, and over the fourth into the third—it did not run parallel with the joists—when it got into the back parlour it ran through the joists to the window, and there was a lead union in the centre between the third and fourth joists, with lead piping, which had all melted away—there had been no explosion of gas whatever—if there had been it would have blown the windows out either back or front—this small piece of lead pipe (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>) was melted off the iron pipe, and was left on the firewood, and the gas, which was full on, was escaping, but there was no explosion—the second fire was 6 feet or 7 feet from the first, and 10 feet or 12 feet from the fire<lb></lb>place—there was no communication whatever between the two fires—there was an ordinary wood partition and a door between them—some straw in a basket had been on fire under the shelves, and some firewood on these shelves (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the upper surface of the lower shelf and the under side of the upper shelf are burnt—the fire began on the upper side of the lower shelf, as there is no burning on the lower side—the burnt firewood was on. the top of the lower shelf—here are the remains of it—the fire on the shelf might have communicated with the basket—some of the wood might have fallen, and set fire to the straw in the basket—the three upper stairs were burnt away, and in the partitions about a foot from the door I found a hole such as a hot poker would make—it appeared to have been drilled with something hot—the edges were burnt—that hole would cause more draught under the stairs, and the flame would go further up the stairs—I asked the prisoner how he accounted for the firewood being there, he said he could not tell me—I asked him if he was the last in the place—he said that he was, and that he went to bed about 12 o'clock.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There was no escape of gas when I found this piece of lead pipe on the firewood between 6 and 7 a.m.—I said that the gas was escaping owing to the lead having melted, but no gas was escaping to my knowledge—it would require very little force to get this piece of pipe off, the hand would do it—joists and rafters are the same thing—the pipe went straight from front to back, except that it crossed one joist and went between the rafters—the pipe altered from iron to lead between the third and fourth joists, close against the seat of the fire where the hole was cut—this is a portion of the bend, I cannot say that it is a union—I have never heard of such a thing as a leaden union—an explosion of gas arises from an escape</p>

               <p>when a light is placed to it—an explosion will cause a flare for a short time, and it puts itself out—I saw no crack in the pipe which would account for an escape of gas—this hole in the pipe has been done by the action of the fire—I have not noticed that before—the flooring of the bar or back parlour was a little out of repair in several places; the people of the house call it the bar—I saw crevices between the boards in one or two places—I saw no fat on the boards—I saw a table there—I heard the servant say at the police-court that her master used to keep bundles of firewood on the shelves under the stairs.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I lifted the shelves up—they would not come away and I broke them away—they each rested on two brackets—the lower one went up to the staircase—but I cannot say about the upper one because the staircase was burnt where the shelf would have reached to—flame rises and the draught would cause it to flow up, but I do not think it curious that the under sides of the shelves are not charred—I found under the table in the bar, a tin which had had dripping in it and I put it on the table—it was partly under the table and partly out—I do not think it could have been knocked off the table because the table was pretty well full, and if it was knocked off it would have knocked something else off with it.</p>

I had been in the prisoners service five months at the time of the fire—I used to come in the morning and leave at night—on the night of the fire I left at 6.30; there was then a large fire in the bar—the dripping-pan was always kept in the shop window exposed for sale, and it was there when I left, there were about 7 lbs. of dripping in it—on Monday morning when I returned, the dripping-pan was on the table in the bar—I did not see it under the table—there was no dripping in it then—it was generally kept in the back-kitchen on the lower shelf—I brought up two bundles of wood in a scuttle of coal every night—I brought the bundles up the night before, and they both, still remained in the scuttle in the bar on Monday morning when I got there—there were twenty-four bundles on the shelf when I left—there were two holes in the bar parlour floor which were covered with tin—the tin was over both the holes when I left on Sunday night—the steps were always kept at the top of the house in a little cupboard in the top front room.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Those were the largest pair, and the only pair of steps kept in the house, a shorter pair were kept out at the back—there is a place of convenience in the yard behind the back kitchen to which customers were in the habit of going—there would be nobody at all in the back kitchen at the time business was going on—I always give them a candle if they go down—they would not pass these shelves—I had to go for coal to a cellar in front</p>

               <p>of the house, and had to pass these shelves—the firewood wag kept on the lower shelf—I never put the candle on the shelf when I went to get coal, I always put it on the table in the front kitchen—there was no table in the back kitchen, nor anything to rest anything on except the shelves—the straw came in the course of the business, and we used to unpack the hampers and take them and the straw into the back kitchen, and we sometimes put the straw on the floor, but I always kept the straw in the hamper, it was there naturally in the course of business—a fire was kept in the back kitchen and it was the custom to have cooking utensils on the fire there, a kettle, or a saucepan, at the same time that business was going on upstairs—a saucepan might be taken from there if the fire was too crowded—we always had large fires in business time—I have seen a hot cinder dinging to a saucepan when it was taken off the fire—when I left at 6.30 on this Sunday, I left the prisoner's wife at work at a large fire—when I wanted to add any dripping to that in the pan I took the pan from the window and into the other room, and put it on the table and filled it—that might happen whether I or Mrs. Harrisson were cooking—I have returned in the morning and found that the dripping had been sold while I was away—the prisoner was in the habit of going out on Sunday evening when he thought most of the people had been in to tea, and leaving his wife at 5.30 or 6 o'clock to manage the business—a good deal of fat and dripping was lying about the floor in spots and places—it used to run out of the tin when the meat used to be doing—I recollect the dripping-pan being upset one day with a good deal of fat in it in front of the fire—it was a very old floor and the house was very old indeed—the gas was never turned off at the meter since I have been there, it was always on when I came in the morning—I remember the prisoner putting his foot into the hole between the fire place and the <hi rend="italic">leg</hi> of the table, and grazing his leg, which was very bad for two months, and he had a doctor to it for a month—a lot of rubbish and paper and straw was always kept in the back kitchen—I have found firewood—on the floor dry in the morning, which Mrs. Harper has put there to dry after I left—three or four bundles were always kept under the dresser in the box.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. Two bundles were for the shop and two for the bar but some was always kept under the dresser—four extra bundles were there when I left on the Sunday evening—the fat used sometimes to run out of the tin on to the floor, and on Sunday a good deal of fat ran out of the tin, and' it used to soak through the cracks of the boards in the bar—it was my duty to clean up the bar, and I always cleaned it after the cooking was over—I have been to see the prisoner twice in prison and had conversations with him—the dripping pan was upset outside the fire place about three weeks before the fire and I cleaned it up—the hearth is stone—after the prisoner put his foot through the floor Mrs. White's went through the same hole, and then a fresh tin was put over the hole which was screwed down when I left on Sunday.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant L</hi>). On Monday 26th February I pointed to some fire wood between the joists, and asked the prisoner if he could account for it being there—he said "No"—I asked his wife in his presence if they kept their fire wood upstairs in this room, and the last witness answered "No, we keep the fire wood downstairs on the shelf"—I said "Do you keep any fire wood in that room at all?"—she said "No only what I bring up at night to light the fire in the morning"—I' said "Did you brings</p>

               <p>up any yesterday?"—she said "Yes; two bundles"—I pointed to the floor and said "Did you put it here?"—she said "No I put it in the coalscuttle and found it there when I came"—the prisoner did not speak.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I told him that it looked strange, the wood being found there—I was present on the Wednesday when Foster spoke to him about the wood, and he said to Foster "You might have put it there for what I know."</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Sergeant H</hi>). I went to the house on Wednesday morning the 28th at 9 o'clock; the prisoner came downstairs with Inspector Hilder, and I said "I am going to take you in custody on suspicion of setting fire to this house, I have taken Borne wood out from between the joists"—he said "How many bundles are there?"—I said "I have found the tyers of four, in between the second and third joists, and I have also found a portion of others between the third and fourth joists and I cannot say how much may be there"—I found these strings and this table knife between the joists; and surrounding the gas pipe I found this wood (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) and also some which was charred—I said "Can you give any account of it?"—he said "You might have placed it there yourself for what I know this morning"—I said "What have you to say about the grease, I could not have put that there?"—he said "There was a dish containing some dripping on the table over night"—I asked where it was and the servant produced it from under the dresser"—I said "This looks very suspicious, it will have to be investigated before a Magistrate, you will have to come with me to the station"—he had sent for some ale and he asked me to have some; I refused—he then went to the sink and said "I will face it"—and placed his head under the tap and rinsed his face—he asked to put' on a clean shirt, and I went up to his bed-room with him where his wife was—he told her that we were going to take him to the station, she wished to accompany him, but he told her to remain where she was and keep her mouth shut and answer no questions—I took him to the station—I saw some steps in a cupboard adjoining the second floor landing—there is a trap-door close to the landing at which I got out by means of the steps and went on to the adjoining houses.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not go there for the purpose of questioning Mm—nor did I take him in consequence of what I dragged out of him—I gave him the opportunity of explaining how the wood came between the joists; and as he did not I took him into custody.</p>

I am an auctioneer and valuer of St. Martin's Lane—I was sent on 6th March to value the property at 6, Hackney Road—the house was then in the possession of the salvage officers—the furniture and wearing apparel was worth 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., the furniture and utensils 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., stock and utensils 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., total 53<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that would easily reinstate everything in the house.</p>

I have known the prisoner about three weeks—early in March she asked me to go out with her—I went to her house—she lives in Crown-place—I do not know how she gets her living—we went to Westminster—I do not know the name of the street—she took me to Mrs. Fowler's—I stopped at the door—she said she was going to ask for 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which she had lent to a young woman there—she had nothing in her hand then, but in five minutes she brought out two quilts—I did not see them till she got to the pawnbroker's in High-street, Blooms<lb></lb>bury—I saw the quilts—these are the same—she said she was going to pawn them, instead of the money she had lent the girl.</p>

I live at 8, Globe Street, Dover Road—for about eighteen months I lived with the prisoner as his wife—I left him about twelve days before this happened—on Wednesday, 21st November, I was with Mrs. Burns, and about 1 o'clock in the day we went to the Guy's Arms, Nelson Street—she did not remain there a minute—she went out returned in two or three minutes with a young man named Ellison—directly Ellison had come in the prisoner came in and deliberately struck me over the head with a hammer seven or eight times, with the iron part of it—they were "severe blows and caused wounds; blood flowed—Mrs. Burns knocked the hammer out of his hand—he then put his hand to his breast pocket and took out a clasp penknife, and made an attempt at me—I put up my hand and he stabbed me in the hand—this is the hammer and this is the knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—after that I was senseless and do not remember anything more.</p>

I live at 8, Globe Street—some time previous to this Carley had been living with me—on 21st November I was with her at the Guy's Arms—I went out and returned with Ellison; we had no sooner got inside the door than the prisoner deliberately came and rushed at Ellison and hit him over the temple with the sharp part of this hammer; a second blow hit him on the shoulder; at the third blow Ellison put up his hand to save his face, and it struck him on the finger—the prisoner then made towards Carley, and struck her seven or eight times over the head with the hammer—I kept screaming all the time for assistance—after he had hit her the eighth blow I hit him on the back of the wrist and he let the hammer fall—he then deliberately put his hand to his side pocket and pulled the knife out—I screamed, "Oh, Bill, he has got a knife"—he rushed towards Carley, and she put up her hand to save her face, and he stabbed her in the back of the hand—a man named Tooney got the knife away from him while he and Ellison were <hi rend="italic">tangled</hi> together—the prisoner never spoke a word while his was going on.</p>

I am junior house-surgeon at Guy's Hospital—on 21st November, between 1 and 2, Carley was brought there—she had five wounds in different parts of the scalp, and one on the back of the right hand—these on the scalp might have been caused by the hammer, and the other by the knife—the scalp wounds were not very severe, ordinary scalp wounds; they were not dangerous; the bone was exposed in some parts, but not to any great extent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> If the blow on the hand was caused by the knife there must have been blood on the blade—there is none on it now—I did not see it that night—it was an ordinary incised wound; if she had fallen on broken glass I should think the palm would have been wounded; it is possible it might have been caused in that way.</p>

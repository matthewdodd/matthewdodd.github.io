                  </hi>. I am a farmer, living at Isleworth. The prisoner was never in my employ, but he had employment that brought him to my premises—in June last I missed about two bushels of wheat, and a quarter of rye, which is about two sacks—it was taken from a little barn on my premises—after the robbery I found a key on the floor of the little barn—the prisoner said nothing to me about a key—that key opened the barn—I do not know Fitzwater—he never worked for me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am married, and live on Hounslow Heath. In last June I lived near Warton-lane, about a quarter of a mile from the prosecu<lb></lb>tor's—I had a man of the name of Fitzwater living in my house—I re<lb></lb>member the prisoner coming to see him in June last, one night, about nine o'clock, he asked Fitzwater which would be the best time for them to go to Mr. Kendall's to fetch the wheat—he said the time he thought proper, and Smith said about eleven o'clock at night—he came and called for Fitzwater that night, but I did not see him—they went out—they</p>

               <p>returned in about twenty-five minutes, and Fitzwater brought with him about two bushels of wheat—nothing else—I did not see the prisoner any more that night—the next morning he came to Fitz water's apartment, and I went up stairs to go to my own apartment, and saw Smith measuring the wheat in a half-peck measure—Fitzwater was there—he had the wheat, and ground it—the prisoner had three bottles that was over after he mea<lb></lb>sured it—he took it away in a small bag—sometime after that I heard the prisoner say he had lost the key of the barn.</p>

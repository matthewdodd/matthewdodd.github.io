I am agent and manager of the house, No. 150, Fenchurch-street—I engaged the prisoner to lay down some lead on the stairs at that house—I had known him before, but had lost sight of him for about two years—I was to find the lead, and he was to find the labour and judgment—I asked the prisoner to give me some idea of what the outlay would be—he made his calculation for his labour nine days at 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a-day, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; a labourer, six days, at 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a-day, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; making 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I agreed to that—I was to pay him 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for his labour, and if he could do it in less time he might—I went with him on Monday, the 8th of Dec., to Pontifex's in Shoe-lane, and gave orders for some</p>

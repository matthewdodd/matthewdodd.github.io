                  </hi>. I keep the Black Horse, in Poplar. On 25th Oct. the prisoner came to my house, about a quarter-past eight o'clock in the evening—she brought a jug, asked for half a pint of sixpenny ale, and tendered me a counterfeit crown-piece—I did not then think it was bad, and gave her change—I put the crown into the till—there was no other crown there—in about three minutes after she left—I looked at the crown again, and discovered it was bad—I went in pursuit of the prisoner, but could not find her—I returned, and put a mark on the crown-piece—I kept it apart from other money, and ultimately gave it to the officer—the prisoner was not in my place more than three minutes—I had an opportunity of seeing her features—I do not remember that I had seen her before—I saw her again about seventeen days afterwards—she was not then in custody, but was in the street at large—Mr. Bottjer asked me to come over and look at her—I went, and said that was the woman—she was going away from the house—I went in front of her, and recognised her as the person—I have not the slightest doubt that she is the person.</p>

I knew the prisoner about five years ago, through my brother knowing some of his friends: the last parcel of these knives was found on the prisoner's person, they had been taken from the counter glass-case - I had missed some three weeks or a month ago, and we could not find how they were gone; on the 4th of July I concealed myself, and heard the prisoner come into the shop - on his leaving it I stopped him, and gave him into custody; the officer took him to the watch-house, and on him were found nineteen knives and nineteen forks.</p>
               <p>EVAN WILLIAMS. I heard the knives and forks rattle while I went down for some beer, and the prisoner was in the shop.</p>
               <p>JOHN GRIFFIN. I took him in charge, and found them in his pocket.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The knives were not in the case, they were on the counter, and I knocked them off in passing out of the shop; I had inquired there if Mr. Bright was ill. and they told me he was not - I called again on the 4th of July, and the boy said he was gone into the country.</p>

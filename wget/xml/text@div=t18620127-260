                  </hi>. I am a waiter at the Kentish Drovers public-house, Old Kent-road—on Monday, 23d December, between 5 and 6 in the day, the prisoner and three more were playing a game of shove-halfpenny—Russell was one of them—while they were playing, George Norris, the deceased, came in—he stood there, leaning over one of the partitions there, watching the game, and he began interfering with it—he said the halfpence were not fair in between the lines—the prisoner cautioned him two or three times not to interfere, to go and sit down, and mind his own business—Fox pushed him to shove him away—the deceased had a pair of gloves on with the fingers off—he pulled the gloves off, and said he would serve him the same as a young man of the name of Thrower had served him; but I believe he made a mistake in the name, it was another party that Fox had had a quarrel with—as soon as he mentioned those words, Fox <hi rend="italic">pitched</hi> into him, and Norris was <hi rend="italic">pitching</hi> into him at the same time—they closed together, and were pushing one another, and by that Fox threw him on the ground, and fell on the top of him—Norris fell on the back of his head—I and Fox helped to pick him up after he lay there for a moment—he was insensible—some water was got for him, but he could not partake of it; it was put to his mouth, and he spat it out again—we put him on one of the seats in the tap-room, and he remained there until he was taken home—that was between 11 and 12 o'clock; but he was on the floor once or twice—he remained in an insensible state all the time—he was taken home on a truck by the doctor's orders—he was in liquor, but was not drunk—the prisoner had been drinking.</p>

I am a costermonger, of 11, Stockwell-street, Old Kent-road—on 23rd of last month, between 5 and 6 o'clock, I was in "The Kentish Drovers"—I saw a game of shove ha'penny going on with the pri<lb></lb>soner and three more—Norris was interfering with the game, saying this was not fair, and that was not fair—the prisoner told him two or three times to mind his own business, as he was not playing it did not concern him—he continued to interfere, and the prisoner pushed him; not violently—Norris then pulled off his gloves, and threatened the prisoner worse than he had served Thrower; but he did not mean Thrower, he meant Nash—they then had a round—he pulled off his gloves and they had a bit of a scuffle; a fight—they both began it—they fought about a minute, and they fell together, Norris underneath—he fell on the back part of his head—he could not get up anymore till he was lifted up by the prisoner and the waiter, I then went away—he was insensible as long as I was there—they were both in liquor.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

I am ostler at "The Kentish Drovers"—I was in the tap-room when this game of shove ha'penny was going on—Norris came out of the tap-room, and stood looking at the game—he interfered with it more than once, by calling the numbers—Fox cautioned him not to inter<lb></lb>fere—he continued to do so, and then Fox got up and shoved him away from that corner—it was a <hi rend="italic">largish</hi> push, but he did not fall—he than took off his gloves, put them on the seat, and they then had one round in the tap-room—Fox began it by the shove, and then Norris turned against him—they both began the round—they had one round and then they came out of the box, and Norris went back on his head and Fox a top of him—Fox fell on his hands and saved himself and Norris went back on the crown of his head he laid insensible, and was taken up and put on the seat.</p>

I am a surgeon, in St. James'-place, Old Kent-road—I saw the deceased on 24th of last month—I attended him from that day to the 9th of this month, when he died—he died from the effect of a ruptured blood-vessel on the brain—there was a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—he was quite insensible when I first attended him, from the effects of con<lb></lb>cussion—on opening the brain I found a large mass of blood resting on the fore part of the brain; that blood having come from a ruptured vessel—I saw no external injury except a slight injury of the upper lip—it is quite possible for concussion of the brain to take place, and to cause death, though there be no external injury—it is not an unfrequent thing—I attribute the rupture to concussion of the brain, it might be caused by a blow or fall—if he had been drunk at the time, it would make a rupture more likely to take place; the vessels would be much more distended, and to that extent it would be more likely they should give way—he never rallied.</p>

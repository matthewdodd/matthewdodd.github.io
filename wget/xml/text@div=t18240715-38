The prisoner was in my employ about seven weeks; I had a good character with him; he was taken into custody on Sunday, the 20th of June - I did not examine my stock till the Thursday following, when I missed more than 4 lbs. of tea from a large cannister, which had had some taken from it for retail sale, but what had been taken out had been entered in a book. I had received information on the Saturday evening, that there was some tea in bags in the cellar; I looked, and found it there, but did not remove it. On Sunday morning I concealed myself, and saw him come down into the warehouse several times, and go up again - he came to brush his clothes, and clean his shoes. The cannister from which the tea had been taken stands in the shop. About half-past eleven o'clock he came into the cellar, and took a parcel of tea that laid on the ground in a bag, and another parcel from between the ceiling and the shop floor, in a paper, similar to what we put tea in. I let him go up stairs into the warehouse, and then heard him ask the servant to let him out. When he had got about one hundred yards from the house I pursued, and asked what he had done with my tea; he said he had got none. I sent for a constable when he got back to the shop, and asked how he could be so ungrateful. On searching him about 4 ozs. of tea was found upon him - I then asked where the other parcel of tea was, which he doubled up on the hogshead; he went into the privy, and brought it out from there - there was in the whole about 17 ozs.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you know whether he is a married man - A. I believe he is. Other persons have access to the cellar. The parcel on the ground laid so conspicuous that any one might see it. There was only about 4 ozs. found on his person.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Rose. About ten o'clock on Saturday evening, the 19th of June, I went down into the cellar, and saw a blue paper bag of tea on the floor - I took it up to my mistress; she told me to take it back again, which I did. Next day I let the prisoner out between eleven and twelve o'clock, by his desire; my master brought him back soon after, and asked what he had done with the tea; he said he had none.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. If the tea had been stolen, would it not have been a foolish place to put it in - A. Very few persons go into our cellar; it could not be seen without a light.</p>

               <p>The following witness appeared for the prisoner.</p>
               <p>THOMAS BENNET. I have not been subpoened, but happened to be here on other business. These bags are not unusual among grocers coming from the country - there are a great many persons in London who use them.</p>

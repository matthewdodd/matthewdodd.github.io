               <p>Q. What is Mr. Manning's name - A. David. The house is in the parish of St. Andrew's, Holborn. On Sunday night, the 29th of November, Allen and Turner came into the house, and two women with them. They called for a quartern and a half of gin. They did not set down at all; they staid a quarter of an hour. Allen went out of the house, and Elizabeth Fox and

             came in, and Allen likewise; they appeared to be well acquainted with each other. They remained in my house half an hour altogether. They were looking about, and going in and out, quite in a remarkable manner. They left the house about five minutes before eleven o'clock. I began to shut up my house. The last two shutters that I put up Allen came out of Charlotte-street. My house is at the corner. At five o'clock in the morning the patrol called me up, and told me that the cellar flap was broken up. I came down stairs. It was dark. I found my cellar flap broken open. It had been secured by two bolts. It is a heavy flap; it is as much as two brewers servants can raise up. Considerable force had been applied to get it open. I lost thirteen gallons of rum, ten pounds value; four gallons of brandy worth six pounds; and four gallons of brandy was moved from one part of the cellar to the other.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181301130038"></xptr>Q. Then all the things that they intended to be taken was not gone - A. No. There were six bottles of wine taken away, that is worth one pound one shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner was Turner dressed the night before - A. In a white coarseish apron, a frock-coat, with pockets at the sides. Allen was dressed with a crape hatband round his hat. Silvester had got an ash coloured stick with him.</p>

            . I am a patrol. About five o'clock, on the morning of the 30th of November, I was in Grays-inn-lane; when I came near the house of Mr. May. I passed the cellar flap, a quarter before five; the flap then appeared to be safe; I walked over it. In about a quarter of an hour, I passed by again; I perceived a man holding the flap up. He was standing holding the flap up. That was the prisoner, Turner. He had on a loose blue coat. hanging open, with metal shining buttons, and pockets outside, a white apron on, hanging down. There was a lamp directly over his head, that gave me light to see him. It was a lamp with two burners. There was another person with him; the other person was down upon his hands and knees, appearing to me to be coming out of the cellar. He had a fustian jacket and trowsers, and a black hatband on his hat. On my coming so near them, they seemed to be very busy at the time. I took it to be the landlord of the house at first. On my proceeding near to them, they dropped the flap, and I heard something rattle, which I supposed to be a bottle of wine. They immediately run away very fast. I then endeavoursd to pursue them. On my stepping over the flap, it tripped me down. As soon as they got into Fox-court, there is a turning on both sides. I lost them. They made their escape. I went to the nearest watchman, and the watchman and I alarmed Mr. May. We examined the cellar. I had seen

               <p>Q. Had you ever known where he lived - A. He has lived in Cross-lane. I saw him again at Hatton-garden office three or four days afterwards. I know him again as soon as I saw him.</p>

            . I am an officer of Hatton Garden office. On the 2nd of December, I apprehended Allen. He had this jacket on him, and in company with Silvester. I apprehended him in Parker's-lane. He had a crape hat-band on. I took him first to a public-house, and searched him, and then I took him to a place that we have at the office. He then had the crape on his hat, and when I brought him up at night to the magistrate. I missed the crape off his hat. I took a candle, and went to a place where he was locked up, and found it down the privy, in the place where he was locked up. I apprehended Turner on the Saturday following, at a public-house in Chick-lane. He had on a large blue frock coat, and white metal buttons, and outside pockets.</p>

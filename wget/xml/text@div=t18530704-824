                  </hi>. I live at No. 3, Kenaston-row, in the parish of St. Mary Magdelene. On Saturday, 2nd July, I went to bed about 10 minutes to 11 o'clock, leaving the house safe, but the staircase window was about two inches up for the draught, being summer time; that window could be approached by getting over the gardens, and into the water closet, when they could easily push the window open—about a quarter to 3 o'clock, I was out of bed, and heard a window pushed up or down—I immediately heard foot-steps on the stairs, and thought it was my lodger—I saw the handle of my room door <hi rend="italic">move</hi>; I opened the door, and saw two persons in the passage, the prisoner is one, I am positive of that—they had their boots in their hands—they ran to the street door, pulled the lock back, and ran out; they threw their boots over the iron railings, and jumped over themselves—I lost nothing—I ran out in my shirt, and saw them both until they came to the end of Paulin-street, where I lost sight of one of them—I saw the constable Duff, told him what was the matter, and went back again—after a time, Duff came back with the prisoners, and I recognised him as one of the persons</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, M</hi> 219). On Sunday morning, 3rd July, I was on duty in Great George-street, Bermondsey, and heard a cry of "Stop thief!"—it was 10 minutes or a quarter-before 3 o'clock—I saw the prosecutor run out of Little George-street in his shirt—he gave me information—I saw a man running, but lost sight of him at the corner of Maltby-street about 200 yards from the spot, and about a quarter of a mile from the prosecutor's house—I cannot swear to the prisoner—other constables came, and I gave them directions—I put a constable to watch, went into the dust yard, and found the prisoner in a ditch there, which is alongside the sewer—I said, "There you are"—he said, "Here I am; I am very sorry; I never came out to do a dishonest act before.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined, Q.</hi> How long was it from the time you heard the cry of "Police!" till you found the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Five minutes at the outside—he was in a stooping position in the ditch—he rose up when I was about seven yards from him—he was not drunk or worse for liquor—there was not the slightest appearance of his having been drinking—the position in which he was was that of a person who was performing an act of nature, but he had not his trowsers down—I make no mistake about what he said—it was not, "I never came out of doors to do an indecent act before," but a "dishonest act.

               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Hunt. I keep a house in Strutton-ground, Westminster; she asked me if I would give her a pint of beer. After I had got up and washed my hands, I said with all my heart, and went in at the Star and Garter in the Strand; the people would not let me have any beer, they said I might have a dram. We came out again, she laid hold of my watch string, and pull'd it out of my fob directly. I catch'd hold of her, she call'd out watch, and the watchman came up. I told him she had got my watch, she said she had it not. I charged the watch with her, and going along, just before we came to the watch-house she own'd she had got it, and pull'd it out, and gave it to the watchman.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I heard a noise and went; there was this man and the prisoner, he said she had got his watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know any thing of the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Morris I know she is a woman that walks the Strand; the man charg'd me with the prisoner, and going along she paused upon it; after some time she took the watch out and delivered it to me, and I gave it to him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say for herself before the justice?</p>
               <p>Morris. She made no manner of defence at all.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>He pick'd me up, I refused to go with him; he offer'd me a shilling to lie with him, but having never a shilling, he gave me his watch in my hand to hold the while. He lay with me, and after he had done he gave me two slaps on the face, because I would not deliver the watch to him without the shilling. Then he call'd the watch and sent me to the Round-house.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Is this true or false?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I don't know whether she is a man or a woman.</p>

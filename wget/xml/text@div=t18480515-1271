                  </hi> I keep a shop, for the sale of ready-made linen, in High-street, Camden-town—I have one partner. On 6th December the prisoner came and asked to look at some shirts—I showed him some; and be selected some, which were to be sent on sent on approbation to see whether they fitted—he said if he approved of them be would give me an order for half a dozen—he asked for some boys shirts for his brother, and if they fitted he would have half a dozen of them—they were all ready-made, they would not want anything doing to them—he asked me to send them, and to allow them to be left till Tuesday evening or Wednesday morning, which I agreed to do—I sent three or four gentleman's shirts, two boy's shirts and some collars, by my servant, Ann Humphreys—on the Wednesday morning, before I had sent for them back, the landlady of the house came and told me that they had left her apartment—I saw no more of the prisoner till he was in custody—the shirts were to be returned, and if they suited I was to make him self a dozen—I am quite sure that these were only sent to enable him to judge of the size and make—they were of different sizes.</p>

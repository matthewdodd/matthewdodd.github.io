                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Simpson, and live at 56, Hatton Wall—I work for Mr. Cadby—on Thursday, the 20th December, the prisoner was at work there—he was at work when the bell rang—I did not see him go out from that time till nine o'clock, when I left—I am quite positive he did not go out from the time the bell rang until after we finished tea—he was opposite to me.</p>

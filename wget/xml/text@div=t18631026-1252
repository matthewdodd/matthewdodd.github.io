                  </hi>. I keep the Prince of Wales beershop, at Sydenham—on Saturday, 10th October, the prisoner came there, and had something to eat—he afterwards asked if we had a bed we could accommodate him with for the night—my wife and I told him we had, it was a room with three others, but he could have a bed to himself—he made no objection to that—he said he was glad he could stay for the night—he then went up into the club-room, and remained there, it may be, an hour and a half—he came down stairs about 11, and said, "I shall go into the bar—parlour and stay there, as I now consider myself a lodger"—my wife was there—I closed the doors of the house, saw that all was safe, took my coat off, and said to my wife, "I must go down in the collar"—my purse, containing 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I think, was in my coat-pocket when I took my coat off—I felt it safe at that time—I laid my coat on the head of the sofa in the parlour, and went down into the cellar—I was there three quarters of an hour or more, and then came up to have something to eat—I was taking my supper, and my wife was sitting on the end of the sofa—she fell asleep with her head lying on part of my coat which had the purse in—I finished my supper and went down into the cellar again, leaving the prisoner and my wife in the parlour—I was down stairs from five to ten minutes—I came up again and told the prisoner that it was time to go to bed—he said, "I have altered my mind, I shan't stay</p>

               <p>here to-night"—I said, "Why not? it is very strange behaviour on your part to engage a bed and leave at this time, past one; you have a bed to yourself, only it is in a room with the other lodgers"—he said, "I have an objection"—I said, "I can't understand it"—he said, "Well, there was an Irishman I saw go upstairs, I have a lot of particular money in my pocket, and I shall have my clothes robbed"—we had no Irishman in the house—the lodgers were all in bed but one—they had all gone to bed when I took my coat off, I am positive of that—the prisoner then said if I would allow him to remain in the parlour and lie on the sofa, he would stay in the house—I said I could not do so—he asked me again once or twice—he then asked for a candle—he was supplied with one—he went to the door, and said, "I shall go home"—he went outside the door with a candle in his hand—he then came back and asked for some matches, which my wife gave him—he then went away and I fastened the door—I went to my pocket for my purse and it was not there—on the following Sunday morning the prisoner came again and asked for a pint of beer—I gave him the beer, sent for a policeman, and I gave the prisoner in custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of the last witness—on Saturday night, 10th October, the prisoner was in our bar—parlour at 11 o'clock—I was there, and remember my husband taking off his coat—he folded it in half and laid it on the sofa head—he then went down stairs, saw that the house was secure, did some cellar work, came up again and had his supper—while he was at his supper I fell asleep on the sofa—when I awoke he had gone to the cellar again a second time—a movement under my right shoulder awoke me, and I found the prisoner with his head over me—he then kissed me and put his hand on my lap—I said, "Where is my husband?"—he said, "Hush! I am not going to do you any harm"—I pushed him and he went back to his seat—my husband came back from the cellar directly after that, and said to the prisoner, "Come, we must go to bed, we are tired"—the prisoner then said he should not sleep there—before that he had agreed to take a bed in the house—he said he had particular money on his person, and he would not sleep in a room with an Irishman, because he should have his pockets searched—he shortly afterwards left the house, and my husband went to his coat pocket, put his hand in, and pulled it out again, disappointed and empty—he stood still, frightened for some time, and then went out, and was absent for some ten minutes—at the time the prisoner took the bed I told him that other people were sleeping in the same room—nobody else came into the bar after my husband went down into the cellar.</p>

               <p>stepped inside the door, and said, "Good night"—I certainly objected to the kissing—a sleeping person can't object to anything—I told my husband afterwards, when he came back again—the prisoner put his hand in my lap while I was on the sofa—I was not sitting by his side in a chair—he put his chair close to mine—I sat down in my usual chair, but from 11 o'clock I never sat in a chair at all—I was passing about the room, doing various things—the coat was on the sofa head—I went to sleep while my husband was there—I put my head on the coat—it might have been ten minutes after my husband came from the cellar the second time, that the prisoner went away—it was not half an hour—the prisoner had a pint of ale while my husband was in the cellar the first time—he went down the second time to put the bungs in the barrels, as is usual—he did not turn the prisoner out—the words used to him were, "You are not turned out, it is a pity for you to go out at this time of night"—we have known him three months as a customer.</p>

            . I am shepherd to Mr. Wells. I counted all the sheep on the Thursday before I saw them in London - there were one hundred and fifty-one. On the Saturday I missed forty-six; I afterwards saw thirty-three in London, and know two of them particularly well - one was wry necked, and the other had been fly-galled, and the mark on the others was master's - they were master's sheep.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. LAW. Q. At what time on Thursday did you see these sheep? A. About eleven o'clock - I missed them on Saturday morning, about eight o'clock, and found them near Whitechapel on the Friday.</p>

            . I am an officer of Lambeth-street. On Saturday, the 18th of February, I went to a stable, No. 5, Warren-mews, Fitzroy square; I found the door fastened, and broke it open. Edwards, of Hatton-garden, and Shepherd, an officer, were with me; we found there thirty-three live sheep, eleven sheep's plucks, and a quantity of sheep skins cut to pieces, and tied up in a bag; I found three knives, two steels, and a chopper - the stable appeared as if sheep had been killed there; there was fresh blood about - it is a two-stall stable. The live sheep were all huddled together in one stall - I could not then see whether there were any marks on them. I left Edwards to mind them while I proceeded to what I was informed was John Shaw's stables, in Osnaburgh-street - I found a horse, cart, and chaise there, which I brought away; on the inside of the cart there was the marks of fat and blood- it was on the side of the cart, where the seat swings. I afterwards shewed the thirty-three sheep to Mr. Wells, at Flying Horse-yard, Lambeth-street, on Monday or Tuesday. I drove them there myself from the stable; I was obliged to carry some of them in the cart, as they were unable to walk. Bennett saw the same sheep.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BRODRICK. Q. How far is Osnaburgh-mews from where you found the sheep? A. About a quarter of a mile. I believe there are livery-stables in that mews; I cannot be certain on what day Bennett saw the sheep, but I shewed them to Mr. Wells first, I think. I took them all at once to Flying Horse-yard, and was two hours getting them there.</p>

            . I am a constable of Bow-street. I went with Dalton to Warren-mews on Saturday, the 18th of February; I then went and found the prisoner at a public-house in Norton-street, Fitzroy-square, not far from where the sheep were found; it was between three and four o'clock. The prisoner's brother John was with him there; I spoke to John, and asked him to go up to his stable, and said, "Is that your brother with you?" he said Yes; I then asked him if he would go to his stable, and that his brother had better come with him; they wanted to know what it was for; I said it was respecting the horse that was in his (John's) stable; when we got them to the stable in Osnaburgh-street I and Dalton told them they must consider themselves in custody; they wanted to know what for; I said for some sheep; they said, "What sheep?" we told them the sheep in the stable in Warrenmews - they both said they knew nothing about them; the prisoner said he had let the stable to a man named Vincent, about six weeks or two months before; I asked him who Vincent was - he said he had seen him, and agreed to let it to him at 16s. a week; I will not be positive whether I asked him where Vincent lived - he gave no further account of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. LAW. Q. How far is the public-house from Osnaburgh-street? A. About the same distance; they made no objection to go to John's stables; when they got there I told them they must consider themselves in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. On your saying it was about the sheep in Warren-street, he said he had let the stable to Vincent? A. Yes. I did not question him further about Vincent.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did either of you ask who Vincent was? A. No - I did not hear that.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not sworn that he was asked, and said he did not know who he was? A. I think he did say so.</p>

            . I am a coach-wheel-wright, and live at No. 6, Warren-mews - the prisoner, I believe, occupied No. 5, until I do not know how lately. I do not know for a certainly that he did occupy it; I saw him there about a fortnight before the stable was broken open- I saw him come down the mews many times - I have a workshop opposite to No. 5 - he came to me about ten days before the officers were there, and applied to me to repair the wheels of a cart, which the officers have in their possession; he told me I should find the cart at his brother's, in Osnaburgh-street; he wanted me to repair the wheels, and wished it done well, but as cheap as I could, as it belonged to a poor man. I saw the cart in the possession of Dalton the same day as I took the wheels off(Saturday) - I am sure it was the same cart.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him go into No. 5, Warren-mews last? A. I think it was a fortnight before that.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BRODRICK. Q. You did not see the cart till it was in Dalton's possession? A. I took off the wheels that morning, and in the afternoon Dalton had it; he had applied to me about it ten days before - I am always at work at home. I had not seen him at No. 5 for a fortnight before, to my recollection.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You do not recollect seeing him there for a fortnight? A. No, my Lord. I have seen two other men come backwards and forwards there in that fortnight; I do not know who they were; I never saw him do any thing there. The last time I saw one of them was on Thursday or Friday before this time - he brought a saddle on his back. The cart is about the size of a smallish butcher's cart - it would hold several dead sheep laying on each other.</p>

            . I live in the New-road, and am proprietor of the stables in Warren-mews. I let the prisoner the stable No. 5, twelve months ago, at 7s. a week - he continued my tenant up to the time he was apprehended.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. LAW. Q. Whether he had under let them you do not know? A. No - it is frequently done. I never asked him for rent - he always brought it to me every fortnight.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When was the last payment? A. Nearly a month before this happened.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I declare to God I am innocent of having any thing to do with the robbery; I could have made my escape - I knew the officers had been to my brother's stable.</p>

            . I live at No. 32, Warren-street, and have known the prisoner five or six years; he lodged at my house up to the time he was apprehended, for ten months, and bore a good character; about a fortnight before he was apprehended I asked him it I could lay down half a load of hay in his premises - I was refused - we were on good terms.</p>
               <p>Q. You must not give his reason for the refusal, but you were refused? A. Yes; he slept at my house till he was apprehended.</p>
               <p>Mr. CRESWELL. Q. What are you? A. I keep a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182604060038"></xptr>chandler's-shop, and deal in hay. I once kept a yard for it.</p>

            . I lodge at Bowden's, No. 32, Warren-street, in the next room to the prisoner; I take in needlework; I have known him three years - he is a respectable, sober, and honest man; I slept in the next room to him, and he was in both nights previous to the robbery; on the Thursday evening before he was taken he came into my sister's room - he knocked at the door; I let him in, and he asked me to be kind enough to make him a basin of gruel; I did so; he was there till nearly half-past eleven o'clock; he then went into his own room, and I saw no more of him till between seven and eight next morning; I did not go to bed myself till half-past two; I was up finishing some work; I did not bear him leave his room before I went to bed; I should have heard him if he had; I saw him again about half-past seven o'clock in the morning; I was going down stairs when he was coming up; I saw him next evening before ten - that was Friday - I saw him in my own room - he came in for a light, as he usually did - he did not stay more than half an hour - he then left us to go to bed; I heard him lock his door and saw no more of him; I saw him again next morning(Saturday) between seven and eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. At what time did you go to bed on Friday night? A. About half-past one o'clock; I was the last person up.</p>
               <p>Mr. CRESWELL. Q. If he had gone out of his room you must have heard him? A. Yes; it is impossible for him to go without my hearing him - I believe so.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw him next morning coming up stairs as you were going down? A. That was Thursday morning - we were both going down stairs together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell us that you saw him at seven o'clock on Friday morning, and he was coming up stairs as you were going down? A. No; I said we were both going down together between seven and eight o'clock; he did not look at all fatigued on Saturday morning.</p>
               <p>Mr. BRODRICK. Q. You first spoke about Thursday night? A. Yes; I was in the next room - I did not hear him go down; I sat up till half-past one o'clock on Friday night, and did not hear him go out; I saw him on Saturday morning on the stairs.</p>

            . I am the last witness' sister, and lodge on the same floor as the prisoner.

               <p>COURT. Q. Where did you see him the next morning? A. I saw him go out of the house about eight o'clock.</p>

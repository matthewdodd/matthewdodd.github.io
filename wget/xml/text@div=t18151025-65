My situation was such as that I could perceive all that was going on inside. He brought a loaf out; I went in when he came out, and saw a three shilling piece which he had tendered to her; I marked it, and she marked it. (A three shilling piece put into the hands of the witness.) That is the one she shewed me, and which I marked. I then saw the prisoner go into a butter shop, which is Mr. Brown's; I saw him tender a three shilling piece to the young man named John Foster, which was refused. That was also marked by me, and the young man. Before that, I watched him into Mr. Maguire's shop; I went in after he came out, and saw a three shilling piece which he had tendered, and which was marked also. Then he went to Browne's, the butter man's, and there I apprehended him; I searched him, and found three penny pieces, with which he was going to pay for the chees, when the three shilling piece was refused. I found nothing more, only a quartern loaf.</p>

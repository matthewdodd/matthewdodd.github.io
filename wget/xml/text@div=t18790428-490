                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector, Scotland Yard</hi>). I know Montgomery as Hitchiuan—this advertisement appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> of 24th December, and the <hi rend="italic">Times, Telegraph</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Standard</hi> of 4th January, 1879: "Dear H.,—I entreat you to help me in this my time of deepest trial. Ill and friendless, I can look to none but you for assistance. By the memory of the past I implore your aid or I know not what I shall do—my last shilling is expended on this advertisement. Remember me at this season of happiness and reunion. I have no home now, so please address E.V., "Barfoot's, 295, Strand, London." Barfoot's is a sort of library—I went to the advertisement offices of those newspapers, and there saw the drafts of the advertisements, which were in Montgomery's writing, which I knew well—I then communicated with the Charity Organisation Society, who inserted this' counter advertisement-: "To the Benevolent. Any persons who have responded to advertisements commencing "Dear H.,—I entreat you to help me in this my time of deepest trial," &amp;c., &amp;c., which have appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Times, Telegraph, and Standard</hi>, are requested to send their names and addresses to the Secretary, Charity Organisation Society, 15, Buckingham Street, Strand." The handwriting in the correspondence is Montgomery's, but it is signed "Ethel Vivian"—I communicated with the persons who had written to the Charity Organisation Society, and in con<lb></lb>sequence of information I received from one of them I went to 129, Stam<lb></lb>ford Street, Blackfriars, and in consequence of what I then heard I went to North Bank and saw Mr. Diosy, and arranged for him to meet Vivian at St. Pancras, where I saw them meet—they were in conversation for about a quarter of an hour and then parted, and I followed her to 21, Regent Square, where she went in—I went there at about 9 o'clock a.m. on 8th March, with a constable—I went into the front drawing-room, where the two prisoners were at breakfast—I said, "Montgomery, there is no occasion</p>

               <p>for me to tell you who I am"—he said, "No, I know you, Little child"—I said "I am going to arrest you on a charge of obtaining and endeavouring to obtain money by fraud from various people, in connection with the 'Dear H.' advertisement appearing in the newspapers"—he said, "I don't see how you can make that a fraud, I merely inserted the advertisements for my friend"—I told him that I was going to arrest her likewise, and told her who I was—she said, "Yes, Mr. Montgomery inserted some advertisements for me, that is all"—I took them to Bow Street—I found a letter in Montgomery's hat in his writing—the envelope also contained a small piece of hair (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>)—it is addressed, "Alexander Marsell, Esq., Poste Restaute, Brussels"—there were two stamps on it, but it had not been posted. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "My dear Alexander,—I enclose you what you ask for, a small bit of my hair," &amp;c. Signed Ethel Vivian.") In a desk-at Regent Square I found this letter, addressed "Miss Ethel Vivian"—I do not know the writing—it is the letter asking for the hair, and to which the last is a reply—I also found this photograph of Vivian (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) and this bill for velvet and other things from Meeking and Co., for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.t dated 8th March, 1879, and this letter, the handwriting of which I do not know: "If it is fine on Thursday next, do you think you could meet me at a quarter to 4 o'clock at Grange's, Confectioner, Piccadilly, a few doors from Egyptian Hall," &amp;c Signed, "C. V. R. M.—To Miss Vivian, 21, Regent Square, King's Cross, London" (<hi rend="italic">Other letters found were also produced</hi>)—in consequence of some<lb></lb>thing I heard, I went to 6, Friars' Walk, Oxford, where I found an old blind gentleman and a woman named Hitchman—on the walls I found a photograph corresponding with one I had in my pocket of Hitchman (<hi rend="italic">Montgomery</hi>)—in consequence of what I then heard of Vivian, I went to Dublin where I found a lamp-repairer named Buman, and found her sister, whom I brought to London—at the police-court I saw three letters produced by Mr. Diosy, Mrs. Cooksley, Miss Cope, and Mr. Kreutzman (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which are all in Montgomery's writing—I have made inquiries, and have traced Vivian since she left Ireland to the present time.</p>

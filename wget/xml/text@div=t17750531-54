             open the window; I knew her before. I returned, and told Clarke, what I had seen; and the next day, about three in the afternoon, Clarke and I, Heley, Bryant, and Senhouse, went again. We knocked at the door, but not getting admittance. I lifted Bryant over a wall that is before the house, and he opened the gate and let me in. The gate opens into a garden. When I got up three steps, I saw Broomwich and Morris run out of the right-hand room. I believe, they were alarmed by the barking of some dogs. I ran up stairs and laid hold of them: both of them were in their waistcoats, with their shirt sleeves tucked up, as if they had been at work. Broomwich's hands had file-dust upon them, of a coppery fort of metal. I did not observe the hands of Morris. Broomwich had a pair of trowsers on, and there was file-dust on them. Clarke came up, and desired every thing might be let alone, till he had secured them. I went into the room on the right hand, and saw some base metal shillings lying on two different work-boards. I did not meddle with them.</p>
               <p>Q. What kind of work-boards?</p>
               <p>Phillips. A bench and a table: there were working implements lying by them fit for the purpose of making money. There was a pair of flasks and a press. (They were produced in court by Clarke). There was about three pounds worth of bad shillings in the left-hand room going up stairs, which being rubbed, appeared to be counterfeits. In the right-hand room, there were some crucibles; one of them over the fire with some hot metal in it. ( Producer some straps that they rub the edges of shillings upon; some files, scowering paper, a sieve, and other things, which were all found in the righthand room.) I found a watch in the room below stairs, which was claimed by Broomwich. There was a watch up stairs Morris claimed.</p>

             there. The next day we went to the house, and Morris and Broomwich being taken into custody, I searched Morris, and found upon him two counterfeit shillings and a sixpence. In the right-hand room I found a crucible on the fire, and hot metal in it; there was a pair of flasks in that room, on the window, and a bench, with counterfeit shillings upon it. Somebody must have been at work there, there is no doubt of it. On the same board there was some file-dust, (producing it) it appears to be a composition of silver and copper. On the table, in the middle of the room I found some good shillings, ( produces a good shilling, and two counterfeits.) The counterfeit shillings appear to be cast from that good one. (He produced several other good shillings and counterfeits, that were cast from them, particularly one good crooked shilling, and two counterfeits, cast from it, with a little defect on one side of the good one; and likewise of the counterfeit, and observed, there was a crooked mould in the flask, answering to it. The inside of the moulds are made of sand, and there is a facing that closes the pores, that what is cast may not come out full of spots. The instruments produced, are applicable to coining; they can't work without them: there was some aqua-fortis and water, the use of which, is to force the silver on the outside of the shillings, and by rubbing it comes off<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177505310049"></xptr> again. Morris said, he had been at work in the garden; but on looking at the hands of Morris and Broomwich, they were all over with the dust and filings of the coining business: and on the trowsers of Broomwich was the mark of the laith, which was in the left-hand room, and is turned with the foot, and may be used in the coining business for edging of silver. The dust about the laith appeared to be the same as that on the working board. In the right-hand room I found this piece of box wood, to which a shilling had been fixed, in order to take the edge off: there was no coin, but only filings where the laith was.</p>

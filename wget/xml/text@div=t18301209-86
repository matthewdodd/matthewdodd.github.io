On Tuesday, the 9th of November, I was going up Barbican - I saw Goodwin with a basket, standing crying in the street - he said he had been robbed of two cheeses; on the Monday or Tuesday following. I was in my mother's shop, and saw the prisoner crossing the road towards me; he said the boy had accused him of taking two cheeses - he said he was not the man the boy said he was - he was about to run away; I caught hold of him, and told him to come into the house, which he did - he answered the description which the boy had previously given.</p>

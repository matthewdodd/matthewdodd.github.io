I had a mare to dispose of, she was worth 50 l. On Monday the 15th of February, the prisoner called on me; he said he had seen my mare, that he liked her, and wished to have two day's trial; the price, 55 guineas, was mentioned to him, he said that was rather high. I told him two day's trial was out of the question; I had not known him before, He asked what trial I would allow, I said I was going to ride out myself on another horse, and if he would accompany me he was welcome to any fair trial. We rode out together, and first went to Tattersall's, as he wished to meet a friend there, whom he wanted to see her. He went into Tattersall's, gave a person the mare to hold, returned in about five minutes, and stated that his friend had been there, but was gone. We then rode into Hyde Park, he said he wished a friend of his in Gloucester-place to see her; I offered to accompany him, he observed that it was very late, he would not detain me, and he would either bring the mare back himself, or send her by his servant. It was about four o'clock. I said I wished him to bring her back himself, as his servant might over-ride her. He brought her home that evening, I saw him, and he observed to me, that he had been disappointed in not finding his friend in Gloucester-place at home; that he wished his friend to see her before he bought her, and asked if I would send her up to Parliament-street for his friend to see. He had given me his card the same day, it was</p>
               <p>"J. Doran, 28, Parliament-street." I said his friend had better come and see her in my stable. He said he could not come there. I at last agreed to send her to No. 28, Parliament-street, to Mr. Young's. He asked what was the lowest price I would take? I said 50 l.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever intend to part with it without the money - A. Never, it was understood to be for ready money. I did not tell him so, but he was a stranger to me. Next day I sent the mare by

               <p>Q. When was the mare to be returned to you - A. It was understood that he was not to keep her out all night. I told the groom to knock at the door, and ask if Mr. Doran lived there? and to say, if he liked to ride her he might. It was a little before three o'clock when he took her. I have never seen her since, nor have I been paid for her. My bridle and saddle were on the mare. The prisoner was apprehended on the Thursday, about twelve o'clock, and a little before four o'clock on that day the bridle and saddle were returned to me - I did not intend to sell the bridle and saddle. Before he was apprehended I went to No. 28, Parliament-street, and found he did not live there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. On Monday, at four o'clock, he took her to go to his friend - A. Yes; he returned her a little after five o'clock. I never intended to sell either the bridle or saddle.</p>
               <p>Q. If the groom had brought you back the money for the mare, you would have been satisfied with that - A. I should have put it in my pocket certainly.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Your servant had no authority to sell it, nor had you sold it yourself - A. No, certainly I did not mean to trust him, as I did not know him.</p>
               <p>JOHN CHURCHMAN. I am groom to the prosecutor's brother. On Tuesday, the 16th of February, I took the mare to Mr. Young's, No. 28, Parliament-street; the clerk came out, and said the prisoner was not there, but would return there in a few minutes. I walked the mare up and down, and in a few minutes the prisoner came to me from towards Westminster Abbey; I told him he might make a trial of the mare if he liked, and show it to his friend in Gloucester-place. I said nothing more to him. He got on the mare, and said he would take care to return it by half-past four o'clock in the afternoon - she was not returned; I have never seen her since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Tell us exactly the words that passed - A. I said my master said he might take her to his friend in Gloucester-place. He said he would either return the mare at half-past four o'clock, or a note to say that he would keep her.</p>

Smithers and Sard, in St. Martin's-lane.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I have known him two years. He has been in my employ for six weeks; he left me about a fortnight before the 15th of February.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he not permission from you to have letters and messages addressed to your house - A. It was only letters from a Mr. Sard that were addressed to my house, not messages. He occasionally called to see if there was any letter.</p>

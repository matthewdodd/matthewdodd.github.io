                  </hi>. I am a carrier, of Kingston-upon-Thames—on 19th February, about 7 o'clock p. m., I was in Camomile Street, City, with a van—I went into a booking-office, came out almost directly, and saw the prisoner at the side of the van—he had hold of a chest of tea with both hands—I had seen him standing there when I went in—his leg was on the fore wheel—he dropped the box into the van again, and I <hi rend="italic">collared</hi> him—he had lifted it, and another box, which wedged it up, fell down,. and it did not go back into the same place—he wanted to know what I was doing; he said that he was going to make water—he dragged me down, and dragged me further than I am from you—I called "Police!" and gave him in custody—the chest contained 28 lbs. of tea.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There was only the pavement between the cart and the booking-office—this is the chest (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he actually had it in his hands when I caught hold of him—he said at the station that he was making water.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 31st of July I was at a fire near London-bridge; I saw a gentleman on <placeName id="t18270913-352-crimeloc1959">Fish-street-hill</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is the girl here? A. No; she said she found it in the street, and a young man dropped it; I was close to the gentleman, but there came such a rush I could not get to him.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was with Robinson, and saw the prisoner attempting to get his hand into the slip pocket of the gentleman, but he could not; I saw him turn the flap of the coat up, and get the book out - it dropped, and the girl took it up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long did this take? A. It might be a minute or two - I was two or three yards from the gentleman, but I did not give an alarm, because there were so many of them - I had a neighbour with me.</p>

            . I was going down Fish-streethill, and saw the prisoner with another person - they tried every one of the gentleman's pockets, and then turned up the flap of his coat, and the book dropped out; a girl picked it up - she would not give it up at first.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How near were you to the gentleman? A. As near as I could be, next to the officers, not more than two yards from him; the prisoner was two or three minutes putting his hands into his pockets; the moment the prisoner was caught hold of, there was a mighty rush, and the gentleman was carried away with the stream.</p>

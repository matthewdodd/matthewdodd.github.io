On the 1st of January, about six o'clock in the evening, I was in my shop; my dog went to the door, and began barking; I then went to the shop door - it rained very hard; I saw the prisoner standing against my private door, close by the shop window; I asked what he did there; he said he was standing out of the wet; I told him he was welcome; he had a basket in his hand with oranges, as if he was selling them. I went in, and in about half an hour, as the dog kept barking about the door, I went to look again, and saw the prisoner standing by the private door, but took no notice of him; I then went down into the warehouse, which is under the shop, and Mrs. Cobb knocked for me - it was then almost eight o'clock; I came up immediately, went towards the street door, and saw the prisoner taking a decanter out through a square of glass, which had been cut; as soon as he saw me coming he left the decanter half in and half out of the window, and ran away directly; I pursued him, crying Stop thief! a gentleman stopped him at the corner of Bulstrode-street - I had not lost sight of him once; I took him to the watch-house; the window was perfectly whole at four o'clock; I had been in the shop all the rest of the evening; I never heard nor saw it broken till then - it was a half circle cut out, and appeared to have been done with some instrument; a decanter could be taken through.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. What did you lose? A. A decanter and two stoppers were taken clean out, and one decanter was left hanging in the window; my wife is not here - she knocked for me to come up.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say? A. She said she saw a suspicious<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182801100007"></xptr>person walking backward and forward before the door repeatedly; that he had been to the shop door twice offering oranges to sell, and, suspecting him, she had knocked me up; I went into the parlour, and asked what she wanted, and when she told me this, I immediately went along the shop, as I have said; she said the person had been there the best part of an hour, while I had been in the warehouse; I did not see the prisoner cut the glass, but I saw him drawing the decanter out through the hole; my wife saw him next morning at the watch-house, and said he was the man, but I knew him myself; I never lost sight of him - I had seen him at six, and at half-past six o'clock, against the private door; I did not see the first decanter taken out, nor did my wife, for she was in the parlour - she was in and out of the shop, as I could hear her walking about.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. I understood you to say, your wife said he had twice come to the door to offer her oranges? A. Yes; I am quite sure I saw the same man stopped whom I had seen endeavouring to get the decanter out.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 1st of January I heard a cry of Stop thief! and found the prisoner in custody of Mr. Cobb, who gave him into my charge; he had no basket then; I took him one street from the shop - I had seen him myself an hour before, walking about Cobb's window with oranges - I am sure he is the same man; I found 8s. 5d. on him - I should know the basket again - I saw it produced before the Magistrate at the office.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. About what time did you see him with the oranges? A. Seven o'clock; Mr. Cobb's house is on my beat; I was only by there once, and noticed him as being a stranger; there were three or four oranges in the basket - I can swear to the basket - there were not many people about at seven o'clock - I will swear there was no one but him that I saw; I did not see Mrs. Cobb at the shop window.</p>

            . I live at Mr. Brown's, next door to Cobb's. On the 1st of January, about eight o'clock at night, I heard a cry of Stop thief! I went down stairs, and saw a basket on the step of our own door, which is the space of a shop window from Cobb's door; there was a decanter and two stoppers in the basket, with some oranges; I took it in to Mrs. Cobb - I saw it there again the next morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you noticed the shop about an hour before? A. No; I had not been out - I was in doors all the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mrs. Cobb tell you she had seen several suspicious persons about the window? A. Yes; and she said a man came in with oranges, and he was a very suspicious fellow; that she told him she wanted none, and she heard a noise, and knocked for Mr. Cobb to come up - I believe she did say there were several suspicious persons about the window.</p>

            . Here is the basket, with the decanter, stoppers, and oranges in it; when the window was broken, a person could not reach the decanter without putting his hand in.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was passing the shop, going to my lodgings. I saw several persons running; I ran after them a great way; the prosecutor came and laid hold of me, saying I had broken his window, and at the watch-house he said I attempted to break it, and steal a decanter. Next day the constable of the night asked the watchman if he had any charge to make against me; he said he had not, but when before the Magistrate, the watchman said he had seen me walking before Cobb's shop. When Cobb came he said a little girl had brought the basket in with the decanter and stoppers, and it must be the one I had stolen.</p>

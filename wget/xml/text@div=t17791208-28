               <p>Do you remember fastening up the house on the night of the 25th of October? - I do not recollect fastening the house that night; I had just come out of a fit of illness, and went to bed sooner that night than some others of the family.</p>
               <p>Was you in the garret that night? - Yes, at about eight o'clock. I did not miss any thing then, every thing appeared as usual.</p>
               <p>When did you go into the garret in the morning? - About seven o'clock; there were seven or eight shelves empty; a great quantity of linen, and different sorts of handkerchiefs were taken away; there were found about 352 in the prisoner Howell's bed afterwards, there were eight tiles taken off the roof of the house; there is a space between the roof and the joists of about twenty-five inches, which is rather too flat for a man to get in, without straining himself very much; he must have squeezed through there; about the distance of a foot, then there was a hole through the lath and plaister into the garrat, big enough to let in a large man, that was the way the person must have got in; in the inside of the tiling I found two buttons, and have them now in my possession.</p>
               <p>Did you give any account of the loss to the pawnbrokers in the morning? - Yes; and in consequence of an information I went about eleven o'clock to the second or third house in Dunning's-alley, which is about twenty yards from our house. I enquired if

             lived there; I was told she did. I went up stairs, and enquired if she was within; the prisoner Howell said she was not. I said she was just come up, and I was sure she was there; he refused to let me in; I put my hand on the door, and went in; I laid hold of him by the collar, and said he was the man I wanted.</p>
               <p>Was there any body with you?</p>
               <p>Yes, Mr. Davidson's boy. We found, before the constable came, upwards of 300 handkerchiefs, on the bed and under his bed, in his room. I observed, before several persons, that I had found two buttons; there were two buttons missing from the bottom of Howell's waistcoat, and one that was left on corresponded with the two I found; that button was cut off, and delivered to the constable. (The buttons were produced in court.)</p>
               <p>Court. It was seven in the morning before you went into the garret? - It was.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177912080035"></xptr>It was light then? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How high is the cieling of the garret? - Between nine and ten feet; the cieling was cut with a knife, and taken out by pieces; there was a ladder in the room.</p>
               <p>Did you go first into the room in the morning? - No; the boy, whose name is Cameron, went into the room first; I went in about half an hour after.</p>
               <p>Did he tell you there was any thing missing in the room? - He did not.</p>

               <p>Did he tell you the cieling was broke, and somebody had been in? - He did not; when I saw him he was not in that part of the warehouse.</p>
               <p>He had been in half an hour before you? - I cannot be certain; he had been in some time before; it was not in the room where the cieling was broke that the goods were taken from, there was a door between the rooms not shut.</p>
               <p>Which of the rooms did you first go into? - Into the room the goods were taken from.</p>
               <p>Did you immediately miss the goods on going in? - I did.</p>
               <p>Jury. Which room did the apprentice go into first? - Into the room the goods were taken from.</p>
               <p>Did he take any notice of it? - He did not, as he told me when I asked him.</p>
               <p>Where is the apprentice? - He is at home.</p>
               <p>There were some ladders in the room where the hole was? - Yes, which we make use of to remove the goods from one shelf to another.</p>
               <p>How near was the hole in the cieling to the wall? - Close to the wall by the window.</p>
               <p>When you went in was there a ladder standing near that hole? - There was not.</p>
               <p>Where does the window open to? - Over a parlour sky-light of our own; it was a two-pair-of-stairs window; there was a shelf near the hole that a man's foot could reach from the hole.</p>
               <p>How high is that shelf from the floor? - About four feet.</p>

               <p>On the 26th of October I was informed by Mr. Davidson's young man that Mr. Davidson had been robbed, and lost a great number of handkerchiefs and other things. About an hour after that the prisoner Brown came to my shop, and brought two handkerchiefs pinned up, as pawnbrokers pin their handkerchiefs up, when they put them on a shelf. I bid the boy make out a duplicate, and I would give her the money. I told my boy I had a suspicion of her, and bid him keep her till I came back. I went to Mr. Davidson's; when I came back she was gone. I went to the room in Dunning's-alley, and saw the two prisoners. I knew the woman again directly; there were three hundred and odd handkerchiefs found in the room. Mr. Davidson and M'Lane claimed them immediately. Upon Mr. M'Lane saying they found two buttons I said I thought it was proper to examine him to see if there were any like them on his waistcoat. I saw there was one like them, and I desired Prosser to take it off; he did; I got a coach; as he was going into the coach I said he seemed stuffed about the breeches; he said stay till I get into the coach, and I will give you all I have, and he produced thirty-seven handkerchiefs out of his breeches, and from his coat and waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Was there any enquiry made of the prisoners how they came by the things? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Did you hear either of them say any thing about them? - I think, to the best of my knowledge the man said he dealt in those things.</p>

This man came up to the room; I let him in, and he called up Davis; they found some things in the box. I know nothing of them.</p>

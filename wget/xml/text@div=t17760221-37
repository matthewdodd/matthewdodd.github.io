               <p>Did you observe whether there were any carriages passing, or people walking at that time? - There were a great many people walking, but not any carriages.</p>
               <p>Had your servant a stambeau? - Yes; he desired the servant to hold it on the other side of the coach.</p>
               <p>Could you distinguish the person of the man? - No, his face was covered with either a red handkerchief or a mask.</p>

               <p>Have you any idea what sort of a man it was? - He appeared about the size of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect how he was dressed? - He had a light-coloured loose great coat on, and his hat was slapped.</p>
               <p>Did he appear to be a thin man or a fattish man? - Neither one nor the other.</p>
               <p>Had he his own hair or a wig? - I could not distinguish that.</p>
               <p>Was his mask, or whatever it was, over his face only or over his head? - It was not over his head; it seemed to be only over the lower part of his face.</p>
               <p>On which side of the square was it? - The north side.</p>
               <p>Did you see which way he went off? - We were going to Upper Grosvenor-street, he went the contrary way.</p>
               <p>Did he overtake you or meet you? - He overtook us; when he had robbed us he turned back again.</p>

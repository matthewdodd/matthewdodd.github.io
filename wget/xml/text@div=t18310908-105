            . The prisoner and her husband came to lodge at our house on the 17th of June - these articles were let with the lodgings; I went up, in consequence of a lodger calling out, "Mrs. Nichols has pawned your blankets;" I went into the room - the prisoner said, "I have only pawned one blanket," but I insisted on going to the bed - she owed me 2l. 10s., which was five weeks' rent; I do not know whether she was distressed - she behaved very well.</p>

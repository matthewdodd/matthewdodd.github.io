I then sat down on the chair and she sat on my knee; she pulled my watch out of my pocket, I had no suspicion of her absconding, with that I took off my clothes and was going to bed, and at that time she took the opportunity of leaving the room. I did not see her again till ten o'clock the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. There was some money besides, how came that to be taken - A. I cannot tell at what period I lost that money, I had it in my pocket when I went into the room, and when I came out I had it not.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you sober - A. I was capable of transacting any thing that came in my way, I am sure this is the woman, I had not been in company with any other woman that night. I have never found my watch since.</p>

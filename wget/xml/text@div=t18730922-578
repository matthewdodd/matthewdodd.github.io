                  </hi>. I am a labourer—at the time this happened I was living at 6, Shooter's Terrace, Fulham—I had lodged with the prisoner and his wife at Manchester—I left them three months ago—on 4th September the prisoner's wife had been living with me about three months, and the prisoner, who I had not seen since I left Manchester, came to my lodging, between 1 and 2 o'clock, and asked his wife to return with him, and he would forgive her all she had done—she said that she did not like to do it—he pressed her to go back and remained in the room with me and his wife till about 5.30, when he threw a bottle which struck my face, some black liquid came out of it, and burnt me very much—he then took up a chair and was going to strike me with it, but I closed with him and somebody called "Murder!" and the police came—the whole of the skin of my face was injured, and my eyes were swollen—my left eye is all right now, and my right eye is getting better.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I lodged with them about twelve years—I am aware that they were married for twenty-two years, and lived a happy life till I came between them—I seduced the prisoner's wife three months ago—I had had no quarrel with the prisoner, we were always on good terms—I did not induce her, when she was on a visit to her friends, to come to me instead of going back to her husband, she came of her own accord—I did not write to her and ask her to come, I had said nothing to her about it beforehand, that I swear—I did not know that when she went to her friends for a short visit she never intended to return to her husband, but I knew it afterwards—I knew that the prisoner was a highly respectable man, employed as hall<lb></lb>keeper at the Manchester City Mission—the prisoner told his wife that if she would go back he would forgive her everything, I said that I did not wish her to go back.</p>

I am a labourer, of Oxford Place, Fulham—I was working right opposite Short's house, and I had worked with him; I heard a female call out "Murder!" went into Short's room, and found him and the prisoner clasped together; I separated them, and saw some dark liquid on Short's face—I said that it was a bad job, it would ruin him'for life; the prisoner said that he did not care if he went to the gallows for it—he was taken in custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of Fulham—I was called in to Short on 4th September—his face was very red all over, as If it had been burnt by some corrosive fluid; his eyes were a little swollen, but not as if any of the fluid had gone into them, but next day, at the Police Court, it seemed as if some of the fluid had gone into his left eye—one eye is injured, but the other appears as if it would get well, and the skin of the face is recover<lb></lb>ing—oil of vitriol would be quite sufficient to cause the injury I found—I sent a bottle, and some fluid was sent to me purporting to come from the bottle taken from the prisoner; I examined it and found it to be oil of vitriol—this bottle neck (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was afterwards shown to me; I extracted the cork, it looks as if it was burnt by some corrosive matter—Short's clothes were in rags, being burnt full of holes from some corrosive fluid.</p>

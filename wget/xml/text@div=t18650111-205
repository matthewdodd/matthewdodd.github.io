I am a linendraper, at 15, Blackheath<lb></lb>hill, greenwich—there is another Mr. Lainson living in High-street, Dept<lb></lb>ford—about the middle of the day on Friday, 2d December, I saw a roll of striped shirting outside my door; only one yard of that roll had been sold—I first missed it on Monday morning, the 5th—there were 105 yards in the piece; is worth 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—this is the part that has been found (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it resembles that which I lost in every way—here is my own mark, here is the ticket and the selling price on it, in my own handwriting—the other pieces that have been found resemble mine; it is all one piece—I have pre<lb></lb>viously seen the prisoner in my shop—her purchases have been very small—I have never known her to lay out more than 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. at a time.</p>

Crossley and Phillips's; I think that is nine yards too"—she said, "I know nothing about them"—I then took her to the police-station and sent for Mr. Lainson—he went with me and identified a portion of the property pledged at Mr. Sharp's—she said it was on the Saturday night that she had sent the piece to be pledged, and, I think, on the Friday afternoon that she pledged the piece which bore the mark—she first said it was in the fore part of the day that she pledged the thirteen yards at Mr. Sharp's—I asked Mr. Reed, in her presence, what time it was, and he said it must have been between 4 and 5 in the afternoon, to the best of my belief.</p>

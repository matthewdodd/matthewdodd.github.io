I have had every facility given me through Touzon for investigating the affairs—he did not keep the books; he gave me information upon every point upon which I required it, but he did not know whether some of the cheques were for interest or for taking goods out of pawn—I do not say that he had as much information regarding financial matters as Silveyra, but he knew of them—the majority of the securities have not yet been realised, but the different merchants who supplied goods have seen them since in the pawnbrokers' hands—I do not propose to go any further into realising the goods pawned, the assets still to get in are the stock in trade, which I am going to realise, and some of the book debts—there are very few debts outstanding—the major portion of the assets as shown by the prisoners I do not intend to realise, as there is no interest to the estate in doing so—I tabulated the statement of affairs from information given me by Touzon, who went occasionally to Silveyra in prison for in<lb></lb>formation which he was not able to give me himself—I find by the books that the names of creditors to the firm are limited in number, and that very large payments have been made to some of them during the five years they have been in business—I have referred to the pass-book but not to the bill-book—I find that the prisoners commenced business with a capital of only 78<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I paid Touzon during my receivership while he was giving me the</p>

I was employed to investigate the books and the state of their affairs, and when I found anything I did not understand I went to Touzon for information—I made my report and an affidavit—from the trans<lb></lb>actions which are entered in the books a person would not be able to discover that they raised 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by pawnbroking, and were paying 750<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year interest—I got the duplicates from Messrs. Lewis and Lewis, who were acting for the creditors—it is considered that there would be no surplus after paying the pawnbrokers' charges, therefore it would not justify us in taking the goods out—the amount of pawnings during the last four months before they went into liquidation is about 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—half of the whole amount is within the last four months preceding their bankruptcy—if they had not met these bills their credit would have stopped—we hold a bill which the bankers have, and which will not be met till August—the cash is only 34<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

I said "I have been looking at your account; can you pay your acceptances when they fall due I because if you cannot I shall not sell you any more diamonds"—he said" Certainly we can"—I said "You are quite sure of that?"—he said "Yes; what makes you ask such a ques<lb></lb>tion?"—I said "I don't care to run any risk in making a bad debt; if you say you can, I will show you some more," and I took a box from my pocket and sold him some more for 154<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for which he gave me a bill, but I have received nothing on it, and never shall; there is not a farthing in the world for me—I next saw my goods in the police-court, produced by Mr. Vaughan as pawned on 24th January, the day after, at least a parcel of the same size, but being unmounted it is difficult to identify them, as Silveyra had his settings in silver, and he put every stone into the silver settings, and these are the same sized stones in the parcel pawned at Mr. Vaughan's, and the same quality exactly as those I sold on the 23rd—I should not have let him have them except for the statement he made—I have been selling diamonds for 34 years, and that is the first time I ever heard of diamonds bought one day being sold the next.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi>. I have been a long time in the trade—I have had many such transactions—it is a very usual practice of jewellers, for temporary accommodation—the pledgings before December run into May, June, and July—the interest was paid, so that the right to get out the articles was left—some of these goods were taken out, and on the same occasion others were put in—it is an ordinary thing to bring other goods, and to redeem previous lots as they have occasion, so that they have our capital to work with at 15 per cent.—trade has been very bad for two or three years—my experience is that pledges are less in bad times than good times—I account for that by there not being such a demand for goods—at the present time diamonds are very low—they advanced about 41. on them, and they would fetch 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a carat; that means 25 per cent. margin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. It is usual to pledge goods for temporary accommodation—I should not think much of it if you pledged your pencil case to pay your cab, but it would depend how often it was done—it has often occurred to me that a man brings 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of diamonds and pledges them, but not for a temporary advance—if he wants money he comes to me to get it, but we will not have it unless we get good security—every tradesman is liable to sudden pressure—it would not be carrying it to an extreme extent to supply tradesmen with capital to carry on their business—it would be highly improbable that they would do so at 15 per cent.—a sudden pressure is one thing, prolonged want of capital is different, but we do not set up to supply tradesmen with funds.</p>

I received the instructions to pawn invariably from Silveyra, and not from Touzon—he was chiefly employed in the workshop—I have known the defendants many years; I knew them when they were at Clapham—I was a helper in their commencing business. Re-examined. I assisted them to start—they sometimes came to me and sometimes I was taking diamonds to offer them—I live nearly ten minutes' walk from them—my services were only a matter of friendship; I never got a shilling commission—sometimes Silveyra came to my place and sometimes Touzon, and sometimes Silveyra sent a boy to my place, or I was taking goods to their office.</p>

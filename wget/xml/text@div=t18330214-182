On the night of the 2nd of February I went to the British Lion, in the City-road; my mate was with me - Sedley and Potter came in - one of the company asked them to drink, and they had some beer at my expence; I then sent my mate to see to my horse, and when he returned, he brought some bottles back for me - Sedley asked me what I was going to do with them; I said, "To take some gin to some of my neighbours;" she said I should not have them filled there, she could take me to a place where I could get it better and cheaper - I then went with her, Potter, and my mate, to another public-house, where I got them filled; I had some gin and cloves there - Sedley, Potter, and my mate, had some rum; we then all went to the prisoners' house - I agreed to give Sedley 3s. to sleep with her: we had some more gin and cloves there, and I and Sedley went into a bed, in which there was another woman - I had put my waistcoat and breeches under the pillow, in which I had my pocket-book, with a 5l. note, and four sovereigns and a half, and some silver lapped up; I cannot tell whether I put out the candle or Sedley, but, after we had been some time in bed, Sedley had one arm under my head, and the other over me - I heard some hand handling of paper: I then listened and heard my pocketbook drop on the floor; I made an excuse that I wanted to get up, to which she objected, but I did get out, and, on getting out, I trod on my waistcoat, took it up, and the pocket-book was not in it; I then felt on the floor, and found my pocket-book open - I called my man, and said,"I am robbed;" he came into the room - we looked, and found the 5l. note in my pocket, but the sovereigns, and half sovereign, were gone; Potter then came into that room, but I did not see Smith till after the officer came - neither Smith nor Potter were in the room when I lost my money; I opened the window, and called Police! two sovereigns were afterwards found on Potter, and one sovereign in Smith's month, but that was in the lower room - I am positive it was Sedley took my money; I think it must have been conveyed to the other; when my man and Potter came up, I had charged Sedley with having my money, and she said, "Search your pockets" - I felt, and found the 5l. note, and some silver loose in my pocket.</p>

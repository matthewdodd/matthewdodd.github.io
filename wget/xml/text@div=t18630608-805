                  </hi>. I am a bonnet manufacturer, and live at 24, Stewart street, Spitalfields—I knew the deceased, William Henry Doggett, twenty or thirty years—he lived at 19, Shoreditch, and was an ironmonger; he had a Shop there—the prisoner was living with him; she is his wife—he was 38 when he died—for some months before his death I had been in the habit of seeing him at his residence—he was suffering from dropsy, and had been con<lb></lb>fined to his house fur some months—when I saw him it was in his bed-room—when I have been there the prisoner was generally drunk—I have heard that they have been married six or seven years, but I don't know. (Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">submitted that in this case he was entitled to call for strict proof of marriage, the allegation being that death arose from neglect of duty on the part of the prisoner; mere cohabitation involved no duty; the only recognised duties were the natural and the paid; if a nurse undertook the charge of a patient for hire, no doubt a duty would arise; there were also the natural duties arising from the relationship of husband and wife; in this case there was nothing but the fact of the prisoner's being a wife that would imply any duty, and, therefore, as in a case of crim. con., strict proof of mar<lb></lb>riage was necessary.</hi> Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">BARON BRAMWELL</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">considered that this case intro<lb></lb>duced some novelty, although, perhaps, the principle was not a new one; mere cohabitation clearly carried with it no duty, but it might be a question sup<lb></lb>posing the man to be incompetent, from his condition of mind or body, to take care of himself, and the prisoner had charge of him, whether there was any duty towards him on her part, and whether, if he died by reason of the non<lb></lb>performance of that duty, she would be responsible; it had been said that strict proof of marriage was not necessary except in two cases, crim. con. and bigamy; he was very much inclined to think that the contention of Mr. Serjeant Ballantine was right; that, for there to be a duty, there must be the relationship of husband and wife, parent and child, other relationship imposing a duty of care; but if that were so, it might be proved in the ordinary way, by repute.</hi>

               <p>did; I think his mind was enfeebled by being allowed to lower so fast as he did—I don't think he had nourishment sufficient to keep him alive—at times he was in bed; except when he asked to be helped out—he could only walk with assistance—he could make his wants known—he was in a very dirty state—I have heard the prisoner use very bad words to him, calling him strange names, quite out of keeping with his own name—she called him "Bill," and "You love your Auntie, don't you?" and that sort of nonsense—she was not sober on those occasions—his Christian name was William—I have not seen him supplied with nourishment—I have on several occasions sent him barley-water from my house, and beef to make beef-tea, as there was none in the house, and the prisoner said she had not time to make it—I think I sent barley-water three times—I asked him if he liked it, and he said yes, it was very nice—I remember on one occasion, some months before his death, the prisoner having a short piece of narrow iron in her hand, and she shook it over him and said, "You know, Bill, I rule you with a rod of iron"—she was not sober at the time—he chided her for saying so, and said, "Be quiet, Annie"—his hair was in a very bad state, all matted together for want of combing—he had the use of his hands—he died on the Thursday, at twenty-five minutes to 6—I was there the evening before, and left him at half-past 10—he complained of being cold, and I assisted him through the passage to sit in a chair before the fire in the kitchen—he only had his shirt on—the kitchen was on the same floor as the room he came from—the prisoner was there—he was lying down in his room—he was helped up—there was nothing put round him—I think I assisted him with the prisoner, only us two—he asked to get up—I could say or do very little there without fear of being expelled; it was with great difficulty that I got to see him—about 3 o'clock the next morning I was sent for from my house—I went to the deceased, and remained with him till he died—he was sinking when I left at half-past 10 the night before; I did not think he would live the night through—when I got there in the morning the prisoner was drunk, and she was drunk when he died—he died on the bed—she was in the same room—she was standing up at that time, I raised her up; she had been sitting on the floor with a tumbler half full of brandy a short time before—she was drunk the whole time I was there, from 3 o'clock till he died—I never saw the prisoner give him any medicine.</p>

               <p>he was in a stupid drunken state, for he was down stairs engaged in his business; I should think he was in a stupid state through drink—I mean to say that he has not been a drunkard for years—I don't know who sent for me on this occasion; the cabman said Mr. Doggett had sent for me—I did not learn when I got to the house that the prisoner had sent for me; I had enough to do to help the dying man—there was a nurse in the house at the time, Mrs. Doggett's sister—she was in the house at the time of the death—there was no harm in the prisoner calling him "Bill," he called her "Annie"—I never heard him call her "dear" or "love," only "Annie"—he appeared to be very fond of her—previous to his death he became in such an emaciated state that there was no appearance of affection towards anybody, he had enough to do to bear the weight of his disease—I should not say that he appeared to be particularly fond of her.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Tinley-court, Old-street, St. Luke's—I was nurse to Mr. Doggett for fourteen nights; I left the Sunday before Easter—during that time the prisoner was living there as his wife—I can't say that I ever saw her thoroughly sober while I was there—Mr. Doggett was suffer<lb></lb>ing from dropsy—he was unable to go down stairs, except at one time, when I was kept at the door for an hour, he came down and let me in while the prisoner sat on the side of the bed—I had been out on an errand—it was the street door that he opened, and I said to him, "Good gracious, Mr. Doggett, make haste up"—he got up as well as he could; I don't know how, for I stayed to keep the door closed—when I went up stairs I found the prisoner sitting by the side of the bed, not sober—the bed-room was the first-floor front room—the doctor attended Mr. Doggett while I was there—medicine was sent regularly—it was not given to him at all times—when Mrs. Doggett was asleep I would sometimes give it to him—I used to be scolded for it; she said she would give it to him herself, and at last he would not take anything except what she gave him—I have seen her give him medicine—he was kept in a filthy dirty state; I never saw any one kept more dirty; he never had a clean shirt or sheet while I was there, nor was he washed or shaved until I begged very hard of her to let me have the barber in to shave him, which he did—I never saw his hair brushed or combed but that once that the barber did it—at times I used to give him such things as jams, and jellies, and grapes, and raisins—sometimes I was sent for them, and sometimes a young lad who was there—Mrs. Doggett used to send me—I saw her shake him once, and but once, and I saw her throw some liquor on the carpet when he would not drink it—I have heard her say several times that she wished he was dead; not particularly to him; she has said it in his hearing and out of his hearing—I was sent by his sister, Mrs. Wildbore, to nurse him—I left because I was very ill—one night when I was there the prisoner was very tipsy, and she fell between the kitchen and the parlour—she ordered her husband to come out of bed to help her—she swore at him terribly, and put her hand to her pocket and said, "I have got the will in spite of them all; they can do nothing, and have nothing"—one morning, when he was very bad and could get no rest, Mrs. Doggett sent me to Mr. Roper's, the surgeon; he came, and I went back with him, and he gave me a sleeping dose for him, to give directly; and she threw it into the fire and said, "I can poison him quite quick enough</p>

I live at 3, Gloucester-place, Bunhill-row, and am a nurse—I went to nurse Mr. Doggett on the Saturday, and came away on the Tuesday morning—I cannot say the date, it must have been three or four months ago—he was very ill—when I first went in Mrs. Doggett was in the act of retching; she was very tipsy indeed—while I was there, I saw her take up part of a mahogany chair in the act to throw at him, but she had not power to do it; it escaped him and went on to the side of the bed—she was never sober during the time I was there, night or day—if she was in a pet, she would thump him hard between the shoulders—she once gave him a blow on the side of the head, and then she would go to him and say, "Oh, never mind your Annie," or "your Auntie; I did not mean it"—and he has said, "You should not do it, you have hurt me very much"—I never saw him have any food; medicines were sent, but I never saw any given—Mrs. Doggett did not allow any person to assist him except herself—I went on Sunday evening to the doctor's and brought some medicine, which was to be given immediately, but she said, "Let it alone, I will give it myself"—whether she did or not I cannot say—she would scarcely allow any person to be in the room; she would not allow me to give him any food, or wash or clean him, or do anything for him.</p>

               <p>food given to him" regularly; he was always improperly attended to—she was never in a state to attend to him, and she would not allow any one else to do so—I have seen her behave with great violence to him, both in language and manner; I have seen her strike him repeatedly—at the time I left attending him, he was in a muddled state of brain, in a state of incapacity; he scarcely knew what he did; he merely lived a life of drinking and sleeping—he was, perhaps, just able to make his wants known, they were not many, he merely slept and drank—I repeatedly remonstrated with the prisoner about the way in which he was treated, and the neglect she was showing him; indeed, her general negligence was such that I declined to attend him any longer; I thought he was being lost through want of attention—on one occasion, when I was remonstrating with her about his sad condition, she insisted upon his coming down stairs in his shirt, saying that I was insulting her by making an observation of that kind—she was exceeding violent in her manner—he did come down in his shirt—after I ceased attending him, some one else attended him for a period of three months; at the end of that time, at the solicitation of his friends, my brother attended him—I heard of his decease—I made a post mortem exami<lb></lb>nation by order of the Coroner—I found no external marks of violence; he died of dropsy, liver disease, and disease of the kidneys—in my opinion, from the state in which he was when I ceased to attend him, want of care and attention would accelerate his death—I think his life was shortened by it, and that with proper attention it might have been prolonged.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You had not seen him for months before his death, had you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I saw him one night when my brother was out, three months before his death—his liver was very diseased, and the kidneys—he had dropsy as a result of kidney and liver disease—the dropsy was in the abdomen, the legs, and all over the body—he died of dropsy, not of congestion of the brain—I think he died of exhaustion, the result of the complication of dis<lb></lb>eases; it was a drunkard's liver—I do not know of his having made a codicil to his will a few days before his death—I cannot say that he was in<lb></lb>telligent during his illness—he was In a state of general incapacity, a sense<lb></lb>less, stupid, muddled state—he was constantly drinking while he was ill, but apart from that, he was in a stupid, muddled, incapable state—I cannot say that he always spoke affectionately of his wife—he was not capable of much conversation—I never told him that his wife was not taking proper case of him—I don't think I have ever been alone with him, not to have any conversation with him—he was very closely watched by his wife—I regarded him as in a state of incapacity; in a state bordering on imbecility—he was quite incapable of understanding what I said to him—I believe he was not capable of receiving any moral impressions whatever—I believe he was in such a condition that I could have made no impression upon him—he could not understand what I said to him, not in a proper manner—the drink had had such an effect upon his brain, that he was in a measure imbecile—I do not mean absolutely so, but in a semi-imbecile state, during the whole three months I attended him—he might have understood, to a certain extent, what I said to him, but he was not a man that a sensible person could reason with—I reasoned with his wife, and I had a communication with the churchwarden—I represented his condition to the churchwarden, and stated that he was being treated in a manner which rendered it a case for magis<lb></lb>terial interference—that was soon after I ceased attending him; some few weeks after—I did not take measures to put him under proper care; a medical man must be very careful how he oversteps the line of professional</p>

               <p>duty, or he would get into a serious scrape—I wrote to his relatives, and com<lb></lb>municated with the churchwarden—I wrote to Mr. Wildbore, or rather, my brother did by my direction, the day after I left him, when he was brought down from one room to another—his relatives had full notice of his condi<lb></lb>tion, and a full opportunity of seeing all about it—my brother attended him during the last part of the three months, but it was only at the earnest solicitation of the deceased's friends that I allowed him to do so—the attend<lb></lb>ance was a mere farce—we charged 59<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the College of Surgeons—for the last three months before Mr. Doggett died I attended him—he was suffering from dropsy, and he died partly from that disease—the prisoner sometimes behaved kindly to him, and sometimes harshly, from the fact of her not being in a condition to help him; he required moving occasionally, and there was no one to do it but her, and she, from her condition, was not fit to move him, and did it very clumsily, and consequently put him to pain—those are the only acts of violence to which I refer—I sent medicines—I don't know whether they were given to him or not.</p>

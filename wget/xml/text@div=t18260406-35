            . I am the prosecutor's wife. I put the children to bed about seven o'clock, in the backroom on the ground floor; the eldest is seven years old; this blanket, quilt, and two coats, were laid on the top of the bed; I brought the candle out of the room with me, and shut the room door - I bolted the back door in the passage leading to the garden, and the room window was shut; we were sitting in the front room - there is a room between that and the bed-room - the bed-room and street doors were shut.</p>
               <p>JOHN NORRIS. I am inspector of the Bow-street patrol. On Friday night, the 17th of February, about a quarter or half-past ten o'clock, I was standing at the corner of Devonshire-street and Globe-lane, and saw the prisoners coming in a direction from Green-place, Twigg-folly, about 400 yards from the prosecutor's, each having a bundle - I knew them before - I went up and took hold of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182604060019"></xptr>Long - he had a bundle containing a blanket and counterpane; I tried to catch hold of Eaden but he slipped down, then got up and ran away, leaving a bundle and his hat behind him; I took them up and cried Stop thief! he was stopped in two minutes by a man who is not here, and both were taken to the watch-house; they made a most desperate resistance - Eaden's bundle contained wet linen - each of them had one of the prosecutor's coats on his back over his own. I am sure of Eaden - I knew him before.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my father at Norwood-green, near Hanwell, Middlesex—on 28th December, I was working with my father and some other men, on the canal that runs from Ealing to Brentford, near a bridge—about half-past 2, I went to the Victoria public-house to take back a bottle—on my way back towards the towing-path I met the prisoner and a boy—the prisoner had a double-barrelled gun, and a dog—the dog followed me for a few yards—as I got near the towing-path the prisoner came up to me, and he threw something at the dog—I said, "Don't do that"—he said no more, but came and caught bold of me and said, "Come along back with me"—I told him I was going on to the tow-path—I was then about twenty yards from it—I was not willing to go back, and he knocked me about; he hit me in the face, and the eye, and the nose—he threw me down, and jumped on me with his knees—he then said, <hi rend="smallCaps">"Go"</hi>—he meant go on to the towing-path—I did not go—I said I would go presently—he then bundled me across the ditch which divides the field from the tow-path—when I got on to the tow-path, I picked up a stone and said, "I will throw it; "he hallooed to the men at work on the path, and said, "I will give you something if you catch that boy"—when I had the stone in my hand, he put the gun to his shoulder, and kept it there—he said, "I will shoot you in the legs, and shoot you dead"—I then threw the stone, and he fired the gun—the shots hit me in the right side of the face, and the right side, and I fell—two men and the prisoner came up, and I was taken to the hospital—I was three or four weeks in St. Mary's Hospital.</p>

I am a fishmonger at Hanwell—on Wednesday, 28th December, about half—past 2 in the afternoon, I was in a meadow adjoining where this occurred, on the other side of the canal—the first that I saw was the boy and Sutherland having a few words together, about coming that way back to his work, and the boy refused to go back again when Suther-land wished him—he then struck the boy in the face, and he fell to the ground—the boy got up and resisted, and Sutherland struck him again—I did not hear the boy make use of any bad language—I did not pay that attention—after some little while, Sutherland told him he could go across the ditch, and he bundled him across, as it were, in a hurry—the boy then immediately looked about for some stones—he got one or more, I can't say, and went back to the spot opposite Sutherland, and there he stood in the attitude of throwing a stone for two or three minutes—Sutherland said, "If you throw the stone, I will shoot you"—I should think he was ten yards from him at the time—the boy threw the stone, and the prisoner fired the gun—the boy fell to the ground bleeding—I was in a meadow opposite, at the other side of the canal.</p>

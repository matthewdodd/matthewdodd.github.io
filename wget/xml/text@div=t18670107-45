I am a labourer, of 2, Chapel Court, Norfolk Street, Southwark Bridge Road—on 3rd December I was walking on the river bank between Blackfriars adn Southwark Bridges, on the upper shore, the part nearest the houses, and saw Timothy Spelling walking on the shore near the water—he called to me, and I went down and saw a bundle in the mud—I assisted him to get it out—it was a three-cornered shawl—the pin came out, and I saw the head of a child—I got a basket out of a barge, because the bundle was too muddy, put the child in it, took it to Emmerson Street steps, and sent for a constable—Bergin came, and I afterwards went with Hewitt to the vault of St. Saviour's Church, and saw the bundle there—I undressed the child, and took off it a three-cornered shawl, a little blue frock, a flannel frock, and two linen rollers marked "St. Saviour's Union"—it was a male child—I was present at the inquest.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of 13, Bridge Street, South-wark Bridge—on 4th December I was called by Drewitt and made an examination of the body of a male child—the whole surface was covered with livid patches, livid discolourations, but there were no marks of violence—the livid discolourations extended to the face—I then opened the head, and found the brain and its membranes perfectly healthy—I opened the chest and found the lungs pale and collapsed, and the right side of the heart full of clotted blood—the stomach contained a little milk, and the intestines a little foecal matter—every organ was perfectly healthy—the bladder was empty and the kidneys somewhat congested—my opinion is that the child died from <hi rend="italic">asphyxia</hi>, that is suffocation—there was nothing whatever to indicate disease—the appearances I describe were consistent with the cause I assign.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is suffocation the absence of air from the lungs from whatever cause? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—there was nothing to indicate what caused the <hi rend="italic">asphyxia</hi>—I have no doubt that in children death sometimes occurs where a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination shows no assignable cause for death—I should think that spasm of the glottis might cause a child's death, and leave no morbid appearance.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And compatible with suffocation by being overlaid? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, or any other cause—it is the fact that healthy children are sometimes suffocated by being overlaid, and are deprived of breath without any in<lb></lb>tention to destroy them—the symptoms I saw were consistent with death from that or any other cause.</p>

I am a widow, acting as nurse in the lying-in ward of St. Saviour's Workhouse—the prisoner came in on Saturday, 19th Novem<lb></lb>ber, but I did not see her till after she was confined, but I nursed her and the baby too—she nourished it well; she was very fond of it, and gave it plenty of suck—she had plenty of milk—she progressed towards recovery, and was quite healthy and strong—she continued in my ward up to the time she left the workhouse, which was on 1st December, near three o'clock in the afternoon—I dressed the child before she left in the very clothing produced, which I got from the matron—two of the articles are marked "St. Saviour's Union," but the mark washes out of the flanuels—this is the same shawl, bound with black; it is half of a large one—I saw a child's body on the Monday evening—it was too much disfigured for me to identify it, but I should say it was the baby—it was a male child, of which the prisoner was confined, and only one other person was confined in the work-house that week, and hers was a female child; she went out a day or two before the prisoner, and I have seen her child since alive—a child had not been born in the workhouse before that, for six weeks or so—I went with the prisoner before she left, to register the child, and it was registered George Williams—the prisoner gave that name.</p>

                  </hi>. I am surgeon to the Royal Free Hospital, and pathological anatomist there—I have had great experience for many years in the examination of the bodies of dead persons, and have often been examined on the part of the Crown in this Court—I have listened very attentively to-day to the evidence on the part of the prosecution, and especially to the evidence of Mr. Thorpe—the discolourations described by him on the post-mortem examination are not consistent with death within twenty-four hours; I speak of the discolourations all over the surface—you generally get discolourations on the back of a body, from the gravitation of the blood—the appearances described by Mr. Thorpe are consistent with ordinary appearances, but how soon you might expect to see them would depend in the first place on the cause of death, and also on the temperature and moisture of the atmosphere—I should say that some days at all events had elapsed since death—I mean that it is very highly improbable that there should be these patches of discolouration all over the body within so recent a period as twenty-four hours after death—the appearances of the viscera described by Mr. Thorpe are not consistent with death by drowning—the lungs were pale and collapsed, which is not the case in death by drowning, the lungs, are very seldom collapsed, and never entirely so—there is congestion of the brain in drowning, an accumulation of black blood in the brain—in cases where death has been caused by the forcible clasping of the throat, or strangling, you do not usually find the lungs in a collapsed state, you would find them dark red from sudden pressure—the pale colour of the lungs described by Mr. Thorpe is in my judgment inconsistent with sudden or forcible pressure on the luags from any cause, and inconsistent with any kind of suffocation, and as regards the membranes of the brain, I should expect to find them congested from violent suffocation—I should not expect to find the lungs collapsed if the air had been excluded from them by forcible means, or by forcible pressure bemade on the windpipe in any way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Irrespective of drowning, in any external violence whatever by which the air is excluded suddenly from the lungs, would you expect to find the lungs in the pale and collapsed state described to-day? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not—the death of infants is caused somethings by natural causes suddenly, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186701070108"></xptr>
               <p>without any premonitory symptoms—I had a child of my own die in my arms from spasm of the glottis—death is immediate in such cases unless the spasm yields, and I should be unable on a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination to discover any diseased organ—I should see signs of asphyxia, but not of the spasm—the appearances described to-day are, in my judgment, quite consistent with death from natural causes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You mean spasms? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That would be a natural cause—I entirely concur with Mr. Thorpe that the child died from asphyxia, but we cannot ascribe the asphyxia to any particular cause—we may say that it is not asphyxia from drowning or from any violent cause, but beyond that all is dark—the appearances Mr. Thorpe has described are absolutely inconsistent with death by drowning—I speak of the state of the lungs and brain—I entirely concur with him that death arose from asphyxia, but what produced the asphyxia he is unable to say, and I think that is a very scientific and proper view of the case—the asphyxia is consistent with natural causes—I do not speak of any external cause except spasms—I do not call pressure on the mother's breast a natural cause, or overlaying—I think the better way would be to limit the answer to spasm of the glottis.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Besides spasm of the glottis, are there other natural causes which might cause the death of a child presenting the same <hi rend="italic">post<lb></lb>mortem</hi> appearances? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should not like to give my adhesion to that without some qualification, and would rather waive the question.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. POLAND</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is what we understand by asphyxia in plain English suffocation? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; suffocation produces asphyxia, which is a negative condition, the absence of breath, and many cases may produce it—I have more than once made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examinationof a child which died from asphyxia produced by spasm—the child drank out of a tea-kettle which produced spasm of the glottis, and if it had lived long enough there would have been inflammation of the glottis—I cannot call to mind a single instance of death from natural spasm producing asphyxia, but I have certainly seen it occur—if death was caused by imperfect respiration caused by the shawl fitting over the child's mouth, and it sometimes being able to breathe a little and sometimes respiration being entirely stopped, I should expect to find the lungs in a different condition—it is a matter high improbability that the death was occasioned in that way, but I would not say that it was impossible—I should have had a great advantage if I had made the examination myself—I did not see the marks of dis<lb></lb>colouration, and therefore cannot say whether they might have been caused by the child having been fastened in the bundle and thrown from a height—my answer has reference to the question of putrefaction.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a chandler, and live in Regent-street, Westmin<lb></lb>ster. On the 16th of Dec., about four o'clock, the prisoner came to my shop-in payment for what he had, which amounted to 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., he offered a bad crown-piece—I put it into my pocket, and afterwards gave it to the police<lb></lb>man—I did not give it to any one else—I ultimately wrapped it in a piece of paper, and put it into my cash-box—there was no other crown-piece in it—I believe the prisoner is the lad, but my shopman speaks more positively—I did not give the money to ray shopman.</p>

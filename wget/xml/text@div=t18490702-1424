On Fri<lb></lb>day evening, 22d June, the prisoner and another woman came to my how a little after ten o'clock, and called for a pint of porter—the prisoner tooks crown-piece from her bosom, and laid it down—I put it in my teeth, and found it to be bad, and asked where she got it from—she said from a man she had slept with the night before—the other woman then paid three halfpence, and the prisoner a halfpenny for the beer—I put the crown on the mantle piece, and kept it there apart from all other coin till I gave it to the police<lb></lb>man next morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I manage the business of Joseph Pike, who keeps the Fox and Goose, at Shadwell. On 22d June, about eleven o'clock or a little after the prisoner came with another female for half-a-quartern of girl—she took a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.-piece from her bosom, and put it on the counter—I took it up, rung it, and she said that is good enough, I wish I had 100 of them—I gave her 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—I put the crown into my purse, and the purse into my pocket—I had no other crown—I looked at it again in five minutes, tried it with my teeth, and found it was not good—I sent the pot-boy after the prisoner, and in about five minutes she was brought</p>

I was on duty, and about half-past eleven at night, in consequence of what a boy said to me, I took the prisoner into custody, not a minute's walk from the Fox and Goose, and told her I took her in custody for passing bad money there—she said she had not been down there—I took her there, and Mrs. Sansum said you are a pretty sort of a woman to come down here, and offer me a bad 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.-piece—she said she had I not been there—I received this 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.-piece (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from Mrs. Sansum, and another one from Mr. Walker.</p>

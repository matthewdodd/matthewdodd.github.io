On the 25th of June I was with my sister, coming down King-street, and just before we got op<lb></lb>posite the King's Arms public-house I saw the prisoner and his wife stand<lb></lb>ing on the pavement—I saw him hit her on the left side of the head—she fell on her right side into the road—I had not heard them talking together before, but they seemed to be talking—she got up, and went to the other side of the road, and he walked in the middle—when they got about twenty yards, she went to him—he had only hit her once, but he made an offer to hit her then—she put her hand into her pocket, and he went into the Cheroot public-house—we went to where he knocked her down, and she showed us the mark where he had hit her in the head, and the scratch where she fell—I here is a pavement there—I saw her next Thursday coining from the doctor's—she looked very bad, and had her head bound up in a white cloth—I saw nothing more of the prisoner—I cannot say whe<lb></lb>ther he was sober or drunk.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. On the 26th of June the deceased came to me—I had known her for a few months, but had not attended her before—she complained of violent pains in her head—I examined it, but could perceive no external cause for it—she did not point to any part of her head—I gave her medicine, treating it as a common pain in the head, which frequently occurs—she came again on the 27th, and said she thought herself rather better—she came again on the 28th, and stated she was much the same—I saw her again on Wednesday the 30th, when I was requested to visit her—I found her considerably worse, and in bed—I ordered mus<lb></lb>tard plasters to various parts of the body, treating it as a case of inflamma<lb></lb>tion, and ordered leeches to the temple on account of the inflammation—there were no external marks of inflammation—she appeared in violent pain all over the head—she was not exactly sensible—she was not coma<lb></lb>tose—there was a wandering state of mind—I saw her again the first</p>

               <p>thing oh Thursday morning, the 1st of July—she was then much worse—she died on Saturday evening, the 3rd—I opened her head on Monday and found very extensive inflammation—I he sinuses of the brain filled with serous fluid, and the whole of the brain having marks of extensive inflammation—I found no external bruise, except a little scar on the left temple, which might have happened months before, for it was perfectly healed—my opinion is, from the history of the case during the time I treated it, that her death was caused from a blow received—I attribute her death to inflammation of the brain—I did not find any local injury within the skull—she was in a very emaciated state.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live at 196, Mile-end-road—on 20th september I saw the prisoner in the Dolphin public-house—I was having a glass of ale at the bar, and he came to me and said, "It is a fine day"—I said, "It is"—he said, "What are you doing to-day, do not you do anything a betting?"—I said, "I do, unfortunately"—he said, "I have got a good thing on to-day" and he pulled out a ticket with Valentine and Wright's name on it—he said, "I backed a horse 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at Valentine and Wright's, and I would not mind hedging"—I said, "You have got a good bet, what ill you hedge?"—he said "I would not mind 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to a 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,"—I said, "That a very good bet, I would not mind taking it"—he said, "Very well, you shall I have it"—I said, "How are we to stake our money?"—he said, "0h, am a perfect gentleman, I come up by the rail every morning and go back; night, I am well known at this house, I have dined here for the last six months"—he called the waiter, and said, "You know me, don't you, waiter?"—the waiter said, "Well, I have seen you here, I believe I know you"—he then referred to the barmaid, and said, "You know the name of Brooks, miss?" she said, "I believe you go by that name"—I had 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in my hand, and just as the landlord was coming into the bar, the prisoner took it out of my hand and went out at the door directly—I went out but could not see him—about three hours afterwards I saw him again, in front of the bar the Albion Tavern, Bridge-street—I caught hold of him by the collar, and said, "I want my 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. back that you have robbed me of"—he said, "I all not give it to you, the horse has not won yet"—I said, "It was no bet all, you robbed me of my money, and I shall never leave you go till you it to me, or else I shall lock you up"—we had a struggle together, and got outside, and he said, "If you don't leave me go, I will put my b——</p>

Q.</hi> Had you the money in your hand? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I held my hand out with the money in it and he took it out, it was four halfcrowns and ten shillings—I was sitting down at the time—he was standing up at a the side of the door—I am not a betting man—I have done a little in it—this was for the Wright stakes—I think it was at Newmarket I did not back any horse for the Cambridgeshire or for the Caesarewitch—the supposed bet I had with the prisoner was the last—I did not tell him my name—he did not tell me of a horse called "Summerside"—I agreed to take 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. because I thought the horse would win—I have taken the odds with other people—a man named Lee was the last person I betted with—I gave him a sovereign—I did not charge him with robbing me—the prisoner did not take his betting-book out in my presence—he did not come back to the Dolphin immediately afterwards and go up to dinner—I afterwards saw him in Bridge-street, Blackfriars, amongst the betting men, and they pulled out some notes and said, "How much does he owe you?"—I said "1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—one of them pulled out a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note and asked me to give him 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and one of them offered me a 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, they were flash notes—the prisoner declined to give me back my money—he said his name was Brooks—I intended to stake my money in the landlord's hands—the prisoner was a stranger to me—I never deposited my money before with a stranger—he did not ask me my name or enter it in his book—I can explain to you how he got hold of my name—on the day previous I was looking at the Times office, and a gentlemanly-looking man came up to me and spoke to me about betting—he said he was a trainer, and he asked me if be could write to me; so I foolishly gave him my name, and he was one of the men that was in the prisoner's company in front of the bar—nobody else was present that saw him take this money that I know of—I will swear that I did not tell him my name was Sims.</p>

On the afternoon of 20th September, about half-past three, I saw the prisoner and the last witness struggling together, opposite the Albion tavern, New Bridge-street—I went up to them—I saw one of the prisoner's mates with his fists up, pretending to knock the last witness over—I went to lay hold of him, and the prosecutor said, "This man has stolen a sovereign from me"—the prisoner ran up Bride-passage, through the Bell public-house, across Fleet-street into Poppin's-court, and down into Farriugdon-street, and ran into the second public-house on the left—I followed him and lost sight of him—I went into a room, and the waiter said, "He is behind the door"—I looked, and he was crouched up behind the door—I told him he was charged with stealing a sovereign, and he would have to go with me—he said, "Oh, go on, it is only a bet, let me go"—I searched him at the station, and found nineteen pawn tickets, two coins imitating sovereigns, three books for betting, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver—there were four halfcrowns—he gave me the name of Charles Brooks, 25 Queen-street, Peckham—I went there and found it to be false—I found an envelope with an address on it upon him.</p>

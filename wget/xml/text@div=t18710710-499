               <p>I doubted the signature—I went and examined it with other cheques, which confirmed my suspicion—I made a communication to the assistant manager, and then asked the lad into the manager's room—he was asked from whom he brought the cheque—he said from Mr. Child's, the solicitor, in Throg<lb></lb>morton Street, and that he was in Mr. Child's employ—he was asked to take a seat—I left the room with the assistant manager, to discover from what cheque-book the cheque had been taken, leaving the prisoner there, and when we returned he was gone—I produce an order for a cheque-book.</p>

I am a solicitor, of 7, Gray's Inn Square—the prisoner had been in my employ, but left six or seven months before this—he was out of a situation for about two months, and then went to Mr. Herbert, of New Inn—at the time he was in my service I kept an account at the Union Bank—the signature to this cheque is not mine—no one was authorized to put it there.</p>

At the time I was arrested I was in the employ of Mr. Herbert, of 5, New Inn. I wrote to him in the afternoon of 2nd June, to tell him I thought I should be with him in the afternoon, because I was absent on the day previous. Mr. Philipe visited me on 31st May, and told me that a cheque had been presented at his bank for payment of 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and asked whether I had done it; I told him I hat, although I knew</p>

               <p>nothing whatever of the affair. The reason I told him I had done it was because he had a matter of business to settle for my mother; he had known my father and mother many years, and I thought if I denied the accusation he would refuse to act, and thereby put us to great inconvenience and trouble, besides incurring considerable expense. I have been en trusted with several sums of money exceeding 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. during my stay with Mr. Herbert, and he can give a satisfactory account of my character.</p>

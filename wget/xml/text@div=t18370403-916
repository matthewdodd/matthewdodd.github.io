                  </hi>. I am an apprentice to Mr. Bird, a pawn<lb></lb>broker, residing at No. 141, Long-acre. On Sunday afternoon, the 19th of June, about half-past two o'clock, I was in a field in Kilburn, leading from Kilburn to Wilsden—in the parish of Wilsden, I believe, and in the! county of Middlesex—rain came on, and then I went and stood under a tree—no one was there when I went first—in about five minutes the prisoner came up—I am quite sure it was him—he wished to enter into conversation with me—I cannot exactly say his words, but I went further down to stand under another tree, and left him—while standing there the prisoner came up—he followed me—while I was standing there he took hold of my collar, and said, "Your money or your life"—I am lure he said that, when he had hold of the collar of my coat—I told him I had no money—he then said, "Let me feel in your pockets? "—he let go of me, and I ran into the middle of the field—he ran after me, and again took me by the collar of the coat—he then said, "Let me feel in your pockets?"—it was raining at the time, and I told him if he would come under the tree, I would give him all I had got, as I was fright<lb></lb>ened—(it was thundering and lightning at the time)—I told him that in consequence of fear—then he dragged me by the collar of my coat under the tree, and when we were under the tree, I gave him three fourpenny-pieces—I put my hands into my pockets—he then said, "Let me feel in your pockets, you have more?"—he did not feel—I put my hand into my pockets, and gave him two more fourpenny-pieces, but before that I asked him, if I gave him two more would he let me go away—he said be would, on his God—then I gave him</p>

               <p>the two—I heard the click of a gate, and saw two men about entering the gate, but instead of entering, they both went down the lane—I sung out, "Murder"—the prisoner let go of me when he saw the men—when the men were gone, he again took hold of me by the collar of the coat—I was standing in front of him, so that I could not run away well—he then said "If you do not give me ail you have got I will have your life"—that fright<lb></lb>ened me, and I gare him two more fourpenny-pieces, one shilling, and a sixpence, which I took from my waistcoat pocket—I had before takes then from my breeches—he then thrust his hand into my waistcoat pocket, where I had taken the money from—I heard some noise, as if it was one behind—after he had put his hand into my waistcoat pocket, he felt my folo, to feel if I had any watch, but while the men were at the gate I had slipped down—finding no watch there, and hearing this noise, he ran off, and left me—I did not follow him, I ran from him—when I got to the gate, I turned round, and saw the prisoner making his way through the hedge—I then crossed the other field to where my father was—I gift him and others information, and I and my uncle, and my father, went in pursuit of the prisoner—after a long search it was proposed to look in a barn—there were two gates to the barn—I entered at one, and came out at the other—I perceived the prisoner standing with his hat and coat off my father was standing by my side at the time, and I directly said, "That is the man, "in the prisoner's hearing—he instantly ran off, pursued by my father—we lost sight of him—I and my uncle went after him—he crossed the road to get into another field, where a man seeing him run by, and hearing the cry of, "Stop thief, "pursued him, but we lost him after running across five or six fields—we then ascertained who the man was that ran out of the barn, from some of the haymakers—I did not see bin again that day—we next heard that he was confined in Oxford jail—I went down on the 23rd of March, and saw him there—I am sure he is the man—litre not the slightest doubt of it—I was standing in the court of the prison, when, all unawares, the prisoners came out, and turned the corner—I said, "That's the man"—I knew him instantly.</p>

                  </hi>. I met the prisoner in Oxford-street on the night of the 30th of Dec., and she went home with me—I bought some meat for supper, and after that it was getting late, and she asked if I was going to bed—I said yes, and asked what she was going to do—she said it was too late for her to go home, she was locked out—I asked her to stop there, and after a while I went to bed—she said she should come and lie down by my side with her clothes on—the candle was put out—she then complained of being very cold, and wanted to lie close—she took my hand, and asked what I had got in my left hand—I had a paper containing a half-sovereign and three fourpenny pieces, which I had put into my shirt sleeve when I went to bed to conceal it—I said, "It is a bit of paper"—I then began to feel whether the money was in my shirt sleeve, and it was missing—I rose and got a light—I could not find it—she said it was in the bed-clothes, I should find it in the morning—I then put the light out, but I could not pacify myself, and lighted the candle again—I said, "I don't like this, I should rather find it"—she said, "Do you think I have got it? if you think that, I will smash you"—I said, "Well, never mind, perhaps I may find it in the morning"—I laid down again, and she said she would not stop longer, she should go home—I got up to let her out—I walked a little way with her, and saw a policeman—I told him the circumstances, and gave her in charge—it was found on her at the station.</p>

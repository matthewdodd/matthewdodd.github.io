                  </hi>. I keep the Horse and Groom beer-shop, Hackney-road—about 5 o'clock on 24th January, the prisoner came in, and asked for half-a-pint of ale, which came to 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he gave me a shilling, I tried it, and found it was bad—I went the other side of the bar, and told him I had been looking for him—I said "You have been here two or three times before"—he moved round to the corner and dropped a packet, which I afterwards found to contain thirteen shillings—I gave the first shilling to my wife—I gave the prisoner into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I have heard what my husband has just stated—the prisoner also came in on the previous Thursday, and had a glass of ale—he gave me a half-crown—I gave him his change—he drank his ale, and left quickly—in consequence of that I looked at the half-crown, and found it was bad—I put it in my pocket till the next morning, and then showed it to my husband, who put it in the fire, and it dropped through the bars like a piece of lead—on the Monday before the Wednesday, he came in and had a half-pint of porter, and a screw of tobacco—I knew him again—he gave me a shilling—I told him it was bad—he said, "I am very sorry, I have only a penny, and I will drink the porter"—I told my husband that he was the man I had received the bad half-crown of—I received a packet containing money from Mr. Balme who was standing in the bar, which I held until the constable came—my husband gave me a bad shilling, which I gave to the constable.</p>

I am a tobacco pipe maker, of Canal<lb></lb>wharf, Mile-end-road—I was in the Horse and groom on 24th January, and I saw Mr. Seabrooke take the prisoner by the collar—I was standing on his left side—I heard something drop which sounded like money—I picked a packet up, and handed it Mr. Seabrooke—it was about a foot from the prisoner—there were shillings in it, but I do not know the number—there was no one else standing at the bar at the time the packet was dropped.</p>

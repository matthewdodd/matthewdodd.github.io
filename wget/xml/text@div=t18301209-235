On the 26th of November, between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, I was inquiring about these boots, and missed them; I had seen them safe five minutes before in the shop, and in about half an hour I found the prisoner at the station-house with them - I am sure they are my master's boots.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. Between six and seven o'clock in the morning I saw the prisoner in conversation with another young man, coming down White Lion-street, Pentonville, about a quarter of a mile from Ward's shop, Smith crossed knocked at a street-door, and asked if they wanted buy lemons; the other kept the same side of the way - the prisoner was not admitted to the house; I went up and asked what he had got under his great coat - he said a pair of shoes; they were a sort of half-boots - I asked him how they came in his possession; he said he brought them of a man at Hornsey, that the man carried a bag, and he gave 5s. 8d. for them - I took him to the station-house: no lemons were found on him - seeing the other man had another pair of boots under the breast of his coat, I went back for him, but he got away - the prosecutor lost two pairs; I found out Emery, who claimed them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. There was nobody with me? A. I saw them both talking together, each having a pair of boots.</p>

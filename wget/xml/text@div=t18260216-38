            . I am nearly fourteen years old, and live in New-court, Brick-lane. (The witness being questioned appeared perfectly aware of the obligation of an oath.) I live with my parents - my father is a hempdresser. On Tuesday night I was in Brick-lane, and saw Mrs. Meyers; a boy came up to her, and said, "Halloo! mistress," and one of the others pushed her - there were four of them; she had an umbrella and pattens in her hand; this was just by New-court; I do not know who the boys were, or whether she lost any thing then - she told them to go on, like good boys; they stopped by her; I stopped at the end of Seward-street, and saw her go into<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182602160031"></xptr>>a chandler's-shop, and when she came out the boys were standing by the window - they made a pull at her shawl; she went up to Rahere-street, and there they pulled her down, and took her umbrella, saying "Pulley, hoy" - I did not see them do any thing more to her. A gentleman picked her up - she held by the rails, and could hardly stand. When they had got the umbrella one of them was standing under a baker's window, whistling; this gentleman was coming by. I pointed him out to him - he had not got the umbrella, but was one of those who illused her, and pulled her down - the gentleman laid hold of him; I am sure he is one of the party; the prisoner is the boy I am quite sure; I had never seen him before, to my knowledge - he was with the boys all the time - it lasted about an hour, I think. I stood some distance from them - he is one who waited at the window for her; there was a light in the window; I am positive he is one of them. There are oil lamps in Rahere-street; I am sure he went with the other boys from the window to the spot where they robbed her - he did not take the umbrella - I should know that boy again.</p>

            . I am the last witness's sister, and am eleven years old. (This witness also had a compelent knowledge of the obligation of an oath.) I was with my brother, standing at the top of the court, which is next to Seward-street; I saw Mrs. Meyers walking along - one boy came up to her, and said. Halloo! mistress," and the others shoved her - she told them to go on like good boys - there were four of them - they walked behind her- she had an umbrella and pattens in her hand; they kept walking behind her - she went into a chandler's-shop, and came out in a few minutes; they stood at the window while she was in there - I and my brother stood at the corner was one of them - I saw their faces while they stood at the window; I never saw him before, but am certain of him, because he had no hat on, and a little thin shortish stick in his hand - the others had hats on. Mrs. Meyers came out of the shop, and as she went down Seward-street they tried to get her shawl off; they followed her into Little Rahere-street; I said I would follow my brother - they knocked her down, and pulled her umbrella from her, saying, "Pulley hoy," and then two of them, who had got the umbrella, ran down that street, and down another; I and my brother were going home, and we saw the prisoner under the baker's window, whistling - I am sure he was with them when Mrs. Meyers was robbed - he did not take the umbrella; my brother and a gentleman helped to pick her up - she was bleeding at the nose, and seemed hurt - she could hardly stand. I and my brother were going home after picking her up, and saw him whistling under the window - we pointed him out to the gentleman, who took him - we went with him to the watch-house, and told the same story there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you see me touch the lady? A. No - he did nothing himself. There were three other boys- I should know the one who took the umbrella; he had a white jacket and leather apron on.</p>

            . I live at No. 63, Rahere-street. I was leaving my own home, and found the prosecutrix laying on the pavement, bleeding - a woman stood by her, and asked my assistance to pick her up; I think there was a boy or two there, who went away. I believe the two witnesses were there, for I asked how it occurred, and they told me. I left the prosecutrix in care of the woman, and went round the corner, where the two witnesses pointed out the prisoner, standing under the baker's window in Goswell-road, about two minutes walk from where the prosecutrix was; I secured him, and took him to the watch-house - they went with me, and gave the same account as they have now - word for word; the prisoner denied it - he had no hat on, and dropped a shortish stick on the way to the watch-house.</p>

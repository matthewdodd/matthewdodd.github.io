                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City police-constable</hi> 657.) On the morning of the 17th of April, I saw the prisoner and prosecutor in New-street, Bishopsgate-street—I said to him, "Young man, take care; if you have got any property about you, perhaps you will be robbed"—I saw them go into No. 1, Swan-yard—I went round my beat, and about half an hour afterwards I saw her run out of Swan-yard—I followed her to her lodging in Petticoat-lane—I searched her, and found on her this watch, guard, and handkerchief.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> When I first met the prosecutor he was drinking with the policeman in New-street, between one and two o'clock in the morning; he asked if I would go home with him; as we were coming out of the public-house, the policeman took out of his pocket a purse with four sovereigns; we went to a house, but could not get in; and the prosecutor said, "Come along with me;" the policeman said, "You will do right to go with him." I went to his lodging, he said he had no money, and would give me his watch till the morning; he put the watch down my bosom; I stopped with him some time; I put the watch on the table again, and came out I saw the policeman, and told him what had occurred; he said, "You are a fool not to have the watch;" I said, "You don't mean that, do you?" he said, "Yes, go and get it, and I will see it is all right." I went back and got the watch, thinking it might be gone, and I should be accused of stealing it.</p>

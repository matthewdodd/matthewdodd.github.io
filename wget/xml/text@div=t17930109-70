               <p>I am a coachman when in place, at present I am a waterman; the prisoner and the prosecutor that night was at the Queen's Head in Bishopsgate-street; I drawed the beer that night for my master, he being without a servant. I turned my back to the table and I heard the money rattle, I judge the prisoner might be doing naughty tricks, I turned round and takes hold of the prisoner's hand, and found ten shillings and nine pence in his hand; the man said he lost thirteen and six-pence.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any body near Allvin? - Yes, there were about four in the box.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the other persons as near as the prisoner? - Yes, I think they were to the best of my knowledge, but I catched the money in his hand, and I surmized him being a man of a bad character; I did not see his hand in his pocket; the money in his hand was eight shillings and a half crown piece, and three pennyworth of halfpence; I think that is the man to the best of my knowledge; the officers has the money; I stopped the money and took the money from him; I thought it had come from the prosecutor; on account of his being a person of a suspicious character, I laid hold of his hand, he had no knife, nor was any about him on the ground.</p>

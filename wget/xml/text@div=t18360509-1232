                  </hi>. I am a widow, living in Union-street, Middlesex Hospital. On the 16th of April, I missed two washing-tuds, from the wash-house, about seven o'clock in the evening.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Robert Taylor—I lodge in the house with Mrs. Stollard. On Saturday, April the 16th I saw the prisoner stand<lb></lb>ing against our door, with another woman—in a few minutes they went into our house, and came out—each of them had a tub—I went down into the wash-house, and missed the tubs—I went, and overtook the prisoner, with the little tub, which she was putting down between two candle-boxed—I said, "You have taken these from our house"—she said, "No"—I saw a woman with a larger tub—I took up the and ran after her, but she was gone—the prisoner got away then, but was taken about ten o'clock at night, when I went to get my beer for supper, I saw her in the public-house—I am sure she is the woman.</p>

                  </hi>. She had not got further than across this court—it seemed to em as if she was going to put down the tub between the candle boxes and to look if they had got away without being noticed—I was looking out of the two-pair of stairs window, and saw her go into the house and come out again with the little tub under her cloak—the other tub was four times as big as this—the prisoner crossed over York-street—the other wo<lb></lb>man was gone.</p>

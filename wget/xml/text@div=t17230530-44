That he, John Mitchel, rather than the Boy should lie in Newgate, and he convicted of a Felony, and transported, did with much Difficulty get three Guineas, and would have given his Note for the fourth Guinea: But this not being accepted, his Friend lent him a Guinea, and then offer'd the four Guineas to Mr. Smith, but Spurrel said he must not take them. Then they offer'd it to Spurrel, but he refus'd it, and told them, They should lay the Money down in a Room, which he did, and then going into the Kitchen, Spurrel call'd Smith out, and he went into the Room, and took the Money, as he suppos'd, for Smith said to them, Now I am ready; if you will I'll go along with you to get the Boy out. That they would have had him give a Note not to prosecute Thomas Smith; but the Prisoner said there was no Occasion for it, he was now satisfied: And Spurrel said any Bail would do. It appear'd plain to the Jury, by this and other Evidence, That the Prisoner did actually take the four Guineas to stifle the Prosecution of Thomas Smith. And two Women,

               <p>Q. Did you lose a gown from your house at any time - A. Yes; out of our garden. My daughter washed. three and hung them out on a paing in the garden. The prisoner lived at the lower part of the house with his mother, they had lived there about nine years. I saw my gowns in the garden at four o'clock on the 24th of March; my daughter called me before six, and asked me if I had taken in the best gown; I told her I had not; I found it was gone. My daughter brought the sleeves to me, and I went to Mr. Pearson's the pawnbroker about six o'clock, he denied that he had got the gown.</p>

            On the Monday following I saw it at Mr. Pearson's. The boy owned to it on the Saturday night; my husband had information that the boy had some money; I suspected the boy's mother had taken it. The boy went with me to Mr. Pearson's; Mr. Pearson did not bring the gown forward till the Monday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the boy say, in the hearing of Pearson, that he pledged the gown there - A Yes; they said, the gowns laid all in a heap, they could not think of looking for it at that time. The boy pawned it in the name of Matthews, and destroyed the duplicate.</p>

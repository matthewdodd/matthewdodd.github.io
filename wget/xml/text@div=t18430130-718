I was formerly in business as a farrier and veterinary surgeon—I have known the prisoner for four or five years—he was in business as a leather japanner when I knew him—he became bankrupt in February 1841, or early in that year—previous to that I had advanced money from time to time to him to the amount of upwards of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—as a security I had a bill of sale from the Sheriff, and a lease of the pre<lb></lb>mises—the prisoner was living at Pentonville prior to his bankruptcy—I had a man in possession—the messenger was withdrawn, and there was no further dispute as to his possession—the prisoner was notable to obtain his certificate, and I lent him 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to get it—the business was not carried on for a period of seven or eight months, and I kept the man in possession all the time—in Au<lb></lb>gust, 1841, an agreement was entered into between me and the prisoner—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—it has his signature and mine to it—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>) "Memorandum of agreement made this 19th day of Aug., 1841, between William Weedon, of Hertford-place, Kennington, gentleman, on the one part; and George Jenns, of Cumming-street, Pentonville, on the other part, as follows; that is to say, the said William Weedon having arranged to carry on the business of a patent leather japanner, as formerly carried on by the said George Jenns, he, the said George Jenns, doth hereby agree with the said William Weedon to superin<lb></lb>tend and manage the said business for the said William Weedon, and to employ his time therein, and to use his best endeavours to promote the same, at or for the salary or sum of 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week, to be payable weekly; and the said William Weedon hereby agrees to pay the said weekly sum. And it is lastly agreed that this agreement may be put an end to by either of the parties giving to the other one month's notice in writing. Dated this 19th of August, 1841."—the bu<lb></lb>siness was at Hoxton Old-town—Rudge, my son-in-law, was a clerk in this business—I did not know anything of the business—what led to the agree<lb></lb>ment was, Mr. Jenns said 1 had nothing to do, if I would carry on the busi<lb></lb>ness he thought it would be an excellent opportunity for Mr. Rudge to have</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was that account taken on this footing, that you looked through the books, and saw what had been taken out of the concern by him, and what by you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, just so—it appeared that in the course of the year I had re<lb></lb>ceived 61<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he had received 136<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—that was the total amount of cash that he had had from time to time—we first charge him with the total cash he had in the year, and next with sundries, 56<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—these were not articles that had been sent in by Mr. Weedon; for instance, a wash-house was built, and there were ropes, and poles, and fanlights, and other things for the wash-house, for Mr. Jenns's convenience, Mr. Weedon charges him with that, and for the rent, hire of furniture, firing, &amp;c., 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that is all the items on the debtor side—on the other side is put what I took out, 61<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and 172<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. by promissory note on demand—in settling this account I was actiug as the agent of Mr. Weedon—the account was settled between Mr. Weedon and Mr. Jenns, and Mr. Weedon then received a promissory note for 172<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the effect of that would not be to put me on equal terms, in point of cash, with the prisoner; but that bill, if paid, would make Mr. Weedon and Mr. Jenns on equal terms—having that balance secured by the bill—we then balanced the account from Aug. 1841 to 1842—the account showed a deficiency of 253<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; and Mr. Jenns's acceptance was given for one half that loss, which the concern showed.</p>

               <p>conversation taking place as to one person drawing out more than another?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not after the certificate—it was on the settlement of this account—it was then agreed, that, for the future, neither Mr. Weedon nor Mr. Jenns should draw out more than the same sum each, from the business—that was in conse<lb></lb>quence of its being found that Mr. Jenns had drawn out so much more than I had, that it would not pay, and it was requested he would take out less—Mr. Jenns took out the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week, and I had, for some time, 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and shortly after 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—since that settlement I and Mr. Jenns have been charged the same amount—since the 24th Sept. we have been charged alike in the cash-book—I have only received 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but it has been entered in the cash-book 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you remember, in Dec. last, some terms of arrangement being pro<lb></lb>posed by you on the part of Mr. Jenns to Mr. Weedon? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, by the re<lb></lb>quest of Mr. Weedon—I do not remember Mr. Weedon saying anything about taking away the books on that occasion—I have heard him say he would take away the books—I have not heard him say he would get in all the monies, take the books, and Mr. Jenns might do as he liked—he had it in contempla<lb></lb>tion to take the books away—I have not heard him say, he charged Mr. Jenns with felony to frighten him into a settlement—I have heard something of the sort said, in Mr. Weedon's presence, by Mr. Hobler, the attorney for the pro<lb></lb>secution—he certainly said, that by putting him into prison he would then come to terms—he did not at the same time tell him that Mr. Jenns was his partner, and there was no pretence for calling this embezzlement—I cannot say that Mr. Weedon said nothing of that sort—Mr. Hobler said, by putting him in gaol he should bring him to some terms—this was at Mr. Hobler's office, a week or ten days previous to the prisoner's being taken up—Mr. Hobler is not my father's regular attorney—he has got half a dozen—there is a Mr. Dixon who advises him—I think Mr. Dixon was nor present at this conversa<lb></lb>tion—I had been present before, when this was the subject of conversation—I certainly have heard Mr. Dixon tell my father-in-law that Mr. Jenns, on his own statement, was a partner.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. DOANE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You said there was some sundries, which were for a wash-house for Jenns? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—what we were to take out was on account of our salaries—I and Jenns were to take out equal portions since September last—that was for salaries, of course—in the first instance I paid Jenns 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—I think that was for two or three months, and then another sum—he some<lb></lb>times times drew out 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I had to pay him 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. less—I had authority to pay him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—I never made out any account, either before or subsequent to his obtaining his certificate, in the name of Jenns, but always "Weedon, late Jenns"—if any such account was made out to Jenns, it was not with my knowledge.</p>

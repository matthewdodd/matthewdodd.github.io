                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Dockyard-policeman</hi>, 68). On the morning of 29th September I was on duty in Deptford Dockyard—I saw the prisoner at the dockyard-gate—he came to repair a gas-lamp that was hanging on the bar<lb></lb>rack-fence—he went across the dockyard into the barracks, and then out into the street again—I followed him, and he went to Czar-street in the direction of a marine-store dealer's shop—I asked him what he had been doing—he said he had been to get half a pint of beer—I followed him, but I lost sight of him, and then met him—I went to Frank's, the marine-store dealer's, and the woman there gave me these three pieces of lead (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I also produce a ladle which I found in the dockyard—the lead fits it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live with my father Thomas Franks, a marine-store dealer, at Czar-street, Deptford—on Tuesday, 29th September, the prisoner, whom I knew by sight, came into our shop—I was in the inner room, and went out to him—he had got these three pieces of lead in the scale—it was between 10 and 11; I cannot say the exact time—they weighed 12lbs.—I gave him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it—he had never been in our shop before.</p>

               <p>minutes, I should say; it might be two or three minutes that he was in the shop—I said before that I was certain this was the man—I say now that he is the man who came there—my father serves in the shop when he is at home—my mother was at home and another sister—they could have seen the man if they had looked into the shop—they are not here—I should take this to be old lead—we ask people if things are their own property, and they say, "Yes"—I supposed this man to be respectable—I had seen him about—the policeman came in not more than a minute afterwards—he asked me if the man came in, and I said, "Yes"—he said, "What did he bring?" and I said, "Some lead," and I gave it him—he did not ask me who the man was—I asked him if he was going to take the lead away—he said, "Yes," he must take it to the dockyard—he came and fetched me some time afterwards, and I saw the man in the dockyard, standing in a little room there—the Inspector was there, and the policeman asked me whether that was the man—I said, "Yes"—the policeman did not say anything to me about taking the lead—he did not ask me what inquiries I had made—the Inspector asked me if I knew the man, and I said I did from seeing him about—he did not find fault with me for taking the lead, I am quite sure of that.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at King-street, Deptford, and have been em<lb></lb>ployed in the dockyard as a labourer—on Saturday week, 20th September, I was working with the prisoner—he ordered me to melt some lead down, because he had broken it up, and we wanted some solder to repair the roof of the vinegar stores—I melted it and threw it under a bench—on the morning he was accused of stealing the lead, I went with the Inspector to look for it—I did, not find it there—it was something like this pro<lb></lb>duced—it was melted in a ladle of this kind, and about this size.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What sort of lead was it, large or a small pieces? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Both small and large—I dare say some of the pieces were two feet long, and about six inches wide—they were strips from old roofs, and some pieces of old lead pipe—I threw three pieces under the bench, and a large piece I emptied out of the pot—I don't know how much it weighed—I believe the prisoner has been employed there some time; he is a master plumber—Mr. Smith employs me under him; he is a contractor—I don't know whether it was Mr. Smith's lead—it was old lead.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in St. John's-road, Deptford, and am foreman of the works in Deptford Dockyard—the prisoner was employed there as a plumber for George Smith and Co. of Pimlico, who are contractors for ordinary repairs at the dockyard—the lead at the dockyard is the pro<lb></lb>perty of the Crown—it would be the prisoner's duty to melt up old lead for certain uses; for those special works—such as making lead-headed nails, and such things required with our lead—the only purpose for his melting the old lead on Saturday, 26th September, would be to clear it out of the metal-pot, and use the lead-pot—the lead was not wanted to use at that time—he had no right to take any lead in the dockyard.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> The prisoner has been employed there four years, I think? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He has been employed occasionally from 1857, but from 1859, continually—he is working under Mr. Smith—he is a plumber.</p>

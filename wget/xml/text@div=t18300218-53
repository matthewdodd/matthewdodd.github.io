This property was taken from his stable on the 19th of January; I had locked the stable the night before, and all was secure; I went at seven o'clock the next morning, and found the door broken open - the lock laid inside, and the property was all gone; I suppose the amount of the loss was 20l. -I know nothing of the prisoner; the harness was all taken at once, and it would require two men to take it.</p>
               <p>LEWIS BEACHEM. My father is a saddler, in Whitechapel-road. The prisoner brought some harness to his shop on Thursday morning, the 21st of January; he offered it for sale - he said he had brought some odds and ends, and wanted 1l. for it; I saw the crest on the blinkers and sent for the officer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. What did he bring? A. A pair of hames and some other parts of two harnesses; my father asked where he got it, and he said he received it of a man named Wells.</p>
               <p>RICHARD BURGESS. I am an officer. I took him into custody - this is the harness.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183002180031"></xptr>HENRY PARNELL. I was in a public-house, and saw Wells and Taylor come in with some harness - they were talking about it; Taylor brought the bag into the tap-room and threw it into the first box.</p>
               <p>Witnesses for the Defence.</p>
               <p>MRS. JOHNSON. The prisoner lodged at my house, and he was not out one night, I can safely say.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What night do you speak of? A. He slept at my house on the Wednesday night before he was taken - I have only two persons in the house; I see them to bed every night, and shut the door - the prisoner was not one night out; ten o'clock is about my latest hour for going to bed.</p>

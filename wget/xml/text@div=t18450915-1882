                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Hillear, a carpenter—we live in Water-street, Blackfriars—I know the prisoner—on the 25th of August I employed him to take to Mr. Pontifex's, in Shoe-lane, a washing copper, a copper-bowl, and a piece of pipe—I paid him 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it—I walked there with him, and saw Mr. Jowett there—I left the articles to be exchanged for a new copper, and I was to pay the difference—Mr. Jowett took the copper, and wrote my name and address upon it—he said the new copper would be 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he could let me have it in a week—it was on Tuesday I left it, and on that day week the prisoner called and said, "I beg your pardon, your copper is not done."—I said, "How do you know?"—he said "I have been there"—on the Saturday afterwards I went to Mr. Pontifex, and learned that my copper was gone.</p>

They are coppersmiths in Shoe-lane—a man came there with a message—he said Mrs. Hillear desired him to call, to know if the copper ordered was ready, and if it was not done, he was to take the old copper away, and get one somewhere else—he described the three articles, and describing all the circumstances as he did, I, on that representation, gave him the old</p>

                  </hi>, I am a widow, and keep the Bull's Head public-house, Walbrook. The prisoner has been my pot-boy for about eighteen months—he was entrusted to take out beer and receive the pay for me—it was paid weekly. On Sunday, the 2nd January, he went out—he ought to have returned the same evening, or early on Monday morning—he did not come back till the Wednesday, when I had him apprehended—he was brought into my presence by a policeman, about nine o'clock in the evening—I told him he had been away before, and I could not overlook his receiv<lb></lb>ing my money and spending it—he said he was very sorry, but if I would let him come back he would try to make every thing right, but as he had done it before I told him I could not overlook it.</p>

On the 20th of July he received two puncheons and an oil hogshead of tallow from Mr. Knight—it was town tallow—I saw it safe on the premises at eight o'clock on the evening of the 20th when I left the premises—on the following morning I found the cask had been cut into, and from 4 to 4 1/2 cwt. gone, the space of the 4 1/2 cwt., was filled up with rubbish, and some tallow melted and put over it—I missed a 2 cwt. and a 3 cwt. cask—one of them was iron bound and chalked—they were oil casks—the prisoner Baker had been in Mr. Wyatt's employ—I know Samuel Tite—he has sold oil and gully to Mr. Wyatt at different times, and has been on the premises for that purpose—we lost a key of the factory three or four months ago—Baker was in our employ at that time.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a beer-shop in Bacon's-place, Old Gra<lb></lb>vel-lane. I know Tippitt—he came to my house on Monday evening, the 20th of July, about eight o'clock—I saw nobody in his company—he had one pot of ale, which he paid 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for—I did not see any one in his company in particular—the following morning, at ten minutes before seven o'clock, he came to me, and said, had the party been there that morning that was with him the overnight?—I said, "I do not know what party was with you over night"—he said, "I was to meet the party at six o'clock this morn<lb></lb>ing"—I said, "The party could not be here, as I have just now opened my shop"—I did not get up till a quarter to seven o'clock—he said he had overlaid himself—he had half-a-pint of ale, and went away—he had a white smock-frock on, which came down to his loins, and a light dress.</p>

On the night of the 20th of July I saw Samuel Tite and Baker there with others, who I did not notice—it was about half-past seven o'clock when I first saw them—they went out during the even<lb></lb>ing, and came in again—while they were there I supplied them with beer and bread and cheese, and I was asked for a newspaper—I gave it to some<lb></lb>body to give them, and the observation was made after they had got it, "we only want to look at the price of tallow"—I cannot say who made that ob<lb></lb>servation, as I was in my bar—I cannot say that I saw either of the pri<lb></lb>soners with the newspaper—there were other persons in the room besides them.</p>

On the 21st of July, in conse<lb></lb>quence of information, I went to a coffee-shop in Rosemary-lane, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, and found all the prisoners there taking coffee—I did not observe any one else there—I asked the two Tites if their name was Tite—they said it was—I then asked Tippitt if he was a soap-boiler—he said he was—I turned round to Baker, and asked him if his name was Brown or Baker—he said it was Baker—I then told them I wanted them on suspicion of stealing some fat from Johnson-street—the two Tite's and Tippitt said, "I know nothing about it"—Baker turned round, and said, "I know nothing of the other three prisoners, I have merely just stepped in to have a cup of tea"—I took them to the station-house—on Samuel Tite I found 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., on Walter 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and on Tippitt 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he said it was all he had, but his hand was closed, and on opening it I found 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. more—I searched them more minutely after<lb></lb>wards, and Walter Tite gave me 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and on Baker I found 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. twisted up in his fob pocket.</p>

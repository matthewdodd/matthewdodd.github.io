               <p>On the 8th of April, about three in the afternoon, I had been for a pint of beer, coming home, I saw two young men pass me, which I had a suspicion of; I went after them, and when I came to the bottom of the Court, there was only one, I came up the court again, and I saw one of them coming down the court again, I saw the prisoner Hooker going into Mrs. Clark's, and bring out the sheets, I was at a one pair of stairs window watching them; I pursued the prisoner and overtook him in Fleet-street, he had the sheets, and gave them to the other prisoner Wright who was in Fleet-street.</p>
               <p>Was Wright the same person you saw with him before? - I cannot say, when he gave the sheets to Wright, I was about a yard and half off; the instant he gave the sheets to Wright, I seized Wright on the shoulder, and he threw the sheets into my arm, he had not time to do anything with them.</p>
               <p>What did Wright say? - He said, he picked them up, he knew nothing of the matter, he was quite innocent of it; he said, he did not know the other young man.</p>
               <p>Did he throw the sheets to him, or convey them to him with an intention to conceal them? - I was at his heel at the time, he did not conceal them.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether Hooker saw you before he gave the things to Wright? - I do not think he did, when I seized Wright, Hooker stepped into the middle of the street.</p>

               <p>On Friday the 8th of April, one of the prisoners at the bar went through our passage, which is the Three Tuns; he seemed to have a bundle, Stapleton was after him; I followed him, and I believe Stapleton<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178505110073"></xptr> called stop thief! I saw Mr. Stapleton take the bundle from Wright and I pursued Hooker and took him.</p>
               <p>Did Stapleton cry stop thief! before the bundle was handed to Wright or after? - I think it was before.</p>

               <p>Somebody shoved the bundle at me, which knocked me up against the wall, there was a bundle, I stopped to examine it, and to my surprise there was a cry of stop thief; to prevent trouble I was proceeding on, and two men came and laid hold of me, and I went with them, the prisoner Hooker never saw me before; please to observe, my Lord, there is a reward offered in that parish of ten pounds.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a partner in the firm of Edward Abraham Isaacs, and Co., Birmingham and Sheffield manufacturers, carrying on business in Houndsditch—my brother and myself are the partners—I have known the prisoner as a furnishing ironmonger—he commenced dealing with us some time at the latter end of last year; first on the terms of one month's credit—he afterwards requested that credit to be extended, to which we agreed; he was to have a quarterly account—he commenced dealing with us on quarterly credit in Jan. of the present year—he had goods from us in Jan. amounting to 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; and on 17th of the same month he had more goods, amounting to 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; on 9th Feb. he had another parcel, which only came to 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; on 3rd April he had a parcel amounting to 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—they were cutlery and goods usually purchased by furnishing ironmongers—on 4th April he had a parcel amounting to 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that was the last parcel we supplied him with—his account altogether in April was 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CAARTEN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Who made the entries in the books? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did—before I allowed the prisoner to have the latter goods, I had some conversa<lb></lb>tion with him—on 30th March, having previously been furnished with a statement of what he owed us—I waited on him for his account, he having been written to—he said, "Mr. Isaacs, I presume you have called about your account?" said, "Yes, I have"—he said, "I have this morning settled an account with Messrs. Hyson, and Co., of West Bromwich, and I shall therefore be unable to pay you; I require, however, a few more goods, which I will call and select at your warehouse, and you can then draw upon meat one month's date for the whole amount of the account"—at that same time he showed me an invoice of Messrs. Hyson's, and said he had just settled that account—I believe that was all that passed as to Messrs. Hyson—he called on 2nd April, and selected goods to the amount of 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a partner in the firm of Meeting, and Co; we are tin manufacturers, at No. 30, Redcross-street, City. On 20th March I saw the prisoner—he had been to our place, and left a message, in conse<lb></lb>quence of which I went to him, and saw him about 3 o'clock in the afternoon</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185406120046"></xptr>
               <p>—he said he wished to give me an order—it was a general order for tin goods; no particular amount was named—I said it was general for us to receive cash in the first transaction—he said he was doing business with a gentleman of the name of Andrews, who we knew, and showed me a ledger—he opened it, and said, "Here is my account with Mr. Andrews"—he said he had paid Mr. Andrews his account; I cannot swear that he men<lb></lb>tioned the amount of it; it was in the ledger—I was perfectly satisfied with that, and on 23rd March I delivered him a parcel of tin goods, among which were two toilet cans, two toilet baths, two jack-screens, thirty-six kettles, and six candle-boxes—they were to be paid for in one month—no bill was given; he never paid for them—the day before the credit expired, I called at his house, and found it shut up.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you let him have the goods in consequence of this con<lb></lb>versation about Mr. Andrews? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Decidedly I did—I saw Mr. Andrews in the mean time, before I let the prisoner have the goods, and he said he believed him to be a respectable man—I did not let him have the goods so much in consequence of what Mr. Andrews said, but I believed the ledger—when I saw Mr. Andrews he confirmed it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CARRTEN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ask Mr. Andrews how the account stood between him and the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I did not—I should have let him have the goods without speaking to Mr. Andrews, in consequence of the appearance of his ledger—I cannot say why I spoke to Mr. Andrews before I let him have the goods.</p>

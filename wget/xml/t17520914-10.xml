            . About a quarter before ten, on the 20th of August, coming down Snow Hill, I heard a cry of stop thief, and saw the prisoner come running down. I stepped cross the road, and took him by the collar; he attempted to get from me; but when he could not, he said he was runing after him. The handkerchief was found as soon as I had hold on him half a minute, about two or three yards from us. There were three or four people came up to me before I saw it taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. to the prosecutor. Was any body near at the time you felt something at your pocket?</p>

            . Coming up Snow Hill at this time, I ran at the cry of Stop thief. Mr. Woodcock had hold of the man. I saw a handkerchief lie on the ground, at the place where he was taken, or within three yards. There were not above three or four people come up then. I took it up, and Mr. Carous owned it.</p>

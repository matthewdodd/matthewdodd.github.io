                  </hi>. I am a turner. I have known the prisoner five or six years—he is a plasterer, bricklayer, and carpenter; a handy sort of man, and got his living in that way—he has worked for me—he did three weeks' work for me about five weeks ago—he finished it on the 17th of Novem<lb></lb>ber—the deceased died on the 29th of December—the prisoner had about five days and three quarters' work from me between those times—he had two children, one girl and one boy, (the deceased,) who was between six and seven years old—his wife has been dead about two years—he had a guinea a week when he worked for me—he would have the means of sup<lb></lb>porting his family, when in employment—I believe he sometimes got more from other people—during part of the time he worked for me, he lived in Robert-street, or Ann-street—he never rented the place in Counter alley—he merely lived there on sufferance—on the 28th of December, the day before his child died, I went there with the policeman—the door was open, and we walked into the room, on the ground-floor—the girl and boy were both lying in one corner of the room on some shavings—the policeman asked the boy whether he had had any victuals that day—he said "Yes," he had had some bread—he did not say who had given it to him—there was nothing in the room but a few empty baskets—no kind of furniture at all, nor any fire—I asked the child where his father was, he said be did not know—in consequence of what I saw, I immediately went to the beadle</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183902040252"></xptr>
               <p>—he was not at home—I left my card, requesting he would attend to the case early in the morning—the beadle did not come down next morning, and in the after part of the day I sent my boy, who brought word that the child was dead—I went again to the beadle, who was not at home, and left word that the child was dead—the child had had the hooping<lb></lb>cough—it coughed while I was there—and I understand he had the measles, but I do not know—I have known the prisoner six or seven years—he might have done better for his children, if disposed—there was neglect, I think—I always found him very willing to work when I sent for him—I know he could not always find employment, because he applied to me for work.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's daughter, and am thir<lb></lb>teen years old. I think my brother was between six and seven years—I do not know the day of the month he died—he had been ill about three weeks or a month before he died—he complained of his head being bad—he had the measles, I believe, and he used to cough—I never heard him hoop—he had had a cough a good while before he died—he died in Counter-alley—I remember Mr. Boulter coming there the day before he died—we had nothing but a few shavings there, no bed or bed-clothes—we had something to eat that day and the day before—my father gave us all he could—he was not in employment at the time my brother died—when my father had food he gave it to us as well as took it himself—I never knew him take food himself and not give us any—he did not go and ask for medical assistance when my brother was ill—I had had some bread to eat the day Mr. Boulter came, and my brother too—my father had not long been gone out when Mr. Boulter came—he was gone to see and get us some victuals—he slept in the same room with us, on the shavings—he al<lb></lb>ways gave us part of what he had—he was pretty kind to us—we had been living there about a month, I believe—my brother had a very bad cough—he coughed at night—my father would sometimes spend his money some<lb></lb>where else—he used to get us in some victuals first, and then he used to go out, leaving me and my brother in the house by ourselves—he sometimes came home drunk, not very often, and not when we were without food—we have not been a day, I think, without something or other—we sometimes got bread and dripping, and sometimes bread and potatoes—sometimes we had bread given to us—sometimes people gave us victuals, and sometimes they would not—my brother had a coat given to him, and a pair of trowsers my father gave him, and a shirt my father bought him—I know Mrs. Bant<lb></lb>lin—my father slept at her place once on the floor—my brother was well then—it was before he was taken bad, not long before—we had only some old pieces of baize and carpets over us—my brother had no doctor—he was very bad for about three weeks or a month, and about a day or two before he died he could not stand up on his legs—he died on Saturday—the</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Bantlin, a traveller. I have known the prisoner ten years—we rent an apartment in the house, in Counter-alley, Newington—we moved there on the 19th of November, and the prisoner came to help us move—he then lived in Ann-street—the prisoner asked me, as it was so late that sight, to let him stop there, and he made shift on the floor—the children were afterwards brought there, while I was away, not to the same house as me, but the next house—I believe he gave his children part of what he had himself, as far as laid in his power—I believe he was out of work about the time of the child's death—I do not think he neglected them through getting liquor, but one and another person, who knew him in his trade, I believe, gave him liquor—I do not think it was at his own expense—I do not think, while he was there, he had sufficient to support the children—I have seen him give them food—they never complained to me that he neglected them—I understand that the children's mother, on her death-bed, requested he would not put them in the workhouse—I saw the child the evening before he died, and he looked very bad—(I went in with Mr. Boulter's boy)—I had not seen him for two or three days before—he used to come up, and sit by my fire-side, when the father had not power to get a fire—he had not the hooping-cough, but he had a consumptive cough, and he had the measles—I think he caught cold, for the girl brought him out the day after he had the measles out on him, and I think they struck in—as far as I saw, the prisoner brought them bread and meat, or whatever he could get, and gave them the same as himself—I never saw any neglect—he was particularly kind to the boy—I believe he was out of employ a fortnight or three weeks before the boy's death—I know he had nothing to do in the Christmas week, for my husband made him come and dine with us, and the child also—I advised him to get an order for the parish doctor, who would give him a note to go to the Board for relief—I cannot recollect exactly what he said at that moment, but he said at times that all the doctors in the world could not save him, for he had had a complaint from his infancy—the child had had the small-pox about four months before—I am not at all aware of any in<lb></lb>tentional neglect.</p>

               <p>of December, the day after the boy's death—I found every thing in as bad a state as possible—I went immediately on the commencement of the morn<lb></lb>ing service—I found the prisoner there, lying in one corner of the room, on some wood shavings—there was no furniture whatever in the room—there was some fire—the prisoner appeared in a state of stupor—I could make nothing of him at first—I found the child dead, lying on a log of wood, in an opposite corner of the room, covered over with a sort of rug—the girl Was sitting by the fire—there was nothing whatever in the house in the shape of food—I asked the girl, "Have you had any thing to eat to-day?"—she said at first, "No"—whether she understood me I do not know—I said, "You are sure you have had nothing to eat to-day?" and the prisoner answered, "No"—the girl said, "I have had a little bread"—I asked her who supplied what she had—she said, "Mr. Boulter, it was part of what was left the night before"—I asked the prisoner if he was hungry—he said, "Yes"—I fetched them some bread and bacon—they did not eat it in the way I have seen poor people eat sometimes—they cooked it first—when I found he had filled his belly, I said, "I am a constable, and it is necessary you should give me some information respecting the death of this child, or I must take you into custody—there is a report that this child has been very much neglected"—(for, while they were preparing their refreshment, I had been out to make inquiry in the neighbourhood)—he said, "We have been short"—I asked what was the cause of it—he said he had not employ<lb></lb>ment, and no means of getting it for them—I said, "Have you made any ap<lb></lb>plication for parochial assistance in your extremities, or medical advice for the child?"—he said no, he had not, in that instance, and the reason he gave was, because he had before that time been passed on to his parish, which was Nessing, in Essex, which he had left, thinking he could do better by coming to town; and I think the girl said, they left because they had not victuals enough there—I do not think the prisoner made that observation—I asked him if he had neglected the children in consequence of cohabit<lb></lb>ing with some woman—he said, the children and himself had certainly been very short, but he could certainly acquit himself of any thing like neglect—he said nothing about the woman—he made the same observation afterwards, on the way to the station-house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. I did not see the child before death—I saw it on Sunday, the 30th of December, but did not open the body till the following day—it appeared very much emaciated—I could see nothing to account for death—there was no appearance of exter<lb></lb>nal marks—on opening the body I found a disease of the lungs, adhesion of the pleura, and a large abscess, which had broken—it died from con<lb></lb>sumption, which must have been going on for some time—supposing it to have had small-pox, then measles and hooping-cough, that might produce consumption, but not necessarily so—all the viscera of the stomach was in a state of health—the stomach was quite empty, but it appeared that during the night the child had a very severe diarrhcea—I have no means of judg<lb></lb>ing whether disease was produced by want of food—even supposing there had been neglect, it was impossible to ascertain it decidedly in that state—I cannot say the child died from neglect of being supplied with food—whe<lb></lb>ther the emaciation was the result of consumption or want of food I cannot state—there is hectic fever with consumption—that would produce very great emaciation—there is no distinction between emaciation produced by disease and shortness of food.</p>

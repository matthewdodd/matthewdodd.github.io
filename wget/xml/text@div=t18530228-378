                  </hi>. I am a brewer, and carry on business at the Scottish Brewery, in Old-street. I had instituted proceedings in the County Court against the prisoner for beer and ale—I should guess the amount was under 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., about 28<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I got judgment against him—on my getting that, the prisoner came to my brewery and said if I would not carry out the judgment against him he was willing to give me possession of his empty house, but not the furniture, as there was somebody in possession of every thing under a bill of sale—and said he had been to Mr. Burnell, his landlord, who recommended him to come to me—I accompanied him to Mr. Burnell's, who was agreeable that that arrangement should take place—Mr. Burnell drew up a document at my request—I put it in my pocket—I have been given to understand that it is now burnt—I did not see any document put in the fire—I saw the prisoner sign the document—it was read over to him—the contents</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185302280046"></xptr>
               <p>of it were, "In consequence of your not pressing the judgment got by you against me, I hereby agree to give you possession of my beerhouse"—I went with the prisoner to the beerhouse—it is called the Market-house—he there gave roe formal possession—I found a person there having a bill of sale on behalf of Mr. Chandler—I asked the prisoner for the key of the door and it could not be found—then it turned out there was another door, and the key of that could not be found—I asked him to give me formal possession; to repeat the words after me, that he gave me formal possession according to the agreement—I went to call on some customers, and left the prisoner in the house, and the man in possession—when I returned I saw the prisoner and he asked me to let him look at the document he had signed—I think I said to him that he had no occasion, as he had heard it read before signing it—he said, "Nevertheless you will oblige me by allowing me to have it"—he said, he wanted to read it himself—I handed it to him; he began to read it, but he had not proceeded far when he folded it tip and attempted to put it in his pocket—he was in the act of doing it when I, exclaimed," Denning, that is very unfair,"—I said, "you must return it, "and I then attempted to struggle with him to get bold of it—he said very little; I do not remember that he said anything, he was very quiet—but I found he was stronger that I was, and it appeared to me that be passed a paper; I cannot swear that it was the paper—he handed it over his shoulder, and it appeared to me he gave it to another party; this was while I was struggling with him—he was holding it up to keep it out of my reach—after the paper appeared to put, he said, "It is no use your struggling, it is gone"—in a few minutes I heard a female voice cry," It is burnt; the paper is burnt. "</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How many persons were in the room when he asked you to let him look at it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The party who held the bill of sale was one, and I dare say there might be two beside—that was in the bar of the beershop—we went afterwards to a room beyond; it was there the struggle took place—then was Denning there, and I think be called another person to come—I think he called some name, but I cannot tell what it was</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I am anxious to have this very little that was said by the prisoner when he got hold of the paper and was reading it, and you said he must give it you back—what was it he said? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> What I meant to express by that was he said little or nothing—most decidedly he did not say, "I did not know that I had signed such a paper, I must show it to some one else"—I have a clerk named Bishop—he is not here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Some time prior to this, had not Mr. Bishop stated that he bad had a communication with the prisoner touching the disposal of his business to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, on the morning before this document was signed; it was consequent on that that it was signed—Mr. Bishop did not tell me that inasmuch as there was a bill of sale in the house and a judgment, he would sell his business to me for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. provided I would pay the bill of sale out; nothing of the kind—I had obtained judgment I think for about 28<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Am I to understand that the prisoner had agreed to make over to you his interest in the establishment merely in consequence of your discharging the judgment against him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The empty house he had—he had already given the power over everything in the house under a bill of sale—I certainly had not undertaken to pay out that bill of sale—there was no agreement about the fixtures; I was to have nothing but the empty house—I could not have it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is the meaning of this in the memorandum:" In consideration of your not enforcing the judgment against me, I agree to deliver up to you the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185302280047"></xptr>
               <p>possession of the beerhouse called the Market-house, and all the fixtures and other articles there in belonging to me." <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not hold myself responsible for the phraseology employed there; I left it to Mr. Burnell—I had a conversation with the prisoner in my brewery before I went to Mr. Burnell.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you got to Mr. Burnell, did you ask the prisoner to remain down stairs and mind the horse and gig, while you went up to your solicitor. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did for a short time—I went up, leaving him with the horse and gig, but it was not in the first instance—it was in the latter instance—my direction to prepare the draft was an afterthought that I had in coming away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you go up to Mr. Burnell, and leave the prisoner with the horse and gig. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did afterwards, that is true—when I drove him there we went up together, and transacted the business verbally in the first instance; we, then went down with the intention of going away—it was an afterthought of mine to go and tell him to draw the agreement.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You left the prisoner down stairs with the horse and gig, and while you were up stairs Mr. Burnell wrote this agreement in Mr. Denning's absence? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; he was not down stairs with the horse and gig at that time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. I thought you said you left him down stairs with the horse and gig? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You went down stairs to Mr. Denning. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I went down stairs and requested him to go up stairs, because it would be as well to make a written agreement—it was not drawn up when I went up stairs, I had other avocations to go to while it was drawing—it was being drawn when Mr. Denning and I went up stairs—I had given directions about it before—I did not see Mr. Burnell give him any copy of it—I had not signed it—after this transaction I put it in my pocket and drove away, and Mr. Denning with me, to the house itself, which is called the Market-house, in Market-street, Stepney—there Mr. Denning took it in his band and began to read it—I think he had not it in his hand more than a minute or two, time enough to read half a dozen lines—he was then folding it up; he had not succeeded in putting it in his pocket—I am not prepared to state that this paper did not drop on the floor in the scuffle between us—I heard some one exclaim, "It is burnt;" I think it was a female voice.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">ROBINSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When was it read over to him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> When it was ready, in Mr. Burnett's own private room—Mr. Burnell read it—there was no objection made by the prisoner to any expression—my impression is, but I will not be sure, that it was read over twice to him—I did not see it fall on the floor—I saw it folded up, and attempted to be put in his pocket, and I said, "Denning, that is unfair;" and I made an effort to recover it, and afterwards he seemed to pass the same paper as it were over his shoulder, and shortly afterwards he exclaimed, "It is gone from me.

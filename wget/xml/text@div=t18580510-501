                  </hi>. I am a traveller in the service of Messrs. Morgan, ware-housemen, of Friday Street. The prisoner was a porter in their service for less than three weeks—it was his duty to carry my parcels only—there were circumstances which induced me to deliver this parcel (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) to the pri<lb></lb>soner, on 20th April, in Leadenhall Street, with directions to go to the ware-house in Friday Street, to carry the goods home—he took it on his shoulder, and went towards Friday Street—I walked behind him—he put his parcel down at Bow church, and looked round him, then got a man to lift it again, and walked to the warehouse—I saw him enter, and followed him in—he went into the travellers' room, which is appropriated to depositing the goods—I waited just sufficient time to go from one door to the other, and then went in, and he had the parcel open before him, with one piece open towards his left hand—the string was undone, and the paper open, showing the goods—the moment he saw me, he took it up in his left hand, and endeavoured to return it to the parcel—I asked him what business he had with my goods open, without my permission—he replied, "You must have left them open, Sir"—I said, "How can that be, when I have just followed you in with them on your shoulder"—I told him to remain there, and when I came back he was making his escape out of the back entrance for goods in Friday Street—Ipursued him, and called "Stop thief," but he escaped—he was apprehended on the Friday night, three days afterwards—he did not return to his work at all.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Aldersgate-street. On Wednesday evening, the 28th of April, I saw two rolls of lead under the Secretary's window—I saw the prisoners go to the lead—Howe took a rule out of his pocket, measured it, and marked it with a knife, they then cut it off, rolled it up into two pieces, and each took a piece and went off towards Goldsmiths'-hall—I am certain they are the men—I saw them the next day about ten o'clock, at the back of the Post-office—Howe had on a blue coat in the morning, but on the Wednesday evening, when he took the lead, he had on a cord jacket—I gave a description of the persons I saw there.</p>

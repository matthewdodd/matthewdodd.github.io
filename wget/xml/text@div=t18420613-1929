                  </hi>. I live in George-yard, Lombard-street, and am a boot-maker. I was in the City-road about half-past eleven o'clock at night, on the 6th of June, walking home—I had been supping with a friend—the prisoner came up and laid hold of my arm, and asked how I did—<hi rend="italic">she</hi> said she was very drunk, and would I see her home—I said, "No," and persuaded her to go home—she still asked me to go with her—I said I had no money, and could not—she then put her arm round my waist, and in fact all over me, and appeared in a druken state—I then found I had lost a half-sovereign out of my waistcoat pocket—she had not hold of me then—I had had my fingers in my waistcoat pocket three minutes before, and felt it safe—I charged her with robbing me—she said "what? let us go and have something to drink"—I still refused, and said, "Here is a policeman coming towards us, if you will not give me back the half-sovereign I will give you in charge"—I was quite sober, and the prisoner appeared more sober then—I gave her in charge—I do not know what became of my half-sovereign.</p>

               <p>minutes in all—I told her I had no money, but that was to get rid of her—I had a sixpence and some halfpence in another pocket—I could not 20 away from her at first, and when she let me go I had lost my half-sovereign—I did not meet any other woman that night.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was on duty—the prosecutor gave the prisoner into my charge for stealing a half-sovereign from his waistcoat pocket—she said she knew nothing of it—she was searched at the station, and no half-sovereign was found—she had been drinking, but was not drunk—the prosecutor was quite sober.</p>

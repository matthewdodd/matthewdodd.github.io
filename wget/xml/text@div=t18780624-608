Tyler, secretary;" that purports to be a list of snares up to 21st November, 1877—the prisoner there appears for 2,225 shares, and Cooper and Bastaple 100 each—on 9th April, 1877, I find a resolution registered with regard to an alteration of title, that the word "deposit" be left out.</p>

I did so—Brown took it—the defendant ultimately handed me back 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and told me to charge the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the books as an advance to Mr. Lee, the solicitor to the bank—I did so—some time alter Mr. Lee came to the bank and looked through the ledger, and he turned to the account in which I had debited the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to him—I went with him into Mr. Pryor's room—he said "I want to know what is the meaning of this 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. charged to my account"—Pryor said "That will be all right, I will make that all right"—Mr. Lee said "It had no business to be entered there at all, it must be put right"—he said he did not know anything about it, it had nothing to do with him, and he could not understand bow it had got there—Pryor said "It shall be put all right"—I said "But how do I stand about it?"—Mr. Lee looked at me and said "On my part I utterly deny and repudiate ever having had 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the Lombard Bank"—I then went out of the room and spoke to the auditor, seeing that it assumed such a serious aspect, and when I came back Mr. Lee had gone—I did not tell Mr. Pryor that I had seen the auditor—he said "This thing must be put right; the best way to do it is to alter it from Lee to Barnard"—I said "I cannot do it"—he then said he would initial it so as to show that money had been given to him, if I would insert "per Barnard," which I did—the entry reads "Re Barnard, per Mr. P., 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," the he initials that—Mr. Lee now stands charged with 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on 5th Jan., 1878, Mr. Pryor brought me a cheque for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., drawn by Barnard in favour of himself, on the National Provincial Bank of England, St James's Street branch—that is credited in the cash-book to Mr. Lee's account as per Barnard—I held that as cash in hand—Pryor said "Keep that as cash till I tell you what to do with it," and I held it till 22nd Jan., and then handed it back to him—I received three cheques drawn by Barnard on the same account, payable to himself, one for 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and two for 125<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each—the 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was met; the first of the 125<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheques was returned dishonoured, paid in again, and was then taken up; and the last was dishonoured, but Mr. Barnard's clerk came on and took it up—they were all eventually taken up—in Sept, 1877, the prisoner instructed me to open an account in the name of James Nash, his brother-in-law—the first credit was a month's salary of his (Pryor's) of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on Sept. 29, 1877; it is headed "James Nash, per J.

I am a solicitor, of 1, Gresham Buildings, Basinghall Street—I became a shareholder, and have been the solicitor to this company three years—I did not borrow 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the bank on 28th November, 1877—I never gave any one authority to take notes from the bank in my name—I believe my attention was called to the subject of an advance to me, and I referred to the ledger—this is the entry at folio 626, "New Account, 1877, Nov. 28, To Advance 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—there is a subse<lb></lb>quent entry, which is <hi rend="italic">bond fide</hi>, on 17th December, for 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on the credit side an entry has since been made of "Jan. 5, 1878; credit, 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—it was before 5th January I saw Pryor with reference to my alleged debt—I asked him to give me an explanation—he did not give one, but</p>

               <p>said something about its being all right—I said it was a frandulent entry—about a week after, I saw the entry "to credit 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I had not supplied any money for that purpose—in November, 1877, I was acting as solicitor for Mr. Pryor in reference to annulling a previous bankruptcy—I attended the Bankruptcy Court on 28th November—an offer of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was made to the trustee of the estate for the annulment of the bankruptcy—the offer was accepted on 30th November—I received 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in notes from Pryor on 28th November—I paid them into my bank on 29th November and drew an equivalent amount by my own cheque, which I afterwards gave to the trustee to annul the bankruptcy—Pryor entered my name on the list of subscribers for ten shares—I said I had no objection—he afterwards told me the numbers.</p>

I acted as solicitor to Pryor at the same time as I acted for the bank—I paid the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. into ownbank till the matter was carried through, when I repaid the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the bank<lb></lb>ruptcy was in 1873—I knew of the advance to Dixon, and that the trustee in bankruptcy had a claim against Pryor's estate in regard to the West Lodge property—the trustee had seized the property as being within the order and disposition of the bankrupt—I aid not attend the directors' meetings till January last, not in Pryor's time—I knew Pryor was in possession of West Lodge—I do not know how he got in, but I believe on behalf of the bank—I knew the bank claimed the property under Pryor's bankruptcy—I did not see Barnard Allen—I may have been present at Cannon Street Hotel when he was re-elected a director, but I do not recollect seeing him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. The bank claimed in respect of the furniture mortgaged to them by Dixon by a bill of sale—there had been two prior bills of sale, and possession was taken by both holders of them—there was also a lease of the house—the property was sold by Messrs. Furber and Price—some portions were bought by the bank, and Pryor was in possession of those, I think, in June, 1877—the bank took possession of the lease—a large portion of the furniture was paid for by the bank—I think it was bought in by Pryor, then the trustee seized the property, the bank also claimed portions, and affidavits were made on both sides—the bankruptcy has not been annulled, it ought to have been—the bank did not instruct me to pay Pryor's debts for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid on Pryor's behalf—he never proposed to me that the bank should pay the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for him—I received my instructions to pay it, from Pryor personally—the directors knew nothing of it till the matter was over—I never authorised Pryor to pledge my credit to the bank for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not know Barnard Allen, I never saw him to my knowledge—in the former bankruptcy there was one large creditor and a few small ones.</p>

In August or September, 1877, I was engaged by you as manager of the bank as a possession man—you subsequently promoted me to the management of the office in Regent Street, about 7th October; I continued there till the office was closed, and then came to the bank, the principal office—in March some of the direc<lb></lb>tors called in Regent Street and told me that a new manager was appointed, and I was to retire—I was discharged—I remained where I was—I went and told you that I had instructions from the directors, and you told me to remain—the directors took up a book and they took away the key of a back door—the chairman said he should fetch a policeman and turn me out, but I heard nothing more—during the time I was there I looked to the bank for money, and I received it front the bank—the cashier gave it me every week—this is the inquiry fee book—there is no entry there of my having received cash from the bank to carry on the business at Regent Street—I never had any—I took it out of what I received, and handed over the balance—on the first day of my entrance you gave me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay expenses, and that was the only money I had from you—you gave it me as manager of the bank—I always went to the bank every week and paid the money in—I kept this book all the time I was there—this is the record of all the fees I received—it amounted to 47<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as near as possible—I am not now acting as manager of the bank—I act as cor<lb></lb>responding clerk—I have a room to myself—I don't know whether I am manager or secretary—I have not been promoted in consequence of your arrest—I hold the same position now as I did when you were there—I can't say that the furniture was removed by you when I left the office—it was there for a considerable time after I left Regent Street—it was shut up, and I left on 7th October—nobody else was appointed to my knowledge—the directors discharged me in the spring, but I maintained my position in spite of them—they had no charge to make against me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. I remained there for several months afterwards—when the office was closed I went to the chief office and I have remained there ever since—the balance was cast every week, and I handed over the money to the prisoner, and he initialled every sum—all the moneys I received from selling shares and from deposits were paid over to the cashier of the bank, all the large amounts—it was money for the petty cash and fees that I handed over to the prisoner, and he pat it in his pocket—what became of it I don't know.</p>

                  </hi>. I was a clerk in the Lombard Bank four days before the entry of 28th Feb.—this is my entry in the cash-book under that date, "Roberts, F., 283<hi rend="italic">l</hi>." as a receipt by me; it is entered on the receive side of the cash, and I see another subsidiary book where in I believe I receive 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I got a Bank of England note for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I have not recorded from whom, I presume I had it from the prisoner—I can't say in what shape I got the remainder to make up the 283<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I see on the opposite side a contra entry, "Paid the Lombard Building Society 224<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which appears to me a part of that entry—it appears to be made up by that cross entry; I can't charge my memory, I believe so—the effect of it is this, that by a cross entry of 224<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and a 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note Roberts's account is credited with 283<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—no receipt was given for the 283<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and no cheque was drawn for the 224<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a director of the Lombard Bank, and also of the Lombard Building Society; since 1874 as to the Building Society, and 1875 the Lombard Bank; I was re-elected at the last general meeting in August or September—I had an interview with one Dixon, from West Lodge, in June last; he saw you first—I received certain instructions, and acted under the bank's instructions—I paid 44<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for what I bought for Dixon, in addition to that which they bought—I saw Dixon afterwards; he came to me and said he was afraid he should be made a bankrupt; I had a transfer of 801<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and a bill of sale for 121<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., making 921<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this is the bill of sale; Dixon executed it to me for 121<hi rend="italic">l</hi>,; the 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was a hire note—I have since seen that hire note in posses<lb></lb>sion of the bank; it was used in conjunction with the bill of sale in certain bankruptcy proceedings—the bank claimed this property; in fact, they claimed all—on 28th November I had 940<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in deposit with the bank—I held no security for that, only a deposit note acknowledging my right to the money I deposited there—I did not withdraw that amount; I deposited it with you for your bankruptcy; they were clearing out my place at West Lodge; I gave the deposit note to you, and you passed it on to the cashier—the conversation about it at the office was, "If Mr. Barnard should require any money, and send for it, send at once to the bank"—the note was left there—I went to the Bankruptcy Court, and in conse<lb></lb>quence of certain conversation there 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was sent for, and I saw 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. pass from you to Mr. Lee—we then went on to the bank, and you returned the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Mr. Jones—he asked you where was the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and you said, "Mr. Lee has it"—I have never seen the deposit note since I left it there that morning; my account has not been credited with that 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I kept an account at the National Bank of England—at the last day of the year, to the best of my belief, 1,390<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. stood to my deposit account at the Lom<lb></lb>bard</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Mr. Gaskin</hi>: "I never spoke to you in my life; you were never at the bank; I never saw you at the bank.) I must contradict you—I had a reason for not being at the bank recently; I did not like Mr. Gaskin's manner, and I told you I should not call at the bank—I have been a director of the Building Society since 1874; they had offices in Regent Street; they were closed about three or four months ago; the closing up was 10 months ago I should think—I had furniture, I took it from there—you were manager there—the Building Society received money for shares sold—the furniture at Regent Street was yours—nothing</p>

               <p>else but money taken on behalf of the Building Society was accounted for to the bank or the Building Society, only fines, not the fees—the fees were received on account of the Building Society and the bank, but they were not accounted for to the bank because the furniture in the office belonged to you; you paid the clerks out of the money; the offices were yours and the furniture was yours—it was never the bank's furniture to my knowledge—I have resided at West Lodge since Dixon absconded, and I am in possession there now—the furniture is the same as was bought on behalf of the bank; the bank has taken possession of it and retained it—there is ample security there to repay them for all the money advanced; there is more furniture there, because I took my own there.</p>

I am an accountant—I have audited the books of the Lombard Bank from the beginning of 1876 to the end of 1877—I have been auditor almost since the bank commenced—there were no books at all when I first commenced auditing the accounts—the books were always in a disgraceful state, something shocking—I complained repeatedly and asked the shareholders to remedy it, to appoint a proper book-keeper and cashier, of neither of which complaints did they take the slightest notice till the beginning of this year, when two respectable gentlemen for the first time were called in to do the books—this is one of the complaints: "Among the most prominent instances of bad booking and inaccu<lb></lb>rate statements, I refer to the accounts of Bastaple, Cooper, Lee, and others, &amp;c."—that is a letter addressed to the chairman by a gentleman in my employment, signed by me—in auditing the books in January I think Mr. Lee appeared as a debtor for 1,700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I think there was a separate entry for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and another entry for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in one account—Mr. Lee had been in the habit of going through the accounts with me, because he was solicitor to the bank and had the conduct of many of these accounts; and it appearing to me rather peculiar that he should have 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to his debit, I called his attention to it, and he stated that he did not owe it—I asked Jones, the cashier, about it, and be said it was all in order, that he had had the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I then went to Mr. Lee's office; he at first repudiated the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he then stated that the money had gone through his hands, that he had paid it into his bankers, and to the best of my belief he said it was in reference to Barnard's matter—I said that was sufficient for me as auditor, and I passed it—I have subse<lb></lb>quently seen the account; but I do not vouch for it officially, because it is since 31st December, 1877, and I have not examined the books for the current half-year: it shows that the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. has been paid back—the book<lb></lb>keeping had been simply disgraceful; you could not trace where a cheque or note came from, or whether a payment was by cheque, post-office order, or otherwise; there never was an account or voucher taken—at the beginning of this year I instituted a system which now works well—it</p>

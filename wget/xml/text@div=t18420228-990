                  </hi>. I keep an eating-house in Broad-street, Bloomsbury. On the evening of the 25th of February, I was at the Brown Bear public-house, in Princes'-street—I had a coat, two handkerchiefs, and a pair of gloves—I left my coat on the seat—I missed it and the other things some time after.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable E</hi> 49.) I produce this coat, handkerchief, and gloves, which I found at the prisoner's apartment, in Greville-street, Hatton-garden—I called him out first—I said, "I sup<lb></lb>pose you know what I have come about, it is about Mr. Cann's coat?"—he said, "Yes, hush, I don't want my wife to know anything about it"—he went and got the key, and went into the room, and there was the coat—he said, "I only did it for a <hi rend="italic">lark,</hi> I thought it was <hi rend="italic">old</hi> Tabor's"—there is a man named Tabor, who uses that public-house.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did you not knock at the second-floor room? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, because I did not know which was the right room—your wife opened the door—she saw me, and closed it again—then you opened it—you opened the other room door, and went in—you put on part of your clothes in the bed-room, and part in the other room—I asked you what had become of the papers, because the prosecutor told me they were of some consequence—you said you had not examined the pockets, what was there was there still.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you had examined the pockets, you said, "Mr. Cann must have made a mistake, for the papers are not here," and the boy said, "I don't think he has examined the pockets, for the things are correct" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, he did not, for the papers were deficient—I said, "Mr. Cann must have lost the papers"—I searched the place partly—I did not go into the bed-room.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I was at the public-house with Mr. Tabor, and when he had left, I saw this coat, which I thought was his; I took it, in<lb></lb>tending to return it him in the morning, and have a <hi rend="italic">lark</hi> with him.</p>

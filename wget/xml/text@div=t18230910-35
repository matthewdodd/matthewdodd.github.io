On the 17th of August I went to bed at twelve o'clock at night; my house was all fast, and the property safe then; I was disturbed about a quarter or half past one o'clock, and heard two loud knocks at the door; I sat up in bed and heard the street door open, ran down stairs undressed, and found a number of watchmen about, who said thieves were in the house; a shutter at the side of the shop (which is part of the dwelling-house) was pulled down, a person could then get in; there is no window; I found the door open; I saw Wright in about five minutes, with a stick in his hand, which was mine, and which I had locked in the front kitchen the night before; he was kept in custody, as Mr. Gazley followed him into the kitchen and recognised him, and said,</p>
               <p>"Where did you come from, you are one of the men who broke into this house; look at yourself, see the condition you are in;" his clothes were all over filth and dirt, as if he had been trying to get over a wall; Wright said,</p>

               <p>"Wright, oh! Wright, a notorions house-breaker." He made no answer, but was taken to the watch-house, where I found Young in custody; he said he lived in Peter-street. I went home and examined the state of the house and found the iron bolt of the shutter burst off, the shutter forced down, and three coach plate-glasses, which had been taken out that afternoon, removed from where they were at bed-time, and placed near the door.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Do you keep a servant in the house - A. No; I fastened it up myself; they entered at the right-hand shutter by the door; when the shutter was moved anybody could get in; the bolts were broken; they were safe when I went to bed, I am sure.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. WALFORD. Q. The shutter must have been forced down by somebody standing in the street - A. Standing in my yard; he might dirty his clothes by rubbing against the coach wheels; my kitchen is under the shop; we did not secure Wright in the kitchen, but followed him up stairs; he could not escape, for the front of the house was surrounded by watchmen; I gave him in charge immediately we got up stairs; Gazley is not here. I found a tinder-box and pieces of candle under the carriage where the glass had been taken out.</p>

            . I am carman to Mr. Gazley, and sleep at his house, which is next door to the prosecutor's. I had been to the stable with my master's horse, and returning about ten minutes after twelve o'clock, went to my bed-room, at the back of the house. I came into the front room with a light, looked into the street, and saw three men and a woman under a gas light over the way, the men were pointing to the house; I will not say that the prisoners were there at that time. I went and called master, and said I thought they came after no good; they went away at half-past twelve o'clock, and after the watchman had called half-past twelve, two men came back; they had not been at Chamberlain's door above a minute before there was a light, the shadow of the light appeared to come from his door; the shortest of the two men came back and looked up the street towards Newport-market where the watchman stood; my wife then came and said there was a noise in Chamberlain's back yard. I immediately went into the back room, put the window up, but could see nobody; I returned to the front room, and saw the two men, the shortest went up the street, and the other down the street from Chamberlain's door, the watchman then called one o'clock, and at half-past one, the same men both came back together from St. Martin's lane; they came right to Chamberlain's house, and the moment they came, I could see the shadow of a light again; the short man went away to the railing in front of Chamberlain's house, that was Young.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you take upon you to say that was Young - A. Yes, I swear that; I am quite sure of it; he leaned against the post, and stooped over to see if he could see the watchman, and then crossed the road, and looked again for the watchman, then went up and stood at Chamberlain's door about half a minute, then got over my master's iron railing, squatted himself down behind a packing case, and I called the watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the other man all this time - A. I could not see him; I think he was in the house. When I called the watchman, Young jumped over the rails, and ran away. I came down into the street with a light, and found the watchman at Chamberlain's door; he knocked at the door, a person opened it, but my light was put out, I did not see who it was. Nobody but about five watch-men, my master, myself, and another man, went into the house. I am sure Wright did not go in with the watchman: when I went in the watchman laid hold of him in the house; I found a screw-driver on the packing case behind, which Young had been concealed. I saw the watchman take Young.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Do you mean to say you saw the watchman take Young, or take a man - A. I can swear he took Young, for there was only the watchman and him there, his back was towards me at the time. I saw him take the same man as ran from behind the packing-case, I am sure he is the man. I saw him again at Marlborough-street, and knew him by his face; I had a view of his face by the gas light, he is the man; I cannot be mistaken, he is the man I call the short one.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. WALFORD. Q. You saw him from a window, is that up two pair of stairs - A. Yes. Q. Who went into the house while you went down, you cannot say - A. The watchman was there before I left the window.</p>

               <p>"I do." I said</p>
               <p>"Why don't you get a light;" he said,</p>
               <p>"The boy is coming with one." I saw no boy, and called for a light outside the house, which was immediately brought, and I gave it to Wright, supposing that he belonged to the house; he took me down stairs, and pointed to a kitchen door, within, which he said he thought the thieves were. I broke it open by his direction, and we proceeded to look<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182309100023"></xptr>up the chimney for them, found none, and Wright was recognized.

               <p>"Watch." I ran directly, he sung out</p>
               <p>"they are breaking into the house, stop that man." I saw Young run from Chamberlain's door, followed and never lost sight of him till Lewis met and stopped him. I said</p>
               <p>"What have you been doing?" he said he had been doing nothing at all. I brought him back, and said</p>
               <p>"You must have been doing something, or you would never have run away;" he said he, had been easing himself there, and when he heard watch called he ran away; I said it was very simple to run away for that.

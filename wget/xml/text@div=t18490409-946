                  </hi>. I live at 10, Clare-street, Clare-market. The prisoner Lewis was my foreman in the slaughter-house—he had no authority to take any fat from the slaughter-house—in consequence of information I gave the police directions to watch the premises—the butchers in the neighbourhood send beasts to my slaughter-house to be killed, and the prisoner would have an opportunity of secreting the fat till he had an opportunity of passing it away, and from the quantity of beasts killed there I should not miss it—I went to the station and examined some fat which I am sure had been killed the same day, and it was in large pieces—Lewis lived at the corner of the gateway leading to the slaughter-house.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman</hi>, 127). In consequence of information, I went to Lewis' lodgings—he said they were his lodgings, and in the back-room I found a quantity of fat in two cloths, in a basket under the bed—he said he did not know how it came there—I had said nothing before that—I produced that fat to Mr. Woods—as I was watching the house on 5th April, I saw Dorset come out with a basket—I followed her into Holborn—she bailed an omnibus, and I stepped up to her, and asked her what she had got—she said, "A bundle"—I asked her to let me look—she said I need not; it was fat she was going to take to her brother, in Newgate-market; if Itook her to the station—the fat appeared quite fresh and warm.</p>

                  </hi>. In the beginning of April I worked for Mr. Rose, in the Old Kent-road—he is a butcher, and kills beasts for different persons—I used to dress his beasts. On Wednesday evening, 4th April, I had 7 stone 4lbs. of fat from him—he said I might have it, as he had no money to pay me—Dorset is my sister-in-law—I took the fat to her house, borrowed some money on it, and told her she might sell it—this piece of paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is Mr. Rose's writing—he gave it to me on the Wednesday evening, when be gave me the fat—I took it the same evening to Dorset, to her house in Shef<lb></lb>field-street—I saw her there—five of the beasts, whose fat it was, were killed on the Friday before Good Friday, and three on the Wednesday.</p>

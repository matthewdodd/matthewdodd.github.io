I am servant to Mr. Forster—I had only been there about two months—I observed the prisoner to lock her room door, and she was the only person who did so—on the 7th of August I observed her go towards the water-closet several times within a short period, and as she went on one occasion I observed a piece of muslin hanging from the pocket<lb></lb>hole of her dress—I then went into the water-closet and searched—I found some muslin, a cap border, and some other articles—they were cleansed and shown to my master and mistress.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clergyman of the Church of England, and reside at Lewishan. I had occasion to go into Lincolnshire, where I had resigned two livings which I held there—I had a sister died a short time before, (Mrs. Charles Forster,) and I bad a box which contained various articles of hers, which were kept in Lincolnshire for a niece of hers—I took the prisoner down for the purpose of packing up the wearing-ap<lb></lb>parel, which I was removing from there to my present residence—she had access to every thing—in consequence of what my servants told me, I sent Duncan up stairs, and be produced these things—I can speak to these stock<lb></lb>ings very particularly, knowing them to have belonged to my brother—they were marked "C F"—I can see that the C has been taken out, and in this instance the stalk of the "F" is of a different colour to the new work—the box from which these were taken contained other articles of a similar description—this handkerchief I can identify, as being a handsome handkerchief—I have one from the box like it—I cannot say How many there were, but I can say that several have been abstracted—the box is much, lower than it was, in respect to the qnantity of things it contains—these other articles I cannot speak to—here are handkerchiefs which have been recently marked "M P"—they have been lying some time in the box, and they correspond.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Which are the articles you identify? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> These three pairs of stockings, and the bottoms of these two pain of ladies' drawers—they were the bottom of a baby's robe—it was chiefly baby-linen that was in that box, except pocket-handkerchiefs and stockings—I saw them in the box on the 14th or 15th of June, and I left Lincolnshire about the 20th—I did not take an inventory, nor count the articles in it—I looked in, but did not ascertain whether any articles were missing—I never gave the prisoner any stockings for herself—I gave her some for the narsery-maid, but they were marked with different initials—the box came from Lincolnshire with the rest of my things—I saw all the articles as soon as they arrived at my house—the prisoner was in my service eight months, as cook and housekeeper—she came from Mrs. Barr's boarding-house, at Cheltenham.</p>

Last Tuesday fortnight, about eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner's coat was in the warehouse; I examined it, having missed property, and found in it three pairs of unsewn gloves, enclosed in a piece of paper - I replaced them; he was in the house at the time - I obtained an officer, and placed him in the street, opposite my door; I then went up to dismiss the prisoner for the day - he went out without my saying any thing to him - I followed him, and when he had got a short distance up the Old Jewry, I called him back, and said I believed he would find something in his pocket which belonged to me: at that time I was not certain the gloves were mine, not having looked at the marks - tranks are gloves before they are sewn: I desired him to take them from his pocket, and he did so - I examined them, and found they were mine, by the cutter's mark in each of them: it is the writing of King, my cutter - I desired the constable to detain him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BALL. Q. He was nine month<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183106300069"></xptr>in your employ? A. Yes - I did not inquire his character, having a recommendation from a third individual; he has been in the employ of Mr. Gardener, of Baldwin's-gardens, and others, I believe - he acknowledged that he put the gloves into his pocket; the other men had access to his coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not go out to speak to a relation? A.Somebody called him out, and that enabled me to examine his coat pocket - I had been robbed very frequently, and could not ascertain who it was.</p>
               <p>JOHN KING. I was in the employ of Mr. Watts for sixteen months. I know nothing of the offence - I saw the prisoner in custody at the Mansion-house; the officer showed me a pair of tranks, and the mark on them is the letter K., which is like my writing; I cannot be on my oath that it is my writing - I would not swear to my handwriting on leather; I cannot say it was written by me - it is like mine, that is all I can say.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, as far as you can judge of the writing on the gloves, do you believe it to be your writing? A. Yes, I believe it to be.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You saw it in the officer's hands at a distance? A. Yes.</p>

            . I am a street-keeper of Coleman-street ward. The prisoner was given to me, charged with stealing these gloves; he did not say a word to me - he would not say any thing - I have had the gloves ever since.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM HENMAN. I am an officer. I have thirtyeight pairs of silk tranks, which I discovered on searching the prisoner's lodging, directly after he was taken.</p>
               <p>MR. WATTS. Three pairs of gloves would consist of thirty-six pieces of leather - these found on the prisoner are leather tranks: I found two marks on them, one is the letter G., another K., which is the cutter's mark; I can swear to it being King's hand-writing - I have been familiar with his writing ever since he has been with me; the same mark is on each pair - I see his hand-writing every day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Will you swear positively that letter K. is his writing? A. I will - I have not a doubt on earth of it; I am quite sure it is his writing.</p>
               <p>JOHN KING. I have seen these before - it was a pair of the larger parcel that I saw at the Mansion-house; here is the letter K. on these three pairs - I think the K. here has been written by me; it is like mine, and corresponds greatly with it - I believe it to be my hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have nothing to say.</p>
               <p>JURY to MR. WATTS. Q. Was the prisoner in the habit of taking goods out to work-people? A. Not for the last two months, but he had been previously, only to get them embroidered, and that was always by my direction.</p>
               <p>Q.Has there been any malice existing between the prisoner and the men? A. I have frequently heard men quibbling, but am not aware of that with respect to him - his coat had been in the warehouse from tea time - very few persons had been there that day; they could not have placed the gloves there.</p>

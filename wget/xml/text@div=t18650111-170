I live at 110, Aldersgate-street—on the evening of 8th December, at 8 o'clock, I was at tea, in the kitchen on the first floor, and beard the door tried three or four times—I then heard Mrs. Hart call out, "Thief! Thief!"—my door was then pushed open, and I saw the prisoner quite plainly—he immediately went down stairs, and I followed him, and kept him in sight as far as Carthusian-street, where I caught him with a bundle—I stopped him, and he brought the bundle as far as the Red Lion public-house, where he struck me twice, and I was compelled to leave go of his collar—he then dropped the bundle, and Mr. Hart, who was then in the street, called out, "Thief!"—he got away—the policeman took the bundle—there were five dresses in it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Mr. Congdon—we live in Friday-street, Cheapside, and are Scotch warehousemen. On the 8th of July I went with Fiskin to the prisoner's—he keeps a small shop in Gos<lb></lb>well-street, which has haberdashery articles in it—I saw some caps and collars in his window—I went in, and pointed to them, and asked where he bought them—he said he did not know the party, but he bought them of a person coming round town—he said he had had invoices, but he could not find them—I saw two pieces of mouselin-de-laine in the back part of the shop—I recognised them instantly, and asked where he bought them—he said of the same party—I asked him if he had an invoice—he said he had not—I asked if he could tell the name of the party he bought them of—he said, "No"—I asked what he gave for them—he said 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I knew one would be worth 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the other 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 28<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I left the shop, and told him I would call again in the morning, but on coming out, I thought it would be better to go to the station, which I did, and saw Mr. Shackle—I went back with him the same evening—the prisoner was not at home—we waited an hour in the street—the prisoner came home—we went in and examined the mouselin-de-laines, and found they were our own, printed for us by Black, of Glasgow—the prisoner was not a cus<lb></lb>tomer of ours—we had not sold him these, and one of them ought never to have been sold—if it got out of our warehouse it must have been stolen—we have about twelve men in our employ—they have access to the goods I do not swear to any of the smaller goods.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police-inspector. On the 8th of July, in the evening, I went to the prisoner's shop, with the prosecutor and Fiskin—the prosecutor asked for those things to be produced which he had seen before—these mouselin-de-laines and some cap-crowns were produced, which the prosecutor identified—the marks on the cap-crown a were nearly rubbed out—the prisoner said he bought them of a man going round—he was asked if he had invoices—he said, "Yes"—he went with me into his parlour, examined his files, and said he had not got them—he said he did not know the man he bought them of—Mr. Barnes gave him into custody—I took him to the station, and there searched him well—I found on him two papers—one of them he said he had been writing out to endeavour to see what he had given for the goods—this other is a note—there were no other papers about his person—he was locked up in the cell, and the next morning, from information, I searched him again, and these other two pieces of paper were wrapped up, and put into his left-hand waistcoat pocket—I said, "What are these?"—he said, "These are the invoices."</p>

                  </hi>. I had seen the prisoner living with Ellen O'Brien as his wife—I cannot say how long it is ago—when I was there she was at home for eight days—he brought her home I believe—on the 3rd of Febru<lb></lb>ary, 1845, I went to Croydon, and saw prisoner and Ann Connor married in Croydon church—the clergyman asked him if he was a married man, and he denied it—I could not say to the contrary—I knew no better—I should say I had seen his wife about a fortnight before Christmas—Ann Connor was a servant as far as I know, and about twenty-three or twenty-four years old—I do not know whether she had any money.</p>

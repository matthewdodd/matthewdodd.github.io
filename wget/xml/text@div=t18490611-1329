                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Wilson, and live with him on the first floor, at 1, George-yard, White Friar-street. The prisoner Clark lived on the second floor, immediately over ours—on 19th May, about half. past seven o'clock in the evening, I met Lidsey going up stairs—Clark came down her own stairs to our landing with a knife in her hand, and seized a pump-handle which was on the landing, and said she would break my husband's b head with it, would rip his guts open, and his bunting wh—of a wife—my husband came out, and asked her for the pump-handle, as it was his—she threw it into the room, and went up-stairs—in two or three minutes she came down again—Lidsey followed her, jumped off two stairs on to the landing, seized my husband by the hair, dragged him into the corner of the landing, and beat him about the head, face, and body—I seized the sleeve of his shirt and said, "Pray don't hurt my husband so"—he took his am away, and a piece of his shirt came away—the prisoner hit me a blow with his arm—my husband got away from him, and went into his own room—Lidsey followed, and threw him on a chair—the chair broke in pieces, and they both fell together—the prisoner Lidsey kept beating him while he was down—I ran down and screamed for assistance—when I came back my husband said, "I am cut, I am stabbed," and his face was all over blood—the prisoners ran up stairs—my husband's face was washed—I saw the wounds—he was pot to bed—a surgeon saw him next day.</p>

                  </hi>.

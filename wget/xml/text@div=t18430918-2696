                  </hi>. I am a boot and shoemaker, and live in Cross-street, Hoxton New-town. On the 20th of August a woman ordered me to come and measure her son for a pair of boots—I went, and it was the prisoner—I measured him for them, he asked the price, I said 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said, "I will pay you ready money, make me the best articles you can"—I made them, and carried them home on the 26th—he fitted them on, and roade no complaint—he said, "My mother will pay you"—I said, "That won't do for me; I will have my money or the boots"—he walked out, taking the boots, came in again, and called me a d—saucy scoundrel—he ordered me out—I went again in an hour—his mother said he was not at home, but I should be paid—I called a great many times, but could not see him—I saw him at last—I never got the boots back, nor the money—the last time I went, the house was stripped.</p>

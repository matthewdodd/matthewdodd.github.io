                  </hi>. I live at Stratford, in Essex, and am a butcher. On the 5th of March, I had a copper pump in my care—I saw it about six o'clock in the evening—I missed it about a quarter to six o'clock the (next morning—in consequence of which I searched my garden, and saw some foot marks—I followed the marks down ray garden, and there I saw the sucker and handle left—the copper pump had been taken over the fence, and I plainly saw it had gone over the next garden—a person of the name of Benham lives there—I observed more foot-marks there—I traced them both right and left—one pale was broken off, but that would not do, and they took it to another place, and dragged it over—the top of the fence was marked with the green and the copperas of the pump—it had been lying by for some time—I went from there into a yard—I did not trace any footsteps beyond that—the officer found the pump.</p>

On the 6th of March, Mr. Shipston sent for me—I traced the steps over two gardens, and then I fetched the horse-police—I and Johnson found the pump in the prisoner Player's cellar, concealed behind an old door against the wall—I took Player into custody, before I found the pump—I told him I wanted him—he laid, "For what?"—I said, "The copper pump"—he turned pale, and then said he knew nothing about it; but after I found it, he said he found it in the marshes, and that Heard was with him at the time—I observed a green mark on Player's hat—the marshes are close by his premises—I went to Cheatham and saw Heard there—he went there by the name of William Granger—in coming away he said, I might as well have let him be, he would not have troubled us any more.</p>

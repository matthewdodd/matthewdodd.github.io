                  </hi>. I live in Church-way, St. Pancras, and as a boot-maker. On the 13th of Dec, about three o'clock in the morning I met the prisoner in Holborn—I had been drinking rather freely—a man was Selling coffee, and the prisoner asked me to give her some, and some bread and butter, which I did—there were some other females round—I then went out, and they followed me, soliciting for more—I was then persuaded to enter a house in a court—I felt disgusted with the company and the place, and said, "I will leave this place instantly"—the prisoner took a switch out of my hand and broke it—she then seized me by my stock, and said, "You b—before you go, I will have some money"—she called to another girl, and they commenced a murderous attack on me, calling for other assistance—I her some of the marks on me now—they beat me, because I had refused to give money at their request—I defended myself as well as I could, they still beat<lb></lb>ing me, and calling out <hi rend="italic">"Jem!"</hi> but <hi rend="italic">Jem</hi> never made his appearance—I made my way out, and called "Police!" a policeman came, but he said he durst not enter the place till he got further assistance—he got more assist<lb></lb>ance—I went in with them, and amongst other persons there I pointed out the prisoner, who had never let me go till she had robbed me, beating me it the same time with her other hand—I was covered with blood from the nose and mouth, because I refused to give her money—I lost my gold pins and chain out of my stock.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an unfortunate female, and occupy the front parlour on the ground floor at 11, White Horse-street, Lambeth. On 22nd Oct., between 1 and 2 o'clock in the morning, I met a young man in the Waterloo-road, who went home with me and remained nearly an hour, but did not have connection with me—we quarrelled, and were talking for a long time,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185210250087"></xptr>
               <p>and after that he tried to lock the door, and I said he should not—he did lock it, and then knocked me down, and tore my pocket from me—there was a half sovereign and ninepence-halfpenny in it; he took the con<lb></lb>tents out, and left the pocket on the table—I would not let him go to the door, and he flew to the window, undid the shutters, and the prisoner came in—the prisoner then knocked me against the table and the bed—my landlady then came down, and rattled at the door, but could not get in—the men then went out at the window, one after the other—the prisoner must have been close against the window, he came in directly the other man opened it—I swear the prisoner is the person who came in—I recognized him among several more.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep this house, 11, Whitecross-street. Smith occupies the front parlour—between 2 and 3 o'clock on this morning, I heard a noise and great bustle—I got up, went to the landing, and found it came from Smith's room—I went down, tried the door, and got no answer, but heard a noise as though the young woman was groaning; and there was a great bustle in the room—I tried to get in, but could not, as the door was locked—I tried several times, and said, if the door was not opened I would push it in—I heard more feet in the room—I heard the window open—I rushed to the street-door; the window and shutters were open, the prisoner was at the window, and another young man, two or three steps off—there was no one else in the street—the prisoner said he was waiting for a young man from No. 13—the other man ran away, and the prisoner followed him, in the direction of his own house—Smith had no dress on, her clothes were torn—she felt in her pocket, and said, "Good God! I have been robbed"—I know the prisoner by sight, he lives at No. 6.</p>

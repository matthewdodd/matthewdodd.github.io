               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You saw them above two months after the robbery? A. Yes - the goods would form a very heavy bulk; the linen was Irish - I bought it in London; I do not recollect the maker's name - I put my own private mark on it; I had sold none at that time.</p>

            . On the 24th of April, 1827, I went to Mrs. Oades' house, and, among other goods, found two pieces of Irish linen, which I have here, also six pieces of Irish and eleven table-cloths, which I returned to the prosecutor on the 25th of March, 1828, by the Magistrate's order - I kept two pieces of Irish.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You had taken the prisoner up the night before, and he had no opportunity of going to the lodging to receive any thing? A. No; I found no centre-bit or crow-bar there.</p>
               <p>JOHN KINSEY. I am an auctioneer's clerk I was in the prosecutor's service on Saturday, the 3rd of February, 1827 - Hattersley, my fellow-servant, was the last person in the warehouse; we both came out together - all the locks were secure, and the place fastened; I went there first on Monday morning, as I had the keys - I found the bar and padlock gone from the outer door, but no force had been used there; I opened the outer door with the key - it was on the latch; I found the warehouse door open, with a piece of linen against it - a door in the passage had been forced open, and a pannel taken out; they had got in that way, and every thing but one bale of goods, and two or three small things, was taken - about 200l. worth of stock was gone; I never saw the prisoner- he had no dealings with master.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Nor any means of knowing how to get into your warehouse, to your knowledge? A. No- not above 10l. worth of property was found; the padlock, no doubt, had been picked, and then the bar came away.</p>
               <p>DAVID LOW. I am a warehouseman, and live in Watling-street. I saw these two pieces of Irish at the Mansion-house about the 24th of April - they were not in wrappers; I am certain I had sold them to Mr. McKenzie on the 1st of February - they have the numbers of our stock-book on them.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I know nothing about the property; I dealt largely in goods for many years.</p>

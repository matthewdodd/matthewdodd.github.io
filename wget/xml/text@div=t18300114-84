            . I took up the prisoner, and asked him whose harness it was he had in pawn for 1l. 2s. - he said it was a gentleman's harness, which had been sent to him to repair, and he had pawned it, being in distress.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not say the gentleman was indebted to him? A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. A gentleman brought me a harness to put some ornaments to, which I did, and then he brought me this harness, and took the other away; I said I was so poor, I certainly must pawn this, as he had not paid me for the other - when he thought proper to redeem it I would do it.</p>

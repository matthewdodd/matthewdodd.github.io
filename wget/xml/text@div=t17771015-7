               <p>I know the prisoner; I saw these things in his possession on the 19th of September; I live next door to the public house; I saw him go by with them; it was in the afternoon; he laid the fender first in the bar of the Cock and Bell; he went back and fetched these three tea-kettles: I worked with this gentleman some time before, and knew that sort of copper was for his own use; he did not send it out to sell. The prisoner worked at the prosecutor's; I suspected him, and went to inform the prosecutor; he was not at home. I saw him go by on Friday morning, and told him, and he went and saw them in the public house.</p>

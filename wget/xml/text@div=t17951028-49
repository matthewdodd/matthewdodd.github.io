               <p>Q. Did he go with you as an assistant? - He went with us as an assistant.</p>
               <p>Q. You had the warrants that you had prepared? - We had the warrants which we had prepared the evening before. We went first of all to the house of Mr. Benett, which Mr. Pinsent pointed out as a person of that description; we searched his house, and at the back part of his house there was a five gallon tub found, we seized it. That was in the yard, the back part of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. That was all you found there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had seized this, what did you next do? - We went to the house of one Horton? another person that we had a warrant against in the same town, and there we found nothing; from thence we went down the street, to the house of one

               <p>Q. What next did you do? - I repeatedly knocked at the door for admittance, but I discovered a key inside, and the door appeared to be locked. While I was knocking at the door, somebody called to me, that

             was coming.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that from the street or in the house? - From the street. He came up to the stairs, to the top of the stairs of the dwelling house door; as they told me he was Rewitt, I did not know the man. I asked him if he was master of the house, he said he was, I then told him I had a warrant to search his house, and read the warrant to him; on this he went to the door, and attempted to open it, I told him that I believed the door was locked; then he called, open the door, there was no answer made, and went off; and seemed very much distressed and cried.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us what you did after you got in? - There was a cellar under the dwelling house, and in that cellar I could perceive there was some liquor; about the middle of the stairs there was a little window that opened into the cellar, which was made fast in the middle, with a kind of shutter over it; I stood on the stairs, and pushed open the shutter with my foot, it gave way, on which I see a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179510280077"></xptr>quantity of tubs slung with cords in the usual way. I requested a soldier to go in, a soldier went in, through the window, and opened the door, which was locked I believe. We then went in, and took one of the casks, and bored it with a gimbler, and tasted the liquor, and to the best of my recollection, it was brandy. We made the seizure, and I asked the Custom-house officer if he would give me leave to deposit the goods in his house, he readily said that we should put it in his house.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you enabled to see what was the quantity in this house which was the object of your seizure? - There was a very large quantity, to the amount, very probably, of two hundred casks, to the best that we could determine.</p>
               <p>Q. Then Mr. Pinsent being a resident there, you thought it a proper place to lodge it at his house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell me of what part you made a seizure, and where it was conveyed to? -We seized all that was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any of it removed from Rewit's house to the house of Pinsent? -We removed sixteen tubs to the house of Pinsent, containing sixty-five gallons of brandy. and fifteen of geneva.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened from without that alarmed you? - We were alarmed by the firing of several guns or swivels. There was a report of several guns towards the key, out of my sight.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good as to describe to my lord and gentlemen the situation of Port Parrow, as it bears relation to a key there? - It is a little fishing cove, and there is a key there.</p>
               <p>Q. There is a small pier there? - There is a small pier.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was Rewitt's house from this pier? - A very little trifle, about two hundred yards. If you go round to go immediately to the water, it is a very trifling distance. I was apprehensive that the mob was assembling, and going to rescue the goods. I was insulted by several of the inhabitants. A man came up to me and cursed me, and called me all that was not good. That was not the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Q. However, you met with insult? - Yes, saying they should soon be prepared, that I should not remove my bones from thence, and it was the last time I should come there.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there in fact any assembly of people that came to annoy you? - There was a large number that came at last armed with guns and clubs, large sticks, and the prisoner at the bar had a bayonet, when I first see him.</p>
               <p>Q. Speak to the number, how many might come towards you? - I dare say there were upwards of a hundred people in the street, but how many armed I cannot pretend to say, but a great many of them were armed.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had they come up towards you, and done any thing, when you had an opportunity of seizing the prisoner, Long mead? - The soldiers were in the act of removing the goods, and the mob came upon them, and said, they should not carry them from thence; one of them went to the cellar door, and shut the door, who it was I don't know, and said, he would be d-ned if we should move any of those goods from there, that we should be murdered if we attempted to do it. The soldiers were drawn up. Mr. Pinsent requested me for God's sake not to let the soldiers fire, for, says he, if you do, we shall be all murdered. I told them that I did not come to molest them myself, and requested that they would let me take the goods out of town; they said, they would be d-d if they would, that they would sooner lose their lives than their property, and if we did not go<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179510280078"></xptr>about our business, that they would murder as, or words to that effect.</p>
               <p>Q. What situation were the tubs in when you got into the house of Rewitt's? - They laid in the cellar in rows, all slung in cords. With that mob I see the prisoner at the bar, he had a bayonet in one hand, with a suzee in the other, and he came up pretty close to me, and said, he would be d-d if he would not run me through. I believe him to be the same person. I never see him before that time, nor have I seen him after, till I took him up.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at him now, do you believe him to be the person? - To the best of my recollection; he had a bayonet in one hand, and a suzee in the other, and swore he would run me through if I did not desist.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go on and continue? - I asked them at length, if they would let us take the goods out of the town? they said, they would be d-d if we should. On this I quitted the place, I thought my life was in danger.</p>
               <p>Q. Now be so good as to describe the guns that you mentioned, how they were placed? - There was a gun in the street, it was a swivel, it was elevated and pointed towards us, it laid between the house were the goods were, and Mr. Pinsent's. I see powder on the touch of it, and an officer of mine told me, that there were three guns behind, that I did not see.</p>
               <p>Q. So far as you observed yourself, did you see any other piece of ordnance of any kind? - No, only that one.</p>
               <p>Q. How many guns might there be in the hands of the people, that were come up in this croud to you? - Really I cannot tell you upon my word. There might be four or five, or more, I cannot presume to say, but I can speak safely to that number, positively there were four or five. We returned then on this, and went to the public house, and called for some refreshment, and went home.</p>

               <p>Q. You gave up the seizure? - We abandoned it. After we had got to the public house, I requested Mr. Pinsent to go down to see whether they were more cool, and inclined to give up the goods; that was about half an hour after. Whether he went or not, I cannot say, but he returned back, and said, it was of no use, they were not disposed to give up the seizure.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that cellar of Rewitt's in your district? - No, it is not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd. You have been some time an officer of excise? - I have been twenty years or more in the employ.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been long stationed at Cornwall? - Ten years at Bodmin.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went into Mr. Rewitt's cellar, and see these things, did you bring the casks out? - Sixteen only were taken out.</p>
               <p>Q. What has become of these sixteen? - They have been condemned by the Exchequer, and sold. They were secured in Pincent's house.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a question that my learned friend put to you, that you did not give any answer to. How long after this was it that you first see the man that you suppose to be the prisoner Longmend? - I cannot tell the exact time. I did not see him on the first beginning of the mob, it was near the conclusion of the business.</p>
               <p>Q. So I understand, but I want to know how long it was after the mob had assembled before you see him? - It was almost over, the mob had assembled for about half an hour, or thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Q. Consequently at this time you must be very much alarmed? - I was certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. You had never seen him before nor since till he was taken up. Now how many months might elapse between the time that this affray happened and the time that he was taken up? - It is a long time; from March, 1794, till within a month ago.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179510280079"></xptr>Q. That is, I believe, a year and a half? - Yes, so it is.</p>
               <p>Q. And you had never seen the man before nor since till that time, nor did you see him on that day till the latter end of the business, and after you were very much agitated? - I see him in the street afterwards walking, while we were in the public house refreshing ourselves.</p>
               <p>Q. What made you say then when my friend asked you the question, that you had never seen him before the time that the affray happened, nor after, until the time that he was taken up? - Not that day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you point out any other man of the mob? - A man that I had known before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you point out any other man in the mob whom you had not known before, and whom you had not seen for a considerable number of months after? - There is a man that I think I should know if I was to see him.</p>
               <p>Q. The next time that you see this man was after he was taken up? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. So that you had never seen him from that day till after he was taken up, and pointed out to you as one of the men. Then the first time that you recognized him as one of the men was after he was pointed out to you as one of the persons that had been in the mob? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long will you venture to say you see him in the mob? - Not a long time, but he was more particular in having a bayonet.</p>
               <p>Q. More than half a minute? - Five or six minutes at least.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean to swear that? - I do. I dare say I see him for four or five minutes in the mob.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say that he had in his hands? - He had a gun and a bayonet.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that he had a piece of fire arms in his hands? - Yes, I do, positively.</p>

               <p>Q. Then you were never resrobated by a Judge in the Court of King's Bench for the evidence that you had given, and gave as a reason for what you said, that you did not understand English? - I do not recollect the circumstance, nor nothing like it.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps I may have mistaken the Court, was it in the Court of Exchequer? - It was not, never such a thing ever happened in any Court Whatever, positively, upon my oath.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you an officer of the excise? - I am.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is it since you have been threatened to be dismissed? - I have been threatened by the smugglers, but by nobody else.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is it since you had a representation that you were likely to be dismissed from the office? - There have been impeachments by smugglers, but they could not make good the impeachments.</p>

               <p>Q. And never since? - I don't know that I have any business to answer these questions, if the commissioners ask me these questions I will answer them.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you under any censure at present? - Not in the past.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd. Then for the space of eighteen months you had never seen this man? - I see him that day afterwards, I told you so.</p>

               <p>Q. When you got there tell us what passed? - We searched two houses, in the first we found five gallons of spirits.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any search warrant with you? - Mr. Llewyn had with him.</p>

            's house; Mr. Llewvn went to the front door of the house, and demanded entrance, we found the door ladened, it was locked, Mr. Pinsent, the custom house officer, said, that Rewitt was coming up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he afterwards appear? - He did; Llewyn shewed him the warrant, he demanded entrance, he desired them to open the door; there was no person spoke on the inside; Mr. Llewyn then came down all the way of the steps, and there was a window to the cellar which gave way, and he saw tubs in the cellar; he ordered a soldier into the cellar, and he unbolted the cellar door.</p>
               <p>Q. How many tubs were there? - A great quantity, between two and three hundred, all slung, that I see at least.</p>
               <p>Q. In the usual way that smugglers carry them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What then? - We went about removing of these tubs to the custom house officer's house, Mr. Pinsent's.</p>
               <p>Q. Who do you mean by we? - Mr. Llewyn, and part of the soldiers that were with us. There was a person just as we began, came up to the cellar and said, if we did not withdraw -</p>
               <p>Q. That was not the prisoner? - It was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any mob assembled at that time? - There was not. We went about removing the goods, and as<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179510280081"></xptr>I returned from Mr. Pinsent's house, one soldier said there were three swivels brought up, I looked and see three swivels, they were pointed towards the cellar door, where the tubs were deposited; I ordered four or five soldiers to six their bayonets, and walk with me to the swivels; I then returned to the cellar door, and found the street was full of men.</p>
               <p>Q. In what situation were those men? - There were several of them armed with guns and susees.</p>

               <p>Q. How many do you think were armed with guns? - I believe I see myself just there, eight or ten or a dozen, I cannot say, but I think so; the street was very narrow, and they came up very close to us.</p>
               <p>Q. Besides that were there any others armed in any other way? - Yes, I observed several with large sticks in their hands.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they do when they came up close to you? - They threatened that if we did not leave the goods, and take ourselves off, that they would murder us; one of them catched the banger that I had in my hand, and threatened to run me through with it; I told him that he would be called to an account for his conduct, and desired him to give it up to me again, which he did. Mr. Llewyn told them he would not wish to have any blood spilt, that he would withdraw, he found that they were more in number a great many than we were. Then we withdrew to the public house.</p>

               <p>Q. Before you had withdrawn to the public house, had you seen how Llewyn was treated? - Yes; there was a person with a susee and bayonet fixed on it, first, and afterwards I see him with the susee and bayonet not fixed, the susee in one hand, and the bayonet in the other.</p>
               <p>Q. What did that person do? - I see him afterwards with the bayonet in his hand, pointing the bayonet at Mr. Llewyn, and he swore he would run him through.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what became of the susee, I don't know indeed; I recollect seeing the bayonet pointed at Mr. Llewyn.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you recollect the person again if you was to see him? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Look round about the court? - I believe that to be the man, but I cannot positively swear to it, I never see him before nor since.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of these tubs that you had seen? - We lodged them in the custom house officer's house; the mob obliged a soldier, and I believe one of the officers, to lay down four in the street, which I took up and carried them back to the cellar. When they came up and insisted on having the cellar door shut, we shut the cellar door, and withdrew to the public house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether any attempt has been made to take any people concerned in this business since? - O, yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after this matter happened was there any attempt to take any body? - Upon my word I cannot justly say the time.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not mean to a day; how long think you? one month or six months? - It may be four, five, or six months after this happened.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you here when the bill was found by the grand jury? - Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there an attempt to take them after the bill was found? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after that time? - It might be a month or six weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when the attempt was made? - We had soldiers, a hundred and three private soldiers from Maker camp.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you able to take any body? - No, they had made their escape, they were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you go to take? - We went to take the persons that were indicted, their names were Liddy, and Perry, and Longmead.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179510280082"></xptr>Q. Were you at last able to carry off any of these spirits that you had seized? - No, we left it at the custom house officer's house, on account of the mob being so powerful that we could not.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had the warrant for searching Rewntes house? - Mr. Llewyn.(Llewyn produces it.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. The tubs that were actually removed, were taken before this riot commenced? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. After the riot commenced, and got at the length that you have described, nothing was taken? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore what these tubs contained that were left behind, you cannot say? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. You talk of a man, not the prisoner, that took your cutlass, the disposition of that man however was such, that on your demanding your cutlass he gave it back to you? - Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you saw a man with a susee and bayonet fixed? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You afterwards saw that man in a threatening posture to Mr. Llewyn, with the bayonet in his hand; can you say whether he had a musket in his hand at that time? - I cannot say, I do not recollect seeing it at the time; I did not take particular notice, I cannot say whether he had or had not.</p>
               <p>Q. I observed you was desired to find out this man; you have been in courts of justice before? - Yes; I have never been here before.</p>
               <p>Q. Then of course you look at the bar for the person that you want to find out.</p>

               <p>Q. My question is, whether the person whom you recognized there, or four days after the obstruction was over, whether you see him amongst the mob when the obstruction happened? - I see him among the mob. I see him with the susee in his hand, and he had a bayonet on the susee, pointed at Mr. Llewyn.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say at the time he was doing this? - I cannot say any particular expression that he made use of, but he made some threatening words, what he would do.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you at the time in the act of seizing these things? - We had the goods in our possession at the time that I see him.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the behaviour of the mob at the time that you see him with this susee? - I heard a man say to Mr. Llewyn, d-n thy eyes, Llewyn, I will have thy blood before thou goest out of the place; and he bent his piece at the same time at Mr. Llewyn.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see how many men might have arms at that time? - I can answer that; I see five or six with arms.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the swivels? - I see a small cannon or swivel, I see the priming of it at the top.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd. Did you see these casks that were taken from the soldiers? - I see two casks that were dropped in the street, I don't know who took them, they were brought back to the cellar by some person.</p>

               <p>Q. I think you say that these that had been secured in Mr. Pinsent's cellar were secured before the mob came? - Just at the time that the mob were coming on, I believe there were some few casks that were taken to Mr. Pinsent's house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Did you see in what situation the casks were? - They were slung.</p>

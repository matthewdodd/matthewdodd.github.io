I apprehended Gilson on Saturday evening, 19th Jan.—I told him it was on suspicion of stealing two silver forks and a silver spoon—he denied it—I took him to Mr. Wayland's, and in going along he said, "I did sell one piece to Mr. Wayland, the top part of the fork, and that was all I did sell"—as I was taking him to Ilford Gaol, he asked me if I was going to take Sales—I said, "What for?"—he then said he sold one piece at a silversmith's shop past White Horse-lane, and another piece in the Minories, opposite Mr. Moses—he said he had cut up the silver forks with a knife, and Moore had given them to him—I said it was alleged to be the property of Mr. Woolley, of Forest-gate.</p>

I purchased a small part of a fork on 2nd Jan. of a lad very much like Gilson—it had been very much cut, and looked black and discoloured—I am not in the habit of buying chopped forks—I am not certain it was of Gilson—I sold it, with other silver, to Mr. Jones, a refiner, in Albermarle-street—I did not know whether it had been chopped or not—there was one prong out in the centre—I am not in the habit of buying such things of such sort of customers; but I was called down from my tea on the 2nd of Jan., and a person, very much like Gilson, asked if I bought old silver—I said, "Yes"—it weighed 8 dwts.—I gave him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I did not see anybody else.</p>

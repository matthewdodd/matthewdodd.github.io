               <p>I am a commodore. I found this man absent from his work, and I followed, and went down the warehouse, and in following of him I observed something in the lining of his coat, and I judged it was tea; after this I asked Stuart to go and take hold of him; and he said he had rather not, and I went and laid hold of him, and took him down to the elder's counting house; immediately there was a King's officer sent for, and he searched him in my presence, and he took the tea from the lining of his coat, in both skirts.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I have lived twenty years in Whitechapel parish, and thirteen years a housekeeper, and through fire, and not being insured, and distress, and one thing another has reduced me; I have sent to my friends in Whitechapel, if they would be so kind to come here and give me a character for the time that they knew me. I hope my Almighty maker will forgive me all my offences in my life time, and I hope for mercy at the hands of this honourable court; it is the first offence that I have been ever guilty of.</p>

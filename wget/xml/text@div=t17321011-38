               <p>Mr. Harding. Before I had taken up the Prisoner's Wife (who was try'd just now) I was told that he and she lay together in my Chambers during my Absence. I challenged her then with some Things that were missing, she said, that he had taken them away. She gave me the Key of his Room, in Black-Friars, I went thither with my Servant and a Constable. The Prisoner was in Bed; I found a pair of Shoes, a pair of black worsted Stockings, and a Wig there, which were mine. He got up and put them on, and said, his Wife brought them. I told him, I had lost several other Things, and that his Wife had sent me to him. Says he, what Things are they, set them down upon a piece of Paper, and I'll go with you to all the Pawnbrokers that she deals with in Shoe-Lane, and if we can't find them, I'll pay you for them, or make you any other Satisfaction. I told him, that I understood he lay at my Chambers in my Absence, and he owned that he had.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Yes, in the Footman's Bed, my Wife told me you desir'd her to lie there, and she desir'd me to lie with her. She told me too, that you would take it well if I sorted some Votes and Pamphlets which lay in your Chambers, and I did so. I believe the Shoes and Stockings she gave me were yours; but she said, you had given her leave to take them. As for the Wig, she said, it was given her by her Master Thickness, who lived with you. And upon her owning before Sir

             that she gave me these Things, I was discharged; but you took me up a 2d Time about sorting your Papers.</p>
               <p>Mr. Harding. I was informed by a Porter, that he had seen the Prisoner come out of my Chambers with a Bundle of Papers, ty'd with a Red Tape. I found such Papers in the Prisoner's Room, and says he, These are the Papers that the Porter saw me with, I had them from my Brother. I look'd over them, and found some Gilt-paper, that I had had by me for 2 or 3 Years.</p>

               <p>Weller. I don't remember that I did, but your Wife said, that you took the Wig out of the Box your self my Master tax'd you with taking a black Coat, and you own'd that you had pawn'd it to redeem another Coat that you had pawn'd before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have been committed to Prison a great many Times, for assaulting my Wife; She swore the Peace against me, so after that I was seldom out of Jail long together. And the last Time I could not be discharged without coming to some Agreement with her. So she said, that she had got a good Place at Mr. Harding's, that she had 30 l. a Year stacking Wager, and 30 l. a Year vails, besides all his old Cloaths, and if I would come and live with her again (for we had not liv'd together as Man and Wife for above 5 Years) she would give the Cloaths to me, and so she did, as I shall prove.</p>

I live in Lewis-street: The ditch that the prosecutor has spoken of, is about twenty yards from the house I live in—I have seen Chalk before—on Saturday night, 27th Oct., I was in bed—I heard a noise at the back of our house—my brother, who is older than I am, was with me—he got up and opened the window—he said, "Here is a man drunk"—I got up and saw three men struggling in the ditch—I heard one say, "You catch hold of his waist"—after a little while a man said, "Take your hand out of my pocket; you are robbing me"—I saw the prosecutor by the side of the ditch after he got out of it—he went to the left-hand side, across the brick<lb></lb>field—I do not know where he lives—I cannot say who the other two men were; they came at the back of our house—as they went past they stopped, and I heard them say something about 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I heard one say, "Give me 15<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and that will be all right"—I heard the chinking of money—my brother hallooed out, "I have been watching you <hi rend="italic">chaps</hi> all along"—one of them hallooed out, "Eh?" and they ran across the brick-field, as hard as they could run.</p>

               <p>made a stumble—Gilpin laid hold of his arm, and they went away u the top of Church-street, leading to the brick-fields—they went fifty or sixty yards—I looked after them.</p>

               <p>(Matthew Crawford, of Union-street, Blackfriars, gave Chalk a good character.)</p>

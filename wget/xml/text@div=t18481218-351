In consequence of informa<lb></lb>tion from Mr. Lobjoit's on 1st Dec., I watched his premises with another officer, about a quarter-past one o'clock in the morning, I saw Pendry come from Mr. Lobjoit's with the wagon loaded with greens—I saw him take from the shafts a sack containing something—he took it round to the back of Cain's premises, about 100 yards from Mr. Lobjoit's—he returned in about two minutes without the sack, and went on with the wagon—I followed, took him into custody, and charged him with stealing corn—he said I must be mistaken—Hodder, who had been watching the back of Cain's piemises, came and told me something, and I went to the back of Cain's premises—I waited till about a quarter-past six—I then saw a light come to the wash-house, and saw Cam's wile there—I wait in and asked Cain who was there, if he knew anything of that sack on hib premises—he said the sack</p>

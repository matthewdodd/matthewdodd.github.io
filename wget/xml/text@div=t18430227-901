I am a member of the Society—Thomas Dunn is the treasurer—I am not a trustee—the prisoner filled the situation of corresponding secretary—there are provincial societies in communication with the parent society in London—he was authorised to write to those societies, and receive money due from them—he was appointed by vote—there is a minute made of his appointment—I have not got it here—he has acted as corresponding secretary ever since, and was paid for the duty—there is also a trade society—he is a member of that, he also acted as corresponding secretary for that, and received a larger payment—there was 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. due from the provincial society at Leeds to our society—I requested him to write for that, I think in April, and up to October—I asked him several times if he had received it; and up to October he told me he had not received it—I had made several applications to him—I do not think he had any written direc<lb></lb>tions how he was to account for money he received—he knew he was to pay them over to me immediately, or to the treasurer; and he has done so in some instances prior to this—he has not accounted to me for this 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—there was 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. due last April, from a provincial society at Birmingham, of which Mr. Bishop is secretary—he has never accounted for that in any way, nor stated it in his accounts—I directed him to apply first—on the 14th of April I asked him for the 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.

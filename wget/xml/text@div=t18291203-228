On the 28th of November a person came into my shop, and said, "That was a beautiful piece of beef I had of you," and as he spoke I thought there was something wrong, and missed a side of pork from my door; I went out, but saw no one - I afterwards saw Mr. Keymer at his door, twenty or thirty yards from me; he told me the prisoner and two others had come out of his house just before - I went into his skittle-ground, but no one was there; I went back to my shop, and a little boy told me something - I went up the street, but I have not seen the pork since.</p>
               <p>GEORGE RICHARDS. I am eleven years old. On the 28th of November I saw the prisoner with a side of pork in his apron - I do not know where he got it; he was then at the public-house door, and went up Old Castle-street -it was a side of salt pork; I saw Mr. Pullen go after the prisoner, but he did not find him.</p>

I was standing at my door - he came to me, and asked about it; I told him two or three persons had gone out of my house, and I told him the name of Grey, Elmore, and another - they had brought in 2ozs. of beef, and ate it in my house.</p>

The prisoner came to his shop on the 16th of March, a little before eight o'clock in the morning; she asked the price of a piece of beef; I said 7d. per pound; she then looked at another, and seemed to be going out; she then pointed to the one she looked at first, said she was going further, and would call as she came back; I then missed this piece of beef, and followed her - she had it under her arm; I brought her back to the shop, and my master came out, and said it was his beef - she said she had bought it in the morning - she then offered to pay for it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are you constantly there? A. Not always; there are two persons generally in the shop, and they were there at the time. I cannot say whether there was a shopman nearer the door than I was; there was one on the other side of the door. She had just got out of the shop when I stopped her; she was not speaking to one of my fellow-shopmen - I will not undertake to say she had not been at the shop before.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How far was she from the shop? A. She was just off the step, turning to the right; there is no way into the shop that way. I am sure she said she had bought this beef in the morning, of a butcher higher up.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was sent for, and took the prisoner to the watch-house; she told me she was going to take it into the shop, to the other man, and she mentioned his name, but I forget it; she said it was the curly-headed man, and she thought she could get it a halfpenny per pound cheaper of him, as she had dealt with him before - she had 6s.</p>

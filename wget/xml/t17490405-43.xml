            ; we asked them what they had got; they made answer there was not a drop of it for us; we told them they were mistaken , for we would have it all; they presented their fire-arms, and told us if we came any farther, they would fire through us, (or words to that purpose) we told them the first man that fir'd should die; we rid in to them, then they gave way; we seized much of their brandy and tea.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to secure the whole?</p>
               <p>Mortimore. Either the smugglers, or people that came about us carried some away. The smugglers did attempt to hinder us in carrying the goods away, telling us they would shoot us if we offer'd to take the goods from them; the brandy was in half anchors, some we seized upon the horses backs; some we turned off; there were a great number of people came and took some away.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did you seize?</p>
               <p>Mortimore. About thirty half anchors; I believe we had near 100, but were hindered carrying it away: we had got several bags of tea upon the ground, but they got them from us: it was packed in oil-skin bags.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they all armed?</p>
               <p>Mortimore. Many of them were; they had long pieces, I saw no swords.</p>

            . I am a riding officer; I was with Mr. Mortimore and the others to the number of five, when we were informed of this gang of smugglers; it was the 14th of Sept. 1746, we saw I believe 30 or upwards, in Southbourne Lanes ; we met with them and seiz'd about 30 half anchors of brandy, and one bag of tea: there were about 40 or 50 horses, some of them were led.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the Bar?</p>
               <p>Fletcher. I know the prisoner, and am sorry to see him here; he was in company.</p>
               <p>Q. How came it you did not seize the whole quantity?</p>
               <p>Fletcher. We went to attack them, they drew up into a body; we ask'd them what they had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174904050018"></xptr> got? they said, nothing for you: we then answered, we would have it all; but there were too many in number for us to take the whole quantity; there might be 200 casks.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they obstruct you in seizing it?</p>
               <p>Fletcher. Yes they did, by offering to fire upon us.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner fire-arms?</p>
               <p>Fletcher. No, he had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he endeavour to obstruct you?</p>
               <p>Fletcher . I did not hear him speak a word: I saw him with two casks, which I took to be brandy, he came up in the manner the others did, and drew all round in a body together , with an intent not to deliver the goods.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they say to you?</p>
               <p>Fletcher. They said they would fire upon us if we molested them: the prisoner was at the right hand of the company, the fire arms were on the other side, and I was within four yards of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner carry away any of the casks that were seized upon the other horses?</p>
               <p>Fletcher. I believe he did not; there was much carried away by the country people.</p>

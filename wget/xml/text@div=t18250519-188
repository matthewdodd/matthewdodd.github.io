I was in the shop, cutting leather; Norman told me the prisoner had taken some shoes from a glass case; I turned round, and saw her with a little basket in her hand: she was not going out of the shop - she had the child in her arms. I saw something black in the basket - I opened it in the shop, before Mr. Bent, and found the shoes in it.</p>

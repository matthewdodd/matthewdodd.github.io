I keep a lodging-house—I do not know whether it is a brothel—the prisoner was my servant—I missed a tuscan bonnet, a gown, and a petticoat—I wished the prisoner to give them back to me before the policeman was sent for—she said she took the bonnet to the cleaners in Leadenhall-street—those are my articles.</p>

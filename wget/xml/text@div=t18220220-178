            . I am a constable, of Bow-street. I have seen the defendant serving in Carlisle's shop, No. 55, Fleet-street. I bought this pamphlet of him on the 21st of December, (Looking at it.) I saw him next day, selling behind the counter, and asked his name; he said it was a question he had no right to answer, and would not. I afterwards applied for a warrant, and got one, and went to see it executed about a week after. I had been several times to look for him in the mean time, but could never see him there till nine days after. I then went with a City officer, who apprehended him, he was behind the counter.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. HILL. Q. What led you to know Carlile's shop - A. On account of a former conviction on the same week. A gentleman named Sharp applied to me to go there.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether he is Honorary Assistant Secretary to the Constitutional Association - A. I have heard so.</p>
               <p>Q. You do this for the public good, you do not expect to be paid for it - A. I expect to be paid for my loss of time, I expect him to pay me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see any body else belonging to the Constitutional Association - A. Mr. Murray.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You were constable of Bow-street then, and are now - A. Yes.</p>

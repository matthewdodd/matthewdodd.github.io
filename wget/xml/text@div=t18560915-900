On 8th Sept, about 7 o'clock in the morning, I was in a coffee shop in Carey-street, Chancery-lane—I saw Masser at the top of Serle-Street, Lincoln's Inn-fields, with a horse and cart—I was there from certain instructions—shortly afterwards I saw a waggon driven by Payne from Chancery-lane into Serle-street—he drew the waggon up by the kerb stone, and halted—Masser drew his cart in close behind the waggon—Payne went on the top of the waggon, which was loaded with sacks, and pretended to be removing something—he then laid hold of a sack which was on the back part of the waggon, and handed it down to Masser, who was standing in the cart close behind—he then took another in the same way, and laid it in the bottom of the cart—Masser then drove into Carey-street at a sharp pace, and Payne drove the waggon on to Lincoln's Inn-fields—I went in advance of Masser—there was another constable with me—one of us remained behind in Carey-street; I went in advance, and when he was half way down Carey-street, I turned round and laid hold of his horse's head, and asked what he had got in his cart—he said, "I have got a quarter of malt"—I asked him where he got it from—he said, "I suppose off that waggon"—I asked where he was going to take it to—he said, "It don't appear that I am going to take it anywhere"—I was in plain clothes—I asked him if that was his answer—he said it was—he refused to give any other account of it—I then took him to Bow-lane station—I saw the name of Charrington on the waggon—the name on the cart was "Sophia Whit-taker, Wapping-wall"—I took it to the green-yard, and Mrs. Whittaker had it from there—the two sacks are here—they are full of malt—the name of "G. Dewding" is on both of them, and the name of "Charrington" is also on one of them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a partner in the firm of John Charrington and Co., of Queenhithe, wharfingers. Payne was our carman—I know nothing of Masser—on 8th Sept Payne had thirty-six quarters of malt to deliver at Messrs. Meux's brewery, in Tottenham Court-road—it was in sacks—he had no right to deliver any of that malt to Masser—I have seen the sacks produced—we have a customer named Dewding—our name is also on the sacks—the malt in the sacks is precisely the same as that which Payne had to deliver.</p>

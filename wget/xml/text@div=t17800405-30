I took him to my house; I sent to Mr. Bolden to let him know I had taken the prisoner. I then asked the prisoner what he had robbed his master of, and bid him tell me the truth; he said he would cut his arm off rather than not tell the truth. He said, He had robbed him of ten trusses of hay, three of them of the best clover, two trusses of barley straw, and a peck and a half of beans. He said he sold them to

On Saturday the 30th of January last, about five o'clock in the afternoon, he presented a draft to me for payment in the usual way of business; the amount of the draft was one hundred and twenty pounds, it was signed H.

            , for the purchase of three soldiers. I asked the prisoner if he did not mean two horses, he said he did I then shewed the draft to some of the clerks that were standing by, to submit it to their judgment whether it was the signature of Mr. Dyson; and then I told the prisoner that the signature was different to the signature of Mr. H. Dyson, and before I paid it, I must submit it to our partners for their approbation. Mr. Prescott was up stairs; I went and shewed the draft to him; then I come down stairs and told the prisoner that the signature was so different from Mr. Dyson's, we could not pay the draft without going to Mr. Dyson to ascertain it. The prisoner said it would be a very great inconvenience if he had not the money. I accordingly agreed with the prisoner that he should sustain no inconvenience, and that if the signature was Mr. Dyson's, I should take the money with me; the prisoner was to accompany me to Mr. Dyson's house. The prisoner made no objection to go with me; I immediately sent our porter for a coach. I had occasion to go to another part of our office to another person; the prisoner took the opportunity of going out of the door. Of course the coach came, and I went up to Mr. Dyson to apprize him of what had happened, and that the prisoner was gone away.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Dyson was a customer of your house. - A. He was, and had been many years.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen him write. - A. I have seen him write occasionally, and paid him a great many checks.</p>
               <p>Q. You looked at the draft. - A. Yes; I believed it not to be his hand writing. I should not venture to pay upon it.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you well acquainted with his hand writing. A. I am.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. How soon did you see the prisoner afterwards. - A. In about a week or ten days.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see him next. - A. I saw him at the mansion house. I think, on the Tuesday week following; he was brought up there upon another charge.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the person that you saw at the mansion house, before the lord mayor, the same person that you saw in the shop, and the same person that tendered the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180702180043"></xptr> draft. - A. Exactly the same. I have no doubt at all in my mind about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got the draft. - A. I have. (Witness producing it.)</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the draft that the prisoner at the bar presented to you. - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Mr. Dyson's name. -

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Has it ever been out your possession. - A. It has once.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any thing particular that you can undertake to know that draft by. - A. I am confident that it is the same draft that was tendered to me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. That draft is the same draft that was tendered to you. - A. It is the same.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you parted with it out of your possession to Sayer the officer. - A. I wrote my name upon the back of the draft before it went out of my possession; it was taken out of my possession to compare it with other checks. I am confident it is the same draft.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. There is

             on the back of the draft. - A. That was done when it went out of my possession. Sayer desired me to write my name upon it. (The check read in court.)</p>
               <p>Q. From one part of your evidence, it appears there was a doubt upon your mind upon the check when it was first presented to you. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had not had any doubts you would have paid it. - A. Yes. I submitted it to other clerks because of my doubts.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore you had your doubts at that time. - A. And therefore I would not venture to pay the money for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore when you had a doubt, you would not venture to say it is the hand writing of Mr. Dyson. - A. No, I would not venture to pay upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the prisoner at the bar went away when you called for a coach - you are confident it is the same person. - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. The first time you saw him after this was about ten days afterwards, and then you saw him at the mansion house. - A. Yes, he was then in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. When you first saw him at the mansion house, did you charge him that he was the person that presented the draft. - A. I merely went when I heard that he was to be brought up; I was desired by our partners to go and see if it was the same man or not.</p>
               <p>Q. That is not an answer to my question - did you or not when you saw him before the lord mayor, state to the lord mayor that the prisoner at the bar was the person that attempted to defraud your house. - A. No, no charge was made then.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before a charge was made. - A. The lord mayor ordered him for re-examination on the Friday following.</p>
               <p>Q. Then for aught you knew, the prisoner might have been discharged. - A. No, he could not, because our charge had not been gone into.</p>
               <p>Q. Your complaint was not on the first examination, but the second; therefore he might have been discharged before the second. - A. No, I attended on the first day.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was that. - A. On the Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you made no charge against the prisoner at the bar. - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You made no charge on the first examination; three days afterwards he was examined again, and then you made the charge. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you are confident it is the same man. - A. I am confident it is the same man.</p>
               <p>Q. Does not that confidence arise from something subsequent, and not from the impression that arose when you first attended before the lord mayor. - A. It arose from the recollection I had in my mind; it is still strong in my mind. I should be sorry to say he is not the man that tendered me the draft.</p>
               <p>Q. Does not that positiveness that you now entertain, arise from something that has taken place subsequent to your attending at the mansion house. - A. It does not.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you mean to tell me that at the time when you first attended at the mansion house you were positively certain that the prisoner at the bar was the man that tendered you the note. - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you charge him then. - A. Mr. Prescott said our charge was not to be preferred that day; I might go to the mansion house to see whether it was the man or not; he understood he was to be remanded for another examination, when our charge was to be made.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has Mr. Dyson kept money at your house. - A. Ever since I have been in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. You perhaps were not very well acquainted with his hand writing. - A. Yes; I have paid several of his checks, and I have occasionally seen him write.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. When you first saw the prisoner at the mansion house he was there under examination, and he was going to be remanded for another examination. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And then your charge was to be made. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you the least doubt of the prisoner at the bar, from the first time that you saw him at the mansion house, down to the present time you are now speaking about it. - A. I have no doubt at all about it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. R. N. Phillips, of 4, Berkeley Square—on Saturday night, 29th July, about 12 o'clock, I was in Knightsbridge with a friend named Payne—the prisoner and another soldier came up and asked us for tobacco—we said we did not smoke—they then asked us to stand treat, which we refused—they then asked us to buy a pawn-ticket—I said it was no use to me and passed on—they walked on and overtook us and laid hold of our arms as we were standing up in Park Lane; we did not walk willingly with them, they forced themselves upon us—after refusing to buy the pawn-ticket they left us—in going up Hamilton Place they came up to us again, caught hold of our arms, and asked us for money—I gave him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to go away—lie said he wanted more, and as I was pulling my. hand out of my trowsers pocket there was a 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece—he said "You have more and I will have it"—I said "It is only 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—he pulled out a bottle and asked if I would drink—I refused and crossed the road—he shoved me against the railings, pressed my chest, unbuttoned my coat, and took my watch from my pocket—I resisted, he took it forcibly from me and ran across the road—I followed and told him I should give him in charge for stealing my watch—he said "Will you?"—I said "Yes, I will," and he up with his fist and caught me a violent blow on the side of the neck, it rather stunued me for a little time—he then ran away, I ran after him; in crossing Piccadilly I missed him; I met a constable and said "Did you see that soldier running? he as stolen my watch," and the constable ran after him—I afterwards saw him in custody of two constables and charged him—on the way to the station I said "I have lost my pin," and the prisoner presently</p>

                  </hi>. I am a servant at 5, Clarendon Crescent, Leamington—on this Saturday I had come to London by the evening train and was going to stay with the prosecutor—I was with him in Knightsbridge—I have heard what he has stated, it is correct—I was in front of him part of the time, I did not see the watch taken—the prisoner's companion was with me, I tried to get rid of him—I went on as far as Park Lane and then missed <hi rend="italic">my</hi> friend, I waited there till he came back.</p>

About 1 o'clock on Sunday morning I met the prosecutor, he made a communication to me, and I went after the prisoner—I found him in Piccadilly by the side of the Green Park—there were two men sitting on a seat there and the prisoner was standing there—I jumped across the street and when he saw me he said to the two men <hi rend="italic">"Churns</hi>, will you take this"—he had his hand in his pocket, I caught hold of his arm, he drew his hand out, I caught it and found this watch in it which the prosecutor afterwards identified—when he came up I asked him if this was the soldier—he said "Yes," and. he should give him in charge for stealing his watch—the prisoner said "He gave me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to get the watch back"—I took him to the station—on the way the prosecutor put his hand up to his scarf and said "I have lost my pin" a few minutes afterwards the other constable said "He has given me this pin"—the prosecutor identified it—I found on the prisoner a pawn-ticket and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman C</hi> 191). I went to Thompson's assistance and helped take the prisoner to the station—on the way he pulled a pin out of the skirt of his tunic, placed in my hand and said "Take this and take no notice of it"—I told the other constable and the prosecutor of it, and he identified it as his.</p>

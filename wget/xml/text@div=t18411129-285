               <p>my knee out on that day—I had a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, along with other monies, which I placed in a canvas bag in a drawer up stairs, which I locked—in conse<lb></lb>quence of hurting my knee I lived for some time in the room of the pri<lb></lb>soner's mother—on the 6th of November I gave the prisoner the keys of the drawer up stairs, to bring me down my canvas bag which the money was in—she took the keys, and went up stairs—her mother brought the bag down, and said, "Here is the bag with the money, take care of it"—she introduced a carpet-bag with a padlock and key, and said, "Here is a bag, put the money in it, and lock it up," which I did, and it was put into the cupboard—I did not look at my money before I did so—I remained in that room till the 14th of November—I then opened the bag, and missed a 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and five sovereigns—I have since seen the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I know it by the number and date—I had put it down when I took it from Glynn's banking-house, on the 17th of September—I did not write any thing on it—I did not take the number of the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I did not have that from there.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RYLAND</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was your reason for making that memoran<lb></lb>dum, when you had only one 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note left? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because I should know it was my note—my husband took the other notes from Mr. Brown, who took the Axe of us—after we went to the prisoner's mother's house on the 28th of October, we put the money altogether—my husband had not ac<lb></lb>cess to the bag—he never saw the money after he gave it to me—I never told any body the number of this 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, till it was shown to me—I stopped it at the Bank—I went with my husband to do so, on the 18th or 19th, I think—I do not know whether or not my husband took the paper with him—I told them the number and date, and they stopped it—I do not think I produced the paper—I think I stated the number and date from memory—I believe the prisoner's mother takes in washing, and does what she can for her livelihood—I believe it is a respectable house—I do not know—I knew the prisoner a year and a half ago—she used to do needlework for me—she goes out to needlework and dress-making—she made me two dresses at home once, and also came to my house to work; and in September they went to live at this house, and she wrote me a note, saying they had apartments to let, and would be happy to accommodate us—she did no millinery at home, while I lodged there, nor did she go out—she did nothing at all while I was there—her mother took in a little washing, and there were other lodgers in the house—there was a lady, her daughter, and son, in the first floor; a Mrs. Holt, her daughter, and niece, and a little girl.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, there being all those persons in the house, do you mean to assert that you and your husband have not quarrelled about his getting possession wrongfully of this money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, not about the money—I do not know whether there was a looking-glass smashed one day—I be<lb></lb>lieve there was—my husband smashed it—we were quarrelling then—it was not because I charged him with attempting to break open the drawer where the money was, to get possession of it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a chisel</hi>)—I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184111290236"></xptr>
               <p>never saw such a thing as that in my husband's possession—Mrs. Colbert used it to flute her caps.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What were you quarrelling about when the glass was smashed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He wanted to go out, and wanted me to give him a few shillings, and I would not—I am forty-three years old, and he is twenty-three—I am po<lb></lb>sitive I never charged him with attempting to break open the drawer, and take the money—nor ever quarrelled with him about it in the hearing of the lodgers—we have had words the same as man and wife would have—when I counted my money on the 14th of November, I missed 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—not more—80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in notes, and 38<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, was left—that would make 148<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I thought you said just now that from the time you counted it on the 31st of October till you missed this none had been taken out, is that so? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You said you had 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. how do you account for the dif<lb></lb>ference? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> When we went to the house we paid 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. away in bills, which I can produce—that was out of the 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I had no other money—I say when I counted my money on the 29th of October there was 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and there was the same when I counted it again on the 31st—it was after that I paid some away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RYLAND</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you not stated that between the 31st of October and the 14th of November you had never been to the bag at all? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I bad not been to the bag at all, only in the presence of the prisoner's mother—I was never out of the room—no money had been taken out of the bag between the 31st of October and the 14th of November—on the Tuesday after I met with the accident I gave my husband five sovereigns to pay for painting the bar, a sovereign to buy him a pair of boots, and a sovereign to pay for moving the goods—I had some medicine for myself, and a lotion for my knee, and a bit of calico, and 1 paid the prisoner's mother 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for rent—I calculate that I spent about 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether for every thing—that 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was part of the 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and came out of the bag after the 31st of October, and after the 6th of November—I did not count my money on the 6th of November—my hus<lb></lb>band was at home at the time I sent the prisoner up stairs for the money.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why not send him to fetch it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was not in the room at the time—he was up stairs in the room where the money was—I was in bed, and not able to go up stairs myself, and I asked the prisoner as a favour to go and get it for me—I did not think it necessary to ask her to give my husband the key to get it—I placed implicit confidence in her: not more I think than I did in him—I sent for it because I wanted some money, and when the prisoner's mother brought it down I took out half-a-sovereign—I did not count the remainder.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PHILLIPS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was anybody ever present when you counted your money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The prisoner and her mother were on the morning of the 29th of October—I counted it in the parlour before them—between the 6th and the 14th of November I went to the bag and took a half-sovereign out, but did not count the money—I did not disturb it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean to say that during the whole time your hus<lb></lb>band never had access to your money-bag? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, what I thought proper he should have I gave him—I had the keys of the drawer where it was, in my possession—I always kept the key about me, and when I went to bed I put it in my pocket under my head.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Nicholls, a baker, in Union-street. I have known the prisoner about two months, and may have seen her a dozen or twenty times—I know her person quite well—she has dealt at our house for bread—I received a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note from her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Should you know it again; did you put any writing on it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I put writing on a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I do not remember whether I wrote on the note I received from her at the time or not—the note that was produced to me had my handwriting on it—I have been examined before—I know the prisoner as a customer—I remember her coming and asking me for change for a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I do not recollect whether or not I wrote any thing on it at that time—I saw my handwriting on the note which was pro<lb></lb>duced before the Magistrate, but I do not know when I wrote it—I did</p>

               <p>not know my writing was on it till I saw it—I must, no doubt, have put it on a short time after I received it—perhaps five or ten minutes after.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you sure it was the same note you received from her that yon put the writing on? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I took no other—I had, no doubt, other 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes at the time, up in my bed-room—I took the note I got from her to the rest—I always write on them before I put them away, but I might possibly have left it till the evening, till I went to bed—I wrote on the note—I do not know how soon after I received it—perhaps ten minutes—I am sure I wrote on it before I put it among the other notes—I wrote on it "No. 6, Borough-road "—I did not know her name, so I put the resi<lb></lb>dence—I knew where she lived by our leaving the bread.</p>

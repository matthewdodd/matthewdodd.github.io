               <p>MR. ABEL RAM. I live in Baker-street, Portman-square. On the 19th of July, about a quarter past twelve o'clock, I was on this side of <placeName id="t18250915-8-crimeloc50">London bridge</placeName>

            . I am warder of the bridge. On the 19th of July I saw Mr. Ram get out of his carriage with his lady - the corner of his handkerchief hung out of his pocket. He proceeded about fourteen yards on the bridge, then returned: I did not then see his handkerchief, but on turning round I saw the prisoner shuffling a yellow handkerchief into his bosom: I laid hold of him and asked how he came by it? He said it was his own: I called to Mr. Ram, who claimed it. The prisoner then said he had picked it up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you tell Mr. Ram that his handkerchief hung out? A. No; only the corner was out - the prisoner was not two yards from him.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I saw this handkerchief on the ground and picked it up; this man asked what I had got - I said it was nothing to him - he said it was, and I shewed it to him - people who passed told him I picked it up; he said they were liars.</p>
               <p>JOHN SALMON. I called nobody a liar - a woman said that he had picked it up - I asked her to go before the Lord Mayor, but she did not - somebody said she was a liar; it might have dropped without my perceiving it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a linendraper, and live at Reading, Berks. Haime was in my service for about five months up to the 2nd of March—he came on Oct. 13th—he said he came from Gloucester—on Friday, the 19th of April, in consequence of information, I came to the station at Greenwich, and was shown some muslin, some cotton stockings, handkerchiefs, and other articles of haberdashery—I know several of these articles (<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>) by my private mark—here is my private mark on this diaper—that has not been sold, nor this piece of muslin—this cambric handkerchief has never been sold to my knowledge—here are a lot of cambric handkerchiefs with my mark—here is a large bundle of things—I have looked through all these articles—I had such articles in my shop in pattern, fabric, and quality, without the private mark on them—I had not missed them, as I have not taken stock since—I believe they are goods which have come from my shop—I discharged the prisoner Haime on Saturday, the 2nd of March—I had no reason to suspect his honesty then—the property produced is worth from 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I know nothing of the female prisoners.</p>

The prisoner Amelia Elmer lodged at my house by the name of Miss Haime—she represented herself to be William Haime's sister—he visited her almost every night, and represented himself to be her brother—he lived at Mr. Jordan's in the same street—I never saw him bring anything with him—I know nothing of Eliza<lb></lb>beth Elmer—Amelia took my lodging on the 5th of Dec, and left on the 2nd of March, the same day that William Haime left the prosecutor's—they were in Reading before they came to my house.</p>

The two female prisoners lodged at my house for I think eight or nine weeks before they were apprehended—while they were at my house I saw William Haime there—Elizabeth Elmer represented him to be her son-in-law, and Amelia as her daughter—the constables came to my house to search their lodging—I went with them into the prisoner's room—they were not there then—we broke the door open—they had left without notice the day before—they had not slept there the night before—they left the door locked—I saw a quantity of haberdashery found on the bed—it was such a parcel as this—William Haime took meals there for the first fortnight, and lived in the same room with them—I had never been in the room from the time they came till the policemen came.</p>

On the 16th of April I went to the lodging of the prisoner Elizabeth, in Gloucester-terrace, searched, and found a great quantity of goods, which I have produced—there was a box of haberdashery, with a cord round it, and the drapery in a cupboard—there was no lock on the cupboard—the haberdashery consisted of pins and needles, and hooks and eyes—none of the articles in the box have been identified by the prosecutor—the articles that have been identified I found in the cupboard—I found the female prisoners in the same room on the 19th—they had returned to the lodging—I had taken the articles away on the 16th—I asked Eliza<lb></lb>beth if she rented the room—she said, "Yes, and my daughter lodges with me," nodding to the prisoner Amelia—I took them into custody.</p>

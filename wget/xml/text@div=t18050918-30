             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. Q. You are house surgeon of St. Bartholomew's hospital? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember on the 11th of September, this month, a person being brought in there to be examined by you? - A. On the 12th of September, between twelve and one o'clock in the morning, when I was called to the man, he was dead; he had a great many bruises upon his face, and a small wound on the left side of his head, and a little cut on his upper lip.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you open the head? - A. I did; there was nothing unusual in the appearance of the head; I examined his head, belly, chest, and neck.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you apprehend was the cause of his death? - A. I cannot speak positively; I should suppose he died from these blows.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the blows occasion his death? - A.I cannot say; people sometimes immediately die after receiving blows, and nothing is to be seen on the body but the blows.</p>
               <p>Q. Would he have died otherwise, if he had not received these blows? - A. I cannot take upon me to say.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you more particularly describe the effect of the blows? - A. The bruises were no more than a person might or do get in boxing; I cannot speak of what they were capable of producing; they might produce nothing in some persons.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. We understand from you, sir, that you found some bruises on the deceased? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any of those bruises of that nature to produce death? - A. That is a very difficult question for me to answer, yes or no.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. A man shoved down might be under some particular circumstance so affected as to occasion death? - A. Truly.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether these bruises would ordinarily occasion a man's death? - A. I cannot tell with what violence these blows might have been struck.</p>
               <p>Q. I mean by those appearances that were to be seen? - A. They appeared like nothing but common bruises; I feel it difficult to answer positively, I cannot say positively what was the cause of his death.</p>
               <p>Q. When you find a wound, you are able to state some connection between that wound and the cause of death? - A. Not always, most commonly we are.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these bruises of the nature likely to produce death? - A. One was from a blow on the head.</p>
               <p>Q. A blow on the head might or might not produce death? - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot state whether they did or not? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not cases occur of sudden death, where, upon examination of the body, you cannot find out the cause? - A. Certainly.</p>

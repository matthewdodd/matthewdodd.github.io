                  </hi>. I am shopman to my brother, William Sulman, in Stock well-street, Greenwich. On the 13th of May, a few minutes after eight o'clock in the morning, I had occasion to take a pail from the shop into the yard—I left a little child about five years old standing at the shop-door—I returned in one or two minutes, and found the prisoner in the shop, standing close to the door—he asked if we had any split rings for sale—I showed him some—he purchased one for 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and went away without waiting to have it put in paper—I then looked, and missed several rings from a glass case near the window—I went out, and overtook him on the road to London, laid hold of him, and said he must come with me—he said, "What for?"—I said he would see what for—he then said he had got nothing, and knew nothing—I told him be must come with me—we were going towards my brother's shop—a neighbor saw me, and walked on the other side of him—we endeavoured to procure a policeman, but could not—I took him to a neighbour's shop, and waited a quarter of an hour, but could not get a policeman—we then intended to take him to my brother's shop, and on the road he attempted to escape—he said we had not got him yet, and tried to wrestle his arm out of my hand—we took him to my brother's shop with assistance, and told him to sit down on a chair, to wait till the policeman came—the chair was about two yards from where I had missed the rings—he sat down, put his right hand in his trowsers pocket, drew it out, and put both hands together—he then stretched out his left hand, and I saw him put these gold rings into a drawer—it was the drawer which I had previously taken the split ring out of which he bought—that drawer was between two and three yards from the one from which these were taken—I distinctly saw him do it, and instantly exclaimed, "I saw you put them down, there they are"—at that moment the policeman came into the shop, and I gave him into custody—I believe my sister gave the policeman the rings, but I am not certain—I believe the rings he has to be the same—when the prisoner put them down, some were strung on a piece of paper, and some were loose—I know them by the pattern to be what were missing, but I could not closely examine them—the drawer laid on the counter at the time he put them in—I did not take them in my hand, but by looking at them in the drawer, I could be certain they were our rings—I know one by the pattern of it, and I ob<lb></lb>served that, before they were moved from the drawer to be given to the policeman—I find that one here, it has a black rim round it—I had seen the rings the night before, when I closed the shop.</p>

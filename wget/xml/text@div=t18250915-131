On the 12th of August, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, I met the prisoner in a public-house in the Broadway, Westminster; she came in several times, and asked me to go with her to another house in Tothil-street - I was not over drunk. I went with her to that house, and then to another, which she said was her lodging; but when we got there, a woman came and demanded 1 s. for the use of the room, which I paid her; she then asked for some liquor, and I gave her another 1 s., but had no change from it. I then gave her 2 s. I had three sovereigns and 10 s., which I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150054"></xptr>told in her presence, and put them into a bag, which I put in my left-hand trouser's pocket. I had some more loose silver in my pockets. I took off my trowsers, doubled them up, and put them under my pillow - she said "You need not be so careful, you will not be robbed here." I put a chair against the door, as the lock did not fasten well. I fell asleep, and was awoke by her hand being in my pocket - my money was gone, but my purse was left; she then went down stairs, and I should have followed, but I was naked - she was dressed different to what she was before. I got up and put my clothes on, and went to Mr. Hayne's, to buy some tools - he is a constable; he sent me to another constable, who went with me and took the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Why did not you seize her with her hand in your pocket? A. I had not time, she was too quick for me. I do not know whether she opened the door and any other person came into the room. I had been in company with two or three women and a man, who said he was a carpenter - he said to me, "Halloo! old mate, come and treat us. I gave them a pint of gin altogether.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. What sort of a purse was your's? A. A brown canvass one.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had she attempted to run away? A. No - she was at the place which she frequented.</p>

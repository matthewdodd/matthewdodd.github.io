               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The Prisoner objected to this letter being put in evidence, as there was no publication. The Recorder considered it better to confine the inquiry to the published letters. The alleged libel was contained in the letter to Mr. Hobson, it stated that Mr. Paddison had left no stone unturned to accomplish the defendant's ruin; that in order to attain that object he had resorted to felonious expedients, that he had committed perjury, and was a villain of considerably darker hue than even Jean Lane.</hi>)</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have known you about three years I think—I first became acquainted with you in 1871 I think, or 1872—I can't say for certain without referring to the books—you were introduced to us by Mr. Macrae Moir, a member of the bar, for the purpose of undertaking a suit in the Scotch Courts—I know the nature of the business—I had frequent interviews with you and no doubt took a few notes—I was frequently con<lb></lb>sulted as to the nature of the arrangements that you were negociating with Mr. Paddison; the arrangement was that Mr. Paddison should find somebody who would advance 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the party advancing it was to get 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for one, and you said that was very reasonable—I never said that I was so satisfied of the bona fides of the affair that I would myself become a speculator—I have an interest in the case, I had some Murthley bonds, I have not now, 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was the extent of my speculation—I advanced 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not get 3,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in return for it—I am not bound to answer what I got—Mr. Henry Robertson for whom you were acting did not immediately conclude the bargain you had made on his behalf, but he did before you left Mr. Paddison's office; he said he considered the terms most reasonable and equitable—about 26th January, 1872, I went down to Aldershot to serve a writ upon Henry Robertson; this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the writ—I did not serve it, I did not obtain a retainer from him to defend him—you told Mr. Paddison that you had incurred numberless expenses in Scotland to get up evidence in support of the case, and as you could not get the money from Henry Robertson it was necessary to sue him, and Mr. Paddison asked me to go and see Henry Robertson to see what the disturbance was between you; I did not serve the writ because I found I should not be serving your interests by doing so; the only difference between you was that you had made it a condition that Mr. McCaul the agent in Scotland, should be turned out of the case, and he did not wish it, and I thought it unadvisable to commence war between you, therefore I came back without serving the writ, as I told you the following day, and I had your written instructions showing that I had discretion what I should do with regard to that writ—you-were not entitled to a settlement unless Henry Robertson should refuse to go on with the case; you were undoubtedly entitled to your expenses if he refused to go on, and if he did go on you were entitled when the time arrived for payment as you will be when there has been a final success—I made an arrangement with Henry Robertson to come to London to see Mr. Paddison and I considered I was serving your interests in doing so—there was no conversation between Henry Robertson and myself as to the amount of your expenses in the case, except that I said I had come to serve him with the amount on the back of the writ, 462<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the business that took me there was either the serving of the writ or getting some arrangement as would be satisfactory to your interests—the first meeting with Henry Robertson in London appears to been on 3rd February, I was present; this is the entry "Attending Mr. Henry Robertson as to his claim and his wife's, and especially as to Mr. Alexander Robertson's as to which he would be willing to give a bond for 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and a 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bond, the latter being for expenses—the word "bond" occurs here; that word I see is not in your copy, that is a mistake—I did not, the morning after I returned from Aldershot make you a proposal of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. down as part of your expenses if it met with Mr. Paddison's concurrence—no part of your expenses have been paid so far as I am aware—you were at our office on</p>

               <p>5th and 8th February, and then you appear to have left, because Mr. Strong, a solicitor, on your behalf called on the 10th—we have never ceased to take an interest in your affairs, we do so up to the present time; that is with a view of getting payment for your expenses when the time arrives, when the appeal is decided in favour of the claimants—Henry Robertson was willing to grant you a bond for 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for expenses—we did not obtain that, because you acted in such a manner as to refuse to allow Mr. Paddison to take the bond or to act for you—a suit was raised by you two and a half years ago against Henry Robertson to obtain payment of your expenses—I had to do with that suit, not in your interest, because you were claiming the money when you were not entitled to it—that action was defended by Henry Robertson, and very properly so—Mr. Tripp was the solicitor in that case; Mr. Henry Robertson employed him I believe—I do not know anything of Mr. Paddison employing him—he continued to act until the case was closed, he was at Guildhall at the time the case was tried; he instructed Counsel; we assisted Mr. Tripp in getting evidence in the case, we were then acting as solicitors for Mr. Henry Robertson in the Murfchley case; we had no retainer; it was not necessary, the case was carried on in Scotland, and the retainer, if any, is held by the solicitor in Scotland, not in England—we have no retainer from Mr. Henry Robertson, except a retainer that may be made out from written correspondence, no actual retainer—I had never seen Mr. Henry Robertson till I went to Aldershot, nor had Mr. Paddison to my knowledge—I was at Bow Street on the hearing of the sum<lb></lb>mons against Mr. Paddison for perjury, it was postponed for a week to give an opportunity for discontinuing an action at your instance against Mr. Pad<lb></lb>dison for the money alleged to be due on the Murthley estate; I was in and out of Court and really can't say what took place—the shorthand notes are in Court, you can refer to them—in the hearing before Sir F. Truscott I simply attended to prove your handwriting—I stated that you had to fly from Scotland; I had been told in Scotland that you had left in consequence of a warrant being out against you for breach of interdict by the Duke of Athol for going across Dunkeld Bridge, and that the warrant could not be served in England.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The defendant came to Mr. Paddison in 1871 in reference to the case of a gentleman, his wife, and child, who were interested in the Murthley succession; that gentleman was Mr. Henry Robertson, at that time a sergeant-major in one of the cavalry regiments at Aldershot; he had mar<lb></lb>ried the widow of a Major Stewart, who was the direct heir to the baronetcy and estates of Murthley: the offspring of that union, her union with Major Stewart, was a son; there was a suit to declare his legitimacy and claim to the estates, and after the child died there was a second suit for the widow to claim her rights through her child; Henry Robertson was without funds—it was at the invitation of the defendant that Mr. Paddison was induced to take up the case—the defendant was to take his chance of the success of the suit—the second suit was decided in favour of the widow, the pursuer; one of the defenders, appealed to the House of Lords, and that stands for trial at present—the action brought by the defendant against Henry Robertson was tried at Guildhall before Mr. Justice Mellor, and the defendant was non-suited after having been examined; he then brought an action on the same facts against Mr. Paddison, in the course of which he delivered certain interrogatories to Mr. Paddison, and while that action was pending he preferred a charge of perjury at Bow Street upon Mr. Paddison's answer</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187501110015"></xptr>
               <p>to those interrogatories; that charge was dismissed—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a letter that he wrote to Mr. Paddison, dated 14th March, 1872; it is the defendant's writing. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that unless an answer was sent by return of post he should prosecute Mr. Paddison for</hi> 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">damages on account of his false and fraudulent scheme in connection with the Murtldey case</hi>). Until that action was brought no claim whatever was made by him against Mr. Paddi<lb></lb>son for money.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">By the Prisoner.</hi> In the first action there was unquestionably a claim of the child's right to the Murthley estates, claiming that he was the son of the late Major Stewart, of Murthley, and grandson of Sir William Stewart—of course the legitimacy of the boy could not be declared unless the mar<lb></lb>riage of the father and mother was proved—that action had to be aban<lb></lb>doned on account of the death of the child on 14th March, 1872—the change that took place in the litigation was entirely in consequence of the child's death.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, of 57, Lincoln's Inn Fields—I have been in the profession since 1859; until recently I was practising with my father—Mr. Macrae Moir is a personal friend, of mine—on 7th December, 1871, he came to see me with reference to the defendant and introduced him to me on the evening of the same day—there was ultimately a conversation between myself and the defendant in reference to the claim of the wife of the deceased Major Stewart and her child to the Murthley estates; there were various negotiations between us after that with a view of prosecuting that suit—I never undertook any personal responsibility to the defendant for expenses that he had incurred or was incurring in that matter—the parties themselves were without funds, and I was to undertake to see that a certain amount should be found—I was informed that proceedings were then pending, and when the child died all proceedings were abated—prior to any proceedings my clerk, Mr. Macdonald, was instructed to proceed to Scotland and make inquiries; one of the conditions was that I should make inquiries and satisfy myself—after that the matter was proceeded with, after the death of the child—it is not true that I have left no stone unturned to accomplish the entire ruin of the defendant—I have not in order to reach that object resorted to felonious expedients; I nave not committed perjury—I do not consider myself a Willian of a considerably darker hue than Jean Luie—there is no pretence whatever for using those epithets towards me—in the event of the ultimate success of the suit the defendant will be entitled to remuneration from the Robertsons, not from me—he brought an action against Henry Robertson in respect of services rendered and was non<lb></lb>suited—he then brought an action against me for the same thing and with<lb></lb>drew the action.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I first heard about the Murthley estates on 7th De<lb></lb>cember, 1871, when Mr. Macrae Moir gave me a letter that you had addressed to him. This is the letter dated 4th December, 1871. (<hi rend="italic">This contained a statement of the case, and of the writer's desire to raise a sum to prosecute the suit through some solicitor who might be recommended</hi>). I have not got the papers that were enclosed in that letter—I have not been served with a subpoena to produce them—it was through Mr. Macrae Moir, and of course through you that I became acquainted with the Murthley case—Mr. Macrae Moir gave me no information about it—I read some extracts from the papers with him, and asked him a few questions as to the position of the Counsel in Scotland who had expressed an opinion favourable to the case; but of</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187501110016"></xptr>
               <p>course with reference to the details of the case, he gave me no information—I do not recollect that the first question I asked you was "I decline to have anything to do with this case until I first know the terms upon which I undertake it"—I think it exceedingly probable that in the course of the interview I may have asked such a question—I do not recollect your telling me that the sum you required for expenses incurred before I took possession of the papers, and got an introduction to the claimants, was 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I don't recollect your mentioning any sum that I should have to pay for expenses; the only sum mentioned was fees to McCaul and Armstrong, the agents in Scotland—I can't tell the exact amount, but it was considered that it would be between 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—you told me that you had incurred expenses in connection with the case—I absolutely declined to have anything to do with the case if it was to be saddled with the expenses previously incurred—I would only take up the case on condition of its coming to me unincumbered, with the exception of some fees that had to be paid in Scotland, and some other small amount—you told me that you were to be very heavily remu<lb></lb>nerated by the claimants in the event of success, that you were to obtain from them a bond for 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I considered that would be remuneration sufficient—you told me that according to your agreement with Henry Robertson, you were entitled to current expenses from a date which I believe was June or July, 1871—you, no doubt, explained to me that the claimants were not in a position to pay your expenses—you did not explain that the loan was intended to cover your expenses as well as other expenses in the case—there was no reference whatever to your expenses in the loan—I would not consent to your previous expenses being paid out of the loan—I con<lb></lb>sidered that you had rendered such material service in the matter, and also were capable of rendering such material service, from your knowledge of the witnesses in the case, that I absolutely declined to take up the case unless it were to be with your assistance, and for your subsequent expenses you were to be paid out of the money that was to be raised—I was informed by you that there was a case then pending in Scotland about the Murthley succession, but I never took part in that case; the nature of that case was to prove the marriage in order to obtain the widow's dower, to obtain for the child the baronetcy and estates, which you told me were worth between 16,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—no doubt explanations were given to me as to the time when that suit began and ended, but I have no distinct recol<lb></lb>lection upon the subject—my impression is that it was actually going on at the time the child died; but I also recollect that you told me there had been some error in the summons, and that other proceedings would be advisable in consequence—it was. very likely in the beginning of February that I came in connexion with Henry Robertson and his wife—the 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid to McCaul &amp; Armstrong some considerable time after the death of the child—I can't give you the exact date it was when it was re<lb></lb>solved that litigation should be commenced upon an entirely new basis, rendered necessary by the fact that the succession to the estate had lapsed or abated by the child's death, and the widow only being entitled to some small portion, 8,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I wrote to Messrs. Bellamy &amp; Strong on 16th February, stating that the original suit had to be abandoned on account of an error in the date of the marriage—besides the 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to McCaul &amp; Armstrong, I think 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid to a Mr. McQueen for something in connexion with the proceedings in 1871, through McCaul; I think about 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid altogether—I distinctly stated that I would not pay you</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187501110017"></xptr>
               <p>any amount on account of previous expenses; you came in for a very heavy claim of an uncertain amount, but told me that about 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would be all that was necessary to be raised for the conduct of the suit, but it might be well to provide 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—your claim was a fluctuating one; one day it seemed to be 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., another day 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., then it sprang up to 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 370<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—you never were able to name any definite sum, or give details of your outlay—I did not know of McQueen's claim until quite recently, within the last two, three, or four months—you must no doubt have incurred ex<lb></lb>penses, because you were exceedingly active and useful in the case at that time—I have the papers in the second suit—the nature of it was briefly this: to establish the validity of the marriage between Major Stewart and Margaret Wilson, now Mrs. Robertson, the wife of Lieutenant Robertson—I have my diary of 7th February—I have an entry that it was determined in Scotland to proceed with the case of the child first—of course the mar<lb></lb>riage must have been established; if there were no marriage there would have been no succession—I knew the child so far as having seen him in February, 1872—I believe Mr. Scott and Mr. Young were the Counsel who gave opinions in the case—I believe McCaul &amp; Armstrong were the solicitors in the first suit, but I am not certain whether they were the first" to insti<lb></lb>tute proceedings; they were in the second—I believe the first time I saw Henry Robertson was on the 3rd February, 1872; that was through you—in all probability he came to see me at your request—I recollect sending Mr. Macdonald to Aldershot to serve a writ on Henry Robertson; that was arranged between you and me on 22nd January—he did not serve it—this is the writ; it was issued by our firm—it was not done on purpose to scrape acquaintance with Henry Robertson; it was in consequence of your dis<lb></lb>agreement with Henry Robertson, and it was believed if he was served with a writ there would be an end of the disagreement—as to acting as your solicitor, you were introduced to me in order that I might act for the Murthley case, not for you, distinctly; afterwards, when it became a ques<lb></lb>tion of acting for Henry Robertson or you, I said you had better go to another solicitor—when I took out this writ I was acting for you simply as I have stated; it would have the appearance of acting for you, but it was simply in accordance with the arrangement I have already stated—about the 22nd December I wrote a letter to Henry Robertson, complaining that he had not paid—this is a letter in your handwriting, containing in the first few lines some pencil interlineations made by myself; this letter was never sent by me, I declined to send it—this is the letter I did send. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated</hi> 21<hi rend="italic">st December</hi>, 1871, <hi rend="italic">requesting payment of</hi> 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">for expenses in<lb></lb>curred by the defendant, together with a bond for</hi> 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">as agreed, for his services</hi>). I was acting as your solicitor in writing that letter, but I must explain, you told me on the 7th or 8th December that you could bring the Murthley case to me; subsequently you found that you could not, because Henry Robertson, through a Mr. Crawford, was negotiating and raising funds elsewhere, and you had a disagreement with Henry. Robertson and then did not see your way to getting your expenses paid, and you thought that if I wrote that letter to him it would be the means of settling the matters in difference between you and placing affairs in such, a way that there would be a settlement, and in point of fact the case would be placed in my hands—I am not act<lb></lb>ing for Henry Robertson—I believe there was a reply to that letter, but I handed over to your solicitors, Bellamy &amp; Strong, all the letters I received</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187501110018"></xptr>
               <p>from Henry Robertson—this is a copy of a letter written by my authority to Henry Robertson. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated 30th December, 1871, acknowledging the receipt of letters, and concluding from them that both Henry Robertson and Mr. Crawford were desirous that the defendant should continue to act for him.</hi>) I recollect on one occasion it was arranged that you should go down to Aldershot to see Henry Robertson, and I gave you two guineas to go—you afterwards told me that you had been, and on your return negotiations for the loan of 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. were renewed—this is the letter stating the terms. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated</hi> 6<hi rend="italic">th January</hi>, 1872, <hi rend="italic">from the defendant to Henry Robertson, setting out in detail the terms upon which the suit was to be proceeded with</hi>) That was the basis upon which I subsequently conducted all the Murthley proceedings—there was some alteration in the terms, but substantially, no doubt, that was the basis—sums were from time to time advanced on the footing that 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was to be charged at the rate of 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that is to say, after expenses were incurred bonds were given for four times the amount ad<lb></lb>vanced—all this was simply negotiation, but after the death of the child matters was talked over again; those were the terms substantially, but there were certain alterations verbally agreed upon—the fourth clause states "The claimants to be assisted in paying any previous claims apart from the law expenses to be afterwards incurred"—the interpretation put upon that clause was, the expenses incurred in Scotland through McCaul &amp; Armstrong, and some few incidental expense; it was not to include your expenses, distinctly not—I did not arrange on behalf of Henry Robert<lb></lb>son to pay you 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., nor any sum whatever—there had been an immense deal of discussion about your expenses, and at an interview between Henry Robertson and myself, he stated that he would give you for your services a bond for 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. instead of for 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which he said he had never agreed to give you; he also stated that he would give you 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and a bond for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the latter being for expenses—he would have to give you the money, but I should have to find the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for him to give—I did not find it—when this was mentioned to you you said that you had commenced proceed<lb></lb>ings at once, as you had been trifled with too long, and I said, as it seemed that you and the claimant would be likely to differ so seriously, I would give up all interest in the matter, and that I could only act for one party—you declined to take the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I don't say that it was offered to you—you subsequently brought an action against Henry Robertson, I think, for more than 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and were non-suited—I did not defend that action, Mr. Tripp atced on that occasion for Henry Robertson—I was in Court, and was also a witness; Mr. Tripp acted as my agent in the matter—I was responsible to him, and have paid him—on 8th February, I think, you sent your solici<lb></lb>tors, Bellamy &amp; Strong, to me with a letter you had addressed to them asking for all correspondence and papers between yourself and Henry Robertson—I did not authorise Mr. Philbrick to state that 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would be paid for your expenses as soon as the suit was gained; what I did state to Mr. Justice Mellor was that no doubt you would be liberally remunerated after the successful issue of the litigation, and that I state now—the litiga<lb></lb>tion has not been concluded in Scotland; there is an appeal pending in the House of Lords—there were two defenders; one was the Baronet Sir Doug<lb></lb>las Stewart, and the other a man called Nicholls; so far as Sir Douglas Stewart is concerned, he has succumbed, and he has paid a sum of money by way of compromise—I am not quite clear as to the amount, but 5,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 5,700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Nicholls has paid nothing; Oh, yes, I believe he has paid</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187501110019"></xptr>
               <p>about 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—am not clear about the amount, but that is in Court in Scotland, or in the hands of McCaul &amp; Armstrong, simply by way of guarantee, in the event of the proceedings in the House of Lords being unsuccessful—not a sixpence of that sum has been touched and cannot be touched till after the issue in the House of Lords—5,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 5,700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had been received—no part of that has been handed to you for your expenses—in May, 1874, you commenced an action against me for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was ordered to file certain answers to your inter<lb></lb>rogatories in that case and I did so—this is a copy of my affidavit. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated</hi> 10<hi rend="italic">th June</hi>, 1874, <hi rend="italic">and stated "the plaintiff told me that he had incurred expenses, but no definite amount was mentioned; it was not arranged that I should pay him</hi> 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">or any other sum for expenses on being retained in the suit</hi>") In my letters of 21st December I did not specify a certain sum as the charge for your expenses it includes liabilities as well—a sum of 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was named for expenses, disbursements, and liabilities—your claim was 462<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for work and labour done and money lent and paid by you for the use of the plaintiff, it was not expenses—I am not aware that a certain com<lb></lb>mission was to be given for obtaining the money in London; that was dis<lb></lb>puted by Henry Robertson, but you did state that a distinct sum 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was to be given to you for raising the money necessary to prosecute the litigation—I don't know whether that 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was to cover all—I did not obtain your authority to compromise the whole matter for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—I can't say how the 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was fixed upon, it was simply a round sum for a claim as to which you were not in a position to give any details or particulars—I was not quite agreed that 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would be a proper sum, it was simply a round sum named in the first instance by Henry Robertson or myself, as a sum which might be offered for settling the whole of your expenses—I don't know what sum Mr. Philbrick mentioned—I say that you never mentioned a definite sum to me and you never were in a position to do so, you did not know yourself what outlays you had incurred—the 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was not the definite amount of your expenses, it was the sum you might accept—300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is not the exact sum stated in my diary of 3rd February, it is a sum of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in bonds and those bonds were not equivalent to cash—on behalf of Henry Robertson I offered those bonds to you on 3rd February and" you would not take them—on 7th February I have an entry that I was to go to Scotland and see Mr. McCaul and ascertain what would be a reasonable sum to offer you as an ultimatum; it was desired to take their opinion about it; I had never seen the correspondence and had no means of judging what the agreement between you and Henry Robertson was—it did not depend upon the. decision of Mr. McCaul whether you were to get any money at all, it was to depend upon the correspondence which was in their possession—the difference between Henry Robertson and you was this, he said that you had sent him a draft bond for 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and he would not sign it, you on the other hand acknowledged that there was a distinct agreement on his part to give you that bond for 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—no doubt there was reference to your expenses in getting up the case in my communication to Mr. McCaul, but it was considered that about 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or something like that at the very outside was all that you could have incurred—I did not offer you the 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not inform your agents, Messrs. Bellamy &amp; Strong, that you had no claim either under the bond or for your expenses on account of the death of the child—Henry Robertson is clearly liable to pay you your expenses if due, and to remunerate you for your services in the event of</p>

               <p>success, but not in the event of non-success; that was the understanding upon which you took up the case—I can't tell you the date when the first payment was made off the loan of l,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. it was some time after the death of the child—I believe the first payment actually made was to McCaul &amp; Armstrong it April, 1872—I had incurred certain expenses in reference to journeys to Scotland, but all that was preliminary investiga<lb></lb>tion which I insisted upon before I would touch the case—that was no doubt ultimately charged as part of the loan, but not in the first instance—no bonds were taken or papers signed by Henry Robertson until after March, that is to say, after the death of the child, because it was not determined then whether I should proceed with the case or not—of course your expenses might have been charged if I had chosen, but I did not choose to do so—I do not recollect promising you that I would advance to Henry Robertson certain sums when he got his commission, to enable him to purchase furniture and clothing; there was about 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to McCaul &amp; Armstrong and some few incidental expenses amounting to a small sum, certainly not to buy furniture or clothing, that he has already; I never advanced him any money for that purpose, certain sums were advanced at a later period, but no bonds were ever taken for that, it was simply a personal matter between him and myself—to the best of my belief they are not charged in the account', I am not quite sure about it; if they are it was contrary to my instructions—with regard to your expenses for the past I have already told you I would not consent to their being paid out of the fund, but with regard to the future your expenses were to be paid as the case proceeded, and I have already told you that I considered your help indispensable; but you went to other solicitors and it was also found that your help would not be advisable in Scotland, in point of fact that you would do more harm in Scotland than good; that I did not know at the time—you did not ask me to accept of your assistance afterwards—you told me you were very ill off for money, that you had expended all your spare money in this Murthley case—I had reason to believe that you were exceedingly poor at that time—I advanced you several sums, alto<lb></lb>gether I think 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—if the case had proceeded and your services had been available of course you would have been paid as the case proceeded—my reason for not advancing the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was not because I was short of money at the time.</p>

            , for two hours and seventeen minutes: I was in the field, but not with my brother. On the Thursday previous I went into my father's house, and then heard that my brother was to fight on the Monday. I never saw Bostock before the fight, nor since; my brother had lived fellow servant with him, and when he left they were always in opposition; I do not know that my brother challenged him to fight: but when I got to the field I went to my brother, and tried to persuade him not to fight; it was then about a quarter past eight o'clock; he said he was not going to fight, for the other party had not come, and they had forfeited the money - the others then came; my brother said they had forfeited the money; they replied that he was afraid to lose, and then they fought.</p>

I expected it would be over every minute, and therefore did not go for an officer. My brother said before he fought that if he did not fight he should never be able to stand in Holborn to get a passenger.</p>

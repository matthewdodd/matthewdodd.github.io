On the 28th of May I watched him, and saw a customer come into the shop - I was standing near the door, and he was behind the counter; just as the customer was leaving the counter I saw the prisoner draw his hand clenched from the till - I walked up to him; another customer came in, whom I told him to serve - he turned to take a canister down, and I saw part of a half-crown in his hand; he put the canister down, put his hand into it, and served 6 ozs. of tea - I then searched the paper he put it into, to see if there was a half-crown in it; there was not - I then called my other assistant, and told him to spread a sheet of paper on the counter - I emptied the tea out of the canister, and I found among it a half-crown with a black mark, which I had before put into the till - I accused the prisoner of taking it, and said I had suspected him for some time; he made no answer, but said he wished to speak to me in the parlour - we went on towards the parlour, and as we got to the door, I said "I suppose you have robbed me before?" he said, "No, not for a fortnight;" I said, "To what amount; I suppose 100l.?" he said, "No, upon my soul, not 30l. altogether;" he said there was more money in the tea - I looked, and found two more half-crowns; I then sent for a Police-constable - I marked them with a brad-awl.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. How long had he lived with you? A. Upwards of two years - I have given the same account as I did before the Magistrate; I think I did not then state that he said he had not robbed me for a fortnight; I did not feel disposed to do him any injury; I have not said that I should be glad to have him back - my assistant and one customer were in the shop at the time; I did not mention to the customer what I had seen - I had before sent the prisoner out for 4l. worth of silver, and then I remarked this half-crown, which has a dull sound and a black mark on it - I did not employ a Mr. Cole to draw up a warrant of attorney, nor authorize him to write to the prisoner or to his brother about his defence in this case - I did not recommend an attorney of the name of Howard, but I think Mr. Cole recommended some attorney to the prisoner's brother; I do not remember having seen this letter(looking at one) before, but I verily believe Mr. Cole wrote some letter and gave it to the prisoner's brother, for the purpose of his having a solicitor - I never authorized Mr. Cole to say, "My prosecutor, Mr. Hunter, is anxious that the prisoner should not be convicted;" in the course of his business, as a traveller, there are debts contracted; I look to him, I do not look to others for them - there are debts on my books, for which I have had a warrant of attorney signed by the prisoner's brother; I have not since then applied to the prisoner to sign a warrant - I never sent any person to say that if a sum of 50l. was paid by him I would not appear to prosecute - I never told his brother so.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is it customary for you, or any of your shopmen to put the ready money you receive into the canisters? A. By no means, my Lord.</p>

            . I am in the prosecutor's employ. I was at the end of the shop, grinding coffee; I saw Mr. Hunter at the door - a customer came into the shop: Mr. Hunter came and examined the tea which the prisoner served - he then called me to bring a sheet of paper, and turned out the tea from the canister, and found the half-crown: he took the prisoner into the counting-house; when I take money I put it into the till.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many persons are in the prosecutor's employ? A. Only the prisoner and myself: I did not go into the parlour - I had no conversation with the prosecutor about this case before I gave my evidence: I had not forgotten what I had to say, and had to consult my master - I talked to my master about several things, but not about this case, nor what I was to prove; this is my hand-writing, (looking at a letter,) I went to the prisoner in prison, respecting some debts he had contracted, and neither Mr. Hunter nor myself knew where the parties lived: they were due to Mr. Hunter, but the prisoner was answerable for them; he had a commission on them - I had summoned some of the persons, in Mr. Hunter's name, in which they were contracted; I was not sent to ask the prisoner to join in a warrant of attorney - I did not hear the sum of 50l. mentioned by Mr. Hunter.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am entirely innocent of the charge.</p>
               <p>MR. HUNTER. The prisoner was a shopman till the last eighteen months, and since then he has had a commission on the business - he sold to whoever he chose; I looked to him for the gross amount - he had no share in the profits, only on what he sold - when he first began he had a couple of guineas a week, but he has only served in the shop on a Saturday of late, and for that he was paid; he did not participate in the profits on a Saturday - he drank tea and supped there, if he chose to stay, and I gave him what I thought proper - he had a commission on what he sold out of doors, but he had nothing to do with that indoors.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where were you when he took the half-crown? A. I was at the post of the door - I saw him take the half-crown, and he likewise acknowledged having robbed me to pay the debt he owed me - I forgot to state that; here is the mark on this half-crown, which I had noticed particularly.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's brother, and am a house-painter. I have become responsible to the prosecutor for a debt of 66l., due from the prisoner; I signed a warrant of attorney for it since this charge was made against the prisoner - Mr. Hunter expressed a wish to Mr. Cole, his attorney, for my brother to sign the warrant while he was at the bar, and he said if it was not convenient to have it done in the office he would send his clerk down here to get it; Mr. Hunter made a proposal about going out of town; he and I went and saw the prisoner after he was locked up at Marlborough-street, and Mr. Hunter proposed to me that if he had 40l., to pay the expence of his recognizance, and 10l. to take him down to the north, he would go out of town; he said that within a few yards of his own house.</p>
               <p>MR. HUNTER re-examined. As I came from Marlborough-street his brother was very much distressed, and said what could be done - I said nothing, that I was bound in a bond of 40l., and so was my servant, and if I had so much to spare I would go out of town; I had no animosity against him, and I hear him none at the present moment.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received an excellent character.</p>

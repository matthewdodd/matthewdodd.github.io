               <p>About one o'clock in the morning I saw the prisoner coming up St. Brides-court with something which I suspected did not belong to him; I told my suspicions to a man who was with me; we watched him and saw him drop the lead; we pursued and took him; I searched him and found two knives upon him: he was never out of my sight; I saw him drop it; the other man took the lead to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>HUMPHRY WILMOT sworn.</p>
               <p>I am warden of the parish: when I heard that the lead was in the constable's possession I went to the constable and desired he would go with me and compare the lead with the place it was taken from; it fitted the place; it was taken off a building that belongs to the church; it covered the vault that goes down into the church; it fitted exactly, and I am positive that lead was separated from what remained; it appeared to be cut with a knife, and the jaggs of the knife answered exactly.</p>

I have done nothing"—O'Connor came up and took Hamilton; I handed Cox over to another constable, and afterwards went to the churchyard, and there found a white bundle where I had seen it go over; it contained five silver spoons, a pair of sugar tongs, a salt spoon, and a bunch of keys—the prisoners were taken to the station.</p>

I did not know exactly where I was. I wanted to go to Highbury station. I met Hamilton, and asked him the way. He said he wanted to go the same way. I had a half-pint of rum in my pocket, which I gave him. We went along the road; he asked me to lend him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I had only 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. He said he would give me security, and he gave me these things. We saw a policeman coming along, and Hamilton said, "You had better throw them away, or you may get into trouble" and I threw them away, and the policeman took me into custody.</p>

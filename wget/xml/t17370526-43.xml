               <p>Prickett. I live at the Sign of the Angel in Charles Street, Westminster. On the 3d of May I was going Home, and at the End of <placeName id="t17370526-43-crimeloc190">King Street</placeName>

I charg'd a Constable with her, and she charg'd the Constable with me; we were both carry'd to the Watch-house that Night, and the next Morning she was committed to Newgate; then she said, she wish'd it had been 2 Guineas instead of 2 Shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you do something you should not have done?</p>
               <p>Pricket. I did nothing at all - she's one of the Street Walkers, and there was another Woman with her, but she pick'd my Pocket. She asks whether I did not give it her, - no, - what should I give it her for? - she took it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I went to a Brandy-shop with him in King street, and he call'd for a Quartern of Gin, and then he went up the Passage with the other Woman, and stay'd so long there, that I went away: Afterwards I met him with

               <p>Pricket Well! - my Lord, I'll tell you the down-right Truth of the Matter. I li't into this Woman's Company, and she ask'd me to do - so and so. I had no Thoughts of it, - not I, but she perswaded me to it, so I gave her 6 d. out of my Purse: Afterwards I wanted &amp;c &amp;c. - but she would have 6 d more; I refused to give her t'other 6 d. so she put her Hand in my Pocket and took it all. There was no Moll Davis with me, - she took it herself. <rs id="t17370526-43-verdict191" type="verdictDescription">

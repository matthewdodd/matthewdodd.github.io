               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was not he as drunk as he could well he at night? A. Yes, and he seemed very tipsy at the watch-house - I think he did say it was a drunken frolic, and that he intended to bring it back; I never said, I thought he would have come forward with a couple of sovereigns to put me out of the way - he had given me 5s. at night.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner in charge at the White Swan - he was in company with some men; he said, "I am playing a joke with a young woman, who lives opposite the Black Horse," or I should not have known any thing about it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not the prosecutrix tell you she expected somebody would give her two sovereigns to prevent her giving evidence? A. She said if the party had come forward and given her two sovereigns, and sent her into the country, he would have heard no more of it.</p>

On the 27th of December last, I went out at four o'clock in the afternoon, and locked the door, and shut the windows. I returned rather before seven o'clock, and found the door open. I put my head in at the door, and saw a light; I waited about five minutes, and heard footsteps in my room. I was afraid to go in; I asked who was there, and the prisoner rushed out upon me; and said do not make a noise, my name is

            , you know me. I collared him, and called for assistance; a light was brought. I secured the prisoner, and delivered him to the officer. The wainscot between the passage and my room was broken down, and a looking-glass, which hung on the part of the wainscot which was broken, was gone: it was all safe when I went out. I found a box taken from its place, and put against the hole, and my feather-bed was drawn off the bedstead to the door; a flock-bed was also half on the bedstead, and half off. About three-quarters of an hour afterwards, the constable brought me my looking-glass. My door was forced also.</p>

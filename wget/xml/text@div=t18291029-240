On the 28th of October the prisoner came in to purchase some webbing for boots - he is a shoemaker; while the person<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182910290093"></xptr>who was serving him went to get it, he took twenty-four pieces of tape off the counter and put them into his pocket: I told a boy to go and tell Mr. Orme, and just as the prisoner got to the door he stopped him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It was outside the counter I picked them up. Witness. No; he reached over the counter and took them.</p>
               <p>ROBERT ORME. I am the son of Jonathan Orme. Lee sent to me, and as the prisoner was going out I told him he had got a pound of thread, which she said she thought it was; I took him into the passage - he pulled out this tape, begged my pardon, and said he did not mean to keep it; he has come to the shop for three or four years.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I beg for mercy; I have a dying mother and two small sisters at home whom I support.</p>

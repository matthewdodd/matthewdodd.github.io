That he still sat as tho' asleep, till the Man and Boy were in Bed, and a young Woman also that lodg'd in the House, was going up to Bed likewise; but came down, upon her Desire, to bear her Company, she not being willing to be left alone with the Prisoner. That some Time after the Prisoner went up into the Garret, to go to Bed with the Apprentice, as she did suppose: Upon which they also went up to Bed, and when they came, the Keys of both their Chamber Doors were taken out, at which they were much surpris'd; and not having other Fastening, they were afraid to go to Bed, for Fear of some Design. And thinking the Keys had been taken away by the Prisoner, they went up into the Garret, to ask him for them, who after some Time told them, they were in one of their Rooms, and came down, pretending to shew them where the Keys were. That being all three enter'd into the young Woman's the Lodger's Room, he pull'd the Key out of his Pocket, lock'd the Door, and put the Key in his Pocket again; and siezing on her, threw her down on the Bed, and used her in a violent Manner. That then he threw up her Coats, and that she strove, and sav'd herself as much as she could, for Half an Hour, 'till being quite spent, she could resist no longer; and that he was so violent, that notwithstanding all she could do, and the young Woman, who was with her in the Room, who also assisted her as far as she could, he did overpower her, and she nor being able to call out very loud, and the Window-Shutters being nail'd up, he did at length force her Body, put what he had into her, and - (which though the Exactness of our Law makes necessary to be express'd in Court, I depend upon it, the Modesty of Female Readers will excuse me, if I omit, and leave it to them to supply the Omission). That the next Day she was very bad, so that she could scarce turn herself in her Bed. This was confirm'd by the young Woman who was there present; who added, That the Prosecutor call'd out to her for Help, she did endeavour what she could to prevent it, but could do her no Good, and would have broken open the Door, but could not. Mr. Allen depos'd, That he being at that Time in the Country, when he came Home, perceiving his Maid, or House-keeper, in some Disorder, and crying, he ask'd what was the Matter, and she gave him an Account how she had been abus'd. The Prisoner deny'd the Fact, and said that the next Morning she show'd no such Resentment of any such Usage as she show'd in the Prosecution, for that he drank Coffee with her the next Morning. The Prosecutor being ask'd by the Court, said. That she drank Coffee the next Morning, with others of the Family, and that the Prisoner after they had been breakfasting some Time came up, but it was an Hour before she would permit him to have any. Another Evidence depos'd, That after he had heard this Prosecution was carrying on, he went to the Prosecutor, and ask'd her whether she meant to hang the Prisoner. That she reply'd, No, she had rather marry him than hang him. Upon a full Hearing of the Matter the Jury <rs id="t17230530-26-verdict158" type="verdictDescription">

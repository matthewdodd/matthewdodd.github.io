                  </hi>. I am shopman to John Thomas Hart, a currier, in Commercial-street, Spitalfields. On 31st Jan., a boy presented a paper to me—that is not here—but on 1st Feb., another order was delivered to me by a boy named Coventry—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"Sir, please let the bearer have five of the same kind of roans that you sent yesterday. Arthur M'Namara, Paul-street, Finsbury")—Mr. M'Namara was a customer of my master's—I had delivered to the first boy three skins the day before—in consequence of this order I delivered to Coventry on 1st Feb. five skins—they were my master's property—the boy signed the book—I afterwards went to a house in Skinner-street—I found the elder Fossey and a boy in the shop—I found on the premises behind the door four of the skins I had given to Coventry—we asked the elder Fossey how they came there, and who brought them—he said he did not know, they were brought by a person who worked for him occasionally.</p>

                  </hi>. I am going on for eighteen years of age; I work for Mr. Smith, in Pelham-street, Brick-lane. On Wednesday, 1st Feb., I was going along Spitalfields, and I met Fossey the younger—he asked me if I was in a hurry for five or ten minutes—I said no—he gave me a piece of paper—I cannot read or write—he told me to go to a leather cutter's, the</p>

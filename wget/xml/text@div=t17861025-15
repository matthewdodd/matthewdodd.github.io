               <p>I go out a charing; I saw the prisoner better than half an hour in the passage; I live in the house; I never saw the prisoner to my knowledge before; but as I went down my stairs, I saw the prisoner looking in at the parlour window; I went out with a little dust, and when I returned, I saw the prisoner coming out of the window with a wet gown under her arm; the gown was callico muslin; I have seen Miss Wake wear it; it was Friday the 6th of October I stopped her; and she said; do not hurt me. I am big with child; and she said, she had a young fellow in Newgate, she wanted money for; and that she would go and sell that gown and make money; and if I would follow her, she would give me six shillings of it; I called assistance, and she was taken into custody; she threw down the gown, and the prosecutor took it.</p>

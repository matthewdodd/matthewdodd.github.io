            . I am an officer. On the 14th of September, between nine and ten o'clock at night, I was in Goodman's-yard, Minories, and saw the prisoner coming along with another man - he had this bag of coffee over his shoulder; I said, "What have you got there?" he hesitated, and said coffee; the other man ran away - the prisoner attempted to follow him, but I detained him; he said,"It is my master's coffee," but refused to tell who his master was - he was too strong for me, and got away; I followed and took him, without losing sight of him - he was four or five hundred yards from Mr. Dowling's.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I saw a gentleman on the pavement, very much in liquor, with the coffee by his side - he asked me to pick it up; I did so, and told him he was in the Minories - he said he would pay me to see him home, and to carry the coffee; when the officer came I called the gentleman, but he did not come back.</p>

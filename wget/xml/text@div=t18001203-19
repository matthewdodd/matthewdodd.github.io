               <p>Q. Where was the guinea? - A. I had it in my till; after I had changed the gold she began to look at the silver, she first said three shillings were bad; in fact, she said the whole was bad; I felt myself very much irritated, and I insisted upon the change back, and looking at it, threw down the guinea that I had received of her, and she put it in her pocket; she made a great deal of hesitation, and refused to return the change; she then said, if I would give the change that I had given her upon my word, she would take it; I told her I certainly would, that it was good; she then took the change and went out of the shop with the guinea.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen, you see it was taken with his consent by the woman. <rs id="t18001203-19-verdict100" type="verdictDescription">

On the 21st of December, between three and four o'clock, I was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182601120045"></xptr>coming down stairs, to the kitchen - I saw the prisoner standing in the shop, with her pocket handkerchief spread a little over the counter; she looked on each side of her, and at the young man who was serving her; she then sat down on a seat, and drew her pocket handkerchief into her lap; I then saw her lay the corner of her shawl over her lap, and put something into her pocket. I had some suspicion, and told Heath to go forward.</p>

            . I am one of the shopmen. I was called by Mrs. Hucklestone, to go to the prisoner - I went and accused her of having a piece of lace; she was sitting by the side of the counter; she muttered something, and said"Dear me!" and took the lace out of her pocket immediately. I told her I should send for an officer - she then pulled another piece out of the same pocket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ANDREWS. Q. Were there other persons in the shop? A. Yes, a great many; the counter is generally covered with goods when we are busy. There are twelve yards of lace in one piece, and twenty-seven in the other - thirty-nine in all - it is worth 30s. I have known the prisoner some time - she is respectable; she took them from under her clothes - it is possible they might have been drawn under her dress by her handkerchief - it had been in a box behind the counter.</p>

            . I serve in the shop. The prisoner asked for some black sarsenet to match a pattern, and I went to our other shop, next door, to get some; I was gone three or four minutes; she bought three yards, and then asked for some calico of which she also bought six yards; she then asked me to shew her some lace; I shewed her the box in which these two pieces were; I sold her a yard and a half, or two yards of another piece of lace - she did not pay me till after she had been accused of this; I then saw her take one piece from her pocket, or from under her clothes, and on being threatened to be given in charge to an officer, she took out the other. I had not left her before I sold her the lace. There was a little girl standing by who took up a piece of lace, and I desired her to put it down.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you been shewing her this lace? A. Yes; she came in alone - the child who look up the lace was not with her. When she was accused of it she said "Dear me, it must have come in with my pocket handkerchief." She has been there several times before, and we always thought her respectable.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was the child who handled the lace, on the same side as the pocket from which the prisoner took the lace? A. She was behind her. I had not parted with the sarsenet or the calico - the lace was round the cards, as it it now.</p>
               <p>Thirteen witnesses gave the prisoner an excellent character.</p>

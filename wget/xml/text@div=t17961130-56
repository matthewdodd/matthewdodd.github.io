               <p>Q. Had you ever seen him before? - A. Not to my knowledge; he was in regimentals, she desired two or three times to know who was there, he said it was Goodwin, and ordered her to open the door, she said, she could not; he said, if she would not, he would find a way to get in, he came against the door with great force, but could not get it open; then he went to open the window-shutter, I said, friend, you don't know what you are at, if you have any business here, I will open the door, you can have no demands with me, or I with you, as we are unacquainted with each other; I said, if he had any demands on the woman, I would let him in; I opened the door, he had a bayonet in his hand, he gave me a cut on the eye, which put me into a great stagnation, I gave a jump to get into the street, he made a stab at my body, I put out my hand to prevent the bayonet entering my body, and received a wound in my hand; I got into the street, and the prisoner followed me with the bayonet; when he could not catch me, he threw something after me, I don't know what it was; I went to friend's house, and got on some cloaths, and returned back with the watchman to the room, on coming into the room, I found the articles mentioned in the indictment missing.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went out, you left the door open? - A. Yes; I was obliged to fly for my own life; I took the woman up, and she declared she knew the man; the coat and belt were picked up in the street, the serjeant found the other things, they were found almost immediately.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a porter, in the employment of John Kynaston, a warehouseman, of No. 4, Graham-street On 25th Aug., about 9 o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner coming out of the warehouse with two pieces of flannel—he was a stranger to me—I followed him, and took hold of him in Milk-street—when he saw me he dropped the flannel and ran away—this is it, it belongs to my employers—the prisoner was brought back directly afterwards by a policeman.</p>

I was in Castle-court, Law<lb></lb>rence-lane, heard a cry of "Stop thief!" and the prisoner ran up against me, coming out of Milk-street, and knocked me down—I took him back to the warehouse—the flannel was taken back also—it was not half way up Milk-street, but about fifty yards up—I afterwards met Jones, who said in the prisoner's presence, "That is the man who took the flannel"—the prisoner said nothing.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did not he tell you that some person asked him to hold it for him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; he said, "What are you detaining me for? I have hit a man a punch on the head, and want to get away from him"—where I took him was about 150 yards from the prosecutor's.</p>

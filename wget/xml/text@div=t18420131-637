                  </hi>. I am a porter and live in Brownlow-street, Drury-lane. On the 13th of January, about half-past five o'clock in the evening, I was in Princes-street, Leicester-square, and saw a cart with bottles and a wine-flat in it—the back of the cart was towards the door of a house—I saw the prisoner standing opposite the cart—I went by and took particular notice, having suspicion of him—I saw him take two bottles, put them under his coat, and go down the street—I told Chandler, a policeman, who went after him, and took him when I told him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. In consequence of information which I received from Marks in James-street, about one eighth of a mile from the cart, I followed the prisoner and took him in Carlton-street—I ran as fast as I could—the prisoner was running and Marks after him—I took two bottles of wine from under his coat—he said they had been given to him—he was running very fast all the way.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carman, and lire in St. George's. I was employed by Messrs. Col burn, of the city, to take some wine to Mr. Gibson, in Princes-street, Leicester-square, and some to St. John's-wood—while I was in Mr. Gibson's cellar, my attention was called to the wine-flats—I missed two bottles of wine from them—the bottles produced are them—"Colburn and Co." is on the corks inside—it is brown sherry—I was answerable for its safe delivery.</p>

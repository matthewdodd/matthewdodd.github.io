                  </hi>. I am the wife of Orlando Balls, who keeps a seminary at Greenwich. The prisoner was in his service—we had a young gentleman named Browne, who kept pigeons—on the 17th of October it was discovered that the pigeons had been stolen, and the prisoner left out ser<lb></lb>vice on the Monday—I detained her boxes, in consequence of suspicion—a person has been tried this session for stealing the pigeons—since that time I have examined the prisoner's boxes, in the presence of the policeman, and found a veil which belongs to me—I was present when she was ques<lb></lb>tioned about it and she said, "I have your veil in my box"—I said I sus<lb></lb>pected she had other things of mine—she said, "I have nothing but your veil"—this was on the Thursday after the 15th—this is my veil (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>) I know it by a red mark over the flower—there are two marks by which I swear to it.</p>

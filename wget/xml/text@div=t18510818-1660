                  </hi>. I live at 28, Mary Ann-terrace, Abbey-street, Bethnal-green. I am a guard to the goods train, of the Woolwich Branch of the Eastern Counties Railway. On Monday, 7th July, between 11 and 12 o'clock in the day, I was on the engine coming towards the Barking-road on the main line—I was going to a siding to fetch coke, and was going quite slowly—there are two pairs of points there, which are to move the engine from the main line to a siding—they are moved by means of a lever—as I was approaching I saw the two prisoners at the points—I saw Upton having hold of the lever of the points, holding them open—it works in an iron box fixed in the earth, with a weight attached to keep them back in their proper place—to open them you have to shove the lever over—while Upton was holding it open, I saw Gutteridge stoop down looking as if dropping some<lb></lb>thing into the points—they saw my engine approaching—it would have had to go over the points on to the siding—I ordered my driver to stop, which he did immediately—if we had been going at the regular pace we could not have stopped—I and the under-guard went to the point, and there found this large stone (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), it was on the chair, in between the tongue of the points and the outer rail—that would prevent the points from working—it kept it half open, and must have thrown the engine off, at whatever speed it had been coming—as soon as the prisoners saw my engine coming, they made off across the line, and got over the fence—I followed them—I came up with Gutteridge standing on a heap of dirt in the field—he spoke first to me, and</p>

               <p>said, "Why don't you take the right one?"—I said he was one, and I would have the other one before long—Upton made off—he was brought back by William Harvey, the point-teller—as I was taking Gutteridge to the station he said he should not have done it if it had not been for the other—I am sure Upton was the other.</p>

                  </hi>. I was under-guard to Capes at this time—I saw Upton have hold of the points, while Gutteridge dropped something in—I have no doubt the effect of it would have been to throw the engine off the line.</p>

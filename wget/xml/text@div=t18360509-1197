                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. Griffith Francis, of Rat<lb></lb>cliffe-highway, a grocer. On the 22nd of April I was telling up some packages of half-pence—the prisoner came in and I left off to serve her; and when she was gone I missed one of the packages, which contained forty-four pence in half-pence, and sixteen penny-pieces—I gave informa<lb></lb>tion to the policeman—I went with him to the Angel, in Back-road, and found the prisoner, and knew she was the person—the policeman called her out—I told her she must have been the person who took the half-pence—she said she had seen them—on the way to the station-house she de<lb></lb>livered them up, saying she hoped I would let her go.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. I told him, if I had got it, it must be in my basket (I was selling oysters) and he must have put them in—they were larking, and he asked me what I should call Davy—I said I should call that Davy; and if I had been at his christening, I should know what to call him. Witness. There was no such thing—my master's brother was in the shop, with the apprentice, doing up sugar—she wanted to be very jocular; but nothing passed about the name—I cannot say what words did pass—I wanted to get the shop shut up as it was very late.</p>

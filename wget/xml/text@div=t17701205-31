I was awaked out of my sleep with the noise of a window breaking. I looked at my watch; it was about half past eleven. I did not get out of bed directly, but waited to hear more noise, I heard a noise like people getting in; then I got out of bed: I looked out at the window, but saw nothing. The third time I looked, I saw a man coming up a paved court that leads to the window where I heard the noise come from; it was a ground floor window: I went back to bed, and rang the bell for the servants: I came to the window again. and saw a boy in a blue coat, about the size of the prisoner Deverux. After I had rang the bell a second time, my servant came down; I believe my ringing has alarmed them; they were making off: I believe I saw four of them when they were going away. They had broke the upper sash, in use to give room for the screw to go up, and they has broke two panes intirely to pieces, the others were cracked. They had broke the window shutter in two or three places, and the sash me thrown up. I never saw any of them before, so I can't sware to them.</p>
               <p>Q. from King. Whether you ever saw us about the place? And whether we had any thing belonging to you?</p>
               <p>Rudge. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When were they taken up?</p>

            . I am brother to the prosecutor, I lived in the house at the time; I saw the window broke as my brother has described. I went out in order to make enquiries in the neighbourhood: about a quarter of a mile before I got to Edger, I passed the three prisoners. Observing the boy answered the description my brother had given me of one of the persons, I had them secured at Edger. They gave very different accounts of themselves. They were not examined as to this fact, they were only examined as vagrants.</p>

                  </hi>. I am of the Jewish persuasion. Before this matter hap<lb></lb>pened I lived in New-street, Mile End-road, and was a watchmaker—I was in the employment of Mr. Hyams, and have been so ten years last November—I have been acquainted with the prisoner Ellis Caspar about sixteen years—I was once his foreman for about twelve months—I remained with him as his foreman till I was about to be married—my acquaintance with him has continued down to this transaction—he was present at my marriage—I con<lb></lb>tinued to see him occasionally from that time to this—I have known the younger Caspar the same time—a certain interval elapsed when I did not see him—he came to learn my business of me immediately after I left his father's employment—he came for a very short time, not more than a month or two—I sometimes saw him in his father's shop as I passed—it may be three or four years ago that the interval was when I did not see Lewin Caspar—I have been in the habit of seeing him for the last twelve or eighteen months—I knew he was in the employ of the Irish Steam Packet Company—Ellis Caspar lives in Finsbury-pavement, and Lewin lives with him—I called there to see them about last October, at Ellis Caspar's invitation, and accompanied him to the synagogue—while we were at the synagogue Lewin Caspar came in—we all three left the syna<lb></lb>gogue together—Ellis Caspar said he wanted to see me—I said I would call at the earliest opportunity—I saw Ellis Caspar on the following Sun<lb></lb>day at my house—I did not expect him there—I had not called on him be<lb></lb>fore, as I had said I would—he then said he wanted me to do him a favour which he did not explain then—he wished me to meet him in the afternoon in St. Martin's-le-Grand, at Williams's coffee-house—he told me we should meet another person, who would explain the business to me—I went there according to his wish—Ellis Caspar came there to me, and I went with him to the Old Bailey—he did not tell me for what purpose—we called a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> in the Old Bailey, both got into it, and were driven to Charing-cross—he told me we were going there to meet a person—we went into a coffee-house at Charing-cross—Lewin Caspar came there—he said nothing there—there were some strangers in the room—he said he would walk out, and go over the way, and we all went into the Park—by that time it was quite dark—when we got into the Park, Ellis Caspar told Lewin to tell me what he wanted of me, as he had told me nothing hitherto—Lewin said, "I have not yet told him neither"—upon that Lewin Caspar said a good deal, he said "The business you are wanted for, is to bring a letter that my father will give you, to my office in John-street, Crutched-friars, and I will give you a box, which you will take to my father, and I will meet you at some future time, and make you a hand<lb></lb>some recompence," or something of that sort—I asked him what the box was to contain—he told me he did not know; it was a matter of no con<lb></lb>sequence to me what it contained—he said a ticket-porter might do it, only he did not want his father to be seen in it, as the business was secret—I was to have the letter next morning, at a coffee-house in the street which faces the Monument—I was to meet his father there—I went to that coffee-house next morning, about ten o'clock—Ellis Caspar met me there—he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183906170155"></xptr>
               <p>said he had not seen Lewin yet—he went away, and returned in about a quarter of an hour, with Lewin Caspar—Ellis Caspar had a letter or paper in his hand—I did not look at it so as to know its contents—Lewin Caspar said the ship which was to have brought in the box had not yet arrived, and he told me I had better call in the afternoon, as it was hourly expected—we then separated—I went back in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—Ellis Caspar desired me to go in a <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> which he paid for, and I went home—I did not receive any thing from either of them at that time—I did the following day—I met them both again the same afternoon, at the same place—I met Ellis Cat par first, and he fetched Lewin—Lewin then told me the ship had arrived, but there had been an accident; two of their ships had run foul of each other, and there had been a great deal of damage done—he told me the ship had arrived, but the boxes were at the bottom of the vessel, and he could not get at them, and I was to come next morning to the same place—I went next morning, and saw Ellis Caspar there, as before—he fetched Lewin—Lewin told me the box was too heavy to take away, and he desired his father to give me half-a-sovereign, which he did—that was for the time I had lost in attending to them—Lewin asked me, if he should want me at any time, where he was to direct—(Ellis was present at the time)—I told him I was always at my employ—he knew where my employer lived—Lewin said he did not wish it should be known by my employer that a correspondence was carried on between us, and he should direct over to my house, by the Twopenny post, and would not sign his own name—after that I met Ellis Caspar in Finsbury-square, and Lewin came to us—I saw them several times before this transaction occurred—I cannot exactly say How often, but it was several times—that was always in consequence of receiving notes—the meeting in Finsbury-square was not at Ellis Caspar's house, it was in the street—the other meetings were frequently at the Exchange coffee-house, and different places.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> During these meetings, did either of them give you information about this transaction you were to be engaged in? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—on one occa<lb></lb>sion Lewin asked what sort of a hand I wrote—Ellis Caspar was not pre<lb></lb>sent then—it was on one occasion, when I met him, about three months at least before this transaction—it was before Christmas—I wrote my name and address on a piece of paper—he said that would do, and he proposed for me to write for him two letters—he said he would give me the forms, and I should copy the forms, and he would also give me another letter, that I was to imitate the hand-writing of as near as I could.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was that other letter about, that he gave you, the handwrit<lb></lb>ing of which you were to imitate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was a letter about a turtle that was to have been sent by a gentleman at the Bank of England—this is the letter-(<hi rend="italic">looking at one marked No.</hi> 6)—I subsequently received two forms which I was to copy—I copied them, and returned them to Lewin Caspar, with the copies—the first I wrote were rejected in consequence of the spaces being too narrow, not left wide enough, and the ink was too pale—there were spaces to be left—I wrote two others—(<hi rend="italic">looking at Not.</hi> 3 <hi rend="italic">and</hi> 4)—these are both my hand-writing—there were spaces left, which are now filled up—(<hi rend="italic">the witness here marked those parts which were left blank when he wrote it</hi>)—the address was on No. 3—I have marked on them what was blank when I wrote it—this letter (No. 4) was addressed to Lewm Caspar when I gave it to him—I delivered both the letters to Lewin Caspar myself at the same time—I addressed one to him by his desire-one was not enclosed in</p>

               <p>the other—they were both folded up separately—I think this was as far back as November last—it was before Christmas, in the early part of December—I did not see Ellis Caspar from the time I delivered these letters until Sunday, the 24th of March—I saw Lewin Caspar, but not above twice between—I met the two Caspars in Turner-street, Commercial-road, on the 24th of March, in the street, coming towards my house—it was between one and two o'clock—I did not expect them—they told me they were going to my house, and they both went into my house with me—Lewin Caspar then said he should want me the next morning—I told him I did not think I should be able to attend to it, for I had business of my employer's to exe<lb></lb>cute—Ellis Caspar said, if I had business to do out of doors, it would be a good excuse for my absence, as it would not occupy more than half-an-hour—I agreed to meet him—I believe I was to meet him in Mark-lane—I was to meet Ellis Caspar, who was to give me a letter to go to Lewin. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you go on the following morning by appointment? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I went on business of my employer's at the same time, and met the two Caspars together in Fenchurch-street—I think it was after ten o'clock—Lewin left his father before he spoke to me, and Ellis Caspar came up and spoke to me—he said he wanted to give me something, where should he go, he did not like to do it in the street—he walked into Mark-lane, into a coffee-house, and he there gave me a letter and a blue bag—the letter was folded, I did not open it—I eventually delivered that letter to Lewin Caspar—nearly the whole of that letter was my writing—there is a memorandum of mine which was written that morning on that letter—(<hi rend="italic">looking at No.</hi> 4)—that is the letter I carried that morning—I wrote that receipt upon it in the wharf the same morning—I think I left my home some time after eight o'clock that morning—I was not dressed in the clothes I ordinarily wore on week-days—when I received this letter from Ellis Caspar, he told me to take it to Lewin Caspar at his office, and Lewin would give me something—he did not say what, but I was to put it into the bag and bring it to him, and he would wait for me in Wood-street, Cheapside—I was to bring it in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I got a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> in Fenchurch-street, and went to Lewin's office, Messrs. Hartley's, John-street—a young lad came to the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> door—Ellis Caspar had desired me to ask for Mr. Hartley, which I did—something passed between me and the lad, and he went in and sent out Lewin Caspar—I gave him the letter, and he went into the office with it—he came out again to the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> with another letter, as well as the one I had given him—he compared the two, and said there was some mistake, I must go into the office and he would correct it—I went into the office into the back-room, the inner-room through the front warehouse—there was nobody in the inner office but Lewin Caspar and myself—we passed through the outer office, and I saw some clerks there—when we got into the inner room he corrected the mis<lb></lb>take—I did not notice what the correction was—he then wrote an order at the foot of the letter—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"Mr. Bristow, please to deliver the above, Messrs.

               <p>name which he mentioned to me, which I have forgotten—I went to Bread-street first to deliver some goods of my master's, and went from there to the wharf—I did not go in the same <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I left the first <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> at the corner of King William-street—I then went to Bread-street, and took a fresh <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> in Cheapside—I went in that to the wharf—I think I inquired for Mr. Hartley there—Lewin Caspar was not there—a person who answered me sent Mr. Bristow to me—I was still in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I gave him this letter in the state it is in now—the receipt was not on it then—he desired me to come into the office—I did so—I saw two boxes in the office, and Mr. Bristow delivered those two boxes to me—they were put into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I wrote this receipt for them on the letter—I had forgotten the name I was to sign—I have signed the name of March—I believe my reason for signing that was because I saw it on another part of the letter—I forgot at the time I got to the wharf what name I was to sign, but signed March, which I thought was the name—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"Re<lb></lb>ceived the above, J. H. Deane, per March, Esq."—I left that with Mr. Bristow—I put one box into the bag—it was scarcely large enough to con<lb></lb>tain one—the boxes were put into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> by the porter—I gave him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>—I went in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> to the corner of Wood-street, near the Cross Keys Inn—Ellis Caspar was not there—when I got to the Cross Keys the porters came and took the boxes out of the <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> and took them into the office—Ellis Caspar was not there when I got out of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I then called another <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> and got into it—the boxes were put in with me, and I drove to the corner of New-street, by the side of the London Hospital, Whitechapel-road, which is the street I live in—I took one of the boxes home—that was the one in the bag—I put it into a closet in nay bed-room—I then came out for the purpose of fetching the other, and as I came up the street towards the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> I met Ellis Caspar—he asked me what I had done with the boxes—I told him I had taken one home and the other was in the <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> would he fetch it—he said, "No, he did not want to fetch it, but I did wrong by bringing the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> so near my own house"—he told me to detain the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> an hour or so to take it to some other place, and take the other box out, and not to take it out so near my own house, as I had done the other, and to bring it to my own house—I had not suffi<lb></lb>cient money to pay the <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> and I went home and got some silver—I then got into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> again, and drove to the iron bridge, Commercial-road—I there discharged that <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> and came back by the omnibus, bringing the box with me—I got down at the corner of Turner-street, which is some little distance from my own house—I carried the box home to my own house, and put it in the same closet as I had put the first—I then went out to attend to my business—I came home about eight o'clock, had tea, and then went to the Earl St. Vincent public-house in the neighbourhood—I had a female servant named Jane Bradley at that time—I was fetched home from the public-house by my servant—on going home I found Ellis Caspar there in my front parlour—he asked me about the boxes, what I had done with them—I told him they were in my bed-room—he seemed very much alarmed—I asked him the reason—he told me that the boxes contained gold, and he told me they must be got out of my place, or something to that effect—he seemed very much alarmed—he desired me to tell my wife to send away the servant—I do not exactly recollect the words he did say—I said I had his assurances that there was no harm coming to me in consequence of what I had done—when he spoke of sending the servant</p>

               <p>away he said the officers were already on the look-out, and he was fearful I should be discovered, so that the boxes must be got out of the way—the servant went away by my desire—my wife sent her away, and I then took him into the back parlour, where my wife was waiting—he said I must leave that house by all means—I told him I could not do that, for I had not given my landlord notice, and there was two quarters' rent due that day—he said I must get away, I must sacrifice every thing, I must go, and I was to meet him the next night, and he would supply me with what money I wanted—the servant did not sleep in my house, but was sent away—I cannot say precisely what time this was, I think it must have been about eleven o'clock—after the servant left, my wife, myself, and Ellis Caspar only remained in the house—there was a fire in the back parlour—I then went up into the bed-room with Ellis Caspar, and showed him where the boxes were—we each carried one down stairs into the back parlour—they were a sort of deal boxes, I think rather darker wood than deal, and larger than that mahogany box—there was a seal on all four sides of them branded into the wood—the lid of one of the boxes was broken open by Ellis Caspar with a chisel which I lent him, to divide the contents as he said, to make it more convenient to carry away—I observed the box was simply nailed together like a packing case—after opening one box I found a quantity of hay, and on removing the hay there was a tin box, smaller a good deal than the outside case—Ellis Caspar said, "As it is so small there is no occasion to divide it, let it be as it is"—the other box was opened in the same way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was done with the outside cases? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Immediately on Ellis Caspar taking the top off the first box he placed it on the fire, and said, "The boxes must be got rid of in that way"—the outside cases were both burnt—Ellis Caspar did not stay till they were entirely burnt—he went away, and took the hay away in his pocket handkerchief, and left the tin boxes there—I took them up stairs into my bed-room after he left—while I was below, and the boxes were burning, I was seized with spasms—I am frequently subject to attacks of that kind—my wife got me some hot water for it—that was at daylight in the morning—it was before I had the spasms that I carried the boxes up stairs—after the spasms had gone I went up to bed—it was daylight—I did not open either of the tin boxes at that time—I opened one of them while my wife was out looking for an apartment in the morning—I found it contained pieces of apparently ore—it had very little appearance of gold—it was various colours—they were round lumps of various sizes, some as large as a moderate sized orange, and others small—I replaced them in the box—I then enclosed each of the tin boxes sepa<lb></lb>rately in brown paper, and put each of them in a separate trunk—I corded one of them because it had no lock—there was a lock to the other—I locked one—I believe the deal box which was not locked belonged to my daughter—that box was corded.</p>

               <p>some directions about them—my sister lived at that time in Petticoat-lane—after giving her these directions, I went to Coventry-court, Haymarket, to the house of Davis, a relation of mine—he is my father-in-law—he married my wife's mother—I went there to be concealed by him—I dis<lb></lb>closed to him what I had done—he has another house in Oxendon-street—he took me to the house in Oxendon-street, and placed me in an upper room there—I remained there from Thursday morning till the following Tuesday morning—after I had been there some time the gold dust was brought to me there—I am not certain whether it was the next day, or the day after—Davis brought it—it had then been taken out of the tin boxes, and was in brown paper—it was placed in a cup<lb></lb>board at the head of the stairs, next the room I was in—I locked the cupboard, and took the key, by Davis's desire, and put it in my pocket—on Easter Monday night, which was the Monday following, Davis came to my place of concealment, with Mrs. Abrahams, the prisoner—Davis told me that my house had been searched, and the gold must be got away, for he expected his place would be searched—Mrs. Abra<lb></lb>hams was present, and they each took a parcel of the gold dust away—the paper in which the gold was wrapped I destroyed myself—I took it off and burnt it in the fire, on the Monday, before they came—they did not take away all the gold at once—they came a second time—I do not know whether it was more than they could carry at once, they came twice for it—they each took some the second time also—I slept to Oxendon-street that night, in the same place—next morning (Tuesday) Davis came to me very early, and in consequence of what passed between us, I went to Brentford—I returned to town the same night—I was told a lodging was to be procured for me—I met Davis that night at Hyde-park-corner by appointment, and he took me to Lincoln's Inn-fields—he left me waiting whilst he fetched Mrs. Abrahams—I think he was gone the best part of an hour—he told me something before he left me—when he returned with Mrs. Abrahams, I said I understood the gold was sold for 2000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I thought it was very little, I told her so—Davis had told me so—she said she did not understand it—that she took all that was given for it, and she had not yet been paid any thing—nothing further passed on that occasion more than that she had not had the means of procuring me a lodging as Mr. Davis had promised—I lodged in a court in Drury-lane that night—Davis got me that lodging—he came to me next morning (Wednesday) and said Mrs. Abrahams had received part of the money—I met him again that night alone—he went somewhere for some purpose, and returned with Mrs. Abrahams—I waited for them in a little coffee shop—I do not know the street exactly, it is in the neighbourhood of the Strand—we all three then went to Peckham in a coach—that was on Wednesday night—when we got there I found a lodging ready for me at a house kept by a person named Fishwick—I staid there from that Wednesday night, till the follow<lb></lb>ing Wednesday week, for a fortnight exactly—during that fortnight I was frequently visited by Mrs. Abrahams and Davis—I remember on one occasion, I think about a week after I was there, going in a coach with Davis, we went to Mr. Robinson's house—I never knew Mr. Robinson before, he was a stranger to me up to that time—when we got to Robin<lb></lb>son's I found Mrs. Abrahams there—nothing was given to me on that occasion—I went twice to Mr. Robinson's, Mrs. Abrahams was there on both occasions—I remember the Sunday before the Wednesday on which</p>

               <p>I surrendered—that would be the Sunday week after I came to my lodging, (the 14th of April)—I went on that occasion again with Davis to Mrs. Robinson's house—that is the second time of which I was speaking—before that time I had given certain information on this subject, on two occasions—up to that time I had not had in my possession any bank-notes connected with this transaction—there was nobody in the coach with me and Davis on that Sunday—I received 15 notes from Davis on that Sunday—Mrs. Abrahams was not present—I had not received any money on account of this transaction before that, but once—that was the sovereign from Davis on the Saturday previous to the Sunday when I went with him in the coach, and that I paid my lodging) with—I had had 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Ellis Caspar, and half-sovereign besides—I had 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. altogether—when I got to Ro<lb></lb>binson's on this Sunday, I produced and delivered the notes to Mr. Robin<lb></lb>son—they were given to me by Davis in the coach going there—I delivered to Robinson all the notes that Davis had given to me—I received them back from Robinson on the following Wednesday, in the passage of the New Inn, in the Old Bailey—that was on the same day on which I surren<lb></lb>dered—I cannot say who was present when I received the notes back from Robinson, he gave them to me in the passage—I do not think Mrs. Abrahams was present—I think she was up stairs at the time—(she was present at Robinson's on the Sunday, when I produced them and gave them to Robin<lb></lb>son)—I observed what notes they were—there was an I O U with the notes—I afterwards handed them to Roe, the officer—(<hi rend="italic">Roe was here called in, and produced the</hi> 15 <hi rend="italic">notes and</hi> I O U)—Davis told me the gold had been sold—nobody was present when he told me that—he told me that when he first met me—(<hi rend="italic">The I O U was here read,</hi>—"l O U 807<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. H.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You went there on purpose to tell Mr. Robinson, and now do not recollect whether you told him or not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I sent the statement to Mr. Robinson in writing—it was very little conversation I had with him about it—I went there to tell him—my object was to be more particular, be<lb></lb>cause I had written the whole account of the transaction to be sent to Mr. Robinson, which was taken to him—there was some negotiation going on at that time, and so I wrote this out—it was taken there by Davis and Mrs. Abrahams together—I recollect perfectly that it was said in Robinson's presence what became of the boxes—it was mentioned that Davis had destroyed the boxes, but about Mrs. Levy was not mentioned in Robin<lb></lb>son's presence—it was mentioned about destroying the boxes, I recollect that perfectly, by Davis.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean to state now it was not stated whether Davis had got the gold from Mrs. Levy or not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That must have been written in my statement—I must have told him that in my writing—I cannot</p>

               <p>recollect that to be the subject of the conversation—we did speak of what had become of the gold.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it not stated that it had been taken from Mrs. Levy? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I remember mentioning the circumstance, but I do not know whether I wrote it—I do not recollect whether I mentioned it in words or not—I wills wear I do not recollect the exact words I made use of—I did not state to Mr. Robinson that the gold had been taken from Mrs. Levy by Davis—Mr. Robinson had been previously instructed on that subject in my writing—I did not go over any part of what I had mentioned in writing—I went to give him a more particular account of the latter part of the business, respecting Mr. Solomon—I dare say I had told him How the gold had gone to Mrs. Levy's—I do not recollect whether I did so at the time I went to give him a more particular account—I will not swear it—I will not swear Mrs. Abrahams was not present in Robinson's parlour when Davis told him he had been to Mrs. Levy's and brought the gold from there—I do not know that it was so, because I never was in Mr. Robin<lb></lb>son's parlour, but when Mrs. Abrahams was present—I will not be positive Davis did not say so in her presence there, but I have no perfect recollec<lb></lb>tion—I cannot swear it—I cannot perfectly recollect that circumstance—I know Robinson was acquainted with the circumstance, but through what means I cannot say—I do not recollect Davis saying so at Robinson's when Mrs. Abrahams was present, not distinctly—I cannot swear it was not said—he may have said so, but I have no perfect recollection—I can<lb></lb>not swear to the contrary.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How many husbands had your wife's mother, because I am told there was a number? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Three, I think—Davis, who has run away—Cohen, who was at my wedding—I do not know the name of the first,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183906170164"></xptr>
               <p>but Lazarus was my wife's maiden name, and he was her father—I never heard that he travelled any great distance—he has been dead some years—I never heard that he went to Botany-bay—I do not doubt that such a thing might be the case—I never knew it—I hardly know How Davis gets his living—I do not know How many houses he keeps—he has more than I am aware of—the house I was hid in I think was a house of ill fame—that was not the first house I went to, but the first house was one of the same kind I believe—I knew that house before—it was not at my own suggestion I went there—it was Ellis Caspar's suggestion—he gave me the paper, and desired me to go—Davis kept that house.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came you to tell me just now that you did not know How he got his living? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe he had various ways of getting his living—I believe a portion of his living was got by keeping brothels—I have not the least doubt in the world of it—I do not know How many he keeps—I knew he kept those I went to, at the time I went there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But it required a note from Mr. Caspar to induce you to go to your own father-in-law's brothels, do you mean to say that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I mean to say I never went there once in three years before—Mr. Caspar desired me to go there to conceal myself, and gave me a note—I kept that note, and handed it over to the officer—I quitted one and went to the other, be<lb></lb>cause he told me I should not be so safe there, as I should be in the other—one house is in Coventry-court, and the other in Oxendon-street—they are very near each other—I do not know that Davis had any other houses but those two—I have been told he had one more—I do not deny it being so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> By the bye, when did you see Ikey Solomons last? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know that I ever saw him in my life to my know<lb></lb>ledge—I have heard of the man—I should not know him if I were to see him—I do not know that I have ever spoken to him—to my know<lb></lb>ledge I never did—if I did it is not to my knowledge now, nor ever was—I never did know him to my knowledge—I have no recollection of the man—he never came to me to employ me in my business as a watch<lb></lb>maker—I did not deface any marks on watches for him, that I swear—I did not expect there was any guilt in this business till my last interview with Caspar—I do not know where I lived at the time Ikey Solomons fled—I do not know what time it was exactly—I remember hearing some<lb></lb>thing of the circumstance—it did not make the least impression on me—my house was never searched on any occasion—it was never searched for Ikey Solomons, nor was any house belonging to me searched for him—nor any house where I lived—I lived in a place called Bevis-marks, at No. 18, I think, but it is so many years ago—it is twelve years ago—my house there was not searched for Ikey Solomons—that I swear.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was your house searched for any thing which Ikey Solomons was suspected of having stolen? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It never was searched—I remember now the circumstance well, if you will give me leave to explain it—there was a person called at my house, when I lived there—I do not know that he was an officer—there were two gentlemen together—they said they had got information I had some stolen property about the house—I took them into my work-shop, and the side room—they looked about, but saw no<lb></lb>thing there, and one gentleman said to the other, "I am perfectly satisfied we have got wrong information"—I do not know that they were officers—I believe one was an officer—I should suppose so—my house was not</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183906170165"></xptr>
               <p>searched, they merely went into the shop—they did not tell me it was for property I key Solomons was suspected of having stolen—they never men<lb></lb>tioned the name—I did not ask them what property they wanted—they merely looked over the shop-board—in fact they did not want to tee so much as I showed them—they merely came in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Just before they came in did you hand any property out of any of the windows? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not—I answer that without hesitation or doubt, because I can recollect—I swear it most distinctly—Mrs. Levy did not live in my house at that time, nor did Mrs. Lewell—Mrs. Almazedo did—I believe she is alive—she was a lady, with two daughters and a son—she was a very respectable lady—I do not know that she is dead, but she was an old lady then—there was no other place but my shop searched—I did not ask them many questions, because they said at once they were satisfied it was wrong information they had received.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you of the Hebrew persuasion? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I have said I was not—I told Mr. Fishwick so, of whom I had the. lodging—it was not true—it is a tenet of our religion to abstain from certain articles of food.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In order to convince Mr. Fishwick that that falsehood was truth, did you eat any of those articles? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I ate at their table—I dare say I ate pork, but I do not know—I ate every thing that was set before me—I do not know exactly what dishes were served up—I said I was no Jew, and ate any thing at their table—he did not ask me if I liked any dish or not—at the first interview I had, he asked me about the diet—he thought I was a Jew by coining with Mrs. Abrahams—I did not eat bacon or pork that I know of—I should consider it sinful to do it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then you can say whether or not you committed a sin? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had no other means of getting provision—I did not eat it that I recollect—I might—I did eat forbidden meat—various meats I had while I was there—every thing that came in my way I ate, whether it was a hind or fore quarter—it made no difference to me while I was there—the bind quarter is forbidden in our religion, but it made do difference to me then.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, Mr. Moss, you have sworn that until a certain time, which you mentioned, you did not suspect there was any guilt? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not—I had suspicions when I was asked to imitate another man's hand-writing—that was a long time before I became alarmed—but my suspicions were lulled by Lewin Caspar assuring me that his friend was a banker, and there was not the least fear that harm could come of it—it never struck me it might be to commit a forgery on the Bank—he told me his friend was to sign the letter himself—it was not his hand-writing I imitated—it was his clerk's. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why imitate another man's writing, you having suspicion it was not right? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I will tell you—I will explain to you again, if you please, How it was I was induced to do so—at the time I mentioned my suspicions Lewin Caspar then showed me a letter which he had received from the same person addressed to him, where a consignment was made to him for 90, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that lulled my suspicions to suppose he was going to commit a forgery.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came you, at the dictation of any one, to imitate another person's handwriting in letters with blanks—can you give any honest reason for doing so? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I cannot—I knew it was wrong, the whole business—I knew it was wrong at the time—he told me he did not wish to be seen at my house—I never suspected to what extent it was wrong—I know it was wrong to some extent—I never knew a robbery was contemplated.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183906170166"></xptr>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Can you give any honest reason for your writing a hand like a banker's clerk at the dictation of a third person? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I can give no honest reason for committing a forgery—it is a forgery I am convinced—I knew it was imitating, but I did not know the intention—I did not think it was an honest intention—I inquired what the intention was, and he said it was to deceive the London clerks only—I should have thought that no harm, if a robbery was not intended—he gave me to understand it was to oblige his friend and not himself—I did it freely—I did not think it fair and honest—I thought a forgery was to be committed—I did it to oblige Caspar's friend.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would you have stolen this gold dust if you thought it was wrong? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I could not have stolen it under the idea that I was doing right—I did not know I was stealing it at the time I took it—I fetched it away to oblige Caspar—I did not know what it was—if I had thought Caspar was employing me to steal it I certainly should not have done it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then why commit a forgery knowing you were committing it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not know at that time what use was to be made of the letters—I knew it was wrong—I did not conceive it to be a forgery, in consequence of my not having made use of any names—I knew I was imitating a handwriting, but I put no signature to the letter—I said just now that it was a forgery, but I was told that it was only to deceive the London clerks—I knew I was imitating.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you know it was a forgery? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Well, I did know it was a for<lb></lb>gery—I have made up my mind to that—I knew a forgery was a criminal thing—I was induced to do it by Mr. Caspar—I would not steal at the suggestion of Mr. Caspar.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then why forge at his suggestion?<hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot give any honest reason for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Give us a dishonest one—come, out with it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Well, my dishonest one was to oblige Mr. Caspar.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not think something was to be got by it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He promised to pay me for it, most distinctly he did.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then to oblige your friend Mr. Caspar you committed a forgery, be having promised to pay you for it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I did it for money—I never said that my only object in doing it was to oblige Mr. Caspar—I did not mean to. convey to the Jury that my only object was to oblige Caspar—I got nothing for the forgery—the forgery evidently did succeed, but I got no money—I am not at all pleased with Mr. Caspar—there was not any stipulated sum which I was to have for the forgery—I was to depend on Lewin Caspar for the reward—I had not the curiosity to ask what the for<lb></lb>gery was about—I was astonished afterwards to find I had been guilty of stealing—I was surprised to find the consequences, as Lewin told me there was no consequences attached to me at all—I had no intention to rob any<lb></lb>body—the letters I wrote did not contain any thing—they were only half sense—I thought there was secrecy in it, but I did not know there was crime—there was no sum mentioned for my imitating the hand-writing—I did not ask if I was to be paid—I was told I was to be paid—it was after I was told so that I committed the forgery—it may have been a month after—it was Lewin Caspar asked what kind of hand I wrote—he might have seen me write, as I was with his father twelve months and better—I was not writing daily in the shop—I sometimes wrote before both father and son.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183906170167"></xptr>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And yet Lewin asked you what kind of hand you wrote? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He did—I do not know that I ever wrote in any books of theirs at all—I wrote on paper—I never wrote in any of Caspar's books.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Pray, Mr. Moss, How many accounts of this transaction did you give to the prosecutor? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know exactly—I gave more than one—they were not all alike—it was with a view to my being admitted as Queen's evidence that I sent in the statement—when I first saw the prosecutor I told them that the statement I was then giving was a true one.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On the oath you have taken was not that just as false as your telling Fishwick you were not a Jew? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, decidedly, I gave that statement intending to deceive them—I was induced to do it—my object was at the instigation of Davis and Mrs. Abrahams to screen them as well as myself—I thought the most of myself—I gave in another statement after that—I do not know How many statements I gave—there were several sent up—I only gave two statements—the one given with my own hand was true, and one I told Mr. De Mole was not true—the first statement I gave in was false—I gave Mr. De Mole another false statement—both those state<lb></lb>ments were false—Mr. De Mole is one of the solicitors for the prosecution—I gave him that false statement to blind him, not to baffle the prosecutor, but to screen these parties and myself—I certainly should not have done it if I had not been implicated myself—I should have had no necessity for it—I sent in the written statement first, and then Mr. De Mole saw me, and I gave him a second statement, which was as false as the first—it was all at the instigation of Mrs. Abrahams and Davis, most decidedly—they per<lb></lb>suaded me to save them and myself—I only gave one more statement—the third was the truth—all of it was truth—I believe every word was the troth—there was not a syllable intentionally, to deceive any body—it was all true—I should suppose nobody could be deceived—that third statement was given in to save myself only.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What! your old affection for Davis and Mrs. Abrahams fled? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had no affection at all—I thought they were my friends, but found they had deceived me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, did you not most solemnly assert to Mr. De Mole that the se<lb></lb>cond statement which you gave him was true? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I did—I believe the verbal statement I gave Mr. De Mole corresponded with my written statement, and that I assured them it was truth—the first statement was contradicted by the second—they were both false—if I said the second statement corresponded with the first it was a mistake—I sent in the first statement as the truth—if I said the second statement which I made to Mr. De Mole corresponded with the first, it was a mistake.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then the second statement contradicted the first? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PHILLIPS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The second was false, and the first was false, yet at he time of giving each you assured the prosecutor both were true? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I have given a third statement to-day—that differs from the other two.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do not you give us the same assurance now that this is true as you gave the prosecutor about the other two? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, because when the first were to be carried into effect I refused to swear to them—I refused to swear to the verbal statements which I made to Mr. De Mole—I thought I had done wrong.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean to swear you only made three statements? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I made</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183906170168"></xptr>
               <p>several statements, and sent them to Mr. De Mole, from the prison—the first statement was sent to Mr. Robinson—I sent one to Mr. Robinson—I was dictated How to word it—Davis dictated it to me—I sent that to Mr. Robinson as the truth—I did not give a second statement in writing—I do not recollect it—I wrote a great many papers—the second statement I wrote I have no recollection of but that I gave it Mr. Buckland, my attor<lb></lb>ney—I have no recollection of sending another statement not through Mr. Buckland—I will not swear I did not send a third false statement.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it not when you were afraid Mrs. Abrahams would turn evi<lb></lb>dence that you made the statement you have now? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I was not afraid at all—I never heard that she intended to turn evidence—the true statement I made was sent from the prison—I sent that in more than a month before the final commitment—I was at all the examinations—Mrs. Abrahams was examined at one of them—I think it was after her exami<lb></lb>nation that I sent in the true statement, but I had mentioned the circum<lb></lb>stance to the gentlemen for the prosecutor in the officer's parlour before Mrs. Abrahams was heard—it was after that that I sent in the written statement—that was done for the sole purpose of saving myself.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, on your oath, do you care who is convicted, provided you are saved yourself? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is not my object—I have acted under the ad<lb></lb>vice of my solicitor, who has told me to tell all the truth and let every one take care of themselves—I was one of those who was to take care of myself.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were not you afraid that Mrs. Abrahams was going to take care of herself when you saw her sworn at the office? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I know nothing of that—I did not see her sworn that I recollect—when she was at the bar as a prisoner I never heard her sworn to my knowledge—I will not say whether she was sworn or not—I remember her being examined as a wit<lb></lb>ness in the police office—I will not swear she was not sworn in my pre<lb></lb>sence—I was not charged at that time—Mrs. Abrahams and I were not sworn on the same book at the same time—I was not sworn till the last examination—I do not remember Mrs. Abrahams being sworn—it was be<lb></lb>fore she was examined that my solicitor told me every one was to take care of themselves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, be good enough to tell us what guarantee we have that you are telling the truth now more than the prosecutor and Mr. De Mole had as to your. other statements? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The only guarantee I believe is I am borne out by other circumstances.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then you do not consider yourself worthy of credit unless your evi<lb></lb>dence is borne out? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Under these circumstances I do not think I am to be believed without it—I think my being a forger is against me—every thing tends to cast suspicion upon me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you not leave that box having a very bad opinion of yourself? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have a worse opinion of myself than you may imagine.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ADOLPHUS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What aged man are you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About 42—I was brought up in St. George's-fields, and apprenticed in Sun-street—I then went to live at Birmingham—I was there about six months, and then came back and worked for Mr. Caspar—I have mostly lived in London—I have been married fifteen years—I was married in the Jewish form—the Jew's Passover corresponds with the Christian's Easter—I am not aware that Jews are much in the habit of visiting each other at Passover times—they eat the passover cake.</p>
               <p>

               <p>commit forgery, and assist in robbery?<hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was conducting business for Mr. Joshua Hyams—I had a salary—I got into debt two quarters' rent, and some other little matters—I keep no shop—I was acquainted with the Caspars before—it was considerably before Christmas that Lewin wanted me to do this—he made a thousand excuses about the forged papers—I had not the least suspicion in the world—I wrote two letters, which were rejected, and then wrote two others, with the paper and ink he supplied me with—the two first were torn to pieces—I had a brass plate on my door, with "Moss, watchmaker," on it—it was Monday night that I burnt the boxes—I sat up all night doing that—in the interval I took off the plate, before it was quite day-light, I recollect that—Mrs. Abrahams came to me at Davis's house on Easter Monday night—I only know of Davis keeping these two houses—he was indicted for one, but I believe he does not keep that house now—I am sure I do not know what other trade be follows—I dare say he may deal in gold and silver—I believe him to be a very bad character—I do not know where he is now—I have not heard from him since he has been away—the last I heard of him was at the police-office, at the first examination or two I think he was there—he was there after I had told the truth, in the Magistrate's parlour—I corrected my statement in the parlour, in the presence of the gentlemen—I saw Davis after I made my full statement in the Justice's parlour—he went to the prison with me in the coach the same evening—he ran away afterwards—it was on Easter Tuesday night that Mrs. Abrahams and Davis met me in Lincoln's Inn-fields—I went to Brentford, to get out of the way, while they procured me a lodging—Davis did not go there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why, you say you did not know you had done any robbery; what harm had you done? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was convinced of it then.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You were doubtful before whether going to another man's house, and taking away valuable property, was a robbery? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not know but what Lewin had authority to do it—it was Lewin's own order—it was Ellis who told me I had been watched and must be careful—he told me so the same night—I had all the property then unbroken in my possession.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why did not you then, when the property was all untouched, and you were implicated as a thief, tell the prosecutors there was their property? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because I was afraid I had gone too far—I knew I had written the letters—I was afraid to do it—it occurred to me afterwards, since that—it did not occur to me at the time—I was under the influence of fear—I heard about the parting with the gold on coming to Lincoln's Inn-fields—my desire in giving the two false accounts was to spare Mrs. Abrahams and Davis, and to screen myself, of course—my wife and sister were not concerned—they were in prison—I thought of saving them most decidedly—I believe you told the Magistrate that I could not be a witness till they were liberated—I have only known Solomon since this transaction—I never knew him in my life before—I put the name of Dean to the letter, as I thought it was the name I was desired to write—I have heard since that Solomon's foreman is named Dean—I never heard it before he was examined—there was a negociation going on by Mrs. Abrahams and Davis before I ever saw Mr. Robinson—the purport of the negociation was not for Mrs. Abrahams to tell what she knew, and bring herself out of all danger—I went with them twice to Robinson's—I do not know the day of the month—it may have been the 11th of April—I afterwards had an interview with Mr. De Mole,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183906170170"></xptr>
               <p>Mr. Hartley, and some other gentleman, I believe, was there—I made a statement there—I had made the statement to Mr. Robinson before that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you, and Mrs. Abrahams, and Davis, went to Robinson's house, did not Mrs. Abrahams say, "I have at last got Moss to come for<lb></lb>ward to you, he will satisfy you with documents who the receiver is?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think she did—I do not know the exact words I made use of—I did not bring the "IOU" with me—Robinson had it before I came—I do not remember saying, "Mrs. Abrahams has brought me to you, I hope I can rely on you as well as her"—I cannot swear I did not say so—I might have said, "Here are the notes, and an 'I O U', given to me by Solo<lb></lb>mon, who bought the gold of me;" but I did not bring the "I O U" with me—I could not have mentioned the "I O U," because I had not got it—Mr. Robinson had it in his pocket-book—I never saw it before I saw it at Mr. Robinson's house—I cannot say who brought it to Robin<lb></lb>son's—he had it when I came into the room—I never had it in my pos<lb></lb>session—I did not say, "Here are the notes and the 'I O U'"—I gave him the notes—I dare say I said I had received them of Solomon, to whom I had sold the gold dust.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you at the same time say, "I hope you will get me made a witness for the Crown?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not recollect ever saying those words—I came there with an understanding that he was to get me a witness for the Crown—I may have said I expected to be made so—I do not recollect the precise words—perhaps I did say so—I cannot say whether I did or not—he had been previously apprised of my intentions—he did not dismiss me, saying I was not to be believed at all—he never said any such thing—he never said, "I don't believe a word you say, you have told me so many lies"—I suppose he had not found me out then—Mr. Robinson was not with me when I saw Mr. De Mole—he came with me in the coach, and Davis and Mrs. Abrahams—Roe, the officer, was waiting there, and Mr. Hartley was there—Robinson and Davis came in a coach from Peckham—I believe an appointment was made the night previous for Mr. De Mole to see Mrs. Abrahams at the London Coffee-house, and take down what she had to say, but I was not present—I never saw Mr.—till I saw him at the police-office—since the last commitment I have had conti<lb></lb>nual communication with him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a messenger in Messrs. Hartleys' office, in John-street, Crutched Friars. On the 25th of March, I remember seeing John Vince with the <hi rend="italic">City of Limerick</hi> papers' box in the warehouse—I saw Lewin Caspar come in between seven and eight o'clock that morning—his usual time of coming was nine o'clock—after the ship's box had been left in the warehouse, Lewin Caspar came in a second time—he opened the box and took the papers out—I received the General Post letters from the postman that morning, and gave them to Wm. Blundell—about ten o'clock that morning, Lewin Caspar told me to go down to the wharf and tell Mr. Bristow not to let the <hi rend="italic">money</hi> go until he (Lewin Caspar) came to the wharf—I delivered that message to Felton, the clerk, as Mr. Bristow was not in the way, and returned to Lewin Caspar at the office.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you not seen him there as early as seven or eight o'clock when vessels were not expected to sail? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He might be there as early, I can<lb></lb>not say—I have not the least doubt I have seen him there at eight o'clock—not frequently—he might be there as often as twice or thrice at that hour—I mean only two or three times in the year and a half—I should be very sorry to swear I had not seen him there ten times—he might or might not—on the 25th of March Mr. Hartley was not in town—the whole management and superintendence of the business fell on Lewin Caspar during his absence—he was the confidential clerk or manager—he was the only man the business rested on—there was a second clerk—every body else there was under him—the business of the office generally commenced at nine o'clock—it opened between six and seven o'clock—I was one of the first there—I remember that it was the 25th of March that he was there. between seven and eight o'clock, because it was the day the robbery was committed—I should say he always showed the greatest anxiety to do what was proper in the business—I have brought him his breakfast to the office several times on mornings that he has been on board ships—I cannot re<lb></lb>member that I have done so on other mornings—I will swear I cannot re<lb></lb>member doing so except on those mornings I have named—I will swear I have not—I have done so when a vessel was sailing—those were the morn<lb></lb>ings to the best of my recollection—I will not say I never did on other oc<lb></lb>casions—I have brought him his breakfast time after time, and especially on those mornings when a vessel was to sail early, but I am not aware; of any other time—I will not swear I have not.</p>

               <p>I mean coming down with a peak to the chin—at the tithe he was in the office with Lewin Caspar he had whiskers—now he has none—they were large whiskers, very bushy at the side, such as you do not often see—I men<lb></lb>tioned about it at the office, not at any other place that I am aware of—I did not give any description of him till I was at the office—there was a great stir in our office when the robbery was discovered—I gave no de<lb></lb>scription of the man till I went to Lambeth-street—I went there by my<lb></lb>self—I was summoned to go by Roe or Lea—I might have had some con<lb></lb>versation with Roe or Lea before I went there—if I had, I cannot recollect what it was—I do not recollect having any conversation with them, but I Will not swear any thing about it—I am not aware that I gave a descrip<lb></lb>tion of the man to Roe or Lea—I will not swear I did not—I might or might not—I cannot recollect that I did, either to Roe or Lea, or any one, till went to the office to state it there, until my statement was taken down by Mr. De Mole.</p>

                  </hi>. I am accountant to the Brazilian Company. I came to the office on Monday morning the 25th of March, at the usual time, about ten o'clock—I know Messrs. Came, merchants, of Falmouth—I have not got by me any advices I received from them previous to that day—no boxes of gold dust, marked "B C 18 and 19," arrived on the 25th of March—we expected them—Mr. March, the secretary, arrived at the office about a quarter before eleven o'clock, and in consequence of some conver<lb></lb>sation between myself and Mr. March, I sent George Carthew to the Dub<lb></lb>lin Steam-packet office to inquire if two boxes of gold, marked "B C 18 and 19," had arrived by the Dublin steam-boat—I remember Lewin Cas<lb></lb>par coming to the bullion-office, at the Bank—I was there—I went to as<lb></lb>certain if the boxes had been delivered at the Bank—I asked Lewin Cas<lb></lb>par what had become of our two boxes of gold dust, marked B C 18 and 19"—he said, "They have been delivered to your house"—I said, "How is that, when they are consigned to the Bank of England by the bill of lading?"—he replied that they had received a letter that morning from Messrs Carne's, of Falmouth, saying, that in consequence of an error in the manifest, they were not to be delivered at the Bank of England, but to the agent of the Brazilian Mining Company in London—I asked him if he knew the name of that agent—he said he did not remember—I asked him if the name was March—he said, "That, I think, is the name"—I afterwards went to the office, in Crutched-friars, and saw Lewin Caspar there—(before that I had been to our office, and ascertained that the boxes had not arrived)—I said, "These boxes have not been de<lb></lb>livered at our house, what has become of them?"—he said, "If you will walk into the office I will show you what has been done with them"—I went in, and he produced two letters purporting to be from Messrs. Came—these are them (Nos. 3 and 4)—No. 4 had the address torn off, and the other was addressed to Mr. Hartley—I called his attention to the one with the ad<lb></lb>dress torn off, and said, "What has become of the back of this letter?"—he hesitated some little time, and then replied, "I don't know whether it was torn off when I got the letter, or whether it has been torn off since"—he did not say who it had been addressed to in any part of the conversation, that I recollect—he called my attention to the signatures of the letters, and asked me if I did not think they were the signatures of Messrs. Came—I said they appeared somewhat similar, and asked him if he knew the handwriting in the body of the letter as coming from Messrs. Came—he said he did perfectly well, having seen it several times—he did not tell me whose writing it was—I said I had never seen it myself—I then looked at the letters more minutely, but made no observation to him about them particularly—I called his attention to the handwriting of the body of both letters, and his observation I understood to apply to both—he gave me</p>

                  </hi>. I am secretary to the Brazilian Mining Company—Mr. George Haythorn is one of the proprietors of that company—there are a great many proprietors. On the 20th of March I received advices from Messrs. Came, of Falmouth, of the arrival of two boxes of gold dust, marked "B C 18 and 19"—the letter of advice does not mention the "B C "but the numbers—they were to come by the <hi rend="italic">Sea Gull</hi>—a subse<lb></lb>quent, advice mentioned the letters "B C" as well as the numbers—it would be known among the shipping people in London that very morning, the 20th of March, that the <hi rend="italic">Sea Gull</hi> had arrived—on the 25th I received further advices from Messrs. Carne, informing me of the transmission of the boxes of gold dust by the <hi rend="italic">City of Limerick</hi>—I never authorised Moss, or any body else, to go to the Dublin Steam Wharf, and make use of my name, to receive them—I did not see this letter (No. 4) before the boxes were gone—the signature to this letter bears a similarity to Mr. Carne's—the hand<lb></lb>writing of the body does not appear to me to be the same, and it strikes me as a very informal, unmercantile sort of letter, which it is very unlikely any merchant should sign—there is nothing else which strikes me—(<hi rend="italic">looking at No.</hi> 3)—I do not think the whole of this is one hand<lb></lb>writing, and it is a letter very unlikely to be signed by Messrs. Carne—my name is wrongly spelt, which Messrs. Carne are perfectly acquainted with, as they are con<lb></lb>stantly in the habit of writing to me, and it designates me as the agent to the Brazilian Mining Company, which is not correct—my name is not correctly spelt in No. 4—my correct designation is Secretary to the Com<lb></lb>pany.</p>

               <p>"London, 23rd March, 1839.—Messrs. W. and E. C. Carne.—Dear Sirs, A most diabolical robbery has been committed here through the means of forging your signatures to two letters; on the other side I send a copy of them, and I beg that you will use your utmost exertion towards disco<lb></lb>vering the perpetrator. The impression is that it must have been done by persons who have had access to your office, or knew of all the particulars as early as yourselves. The letters were posted at Falmouth, 23rd, and arrived with this morning's manifest. Shortly after a gentleman called requesting the delivery of two boxes, marked B C 18 and 19; he showed me a letter, purported to be Mr. Marsh, or from him. I had not the slight<lb></lb>est suspicion, and referred him to the wharf, writing an order for their de<lb></lb>livery. Unfortunately they were handed to him, and it only remains to use every exertion to obtain a clue. Let me beg and entreat of you to show your usual zeal in this matter. Believe me, dear sirs, I am almost heart-broken. Yours, very truly, <hi rend="smallCaps">L. CASPAR."</hi>

               <p>"The man who called at my office appeared about 50 to 60 years of age, grey whiskers, middling stature, very dark complexion, swarthy or very sunburnt, (as an old traveller would appear), has a country dialect, as if from your parts.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When had you first any communication about Solomon? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The first communication we had about Solomon was from Messrs. Bult—it was some time at the latter end of April or the beginning of May, I am not sure which—it was before he was examined as a witness—I remember his being examined at the police-office—he was first sum<lb></lb>moned to the police-office to give an account of the property he had sold to Messrs. Bult—he was examined as a witness and sworn—that was very early in April, I do not remember the day—I believe it was on the 6th, it was on a Saturday I know—I think Solomon's house was searched about a fortnight or three weeks after the examination—it was not searched more than once to my knowledge—I was not there when it was searched at any time—Solomon went about his business after he was first examined—he was taken up, I should say, nearly three weeks after—it was after that that the first negotiation took place about his being admitted as a witness—I never spoke to Solomon in my life—I never spoke to my attorney about his being admitted as a witness—I was not aware that any proposition was made by Solomon—I was not aware that any offer was made of his being made Queen's evidence—I only knew it about three weeks or a month ago, I think about a month ago—I knew it before he was examined the second time as a witness—a few days before—now I recollect it was at the commencement of May, the first three or four, or five or six days of May—I learnt it from Lea the officer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it then agreed on with your consent that he should be admitted? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I gave no consent about it, I left the matter to the discretion of the magistrates—I gave no assent or dissent about it—I left it to the magis<lb></lb>trates and my legal advisers—I heard that he was to deliver up a large portion of the property which he had got possession of—I mean the five bare of gold which he had—they were worth about 2400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., we understood at the time it was near 3000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I believe his house had been searched before that by the officers—I do not know that it was arranged that it should be found in any given part of the house, nothing of the kind was said to me—I know nothing at all about it—I did not even know in what part of London it was to be delivered up, nor any thing about it—at the time Lea communicated to me about Solomon being admitted as Queen's evidence, he did not say any thing about his house being searched again—I am sure of that—I do not recollect it—Solomon was taken into custody some time in April, he was examined as a witness the second time—I do not recollect that he was sworn more than once—he was examined more than once or twice—he was first summoned and sworn when the first conversa<lb></lb>tion took place about Messrs. Bult—he was afterwards in custody and examined as a prisoner, and afterwards he was examined as a witness—to the best of my recollection, that was at the latter end of May, but I am not certain about dates—it was some time after the conversation between myself and Lea—I do not recollect that any one was present when Lea mentioned it to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Lea was the first person that mentioned to you that Solo<lb></lb>mon meant to give up part of the property? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERGEANT BOMPAS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where was it Lea mentioned this to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I really cannot charge my memory with it, we have been so much together</p>

               <p>from the time of the robbery, that I really do not know where it was—it might probably be at my own office in John-street, or it might be at Mr. De Mole's—it made no impression upon my mind—I expected to get the money which Solomon proposed to give up—I do not recollect where it was Lea told me—I never saw Mr. Abrahams, Solomon's attor<lb></lb>ney, except at the police-office—I never spoke to him on the subject—my attorney communicated with him—that was after my conversation with Lea—we had several conversations about the gold being given up—not about Solomon's evidence—I authorised Mr. De Mole to communicate with Solomon's solicitor—I did not authorise him to make the best terms he could with Solomon—I authorised him to make no terms whatever—I authorised him to hear what Mr. Abrahams had to say, but to make Do stipulation whatever about any portion of the property—I did not know of the officers going to search a second time—I have not got the gold dust into my possession yet, nor has my attorney—the officer got possession of it about the first week in May—Lea brought it to the police office—that was not almost immediately after the conversation with Lea—there was considerable time before the property was given up—it was the first week in May I saw it at the police-office for the first time—J did not at all personally interfere, I left it to my professional adviser to do what he thought best—I was under their advice.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Pray have you indicted Mr. Moss for this felony—have you not been before the Grand Jury on a second bill? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have not been before the Grand Jury at all—I do not know that I have preferred an indictment against Moss—I did not know there were two indictments—Mrs. Abra<lb></lb>hams was at liberty when we were at the New Inn, and Moss also—he surrendered himself that day at the New Inn—what then passed implicated Solomon very strongly in the transaction—it was from information which we got from Mrs. Abrahams that we took up Solomon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PHILLIPS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe Moss made several statements? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He did, affecting in each to tell the truth—upon the faith</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183906170189"></xptr>
               <p>of those statements we were about to make him a witness for the Crown—it was considered then, that having made different statements, he could not be fully depended on—the principal part of the statement he made to us at the New Inn was false.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> That was when Mrs. Abrahams was there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PHILLIPS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it not proposed on the part of Mr. Solomons's solicitor, or himself, that he should refund such of the property as he had in his possession, and be admitted for the Crown? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—this was stated openly and publicly before the Magistrate in the police-office, and his consent requested before it was done—the two Magistrates, on the re<lb></lb>presentation of the counsel for the prosecution, gave their full consent to it—at that time Moss was a prisoner, and had not been examined as a wit<lb></lb>ness—it was stated to the Magistrate that the best test that Mr. Solomon was about to tell the truth, was his delivering up the property, so that they could depend upon what he said—it was also stated by the counsel for the prosecution that it was utterly impossible they could make out any case without making some of the prisoners witnesses.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And was it not under a full conviction on all your parts that Moss was not to be depended on, having given such contradictory statements, that Solomon was admitted as a witness? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, but nothing whatever was done until every thing had been stated to the Magistrates, and their consent asked and given, in the presence of the prisoners—the value of the property given up by Solomon is about 2400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I am quite satisfied we could not have gone to trial on the evidence of Moss, unless we had strong corroborative testimony—I think it ought to be strong.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long has Lewin Caspar been a clerk in your house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I only became connected with the establishment in October, 1837—I found him. in the office then—very large quantities of money have passed through his hands in the course of business, frequently from 3000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 4000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month,—I had the highest opinion of his honesty till this transaction—large quan<lb></lb>tities of property, as well as money, have passed through his hands, bullion and specie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have not been able to find Allen? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We have not—I have not been on the look-out for him, nor directed any search for him—I have had no occasion to do so—I do not think it worth while—he absconded without giving me any notice, five or six weeks after the robbery—this transaction had been put in the train of legal investigation long before he absconded—Solomon had been taken up about three weeks before, to the best of my recollection—Allen absconded about a month before Solomon was first summoned to give an account of the property—it was, of course, talked of in the office that Solomon was taken up—on one occasion Lewin, Caspar had specie to the amount of from 130, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 150, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in his care—that was on the 15th of December last—it was a consignment from Fal<lb></lb>mouth—I was in London then, and he went with it to the Bank—Allen was our collecting clerk—he had access to the different offices—we trusted him, or we should not have kept him—I was apprised of this robbery on the 27th, while in Dublin—I came to town on Thursday, and Lewin Caspar was taken up on the following Tuesday—I have no doubt it was publicly talked of in the office before I came, as information was given the very day it happened—I found Lewin Caspar in his situation when I returned from Dublin, and he remained there till he was taken—he went to his own home</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183906170190"></xptr>
               <p>as usual—he was allowed to spend the Sunday as he liked—he could have gone off if he pleased—Good Friday also intervened—he had that day himself also—he might have absconded if he liked.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was Lewin Caspar a clever clerk, and did he un<lb></lb>derstand mercantile business well? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Particularly well—I have seen the two forged letters—they are such as would decidedly have excited my sus<lb></lb>picion—I have neither directly or indirectly received money or money worth on this transaction, except the five bars of gold restored by Solomon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have been asked whether you found Lewin Caspar at his post when you returned from Dublin—did he ever, before or after inquiries had commenced on this subject, suggest or hint to you that there was a person in the world of the name of Moss? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Never—the same course was pur<lb></lb>sued with respect to Moss becoming a witness as was pursued with regard to Solomon—it was the proposition of his attorney, adopted by the prose<lb></lb>cution, and acquiesced in by the Magistrates—it was at the latter end of the examination of one day that Mrs. Abrahams was examined—she was ex<lb></lb>amined from about ten to fifteen minutes, to the best of my recollectioin and she was then handed over to the care of the officer, upon her begging she might not be put into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the inland messengers of the General Post Office in London—all unpaid letters have a circular stamp placed on them, which is kept at the Post Office—the whole of the bags are di<lb></lb>vided into eight divisions, called tables, and each division is stamped by a particular letter—there are four stamps for each division—I have them here.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Look at the London post-mark, with which this letter (No. 3) ap<lb></lb>pears to be stamped? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> This is not the London post-mark—it is a for<lb></lb>gery—the post-mark to this letter (No. 2) is genuine—this letter (No. 3) could not have come through the General Post Office—the post-mark to this letter (No. 4) is also a forgery—that did not come through the Post Office.</p>

                  </hi>. On the 25th of March, I was living in the service of Mr. and Mrs. Moss—since I was before the Magistrate I have been under the care of Lea, the officer—I had lived with them two years, but used to sleep at home with my friends. On the 25th of March, he lived at No. 12, New-street, which is by the side of the London Hospital—Mr. Moss generally went out to work of a morning in a kind of long rough working dress—he used to go out between eight and nine o'clock, or about nine o'clock—on the morning of the 25th of March he went out about half-past eight o'clock—he had not his working dress on then, but a better suit of clothes—he returned between one and two o'clock—he usually gave a double knock, but when he returned this day, only one knock came to the door—my mistress opened the door.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you were before the Magistrate do you remember what you said on that subject—did you say your mistress opened the door? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, there was a mistake in my deposition when it was read over, and I named it to Mr. Humphreys—it said I had opened the door, but I did not open the door—I went to Mr. Humphreys' office and told him of it—my mistress opened the door—I heard my master's voice while I was in the kitchen—Moss did not stay but a very few minutes—he did not stay to din<lb></lb>ner—I made some observations about it at the time—after my master had been gone some time I went out—my master returned about eight o'clock in the evening—he washed himself, and then went to the Earl St. Vincent public-house—about half-an-hour after he was gone, another knock came at the door—it was the elder Mr. Caspar—I let him in—he asked me where Mr. Moss was—I said he was round at the Earl St. Vincent, and I would go for him, I should not be gone a minute—I fetched him home—I staid till half-past eleven o'clock, and left master and the elder Caspar there—Mr. Caspar had been there all that time—I used to come to work in the morning about half-past six o'clock—I came on the Tuesday morn<lb></lb>ing</p>

               <p>about half-past six o'clock—it was my duty to light the fires—I did not light any fire that morning, because it looked as if it had been burning a long while, and they were all white ashes—the fire was then alight—that was in the back parlour—Mr. Caspar was gone then—I did not see him—I examined the ashes—I know wood ashes—it appeared as if wood ashes had been burning there, and one of the hobs was over red sealing wax—there were some nails among the ashes underneath the grate, and some little lumps that looked to me like glass—I do not know what it was—my mas<lb></lb>ter was in bed when I went that morning—my mistress went out directly I came in, she had a bundle in one hand and a basket in the other—when I went away the night before, there was a brass-plate on the door with my mas<lb></lb>ter's name on it, but when I went next morning it was taken off—I know master's sister, Mrs. Levy—my master did not go out on Tuesday till late in the afternoon—he was walking about the place—Mrs. Levy came that Tues<lb></lb>day morning, and in the afternoon a truck came—when my master went out in the afternoon, he did not return any more to New-street—a truck of things went away that day to Mansel-street, and the rest of the things next day—only master moved on the Tuesday—my mistress returned about one o'clock on Tuesday afternoon—she went out again directly she had had her dinner, and returned about five o'clock—on Wednesday morning a van came and took the rest of the things away—I remained there all Tuesday night, help<lb></lb>ing them to pack up—my master has a daughter named Rosetta—she kept her clothes in a deal box—she told me something about that box, when I came there on the Tuesday morning, and in consequence of what she said I looked at the box, and her clothes were in a drawer and not in the box—that is the box they used to be kept in—(<hi rend="italic">looking at one produced</hi>)—that box was underneath the bed in her father's room on Tuesday morning—I looked at it—it was tied up with a cord—from what the girl said to me I tried to lift it, but could not, it was very heavy—that box was taken away in the truck by the carman—I know Mr. Reed—he is the landlord of the house in New-street—they told me about some things going to be pledged, and Mrs. Moss gave me five sovereigns, which I gave to Mr. Reed, the landlord, by her direction—I do not know what rent my master paid a year—I think the five sovereigns was for the quarter's rent—I went to the lodgings in Mansel-street on the Wednesday—I saw Moss there on Wed<lb></lb>nesday evening—he was at home all day on Wednesday in Mansel-street, and he went out in the evening—I was at Mansel-street all day—I know Isaac Davis—Mrs. Moss and Mrs. Levy assisted me in packing up the goods on the Tuesday night, and on the Wednesday morning Davis assisted—I went to the lodging in Mansel-street about seven o'clock on Thursday morning, and saw Moss there—I saw old Caspar there that morning—I opened the door to him about a quarter to eight o'clock—he asked for my master, and master went and spoke to him just in the passage—after speak<lb></lb>ing together old Caspar ran down stairs, and master went out in a very few minutes after—he did not come home to breakfast that morning—I was kept in-doors, and not permitted to leave the house from that Thursday morning until the Saturday evening—I slept there—that was not usual with me—on the Sunday before the robbery was committed, old Mr. Cas<lb></lb>par came to the house in New-street about dinner-time, and staid about half an hour—I had frequently seen him at my master's house before that—on the Saturday after the robbery he came to Mansel-street about dinner<lb></lb>time, one o'clock, and on that occasion my mistress sent me out of the room</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> It was taken down that you said you heard your master's voice say, "Where is the girl?" and you knew it was your master's voice, and you went and let him in? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I never let him in—it was perhaps taken down so, but I did not say so—it was read over to me as if I opened the door, but I did not—I said I knew it was my master's voice, but I did not open the door—I did not let him in—it was taken down that I went and let him in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When was that read over to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About a week ago, I think—it was read over by Mr. Humphreys, at his office—there were some other gentlemen there—it was not read over to me more than once—I was sworn to it a great while ago, but they must have made that mistake at Lambeth-street, because I never let him in—I swore to it when I was first taken to Lambeth-street by the officer—I was not taken up as a prisoner; I was taken before the Magistrate as a witness—that was about two months ago—it was read over to me then, and I swore to it, but the Clerk read so fast I did not notice that when he read it—it was first taken down from my mouth, and read over to me about a fortnight after—I put my cross to it, and swore to it—it was read over to me again by Mr. Hum<lb></lb>phreys, about a week ago—Lea was present—I wanted to correct it then, as I did not open the door—I have been under Lea's care about three months, from a week after the robbery was done.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say the deal box was under the bed; did you pull it out? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I just knelt down and lifted it, I did not pull it out—I cannot say whe<lb></lb>ther it was far under the bed—it was afterwards put into the small room—Moss went to Mansel-street on Tuesday—he went away on the Thursday after he got to Mansel-street, soon after Mr. Caspar, and did not return till Monday—I did not go into the little room till the Thursday afternoon, the first Thursday I was there—I saw the box then—I was at Mansel-street on the Tuesday morning in the next week—I was not there on the Wednesday—I first saw Mrs. Levy there on the Wednesday morning—she came with me—I saw her there on the Tuesday evening, when the truck went—I saw her go away once on Wednesday, and about three times on Thursday.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did she carry any thing away from the box? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know whether it was from the box, but it was out of that room—she went out, and was out about an hour, and then came back again—I saw the box again on Thursday afternoon, and it remained there—it was there on the Tuesday in the next week—I went into the room, and saw it there, on that Tuesday morning—I really do not know whether any body was with</p>

               <p>me—the box remained there all along, and I left it there—I was cleaning the room on the Thursday, and I looked into it, and there was nothing in it then but one dirty muslin frock—the box remained there then—I was not there after Tuesday morning.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ADOLPHUS</hi>. I believe, when I first saw you at Lambeth-street, Mrs. Moss and Mrs. Levy were in custody. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I do not recollect whether Mr. Moss was in custody or not then—Mrs. Moss and Mrs. Levy were not in custody the first time I was there—I had been examined two or three times then—I cannot say How long the last ex<lb></lb>amination was after the first—it might have been a fortnight—I think my deposition was read over to me at the last examination—I do not know when it was taken down—Lea did not tell me there was a mistake—he never named it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came you to go to Mr. Humphreys. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Why, it was so long, and I was afraid I should forget it—the time being so long, I wished to have it read over again—it was only read over to me once at the office—I dare say that was a month before I went to Mr. Humphreys—I was afraid something might escape my memory—I really do not know whether Mr. Moss was in custody when I was examined—I saw him in the dock once—I saw him at Lambeth-street—I did not see him anywhere else—I have seen him, since I was examined, at the Flying Horse—I really do not know whether Lea was with him at the time or not—I do not know whe<lb></lb>ther it was once or twice I saw Mr. Moss at the Flying Horse—I do not know whether Lea was in his company on any of those occasions—I think he was by—I cannot say he was there, hut I do not know whether he was in the room with Lea—the Flying Horse is the public-house close to the police-office, where the policemen go.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I suppose, from the time you first went there, you have had no conversation with Lea or Roe about your evidence. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Lea came in one morning, and I said, "Mr. Lea, I am so frightened I shan't keep it in my memory," and asked him if he would take me to have it read over—I was not at the office when my master gave his evidence—I have never been in the office only when I had to give my evidence—my evidence was given as against my mistress and Mrs. Levy.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, and live at No. 3, Meeting-house-lane, Peckham. I have known Alice Abrahams many years—she came to my house last Easter Wednesday, in the forenoon, and wished to know whether I could make it convenient for a person to come and lodge with me, whether I could accommodate them with a bed and lodging—she did not say who it was—she asked me if I could accommodate a person there, a particular friend of hers—I said, "Is it a male or female?"—she said, "It is a male"—I asked her if every thing was honourable—she said I might depend on it, that it was—I told her if my wife was as agreeable as I was I had no objection—I had no lodger at the time—I asked if it was any person I knew, knowing all her family so many years—she said, "No, it is not"—she said his circumstances were rather embarrassed, and he wished to be there two or three days, until his creditors could meet, and compromise the business—my wife was at that time attending a lady in the village in her accouchement—I told her she might see my wife, it was on her road home, and I would take her down there, and she might speak to her—I went with her to my wife, but what passed between them I do not know—it was at the lady's door—I was not exactly near enough to hear, but my wife came over and said, if the person could make it convenient with me till she returned home, she had no objection—Mrs. Abrahams said, "None of my family know it, and I don't wish them to know it"—she went away, and returned again the same evening, in company with two gentlemen—one was Mr. Moss, and the other a gentleman—I do not know his name—(<hi rend="italic">Moss produced</hi>)—that was one of the persons—he was left behind, and slept at my house that night—Mrs. Abrahams and the</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer of Lambeth-street office. On the 25th of March the prisoner, Lewin Caspar, came to me at that office, at near three o'clock, to inform me of a robbery which had taken place at Messrs. Hart<lb></lb>ley's—he showed me these two letters (<hi rend="italic">Nos.</hi> 3 <hi rend="italic">and</hi> 4)and described to me the way in which the robbery had been effected—by desire of Mr. Hard<lb></lb>wick I went with him to the Dublin steam-wharf—he staid with me there</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183906170202"></xptr>
               <p>a short time—he then said he thought he could be of no more assistance to me—I then went with him to the office in John-street—he there pro<lb></lb>duced four or five letters out of a drawer, and asked me my opinion of the writing—he had them in his hand—he said, "Do you not think the writing is very much like these?"—I said, "No, certainly not"—he then asked me what I thought of the signature of Messrs. Carne, and on compar<lb></lb>ing it with the other letters, I said they appeared very much alike, certainly—he said it was principally on the faith of that signature that he had given the order to the person who brought the letter in the morning—I asked him the description of the person—he said he was about sixty yean of age he thought, and a little taller than himself, dressed in black, and grey hair and whiskers—he said it was a person that came from Mr. March, but whether it was Mr. March or not he did not know—nothing more passed at that time—I went away shortly after—about eight o'clock that night I was at the Swan with Two Necks, making inquiries about this matter, and the two Caspars came there together in a coach—the mail leaves the Swan with Two Necks a few minutes before eight o'clock, I believe—it was gone when they arrived—I spoke to them, and told them they might perhaps overtake it at the railroad station, and I went with them in a coach, but we arrived too late—that was with a view to Lewin Caspar's going down to Falmouth about this business—he stated to me himself, in his father's presence, that he meant to <hi rend="italic">go</hi> to Falmouth to look after it—I think his father was not to have gone with him—his father went all the way to the railroad station—we returned in the same coach when we found we were too late—as we returned the elder Caspar left the coach, to the best of my belief and recollection somewhere about Charging-cross—I cannot say exactly, for I did not notice.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it said for what purpose he should leave the coach? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Young Caspar said some bills were to be printed on the following morning about this matter, offering a reward of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said Mr. Allen and Mr. De Mole were to have them printed—I said I should like to see Mr. De Mole and Mr. Allen before they were printed, and upon that Lewin Caspar told his father to go to Mr. De Mole about it—it was for that reason he left the coach—Lewin Caspar only went with me to the steam-wharf that day to take inquiries—in the evening he went with me to St. Paul's coffee-house, to inquire if any person had come by the Falmouth mail—I had been there before in the early part of the day—we went to see if a person had come, answering the description Lewin Caspar gave of the man, sixty years of age, with grey hair and whiskers—we heard of a person who appeared to answer the description—Lewin Caspar said he thought the description given by the proprietor of the coffee-house, resembled the person very much—he described the person as having grey hair, and about the height and age—there were one or two waiters, and the landlord—three persons had arrived that morning from Falmouth, and this descrip<lb></lb>tion was given of one of them—Lewin Caspar said it appeared to corre<lb></lb>spond—he said nothing to me about that house at that time; but a day or two after he said he thought I could not do better than stick to the per<lb></lb>sons at that coffee-house—I saw him on two or three occasions after, and he asked How I was getting on—three or four days after, I succeeded in tracing the <hi rend="italic">cabs</hi> to New-street, and was led to a house in which the wit<lb></lb>ness Moss was stated to have resided—I think it was No. 1—it was the first house on the left side—I have never been there with Moss—I saw</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did Blundell give you any description of the man who took away the boxes? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> To the best my recollection he could give very little description of him—I believe he did give some description—I remember he could speak very slightly of him, in fact I asked every one of the clerks—as for as my recollection serves me, Blundell gave a very slight description of the man, but he did give a description that he was dark, tall, and so on—I had seven or eight descriptions from different clerks there—some described him as one sort of man, and some as another sort—I had seven or eight differ<lb></lb>ent descriptions of him from persons, the greater part of whom were con<lb></lb>nected with Mr. Hartley's wharf and office—I think Blundell said he thought the man had grey whiskers, but he would not speak distinctly on it—I particularly asked him that—he certainly said he thought the man had grey whiskers—he did not give me that description of the man before Lewin Caspar gave me any description at all—that I swear positively—Lewin Caspar had mentioned about the grey whiskers to roe before I saw Blundell at the office—Blundell's description corresponded with Lewin Caspar's as to the whiskers, but not as to the person—Blundell did not describe the man's age at all—I did not ask him—I do not recollect that any thing passed between us respecting the man's age—I do not recol<lb></lb>lect what he said about the man's age at all—I will not swear he did not describe him as about sixty years of age—I spoke to half a dozen clerks about it, and I cannot recollect—I spoke very little to Blundell about it at all.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my brother as goldsmiths and dealers in bullion, in Cheapside.

Robarts, on account of two bars of gold, which we had bought of him on the 2nd of April—we had bought the gold of Solomon, but his eldest son Selim brought it to us, as he had been in the habit of doing—the weight was 408oz. gross—we have a correspondent named Emerique, of Paris—in purchasing bul<lb></lb>lion the object of the party is to turn it into money directly—we seldom keep it above a few hours if we can dispose of it—it depends on the state of foreign exchange—we shipped these bars of gold to Emerique, of Paris, I think on the 5th of April—I had in the meantime made a com<lb></lb>munication to Mr. De Mole, in consequence of what. I had heard of the loss of the gold-dust—I made the communication the same day I received the gold, before I sent it away—when gold is once melted, if it is amalga<lb></lb>mated with copper or any thing, it will entirely alter the colour, which would prevent it being identified—the alloy will alter the colour—the colour depends on what it is alloyed with—I have two assay papers—(<hi rend="italic">marked</hi> 12 <hi rend="italic">and</hi> 13)—they came from Mr. Johnson, the assayer, in the ordinary course of business—it is the custom to take a little piece off to assay gold—I did not pay the balance for the gold on the same day the 1200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque was paid—we had an order not to pay the balance—Edward Clark, our clerk, had paid some money to Solomon on the 2nd of April on account, but not in my presence—there were two payments made on the 2nd of April to Solomon—I do not exactly know whether it was on the 2nd without my books, which my clerk can produce to-morrow—the payments were all made by my clerk—he can prove these things to-morrow—he is not here—this is the cheque for 1200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—(<hi rend="italic">marked No.</hi> 11.)</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> After your son Isaac had taken what you sent to Cock and Johnson, did you receive a communication also from them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I saw Mr. Cock myself—he made a communication to me about the gold on the Thursday—I afterwards sent my young man (Dean) to them—I think that was on the Friday—I was afterwards summoned to give an account of this matter at Lambeth-street—I received a summons on the Friday night to appear on the Saturday, to the best of my recollection—that was the Friday in Easter-week—I had my attorney with me when I attended—it was Mr. Plumtree on that day—you put some questions to me, and after some answers which I gave I declined answering any more questions—the magistrate let me go—on my receiving the summons on the Friday, before I went to the magistrate, I sent my son Isaac to the prisoner Moses' house—he brought me back a message from Moses—on the Saturday when I went before the Magistrate I gave directions to my son Selim, and Dean, about money, and in consequence of those directions I got back six £100 notes, and 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in £5 notes, of the money I had paid Mrs. Abrahams, the self-same notes—I got them changed for sovereigns—I got rid of them—I paid some in to my bankers, and got change for them as well as I could—I had given my son Isaac directions on Easter Tuesday to get money for me—I sent to Cock and Johnson's the bars—I sent in other directions for money, to more than one, two, or three places—I know Mr. Woolf, a tailor in Regent-street—he is a nephew of my wife's—I sent to him among others—I told my son Isaac to go to him, and he brought me 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in notes and sovereigns.</p>

               <p>stolen plate—I was told then that I ought to have been in the dock, but allow me to explain: a regular dealer I had known for years by the name of Lau<lb></lb>rence, well known in the trade, came to my shop one morning, and produced some plate—he asked me for that plate 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. peroz.—I offered him for that plate 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. an ounce—he would not take it, and was going with it to the next neighbour of mine, Mr. Warner, a silversmith in the Strand—I sent for him back again, and offered him 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it—he would not take that—there being some articles among them which I wanted, (I should not have given that price at any other time, but there being two Or three articles I wanted) I gave him 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. an ounce for it—some few days after, to the best of my recollection, my young man came home and said he had seen a bill at Messrs. Bult's with a description of this plate, saying it was stolen by a town-traveller of Mr. Lias; that it had been absconded with by a town-traveller of Mr. Lias, the same plate that I had purchased—he discovered that it had been stolen—we sent immediately to Mr. Lau<lb></lb>rence to give him information of it—he, in his turn, went to Mr. Lias, and gave the information himself who he had bought it of, and sold it to me—we gave the information from our house to Mr. Laurence, and he went and told Mr. Lias—we had no business to inform Mr. Lias—we told the man we bought it of—I gave evidence in the other Court when the case was tried there—I was told by the Judge that I ought to have been placed in the dock, and tried—he told me I was a lucky man not to be placed in the dock—that was in answer to a question I asked—I asked who the plate was to be given to, to the best of my recollection—I did not ask if I was to have it, to the best of my recollection—be did not say I was lucky in not being tried for receiving stolen goods—he said, "You are a lucky man not to be placed in the dock;" but I beg to tell you I was then going to give the explanation to the Judge of our having given information in the first instance of it; and he said, "There is no im<lb></lb>putation on you, Mr. Solomon"—it was Mr. Sergeant Arabin, I think, tried the case—I do not know that I was complimented by the Counsel—the case was tried at night, and, in the confusion, asking about the plate, that observation did pass in the Court, and it was the general impression in the Court that the Judge mistook me for Mr. Laurence—it was night before the case was finished—I do not mean to swear it was night—I know there were lamps alight—since then Mr. Laurence has paid me back at the rate of 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. an ounce, in bills at two, six, and nine months, which bills I have sent, with some others, to Ransom's, the bankers—he gave me the bills with the rate of five per cent, interest.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What time in the day on the 2nd of April, Easter Tuesday, was it that Mrs. Abrahams came to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> To the best of my recollection, it must have been about a quarter before twelve o'clock—I cannot exactly remember the time—I have known her some few years, not by dealing with her, or her with me—perhaps I have very seldom, but I have been to the bar, and taken some sherry—I do not suppose it was a dozen times—it was at her father's house, where she served—I was very much alarmed when she brought me the 110 ounces, when I saw there was a quantity of it, because I had previously told her father only to send thirty ounces—I do not know that I never intended to buy more than thirty ounces—I certainly did not expect more than thirty ounces when I told him at first—I did not expect to have more than the thirty ounces at first; but when she</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183906170214"></xptr>
               <p>brought it me I was very much alarmed—I found I had got into it, and I suspected this was the gold that was lost—the gold I heard of that was stolen—the gold dust.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And then you desired her to bring you some more? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She went away to bring more—I did not desire her to bring more—it was when I saw the 110 ounces that I was alarmed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then you thought it was the gold dust that was stolen, and after that paid her the money, and agreed that she should bring more? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She said she would bring more—she swore an Hebrew oath, that she would never divulge it—I did not swear too—she did not take an oath from me that I would not divulge it—I had no idea of taking an oath to her—we did not take each other by the hand—she seized my hand—she swore, I did not—it was after that, all the rest of the gold came.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you then any doubt whatever that you were buying the gold that was stolen? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I suspected it was the gold—I suspected it was that gold—I believed it was that gold—I went on receiving it—she brought me the rest—I did not become quiet and easy about it—unfortunately I have not been out of a state of agitation since.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you say you were in for it, why did not you give her back the gold before you paid her, if you believed it was stolen? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because I had done so—I was unfortunately in it, and felt unhappy all the time—the had previously sworn to me in a very pitiful manner that she would new divulge that I had melted it for her—I do not generally keep a furnace alight in my back-room—I do not recollect whether I lit it on purpose for her—the furnace was burning, and I put the crucible on—the fire was already burning—I paid her 330<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at first—I paid her the 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the course of the afternoon—I cannot tell exactly the time—I did not pay attention to the time—to the best of my recollection it must have been between three and four o'clock—it was about that time to the best of my belief—I gave her the 330<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the morning—it must have been before twelve o'clock to the best of my belief—I should say it would take about half-an-hour to turn the gold into a bar in my furnace—I had not received all the gold from Mrs. Abrahams before I paid her the 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was after I had received the third lot that I paid her, to the best of my recollection—the 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was not paid on the second occasion, it was after the third melting—I melted two or three times after that—I do not know whether my son Isaac was there all day—he was not in the back shop—he attends to the front-shop—he was not in the back-shop that day to my recollection—I do not recollect, upon my honour—I do not mean to say he did not see what was going on—I do not recollect his coming into the back-shop at the time—I do not remember his coming into the back-shop at all—I will not swear he was not there, but I do not remember his coming in there at all—my son Selim was certainly not there, for he attends to the shop in Coventry-street—he was not in the Strand at all on Easter Tuesday to my know<lb></lb>ledge, to the best of my recollection he was not—I do not mean to swear it, I say to the best of my recollection—I saw my son Isaac up in the drawing-room that day, when he brought me the 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the banker's—to the best of my belief he was present when the 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid—yes, he was—I recollect it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Of course he knew what it was paid for, and all about it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That I do not know, I am sure—nothing took place in his presence about it—he only told me he had been to the Bank of England and got the 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183906170215"></xptr>
               <p>and 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note changed, which he had received from Williams, Deacon, and Co.—he told me that in the presence of Mrs. Abrahams—I did not direct him to get the notes changed when he received them—he got them changed at the Bank of England himself—he thought perhaps it might be more convenient to me—he had no other reason for going—if he had thought I was doing wrong, perhaps he would have brought all sovereigns—I told him to go to Cock and Johnson's and get the money, but did not tell him what for or for whom, to my recollection—I did not to my recollection tell him what for—I swear to my recollection I did not—I merely told him to go and get me this money—that is all I remember—I do remember telling him that, but not for whom—to the best of my recollection he was in the front shop at the time I told him to go to Cock and Johnson's with the bar—to the best of my recollection I went into the front shop and gave him the bar to take—I cannot state it in any other way—I gave it to him in the front shop to the best of my belief—I am almost certain I did—I did to the best of my recollection or belief, I can say no 'more—I will swear to nothing but what I am positive downright to—to the best of my firm belief he was in the front-shop when I gave it to him—I cannot give any other answer—there was nobody present that I recollect when I gave it to him—I do not remember seeing any one present—I was so agitated in the busi<lb></lb>ness that I did not notice whether any body was present or not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> As I understand you, you did not at all suspect, till you saw the 110oz. but that it was perfectly right? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I did previously suspect it, before she came I suspected it was all wrong, that there was something wrong about it, when Moses said, "Remember, you do not know me and I do not know you"—I do not remember saying that I did not suspect any thing till I saw the 1100oz. instead of 30oz.—I felt alarmed at its being that, it might have been a further confirmation in my mind, but I had a previous suspicion of it—I suspected that it was the gold that was lost.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not ascribe your suspicion to its being 110 <hi rend="italic">oz.</hi> instead of 30? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, very likely I did; but I previously-suspected it—I sus<lb></lb>pected before she brought the gold that it was the gold that was stolen—I suspected it—I can say no more.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you believe before Mrs. Abrahams brought it, that she was going to bring the gold that was stolen? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I suspected it was—I cannot answer in any other way—I suspected it was the gold lost—I was in great alarm when it came—I was alarmed before she came at all—I did not give it a thought before she came the first time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why, you say you suspected it before she came at all? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I suspected it, but I was under no alarm, because I had done nothing yet—I felt no alarm as I had had nothing to do with it—she went into the back shop with me when she came, pulled out the gold, and we melted it there at once—there was no one in the back shop with me at first—my servant, Dean, came in at the latter end of the melting of it—I melted it myself the first time or two—I put it into the crucible with my own hands—to the best of my recollection, Dean came in at the latter end of the melting—I have no doubt at all of his being there at the time I was melting the first parcel of gold—it was at the latter end of the first parcel, to the best of my belief—he assisted me in melting the first 110oz.—it was at the latter end of the melting, because I had sent him previously into the City—he was there when the 110 oz. were being melted—to the best of my recollection, he came at in the latter end, just as I had nearly finished—I</p>

               <p>had sent him to Cock and Johnson's, and Messrs. Bult's—he was gone an hour or two—he left after eleven o'clock—I received all the gold the same day—all that I received—all that I had to do with, was melted—I do not know whether I bad all which is the cause of the pending inquiry—all the gold that I received I received that day, between five and six o'clock in the evening to the best of my recollection—it must have been about that time—after Dean returned, he and I melted it together.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then did Dean assist in all the meltings? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">SERGEANT BOMPAS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you put the rest into the crucible, or did he? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We did it together—my son Isaac was attending in the front shop—I do not know whether he was there all the time or not—all the gold was melted in Mrs. Abrahams's presence—each melting took from half to three quarters of an hour—about half an hour to the best of my recollection—as soon as it was melted she went away to fetch some more at each time—the last parcel was brought, I think, between five and six o'clock, to the best of my recollection, but I did not notice the time—the time it was finished, was between five and six o'clock, the time she went away last—it was early in the afternoon that I sent Isaac out—I do not remember sending any body else out that afternoon—I have no recollection of it—I do not know whether I did or not—it was about three or four o'clock in the afternoon that I paid the 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and after the third melting—there were two or three meltings afterwards—Mrs. Abrahams came next morning (Wednesday)—I think it must have been between twelve and one o'clock—I cannot say exactly the time, because I did not pay attention to it, but it was between twelve and one o'clock, or about one o'clock—the bars which I sent to Messrs. Bult were melted on the Wednesday morning—I am certain of that—it was not on the Tuesday—I mean the re-melting—Mrs. Abrahams saw the original melting, but this was the re-melting—the gold was all re-melted on the Wednesday morning, except the bar sent to Cock and Johnson's, and a bar of 70 oz. melted on Tuesday—I sent two bars to Messrs. Bult, which I melted on the Wednesday morning—that is what I put some copper into—that was all I put in, to the best of my recollection—the copper I put in myself and my servant Dean—I was afterwards summoned and went before the Magis<lb></lb>trate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was what you swore then true or false? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not swear there true—it was false—I think it was to some question about some 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes that I objected to answer' any thing more to, to the best of ray recollection—I was not thinking all the time, but I swore falsely to protect myself certainly—I was not thinking all the time I was questioned—I swore falsely to screen myself.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did it occur to you that it was against you, or in relation to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It did when I saw her there—I paid no attention to what passed—to the best of my recollection, I think I heard my name mentioned; but I do not recollect what passed—to the best of my recollection, I mean to swear, I did hear it—I cannot say positively whether I did or not—I was in such a state of dilemma that I did not see or hear any thing of what passed—I did not pay any attention—she might have mentioned my name—Mr. Abrahams, my attorney, is no relation to me or my wife—neither him or his wife—his wife is not my niece—Abrahams's wife and Mrs. Woolf are sisters, and Woolf is a nephew of my wife's—to the best of my recollection I heard Mrs. Abrahams mention my name—I will not swear she did not mention it—I rather think, to the best of my belief she did—I hardly have a doubt about it—my solicitor came to me while I was in prison, and I made a communication to him—he took a statement from me in writing—I suspected it was for the purpose of being communicated to the attorney for the prosecution—I believed that it was for that purpose—he suggested it to me first, to state the whole of the truth—I gave my statement to Mr. Abrahams, and told him I wished to make every reparation which laid in my power—he suggested it to me, and I agreed to it—I was very happy to do so, to make every reparation in my power, and to tell the whole truth—it was impressed upon my mind to tell the truth—I sent that statement before any communication was made to me that I was to be Deceived as a witness—Mr. Abrahams came and took my statement, and I said that statement—I do not know what day it was—it was a long while before I was examined as a witness—I cannot at all tell How long—it was longer than a week, I will swear that; and, to the best of my recollection, it must have been a fortnight too—I knew where the gold was at that time—I had no communication with Dean from the tune I made that statement till I was admitted as a witness, neither directly nor indirectly—I was in prison, and had no communication with any one but my solicitor—I sent no message to him, nor to my sons—I had nothing but through my solicitor—he talked to me about the business of the lease of my house, and I desired him to attend to it for me—I got rid of the lease of my house in the Strand—that was not done in case I should not be a witness, for this has ruined me altogether—I do not recollect whether it was before I was admitted as a witness that I got rid of my house in the Strand—I do not remember—I got rid of it, because I never could live in it any longer after this transaction—not that I might be prepared for my trial, and that no<lb></lb>body should take it—I believe it is now sold to a person in King William-street—I have not troubled my head with my own affairs—</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You had the gold in your house at that time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I gave it to my servant Dean to take care of—I gave it him the morning after we melted it, when I received the message from Messrs. Bult—I gave it to him to take care of—to put away—I either gave it him, or told him to take it out of the iron chest—I was agitated and alarmed about it—I gave to him to put away—to put it out of the way—I did not use the word con<lb></lb>ceal—I gave it him to take it out of my sight—I did not see where he took it—my house was not searched before I was taken up—I do not know whether it was after I was taken up—I did not ask Dean where the gold was before I went to gaol—I only gave it him to take care of to put it out of the way—I believe he is my servant still—the gold was in my iron chest—I kept the key of it at the time—my son Isaac had nothing at all to do with taking care of any part of the property, only Dean—I only sent Isaac with a bar to Cock and Johnson's—he attended in the front shop.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was he trusted in respect of your property generally? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He is my son—he did all things I wished him to do—Dean only had the care of this property—before that I locked it in my iron chest myself—I kept my papers and deeds and coin in that iron chest—I put bowls of coin there of a night—there was no other melted gold there, to the best of my recollection—I am a general dealer in gold and silver, a bullion dealer generally—my son Selim had nothing to do with the shop in the Strand at that time—I sent for him on the Wednesday morning—he had</p>

               <p>very little indeed to do with that shop—he might come over occasionally, but very little indeed—he had the entire management of the shop in Coventry-street—my daughter had nothing at all to do with the business—she never interfered in it at all.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ADOLPHUS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Let us understand you rightly, you had two shops at the time of the transaction, one in the Strand and one in Coventry-street—the shop in the Strand is where the fire is ready, and the crucibles prepared? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Where the gold was melted—it is the place of business—the crucible was ready, unfortunately, at that moment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> It was merely accidental that the crucible was ready, it was never so before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Never, to my knowledge—I have been twenty-five years in business—Moses came to me in the morning, and said he had gold dust to sell—I said I would not receive more than thirty ounces—I had not dealt with Moses before for gold—I had dealt with him for spirits—I did not ask where he got the gold—I got 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. an ounce for the gold—that is standard—it contained silver and sulphur at first—I cannot tell what I got for it, because it was mixed with other gold—the gold contains silver and sulphur.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is not the gold dust coming from the Brazils in the highest state of perfection? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, not in the highest perfection, it requires a process to make it pure—I do not know whether it is in the purest state when it comes from abroad—it comes in different prices—it varies in price, and cannot be quite pure—alloy is used to it afterwards to make it workable—I had beard there was gold dust lost before Moses came to me—I heard that it had been stolen—I asked no questions of Moses—I was astonished when Mrs. Abrahams came with the 110 ounces instead of thirty, and I was sorry I had got into it—I had melted it and weighed it before J discovered there was 110 ounces—I could tell, without melting it, that there was more than thirty, ounces, because I made the observation that she had brought more than her father intended—I did not say, "Take it away," nor did I say, "Come again with as much as you please."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Pray did either of your sons see any thing of the transaction of that day, when Mrs. Abrahams was there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> My son Isaac saw her come in, to the best of my recollection, in the morning, the first time she came with the gold—he did not go with her into the back shop, he remained in the front shop—I do not recollect whether any body else was in the front shop—when Mr. Moses came in I was attending to two or three persons—I do not know who they were—in a public shop I cannot tell people—none of them are here—I received the summons to attend before the Ma<lb></lb>gistrate on the Friday night, three days after I bought the gold—I at<lb></lb>tended, and was examined—what I then swore was false—I was not thinking at the time, and did it to screen myself—I knew it was wrong—I signed my name to it—I did not consider it willful and corrupt perjury—I did not swear to injure any body, but to screen myself—I was not think<lb></lb>ing at the moment—I am very sorry for it—I feel great remorse and sorrow for it—I am satisfied I swore wrong, but I did not think it was wilful corrupt perjury at the time—I regret it very much—my conscience has told me I ought to regret it—I saw Mrs. Abrahams at the office, while I was at the bar in custody—I am sure I do not know How far I was from her when she was being examined—I should think I was as far as I am from the foreman of the Jury now—but I cannot remember such trifling things—I was as far from her as I am now.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Upon your oath was she not interrogated by the Magistrate in a clear</p>

               <p>voice, and did not she give her evidence in a clear tone? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not pay attention to it, I was too agitated—the magistrate did not ask me if I had any questions to put to her to my recollection—I was attended by counsel, and I left it to my counsel—Mr. Plum tree attended as my attor<lb></lb>ney in the first instance, and Mr. Abrahams next—that was when Mrs. Abrahams was examined, but I do not know what passed—I have been detained in custody ever since till now—I have never been out—neither of my sons or Dean have been to see me while I have been in custody—I did not know where they were—I did not know whether they were in England—I have no reason to believe or suppose that they went out of the way and went abroad—I did not write to them and desire them to come back and be witnesses with me at the police-office—I left it in the hands of my soli<lb></lb>citor—I believe Dean is still living in the service of my family, carrying on my business in Coventry-street—I have not taken any other house to carry on business in—they have, I believe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Who are they? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know I am sure—I do not know where the house is—I do not know whether it is in Hanway-yard—I have heard that some one has taken a house for them—I do not recollect the person's name—he does not act for me—I have been in prison ever since, and have had no communication—I do not know who has taken the house or where it is—I have been in prison, and have not troubled my head about it—I do not know that it was my brother-in-law, Mr. Rees, that took it—I have every reason to believe it is not, or I should have heard it—I do not know who is the owner of the house in Hanway-yard—it is not my brother-in-law—he has no houses there—he did live in Hanway-yard before I went to prison—he lived there in a house of his own—my wife and family have not taken his house—they have taken a house there, but not his house.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Pray How long was it after Alice Abrahams was examined that the remorse struck you, and your conscience began to work? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Directly after I had bought the first gold—I would have made reparation and told the truth if I could have got out of it then—I did not like to expose myself that I was in it—it was about a week or ten days after Mrs. Abrahams was examined that I made the disclosure—it might have been a fortnight—my conscience had begun to work before that—I only sent one statement—I was examined privately before the Magistrate once, and then. Mr. Hardwick told me I must consider that statement was a vo<lb></lb>luntary statement, and that was the way I gave it—it was drawn up in writing by my solicitor, and my signature was attached to it—it was the substance of the truth that I was to swear to—I swore to it afterwards be<lb></lb>fore the grand jury, not before the Magistrate—I do not remember swearing to it before the Magistrate—I gave it in—they considered it a voluntary statement—I did not swear to that statement before the Magistrate—I was examined by the Magistrate after I gave that statement in—I was ex<lb></lb>amined afterwards on oath before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was that statement of yours put in and sworn to, or did you swear to some other matter which was taken down by the clerk? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was sworn to what I am stating now—I swore to all the questions the counsel put to me, and that was the truth—my solicitor wrote down the statement as I stated it to him—he drew it up from my dictation—he wrote it down, and at the same time told me not to add a word more or less, and to tell nothing but the truth and the whole truth—I cannot say whether that same paper was read before the Magistrate, or whether he copied</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183906170221"></xptr>
               <p>it before he gave it to the Magistrate, but I know it was read before the Magistrate, and brought to me to sign—I believe a gentleman now on the bench, Mr. Hardwick, and Mr. Clarkson were present in the private room when I made this statement—I do not recollect seeing Lee and Roe there—Mrs. Abrahams was not there—I should think it was nearly a fortnight after that before I was examined as a witness—my sons had been exam<lb></lb>ined before that, and my servant Dean—I remember him being examined—he is in my service now—he attends at the shop in Coventry-street—he has been a great many years in my service—he is a confidential servant—I left him in care of my whole house—I do not know whether he went out of the way when I was in trouble—I was in prison from the 16th of April, and cannot tell you of any thing that took place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, upon the subject of this private examina<lb></lb>tion, was the clerk to the Magistrate present who read over the paper which you had signed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—it was purely a voluntary statement made by me to my attorney to be forwarded to the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the Magistrate give you any caution, or make any observation to you on the subject of your statement before it was read? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> To the best of my recollection he said it might be used against me, or it might be destroyed—he said if the statement proved untrue I should be put in the bar, and it would be used against me—at that time no promise was made me that I should be a witness—I did not know I was to be received and examined for the Crown till long after.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the son of Henry Solomons. My father had a shop in the Strand, and another shop at No. 9, Coventry-street—I assisted him in the business at the shop in the Strand—I was at that shop on Easter Tuesday last—the prisoners, Mrs. Abrahams and Mr. Moses came there—Moses came first—I was in the front shop next the street when he came—my father was there—Moses spoke to him—he merely said he wished to speak to him, and they went to the passage, and went up stairs—they re<lb></lb>mained up stairs about ten minutes—Moses then left—about three-quarters of an hour after he was gone Mrs. Abrahams came—she went into the back shop—my father was there with her—there are furnaces in the back shop—I do not know whether there was any fire in them at that time, I believe there was—I did not remain at home all the time Mrs. Abrahams was there—my father directed me to go out—in consequence of directions from him I went to Ransom's, his banker—I returned and told ray father what had happened there—I went out again, and took a cheque for 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with me, drawn by my father on Ransom's—I took the change I got for it to my father—I know Woolf, a tailor in Regent-street—in consequence of my father's directions I went to Woolf, and received a cheque of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from him on Ransom's—I had also received three£5 notes and five sovereigns from Woolf—I went to Ransom's with the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque of Woolf's, and received the amount of it—I do not remember what I received from Ransom's in payment of that cheque—I delivered it to my father in the same state I received it—I took a bar of gold to Cock and Johnson's the same day, and they gave me a cheque for 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on Williams and Labouchere's bank on account of that bar—I presented it for payment, and received a£300 note and a£100 note—this is the£300 note I received (<hi rend="italic">looking at the one marked No.</hi> 15)—I took it to the Bank of England and got for it twenty £10 notes, and twenty£5 notes—I changed the£100 note for a hundred sovereigns—I carried them back to ray father—I found Mrs. Abrahams</p>

Bult, and had received some money for them—I do not know the exact amount—it was about 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I should think—I gave that to John Dean—the French bank notes belonged to the shop in Coventry-street—on the evening that my father received the summons I saw the prisoner Moses at his house in Vinegar-yard—I went there by my father's direction—I said to Moses that I wished to speak to him—he said, "What do you want?"—I said I wished to speak privately to him, and I walked up stairs with him—there was nobody in the room besides ourselves—I showed him the summons, and asked him for the bank notes which he had—I believe he had read the summons when I put that question to him—I said if he would let my father have the bank notes he should have sovereigns as soon as possible—he said, "Don't make yourself a child"—he promised me that he would not part with the bank notes, and I then came away—I was aware of the contents of the summons when I went there—when I showed him the paper I said, "I hope the bank notes are perfectly safe, and if you will let me have them back you shall have sovereigns for them"—I said my father had received a summons, and that he had to appear at Lambeth-street.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You heard a good deal of this affair while concealed in the Hay-market, I suppose? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not hear any thing—I only saw Mr. Abrahams one evening—we had money with us to live there—it was my brother's money, not my father's—I never wrote to my father or communi<lb></lb>cated with him in any way while I was in the Haymarket—my sister was in the Strand at that time.</p>

In£5 notes—I gave Moses sovereigns in return—after I got these notes I went again to Moses' house—he was not at home—I saw Alice Abrahams—I asked her whether I could see her father, she said he was out—we then got into conversation respecting the Caspars, and in the course of conversation I asked her whether the I O U was safe—she said yes it was, she had given it to her sister in a piece of paper, with some other notes, sealed up—I then asked her whether she was sure she was not watched, when she brought the gold dust to our house—she said, "No, I am sure I was not, and I will tell you the reason for why; I have an old sweetheart of the name of Jessop; I asked him to lend me a cupboard, to put some things in, which I intended to send to my sister in the country; and it was there that I put the gold dust," and that she brought it to our house from there—during our conversation the name of Davis was mentioned—she mentioned his name—she said she was in the house when the officers were there to search it, when some jokes passed with them, and she gave them a glass of rum—on Monday, the 15th of April, I re<lb></lb>ceived a message from John Dean, my father's servant—in consequence of the message I received from him, I went, between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, to <hi rend="italic">Money</hi> Moses' house—I found Mrs. Abrahams there, standing before the bar down stairs—she took me up stairs into a room, and told me she must have those bars back—I said, "No, you can't"—she then said that if she had them back she thought she could settle it with the prosecutors—I then asked her whether her father would give up</p>

                  </hi>. Easter Tuesday last I was in the service of Henry Solo<lb></lb>mons, of the Strand. I remember going on that day for ray master to Messrs. Cock and Johnson's—I returned about one o'clock, as nearly as I can recollect—when I returned, my master was in the workshop—the prisoner Mrs. Abrahams was with him—there were two furnaces alight, and a crucible in each—I saw Mrs. Abrahams give him some lumps of gold—he put them into a crucible—when it was melted, Mrs. Abrahams went out into the front shop—I did not observe any thing done between her and my master in the front shop, if any thing was done—I do not know How long she staid in the front shop before she left—she came back in about half or three-quarters of an hour, and brought more gold, which was melted in the same way as the other—Mrs. Abrahams was present in the workshop at the time of its being melted—after it was melted she went into the front shop, and went away again—she came, in the course of that day, four or</p>

               <p>five times, I am not certain—after the larger pieces were melted, she produced some smaller ones from a bag or pocket which she had fast<lb></lb>ened round her waist—she said that was for herself—I melted that—after it was melted I gave it to her, and she took it into the front shop—my mas<lb></lb>ter was there with her—she gave me half-a-sovereign—after she was gone we remelted some of the gold with about seventy ounces of silver that night, and made it into a bar—it was put into an iron chest—previous to this, one bar had been melted, alloyed with some silver-gilt lace—I think I should know the bar into which the seventy ounces of silver was put, if I was to see it—(<hi rend="italic">one produced</hi>)—yes, this is the bar, but it has been marked and cut since I gave it to Mr. Lea—before this bar was melted with the seventy ounces of silver it weighed about 270 ounces—the bar which was remelted with the silver-gilt lace was sent to Messrs. Cock and Johnson by my master's directions—Isaac Solomon took it—next morning, Wednesday, we melted six more bars—I mean Mr. Solomon and myself—some large pieces of Russian copper coin were put into them, which would alter the colour of the gold—Selim Solomon was afterwards sent with two of them to Bult's, in Cheapside—the other four were put into an iron chest, the same as the bar of silver was put into—that would make live bars—in consequence of something which passed between me and my roaster, I took charge of that gold—it was taken from the iron chest, and I put it into a chest belonging to myself—I placed the chest in the top room of the house, and left it there—I went away about a week or ten days af<lb></lb>ter—when I went away, as far as I know, I left it in that place—I re<lb></lb>member, after the two bars were sent to Cock and Johnson, Mr. Clark came to my master—he is a clerk to Messrs. Bult—on the Friday following Mr. Solomon sent me to Cock and Johnson's with a message—I delivered the message, and received an answer—I went to Messrs. Bult two days after the bar was sent there, if I recollect right; no, I believe it was on the next day, Thursday, I was sent there with a message by my master.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, upon that day did you see Mrs. Abrahams? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is a mistake in the depositions, and I wish to have it corrected—I will tell you what I said before the Magistrate—that upon the day on which Selim went to Messrs. Bult, upon his return I saw Mrs. Abrahams in the shop—when I was summoned before the Magistrate, the deposition was read over to me—I mentioned to Mr. Gunter that it was not when I returned from Messrs. Bult's, but when Selim returned from Bult's, that I saw Mrs. Abrahams—Selim is the person who took the two bars—that was the occasion on which I saw her—it was in my master's shop on Easter Wed<lb></lb>nesday—she asked for Mr. Solomon—I told her she would find him up stairs—she went up—I remember the Saturday on which my master went to the police office—a summons had been left for him on that Saturday—I received a £100 note from Selim Solomon on that Saturday—I received no directions what to do with it, only to get it changed—when he gave it to me he told me what to do with it—in consequence of those directions I went to Messrs. Ransom's to get sovereigns for it—I sent it by George Wood, one of my master's servants—Wood brought me back one hundred sovereigns for it—I put them into a bag, and gave them to Selim Solo<lb></lb>mon with another 100 the same evening—in the course of the next week I changed several other notes for gold by Mr. Solomon's direction—I know the person of the prisoner Moses—I saw him at my master's shop on</p>

               <p>Easter Tuesday—it was in the forenoon, about 11 o'clock—that was before I went to Cock and Johnson's—I was in the workshop when I saw him—on Sunday, the 14th of April, I saw Mrs. Abrahams in master's shop in the Strand between 11 and 12 o'clock at night—she asked to see Mr. Solomon—I told her that he and all the family were gone to bed, but if she wished to see him particularly I would call him up—she said, "No"—I asked her if any thing was the matter—she said, "No"—she then told me to tell young So<lb></lb>lomon to be at her house between seven and eight o'clock next morning—I delivered that message accordingly to Selim Solomon—I saw him go out next morning (Monday) between seven and eight o'clock—I know these two assay papers—(<hi rend="italic">Nos.</hi> 12 <hi rend="italic">and</hi> 13 <hi rend="italic">produced by Mr. Bult</hi>)—the top writing on them is mine—the other is Mr. Johnson's, of Maiden-lane, the assayer—he is a different person to Messrs. Cock and Johnson—(<hi rend="italic">read,</hi> "H.S., No. 2, 2nd April, 1839, double gold assay"—that is my writing as far as that—this "W 4 1 5/8" means "worse 4 carats 15/8"—that is Mr. Johnson's writing—that means less standard, or worse than standard 4 carats 1 gr. 5/8—this "No. 1 H.S., 3rd April, 1839, double gold," on the other assay paper is my writing—the "W 4 2-1/8" means worse 4 ounces 2 grains, and 1/8—they have each Mr. Johnson's signature to them—On Monday, the 8th of April, I remember obtaining some sovereigns from Messrs. Bult's—there were from one hundred to one hundred and twenty, as near as I can recol<lb></lb>lect—I got some from Messrs. Ransom's on the same day—I do not recol<lb></lb>lect getting any more at any other place that day—during that week I got some from the shop in Coventry-street—I do not recollect How much gold I got from Ransom's—I got it from various cheques—I do not recollect what I got from Coventry-street—it was by Mr. Solomon's directions that I got this gold—I changed notes with the trades people in that week—with three or four people—I remember taking a £100 note to Ransom's during the week beginning Monday, the 8th—I took one there to get change, and one to pay in to Mr. Solcmon's account—one was changed for notes and sovereigns.</p>

Bult's, and Cock and Johnson's—I do not know to what amount we sent them—it was not 8 or 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—I should think about half that.</p>

               <p>Certainly—the business we do with Bult's is notes and coin and a few bars—it was quite an extraordinary thing to send two or three bars to this extent at one time to Bult's—when I returned from Messrs. Bult's, on 2nd of April, Mrs. Abrahams was in the workshop—Mr. Solomon put the gold in in my presence—not in both the crucibles, only in one—I saw that it was gold dust—I had heard of the loss—I did not suspect what it was at first—I did not suspect till after it was all brought, when I saw the quantity—I did not know what weight there was—I could see it was large bars—I could tell there was more than thirty ounces when I saw it con<lb></lb>tinually coming—when I saw there was such a quantity I suspected it was the gold that was lost, when I saw it come so many times and there was such a large bulk—I had no suspicion when I saw Mrs. Abrahams with the one hundred and ten ounces—I thought it was the ordinary course of bu<lb></lb>siness—I had never seen Mrs. Abrahams before—I staid in the workshop all the day from time to time when she came—I saw her come from time to time—I went out of the workshop after it was all done—it might be about six or half-past six o'clock—Mr. Solomon was with me all the after<lb></lb>noon—he was in and out of the workshop all the afternoon—he was not in the workshop all the afternoon—I do not recollect seeing Isaac in the work<lb></lb>shop—I saw him in the front shop—he generally attended in the front shop, but he went into the city, and Mr. Solomon was obliged to attend when he was in the city.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How often was Mr. Solomon in the workshop with you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Every time Mrs. Abrahams came Mr. Solomon came into the work<lb></lb>shop and put the gold into the crucible—he did not always do that—he did that afternoon—I never melted any thing of the kind before—I never melted gold dust—I never melt any thing but for respectable dealers whom I know—when I saw Moses in the shop, he was standing with his back against the wainscot, looking across the counter—I was at the furnace at the time—there was a crucible in the fire, but I was not looking in the furnace—I was looking towards the door—it was my business to attend to the furnace at that time—I had seen him once before—he was not known to Mr. Solomon—he came there with a bottle of spirits once—Mr. Solomon did not deal with him that I know of—I do not think I saw him in the shop more than half a minute or a minute at the outside—I do not mean when he came with the spirits, but when he came on the Tuesday—there were two doors between me and where he was standing—there is a door to the workshop, and between the workshop and passage there is a little parlour—there is a door to that pars lour—there were three doors between us, but neither of them were shut—there were two doors, and one besides—if I had told you there was only one and there were two, I should have said false—I did not remember at the moment—we leave all the doors open—that was the usual course, except when the chimneys smoked, and then we closed them—I should think it is nearly 90 feet from the further end of the workshop to the door in the Strand—you can see the door in the Strand from the furnace—I swear that—a person in the Strand could not see what was going on at the furnace, for the furnace is not so high as we are, but they could see the furnace alight—the shop-door leading from the street is generally kept shut—the back parlour is not used for any thing particular—any lumber is put in it—there is a counter there, on which we brush clothes or so sometimes—I never knew Mr. Solomon take a person in there for private conversation—I do not recollect that there is any fire in the workshop, except the furnaces</p>

               <p>—there is no place for a fire in the workshop, except the furnaces—the chim<lb></lb>neys smoke when we are burning sweep—I should think the parlour is about fifteen feet wide, but I never measured it and cannot say—I should not think the passage is quite so wide as the parlour—I do not know whether the shop is about nineteen feet wide—I cannot say whether it is wider than the parlour—it might be a foot or so longer—the shop I should say is a little longer than the parlour—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the plan</hi>)—this is not correct—the furnace ought to be on this side—the furnace is opposite the door—when you enter the room the furnace is right before you—it is at the furthest end of the workshop opposite the door—there are four furnaces—they are against the wall at the end—they are built against the wall on the left hand—they join the wall on the left hand—they are not straight against the wall—they do touch the wall in one way—the side of them are against the wall, but the back is against the wall in front of you—they do not touch the wall on the right hand—there is no furnace near the door on the left hand—the furnaces come out about two or three feet from the wall—when you first enter the shop, there is a door between the shop and passage, then another door to the parlour, and then another door into the work<lb></lb>shop—I dare say the whole of the premises, from the street door to the end of the furnaces, is between eighty and ninety feet—I was in the workshop when I saw Moses—it was my business to attend to the crucibles, but I was not looking at them at the time—if I had been attending to them, my back would have been to the front shop—I think there were some other people in the front shop at the time, but I did not see any one distinctly—I could not see all over the shop—had Mr. Moses stood against the counter, I could not have seen him, but he stood against the wall and looked over the counter—I believe there was somebody else in the shop, but I would not undertake to swear it—I cannot swear I did see any body distinctly—I cannot say positively that I saw any body else—I do not recollect seeing any body there—I cannot swear there was any body there—I have no recollection of seeing any body else there besides Mr. Moses—I have no recollection whether I saw any one else there or not.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you sleep in the house of Mr. Solomon, in the Strand? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did—I was present when the house was searched the first time—I did not go up stairs—I have no room—I slept in the shop under the counter—I had two boxes—one on the third floor, in which I kept my clothes, which was broken open, while I was away, and another in the top of the house, where I kept some clothes which belonged to my deceased mother—it was up four pairs of stairs in an attic, which we used entirely for lumber boxes and all kind of lumber—I was not present when the officers searched that room—my other box was broken open during my absence, or I would have opened it for them—I was present the first time when they searched the lower part of the pre<lb></lb>mises, but I did not go up stairs—Roe went up to search—the gold was in one of the boxes—I would have opened that box for them if I had been up stairs—it was on the fourth floor where the gold was—I received a message from Mr. Solomon to give it up—Mr. Abrahams gave me that message—I had no communication with Mr. Abrahams from the time Mr. Solomon was taken up, till he came with my deposition—I received a message from him in the presence of Lea the officer through Mr. Abrahams to give up the bars to Lea—Mr. Abrahams, Mr. Solos omon's solicitor, delivered the message to me—Mr. Abrahams' son came to the lodging, and told me his father wanted to speak to me, and when I met him in the Strand he was with Lea the officer—he told me I was to give Lea the five bars in my possession, and I accordingly did so—I was out of the way at the time—I went down to the Strand from where I was concealed, leaving the two Solomons at the place—it was in the day-time, about eleven o'clock—I considered I was safe then, as I was told Mr. Abrahams wanted to speak to me—I was staying at the house of a Mr. Mosely, No. 32, Haymarket—he is no relation of So<lb></lb>lomon.</p>

               <p>had as much doubt as that came to? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is the fact—my sus<lb></lb>picion was certainly strong enough to make me believe so, but I had no right to believe it was so—I had strong suspicion, that is the fact—I did not ask any question of Mr. Solomon about it—I went on melt<lb></lb>ing—I had never melted things before which came in under suspicious circumstances—I never had any suspicion of any thing I melted before—there are three doors to our workshop—there is no place to go out into the street, except going through the shop—one door leads into a closet—you cannot get into the street from there—you can get into the open air from that closet—you go across the yard to that closet—you come out of the workshop and go into this back-parlour—there is a door out of that into a yard, and down that yard at the end there is a closet—that closet has no door outward—you can see the Strand from the workshop—you can see any body—any one who saw a person coming could go into that closet—any body who knew it—I suppose it was not communicated to every body—I am still with Mr. Solomon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you, or had you any doubt that he received this gold with a guilty knowledge? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not know How he received it—I did not know what was paid for it, nor How he came by it—I only know it came there—I have not heard him say any thing on the subject—I knew it when he was examined at the police office—I continue in his service still—the attorney came to us in the Haymarket, and asked us to make statements to him—he did not tell me for what purpose at that time—he told me to state the facts, as far as I was concerned—he did not tell me to what use they were to be applied—he never told me what use they were to be ap<lb></lb>lied to until they came to the police office—he did not tell me it was to corroborate Mr. Solomon, who would not be believed if he was not corro<lb></lb>borated—he told me it was to corroborate Mr. Solomon, but he did not tell me he would not be believed without—when I went to the private audi<lb></lb>ence before the Magistrate, there were two or three gentlemen there—I do not know their names—I believe it was Mr. Hardwick and the clerks, and to the best of my recollection Mr. Abrahams was there—I do not recollect that there was another Magistrate there besides Mr. Hardwick—there were three or four gentlemen, but who they were I do not know—to the best of my knowledge Mr. Abrahams was there, but it is so long ago—I did not know it was important I should recollect—I cannot say How many persons there were—I do not distinctly recollect whether Mr. Abrahams was there or not, but to the best of my belief he was there—the two young Solomons were not there when I was there—they were waiting to go in when I came out.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had Mr. Abrahams taken down in writing what you were to say before you went there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> When he came to Moseley's, in the Hay-market, what I stated he took down in writing—he took down what the others said also—that which he so took down was put into the hands of the Magistrate's clerk, and I was examined out of it, and it was read over to me in the private room—I do not distinctly recollect whether I signed it then in the private room, but I signed it before the Magistrate—I did not sign it when Mr. Abrahams took it down—I do not recollect that I signed that paper at all—if I did not sign it in the private room I did not sign it at all—not that statement.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ADOLPHUS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You did not sign it at Moseley's, and if you did not sign it in the private room you did not sign it at all? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is correct—I believe Mr. Humphreys was in the private room, but I am not certain—I do not recollect seeing any counsel for the prosecution there that I know. Mr. Clarkson examined me at the police-office—I am not certain that he was in the private room—I am not aware that any copies were made of my statement—how many Mr. Abrahams may have made I do not know—when I came before the Magistrate in the public room, I was asked questions about this transaction—they were to exactly the same matters as I had stated in the private room, and which were con<lb></lb>tained in that paper—it had been read over in the private room.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And after you had rehearsed in the private room, and given evi<lb></lb>dence in the public room, still there was a statement which was not cor<lb></lb>rect, and which the clerk did not correct? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was—I signed it as it was—I think I was about a quarter of an hour in the private room—I was not there three hours—I had been in the public office before that, about half an hour—I should suppose it was about an hour altogether, from the time the Magistrates went out till they came into Court again.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you went back into the public room to be sworn, were questions put to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Then questions were put to me to which I gave answers.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ADOLPHUS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And did the questions so put to you produce answers conformable to what you had stated before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They did; the questions, and the answers I gave, were the same in substance as what had been read over to me in the private room, and something in the same order—I was sworn before the clerk took down what I said—I was sworn to state the whole truth—I did not know what they were going to ask me—I had no business to guess—I could not tell what they were going to ask me—I was there to give an account of the business—I never went before the Justice before—I think it was on the 7th of May that I was first examined before the Magistrate—it was in the early part of May—I was examined again about eight or ten days after to the best of my recollection—I do not recollect whether I said any thing before the Justice in the pri<lb></lb>vate room about Selim Solomon going to Mrs. Abrahams in consequence of the message delivered to me—it was on Sunday night, the 14th of April, that she called—on the 7th of May, when I was examined, I did not say a word about that—I had told Mr. Abrahams of it before—I went a second time to the Justice—I was ordered to attend there again, and went—Mr. Abrahams did not tell me of it—I think Selim and I went together the day I was re<lb></lb>examined, to the best of my recollection—I went to state that I had omit<lb></lb>ted a fact concerning Alice Abrahams—I do not know what he went to do—I did not know what would be wanted of me till I was there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where has Mr. Solomon taken a shop now? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There is one taken in Hanway-street—I have been there—it is not fitted up with a furnace—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183906170240"></xptr>
               <p>I do not know what shop it is to be—it is not open yet—there is no conve<lb></lb>nience for a furnace—the lumps of gold were found in a box of mine—I had not looked into the box from the time I put them there till I went to the box with Lea and Mr. Abrahams—I put them there the day they were re-melted—that was on the 3rd of April, when they were re-melted and alloyed—I never put any valuable property in that loft before myself, nor ever knew of any being put there—Roe came to search the house when Mr. Solomon was taken into custody—that was about a week or ten days afterwards—I knew what he came to search for.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came you, being an honest young man and a Christian not to conduct them up stairs, and say, "Here is what you are searching for?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because I did not think proper—I certainly do not think it would have been honest to do so—it was given into my custody, and I did not think I had a right to give it to the officers—I saw the gold dust come to the house, and I had suspicions—I saw it melted and alloyed so as to disguise it—I then took it away, and concealed it in a box in the loft—there were stairs leading to that loft—I saw the officers come to search for that gold, but told them nothing about it—afterwards, when I was requested, I told Lea where it was, and conducted him to it—I gave it up at Mr. Solomon's re<lb></lb>quest—Roe was not there at that time—the box was precisely in the same situation as where I had left it—the door of the loft was not locked or se<lb></lb>cured in anyway.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>and even outside the street looking through the glazed doors you can if the inner door is open—you can see the brick work of two of them—I do not say you can see the furnaces, because they are lower down—when you enter the workshop the furnaces face you exactly—they are neither right nor left I should say—there are four furnaces—I rather think the furnaces do not remain now, for when I was there five weeks ago the workmen were there—it is turned into a linen-draper's shop.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How do you make it an hour and a half, if the coach went at the rate of six or seven miles an hour? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We waited some time—young Caspar got out at the coach office at the Circus—he stopped there a few minutes—we stopped eight or nine minutes at Vauxhall-bridge—as near as I can tell, old Caspar left the coach about half-past nine—young Caspar went with me from the Strand to the coffee-house in St. Paul's church-yard—he got out there, and I got out with him, and we went into the coffee-house—to the best of my recollection I finally parted with young Caspar about half-past ten o'clock—I should think we staid an hour at least at the coffee-house—we went out of our road a little at Vauxhall-bridge, but only a short distance—I do not recollect what distance—it might take us five minutes out of the way—we stopped and made inquiry when we found we were out of the road.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you employed as a police-officer? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I was only employed at the police-office in conse<lb></lb>quence of the excitement that this examination of the prisoners caused—I was there to prevent confusion at that time—the prisoners were sometimes confined in the cell where I heard the conversation, and sometimes in the adjoining cell—they were brought from the prison there—I believe they had been brought from the prison that morning—I had not seen them come—I did not see them put into that cell that morn<lb></lb>ing—I saw them brought out after when they went into the office after that conversation—I was present at the cell when they were brought out, and followed them into the office—at the time of the conversation there were no more prisoners in that cell—after that the door was opened, and one or two of Moses' daughters came—the door was opened by the jailor two or three times prior to my hearing the conversation, for the purpose of taking something in to the prisoners, I then saw who was in the cell—he took them in a pipe and tobacco, and twice he took in a light—I believe that Solomon and Moss, who were admitted as witnesses, were in the further cell at the time of the conversation—there were no prisoners confined on night charges—there were not four other prisoners confined in the same cell at the time I heard this conversation, nor after till I saw the two young women let in by the jailor—I will swear that the prisoners were the only persons there at the time I heard the conversation—I cannot say if it was two or three times that I had looked into the cell and seen who was there, before J heard this conversation—I will not say from ten minutes to half an hour How long it was before—I had remained in the yard from the time of my looking in the cell till I heard the conversation—I was in the yard all the time, so as to be able to say who went in—there was not a drunken woman confined in that cell at that time, there might be afterwards—there was a drunken woman in the yard—I cannot say How long after, it might have been an hour, or it might have been two—she fainted away in the open yard—I cannot say if four of Moses' children came to see him that morn<lb></lb>ing—I saw two I think—the jailor kept the key of that cell all that time—I did not at all—it was part of my duty to keep watch over the cells at the police-office—I was stationed in the yard to keep the prisoners and to keep people from going into the yard—I went at half-past eight o'clock—I left from nine o'clock to half-past nine, but I went in and out after that—I never left the yard from half-past eight o'clock till past nine—I might have gone up the steps of the office, but never out of sight of the cell door—I did not go into the office—I do not know where the jailor was all the time—I do not recollect who I first mentioned this conversation to—I mentioned it to some of our men—there was an inspector there—I did not consider this as of any importance—I think it was very likely to be the</p>

               <p>jailor, who was the cause of my being taken before the Magistrate as he saw me standing there—I might have said to him, "They are quarrel<lb></lb>ing there"—the jailor was there, and put his ear to the door, I be<lb></lb>lieve twice—he did not hear the whole of it—to the best of my belief, I did not tell the jailor what I heard pass—when I went before the Magis<lb></lb>trate, I heard the younger Caspar make a remark—I did not pay any at<lb></lb>tention to know whether he did wholly deny my statement or not—I perfectly or partly recollect what he stated, but whether he meant it as a denial of all I stated or not I do not know—I did not understand whether he totally denied it or not—I did not hear him say that my statement was false or untrue—I believe he said he had not made use of such words as I im<lb></lb>puted to him, and he said that he applied to Moses to either give or lend him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to defend himself—I do not precisely recollect what the words were, but I believe he said he did that because he was in great distress for want of money—I believe he said Moses had promised to give or lend him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and that he said to Moses, "If I had got 1400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 1200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by that transac<lb></lb>tion, as you are reported to have got by it, you should not have wanted 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

                  </hi> I am one of the police Magistrates at the office in Lambeth-street. I have been so about seventeen years—the examina<lb></lb>tion of the prisoners and the witnesses in this case, was conducted before me—I am the committing Magistrate—I remember some papers being pre<lb></lb>sented to me, which I took into my private room—I had had no communi<lb></lb>cation with the parties to whom the statement alluded before they were put into my hands—they were put in publicly in the office in the presence of the counsel and attorney—I took these statements into my private room at the request of the counsel, which was made publicly—it was publicly stated to be for the purpose of enabling me to ascertain whether, in my discretion, I should receive the testimony of Solomon as a witness for the Crown—the prisoners were present, and the counsels and attorneys on all sides, and the office full of people—I desired the clerk to accompany me to the pri<lb></lb>vate room—the attorney of Solomon was present in my private room—the statements were in the hands of the clerk, and I believe were read by the clerk in the presence of the young Solomon and Solomon's attorney—each of the persons who had made statements were brought into the room to me by themselves, and each of the statements were read to me without the interference of any body—the statements were read to each separately, and the others were not in the room at the time—after that had been done, and I had come to my conclusion as to the course to be taken, the persons left the private room, and were taken into the office, and there a <hi rend="italic">viva voce</hi> examination by counsel took place publicly.</p>

ADOLPHUS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say that these papers were delivered to you publicly in the public office? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I do not know whether any of the prisoners or their counsel or solicitors had the means of ascertaining one word of their contents—all that passed was, the coun<lb></lb>sel requested the Magistrates would take certain papers into their hands and retire into their room, and there read them—none of the counsel of any of the prisoners had any means of knowing one syllable that they contained—the counsel and attorneys for the prosecution retired with me—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183906170255"></xptr>
               <p>the counsel and solicitors for the prisoners were not allowed to be there—Mr. Abrahams, the attorney for Mr. Solomon, was allowed to be in the room—I cannot say How many persona came into the room to make statements—there was Solomon and I think two of his sons—I do not recollect whether there was any more—I do not recollect whether Mr. Dean was one.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were these statements signed by the parties? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—after they had been read over to them, and every question strictly forbidden, and they had been distinctly told that the Magistrates would only receive it as voluntary confession, which might be used against them—when the papers were read by the clerk to us, the persons making the statements were asked, if such statements were true—the papers were each signed by the parties making the statements—I cannot say into whose hands they im<lb></lb>mediately passed, but I suppose into the hands of the counsel, as notes to examine the witnesses afterwards in open court—I received the papers from the hands of the counsel for the prosecution, before I went into the room, and returned them to their hands—this private examination might have lasted an hour and a half—I believe the counsel and attorneys for the prosecution had private audiences with me several times, not every morn<lb></lb>ing—we were asked for a private audience and gave it, and should have given you the same if you had asked—Alice Abrahams was examined be<lb></lb>fore me before this—I cannot say if she was examined on her oath, but she was examined and made a statement as a witness—I have never been desi<lb></lb>rous of any testimony, but when I found there was evidence to implicate her—there was none excepting her own statement—the prisoners were to be kept separate in Cold Bath Fields—there were various directions from time to time—myself and my brother Magistrate were there when these statements were read over—I am not sure whether Lea or Roe Were there.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JONES</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you there when Lewin Caspar came to give information of this robbery? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I think it was about twelve o'clock in the day—Lea, the officer, came and asked me whether I Would give a gentleman in waiting a private audience—I found that person to be Lewin Caspar—when I saw him at the bar, I recognized him to be the person I had seen in the private room—he said he had been to the Mansion-house, and they had referred him to our office, for the purpose of detecting the thieves—in consequence of his application, I directed the officers to give the necessary assistance—in the interview young Caspar appeared agitated, and expressed great anxiety about the matter, and he put some papers into my hand, stating on these he had given an order for the delivery of some chests of gold dust.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have told us some orders were given that the prisoners should be kept separate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and I believe they were kept separate, so that they should have no communication with each other, ex<lb></lb>cept when they came to the office—I should not have read these papers in my private room, if I had not thought it detrimental to justice to read them publicly.</p>

               <p>found there—I will not positively swear that there were no boxes there, but to the best of my recollection there was none—there was a good deal of lumber there—I did not pull it about, but I looked, and did not find any thing there that I was looking for—the room was small—it was per<lb></lb>fectly light.</p>

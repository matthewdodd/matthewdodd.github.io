                  </hi>. I am a chimney-sweeper. On the 14th of April, about five o'clock, I was at the Duke of York public-house, having a little beer—the prisoner was in the room—I have known him twenty years—we drank together, and were <hi rend="italic">skylarking</hi> and pushing one another about—I threw a handful of soot in his face—I went out of the parlour, and left him in the tap-room—the soot went in his eyes, he took and rubbed them—I went into the tap-room again—he came into the tap-room in about a quarter of an boor, I think, after me, and struck me twice with his hand on my neck—I did not see any thing in his hand till I was going out at the door—(Hurley led me out to a doctor's shop—my neck was scratched, and bleeding all the way to the doctor's—it bled a good drop)—out at the door I saw a knife in his hand—they were the only two blows I got—I was standing up at the time—as he was going I fell backwards against the fire-place, from the first blow; and as I was getting up I got the second blow—I was very drunk at the time, the prisoner was drunk also—I had had no quarrel with him.</p>

                  </hi>. I saw the prisoner and Ryan come in and out of the public-house several times—then I did not see them for a considerable time—Ryan then came into the tap-room, and in about eight or ten minutes the prisoner came in, and struck him under the chin—I did not see any thing in his hand then—the prosecutor fell back to the fire-place—I lifted him up, and saw the prisoner come to him again with a knife, and then I saw him cut under the chin—I gave him into another person's hands, while I ran for a policeman, and gave the prisoner in charge—Ryan said nothing to the prisoner, nor did he strike him when he came into the room.</p>

On the 25th of June I was in my garden; I told Miss Gonin, who lives in the house, to bring me some seed - she came to me in the garden, returned to the house, called to me, and said a thief had entered and taken the silver, which was kept in the cupboard, on the left-hand side of the fire-place; I went out, and saw some men on Muswell-hill - they directed me after three men in a cart, who had gone down the hill, and at the bottom of the hill I met Mr. Smeeton; I went on in his cart, and in three or four minutes saw a cart on Mount Pleasant: before we got up to it, some men got out of it - they were about two hundred yards off; there were three men by the cart, but I had only seen two in it; one of them went down a lane on the left - the third, who was by the cart, went to the right, and one remained in the road; we drove up, and both jumped out of the cart -Smeeton collared the prisoner: our horse was very restive at being driven so hard, and I held it by the head; the prisoner, seeing this, struck Smeeton - he appeared to be loitering about the cart; when we got up he was about three yards from it - he got from Smeeton, and at that instant two men came up; one took the horse reins, while I followed the prisoner - he got through the hedge, and was secured by a man; I knew him to be one of the men I had seen in the cart - on searching the cart I found a plated knife, in a basket of willow-shavings; it was mine: the prisoner, as he ran, threw some lemons from his pocket - I have found nothing more; I could not see whether the other man took any thing away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.How far were you from the cart when he got out? A.About two hundred yards; he did not run till after I had seized him - the other two ran into the fields.</p>

            . I live at Mr. Fortescue's. I took him some seed into the garden, and as I returned the prisoner came to the front door, which was open, with lemons to sell - I said we wanted none; I did not see him in the house: I saw him go out at the gate - I walked down the garden once, and as I returned I saw another man coming out of the passage; he had been into the house, and was offering willow-shavings for sale - I was flurried, and asked why he went into the house; he went out without answering - I went to the closet, and missed a basket, containg the plate stated in the indictment. I saw no cart, nor any body in the road.</p>

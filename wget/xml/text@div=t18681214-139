                  </hi>. I am a book-keeper in the service of Messrs. Waterlow &amp; Sons, and live at 66, St. Swithin's Lane—on 28th November, about 11 o'clock, I was in Alderman's Walk, Bishopsgate Street—I saw the prisoner there—I went into a urinal there; John Harrison was with me—when I came out, I passed the prisoner—he came behind me, and put his arm round my neck and forced me backwards—I became insen<lb></lb>sible—when I recovered, I was walking to the station with the prisoner and a policeman—I missed my scarf pin at the station-house; I charged the prisoner with stealing it—I felt the effects for the next day or two afterwards—I was sore about my mouth, and there was a cut on my mouth—the prisoner is the man—I saw him when I passed him, and he looked at me.</p>

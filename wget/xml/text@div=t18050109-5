            's: When I went up I found the door of the room open, my trunk open, and my property gone, I had left my room in the morning about seven o'clock, locked; I put the key in a place where it is always kept with the other lodgers' keys, for the servants to make the beds.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the trunk locked? - A. No it was not.</p>
               <p>Q. What did it contain? - A. A coat, two pair of breeches, two waistcoats, two pair of stockings, four neck-handkerchiefs, a pocket Bible, and my hat was also taken away, there was other property taken, but that belonged to the landlord; there was nearly three yards of linen, and a pair of slings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find any of them again? - A. Yes; in a few days there was a neck handkerchief and the slings found in the apartment of the prisoner; I was with the constable at the time they were found, at No. 9, King-street, Seven-dials.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of your coat? - A. Two pounds; I had had it about three months, it cost me two pounds eighteen shillings; the two waistcoats are worth ten shillings, two pair of breeches, a guinea and a half, the stockings four shillings, the Bible five shillings, the linen-cloth five shillings, and the slings, I suppose, sixpence.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason have you to suppose this woman stole them? - A. She was not known to the house.</p>

               <p>Q. How do you know they were her apartments? - A. She told me she lived there in the name of Robson; and she likewise told me her name was Ralph, she lived in a two pair of stairs back room; I searched the room, and found this neck-handkerchief, marked A T; the prosecutor found some slings in the same room; I tried the young man's lock, and among the twelve keys I found these two that opened the door.

            , but I cannot say positively that the prisoner is the woman.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Thorburn.) Look at those articles? - A. This neck handkerchief is mine, and the braces are mine; one of the buckles was wanting, and that part was cut to go over the button of my breeches, and the linen I know to be mine; it was sent to me from Scotland by my mother, cut off the web; I know it by the quantity and the quality; I have been in the habit of wearing my mother's linen all my life.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. The linen is my own, I have a pair of sheets of the same now in pledge; the handkerchief was left in my room by a person that slept with me; I know nothing about the name of the person that left it; the duplicates are all my own, they have been advertised, and nobody has come forward to own any thing; I have three small children, and am pregnant now.</p>

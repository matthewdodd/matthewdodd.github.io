                  </hi>. I live in Gifford—street, Kingsland. On the night of Sunday, 11th Jan., I was in Church—street, Shoreditch, a little before 10 o'clock—I saw both the prisoners—three men attacked me—I was not per<lb></lb>fectly</p>

               <p>sober, but sober enough to know what I was doing—they struck me, and knocked me—I fell against a door, which flew open, and I fell into the passage—Chiverall then threw himself upon me while I was on the ground—I grasped him with my arms, and M'Cormick kicked me in the face—I called out, "Police!"—while Chiverall was on me, he attempted to tear my coat open and take my pocket book, which was in my breast pocket—my coat was buttoned as it is now—I got partly up, and Chiverall knocked me down again—Mr. Jackson came to help me, he pulled Chiverall off me, I got up and seized Chiverall by the throat—a policeman came up, and I gave Chiverall into custody—M'Cormick kicked me in the face while I was on the ground, and then ran away—I received a kick from him in the ribs when I was knocked down, and Chiverall threw himself on me—I was very ill for several days, and under a doctor; my lip was cut, and my forehead, and I had a black eye—I did not know either of the prisoners before—I had no quarrel with them—nothing was taken from me.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the King's Head, in Church-street. On Sun<lb></lb>day night, 11th Jan., I saw the prosecutor at my door—I was then going out—he was coming out—I went to the other door, the bottle depart<lb></lb>ment, and stood there—I saw two young men about ten yards from the door—the prisoner Chiverall was one; they were together—the prosecutor wan passing, and they turned round immediately behind him, and Chiverall attempted to put his hand into his pocket—the prosecutor turned round and seized Chiverall by the collar, and as soon as he had done that the other person struck the prosecutor in the face, and knocked him against a door—the door flew open, and he fell in the passage—I ran up immediately, and the other one ran away—I took hold of Chiverall by the collar, and pulled him off the prosecutor—the prosecutor got up, took hold of Chiverall by his collar, and called out "Police!"—a policeman came and took him—the other man ran up Boundary—street, the direction the policeman was coming down—I saw the second person, and from M'Cormick's stature and appear<lb></lb>ance, I believe him to be the man.</p>

               <p>two persons stood with their backs towards the window—they turned, and the hand of one, I could see distinctly, attempted to put in the pocket—they were standing ten yards off and when they did this they had not gone, I should think, more than one yard further—they were at that time between the prosecutor and me—I saw Chiverall's hand going from him in a direc<lb></lb>tion to the prosecutor's pocket—I am certain of it—he touched him, and directly the prosecutor turned round and seized him—that appeared to me to be in consequence of his feeling something done to him; and directly on that M'Cormick knocked him down—I cannot say whether the prosecutor had hold of Chiverall till he fell—when I got up Chiverall was upon the prosecutor in the passage, whether he pulled him down I cannot tell—I staid till the policeman came, which was in half a minute—I did not see the policeman till he came up—there were other persons round after this was done—a great many persons were about, but whether they had been with the prisoners, I cannot tell—the prosecutor had a black eye, and his nose was hurt; I believe he had a scratch on his neck; I did not notice his lip—I did not see any conversation with the prosecutor and these men before this happened.</p>

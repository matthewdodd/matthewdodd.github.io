                  </hi>. I am a partner with my father, in Borough Place, Waterloo Road, as rag merchants—the prisoner was in our employ—on Monday, 21<hi rend="italic">st</hi> January, he borrowed 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he did not come on the Tuesday—on Wednesday I found this note on one of my bill heads: "Dear Sir,—I am very queer this morning and have a most severe head<lb></lb>ache. Excuse me until after dinner. I have given the men their orders. Your obedient servant." He did not come back that week—on 28th January I met him in Waterloo Road—he said "I have been to the counting-house, and Mr. Nicholson said I had better not commence business till I saw you"—I said "He was quite right, and had he let you come I should have been very much annoyed; I want you to explain your conduct last week"—he said "I suppose I can come back again, you will look over it?"—I said "Certainly not"—I refused to take him back—he then left me—I had not given him any authority to pay railway charges on 24th January or on 1<hi rend="italic">st</hi> February—when he left my service on 22nd January he had none to pay—none of my vans had run over a child—Mr. Rees, Mr. Berry, and Mr. Carrington are my customers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I had a weekly engagement with the prisoner—I thought he was ill—I did not consider him out of my employment on January 22—if he came there on the Thursday at 7 o'clock he had no right there, as his time was 8 o'olock—I was there at 8 o'clock—he did not come then—when I saw him on the Monday he demanded no wages, nor has he since—I asked him for the 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I lent him—I said "You have robbed me of 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I considered him discharged—he had no authority to borrow money to pay charges—he had been six or seven months in my employment—he took the weights and helped to unload—weights are taken by the buyer and seller—it is not a con<lb></lb>fidential duty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. Messrs. Rees and others applied to me for payment, and then I became aware of what the prisoner had done—he had a key which he took away; I got it back a fortnight after.</p>

I gave him 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he asked me for some water flock, and said that Harris wanted it—I have not heard that they did—I next saw the prisoner in custody—I applied to Mr. Harris for payment—I advanced the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. believing the note.</p>

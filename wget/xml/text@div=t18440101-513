                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Whaley; we live in Mount-street, Lambeth; the prisoner was in my service about five weeks. I received information about the 11th of Dec—I went into the prisoner's bed-room, and searched her work-bag—I found part of a petticoat of my daughter's, which the prisoner had been cutting up, and I found a black brooch belonging to myself, which I had worn on the Friday—I kept it generally on a pin-cushion in my bed-room—I had missed it on the Sunday, and found it in her work-box on the Monday—I had asked her for it on the Sunday, and she said she had not seen it after I saw it in her bag I asked her again, and she said she had not seen it—she went up stairs; I followed her, and locked my bed-room door, that she should not put it on my pin<lb></lb>cushion again—I then looked in her bag, and it was gone—I sent for the policeman, who searched her box, which she un<lb></lb>locked—a pinafore of my daughter's was found in the box, with her name marked on it, a diaper napkin belonging to me, some remnants of ribbon, about four yards, and some pieces of lace; and here is a worsted shawl belonging to me—I know these things; here is my name on the napkin; she managed to throw the brooch away, and we found it under the bed, in my daughter's room, on the Saturday following—I am quite sure I had seen it in her bag—I missed tea, sugar, candles, and other things.</p>

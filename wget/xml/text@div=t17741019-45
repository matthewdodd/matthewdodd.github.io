Last Monday I was out about some business; when I came home my wife told me she had some suspicions of the prisoner; that he was shuffling about in the back shop, and she did not like it, and therefore she had set a man to watch him; the man told me he thought he had something in his bosom, and that he was drinking at a publick house; I went to the publick house; he was coming out; I stopped him, and found one of my hats in his bosom. (The hat was produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>

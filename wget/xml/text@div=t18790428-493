Joseph Reynolds, 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>." He did not afterwards bring me the proceeds, or any part of the proceeds of the cheque—it ii en<lb></lb>tirely untrue to say that the cheque was given to him to change for me—I have frequently changed cheques at Mr. Rawlings's for my own use, drawn to "self," but have never drawn such cheques in Reynolds's name—I put the prisoner out of my house about the end of March—he never, previously the action in the county-court, alleged to me that the 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque had been given to him to change for me—the first time I heard the story was, I think, in Court, when he commenced proceedings at the county-court—I was pre<lb></lb>sent when he gave his evidence, and heard him swear that I gave him the cheque to change for me—he said Mr. Rawlings changed it for him, and had a conversation with him.</p>

You are a visitor, are you not?"—he used at last to kick up all sorts of rows and say it was the gout—it was his general drinking gave him the gout, not what he had of me—I said at the police-court, "I have given the prisoner several cheques, some few for stable rent"—I have lent him several sums, chiefly by cheque, and then it was eaten up by the stable rent—he came as a visitor, and charged as a servant—he left my house about the commencement of March last year—Worman came to see him, turned out because he was violent, and would not go—he stayed at my request—I was afraid of the prisoner—he said, "I have been clean off my chump three or four times with the gout"—I had a loaded revolver in my pocket at the police-court—I have not got it now—the solicitor or the Magistrate did not tell me to leave it at home—I told Mr. Watts that I put it in my pocket because his client was out—Mr. Worman told me that the prisoner said he would rip his (Worman's) bowels out—it is not my custom to carry loaded revolvers—my father was a wonderful shot, and I am the same, and I take an interest in firearms—my revolver is always either in my pocket or under lock and key—I am the inventor of one revolver, and have had a gunsmith's shop—it was loaded in the police-court in all five chambars—I do not often carry one—I have had two in my pocket sometimes, and have been to the gunsmith's, where there is a great number of them—I had only one at the county-court—the Judge said, "I think you had better hand it to the in<lb></lb>spector"—I was in Court a portion of the time when the case brought against me by the prisoner was tried, and I suppose I was sworn—I do not think I had one revolver then; I am certain I did not have two—I am not sure I did not have one—revolvers were spoken of because the pri<lb></lb>soner announced his intention of getting me in a lunatic asylum—I do not think I had a revolver on the second occasion, but I will not swear—I can<lb></lb>not remember—I paid the prisoner 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week for the stable, but for some reason towards the end he reduced it to 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was present at the police-court, but was not called as a witness—my knowledge upon these transactions was the same then as now—I had not been told that it is necessary to have two witnesses to an assignment of perjury—I do know the fact—Constable Bone 395 N called my attention to it here several days ago—lie said, "There are so many witnesses, two are sufficient to convict a man for perjury"—I have nothing to do with this prosecution, and have not advised Mr. Stevens to prosecute—I have had some conversation with Mr. Abbot about the evidence—he did not say anything about two witnesses being necessary; he said Mr. Stevens's evidence would have to be corroborated—I do not know if I am the corroborator—that is all the conversation—I gave him a written state<lb></lb>ment of what I could prove a long time back, before the proceedings at the police-court—Mr. Boaz and myself have had some talk, but not as to the necessity of two witnesses—I expressed my surprise to him that these proceedings should have been necessary, considering that both he and I knew what Reynolds had told us—I thought that after Mr. Stevens's kind<lb></lb>ness Reynolds would not put him to the trouble of prosecuting him—I have been with the prosecutor as a visitor since the night the prisoner was turned out by the police—he was very violent—I have a residence of my own at 21, Park Villa—I have stayed twelve months with the prosecutor—he has paid me no money except travelling expenses when I have been out—I intend to leave him as soon as he has settled some, family affairs—the prisoner, when he told me that Stevens would not come to prove his debt, said, "If you will ask your friend to give me 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and forgive me the debt, I will be the best friend to him in life"—I knew that just now in the witness box, but I did not say it, solely because I had no desire to press against the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman G</hi> 78). On the 27th March I took the prisoner in custody on a warrant, dated September 10th, 1878, for disso<lb></lb>bedience of summons—I had been looking for him some time—I read the warrant to him—he said, "I know nothing about it. Will you come home with me?"—I said, "Yes, I will, but I shall not let you go indoors"—when we got to his house I called down Mrs. Reynolds, and the prisoner said, "Give him a sovereign"—I said, "No"—he said, "How much do you want?"—I said, "What for?"—he said, "You need not see me"—I said nothing, but put him in a cab—while in the cab he said, "You need not say anything about my offering you money. This is a very bad job and it will ruin me; I have had a consultation with a solicitor, and he tells me that they cannot give me much imprisonment, but it will cost me 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for counsels' fees."</p>

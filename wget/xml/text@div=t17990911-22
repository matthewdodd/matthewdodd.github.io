               <p>Q. How long had you been talking to her in the street? - A. She did not say any thing till she came into the house, only she asked me to go into the public-house to give her a drop of drink, we had no talk at all.</p>

               <p>Q. When you left the house, did you agree to go together any where? - A. No, I did not; when we came out of the house, she put her hands in my right hand pocket, and took out my tin box and my discharge, and my notes.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know she took them? - A. By feeling her hands come out of my pocket, and turning the corner with them; I was hardly able to walk, and I could not follow her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find those things again? - A. Yes, the next day, in Little Wild-street, as they told me the name of the street was; she produced my smart ticket out of her bosom to me, and with her pulling it out of her bosom, a five-pound note dropped upon the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that one of your five-pound notes? - A. I cannot tell; after that mother Malony put her hand down into her bosom, or some part, and pulled out six guineas, and two seven-shilling-pieces; she said, if she had her property again, she would not part with it, and I found one of my combs upon the table by the bed where she slept; it was marked so, that if all the combs in London were brought, I can swear to my own comb; there was Fitz marked upon it with a wire red hot; there was nothing else that I could swear to but my comb and my smart ticket.

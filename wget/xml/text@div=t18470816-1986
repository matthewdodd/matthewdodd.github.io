                  </hi> I am in the service of Mr. John Green, an oil and colourman, at Woolwich. On the 5th of Aug., the prisoner came to the shop—he wanted two casks of mustard, and two gallons of mixed pickles—I gave him them from under the counter—he afterwards said he wanted three bill-heads, which I gave him from off the file—he took one, and wrote on it Mr. Vine's name, what was under it I do not know—he said I was to go with him and receive the money—when I got to the Ordnance Arms, he took the mustard, and told me to go on with the pickles to Mr. Vine, at the Dover Castle—When I got there, the pickles were not ordered.</p>

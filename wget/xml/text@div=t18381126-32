                  </hi>. I live at Adams Mews, Edgeware-road, and am foreman to William Nicholls. He is a road contractor—the prisoner was in his employ, and was at work at his wharf—there were some iron strakes there—the prisoner had twelve of them, and had been doing something to them—I missed three of them—I have the three here—I have compared them with the nine remaining, and they exactly correspond.</p>

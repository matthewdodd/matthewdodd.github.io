On the morning of 4th October, about half-past 12, I went to the house of the prisoner Mead at 1, North-wharf-road, Paddington—as I was coming up to the house, I saw Alfred Grantham coming out of it—when he came out I went in—I took Mead in custody on another charge—I saw Alfred Grantham again about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes afterwards; he was coming into Mr. Mead's shop again as I stood at the door; he made a dart back again when he saw me, and looked in at the window; I caught hold of him then; I asked him what he had underneath his slop frock; he did not say—I pulled up his slop and I pulled these out; one brass inscription plate and two small leaden inscription plates, and a part of a lead coffin—Mr. and Mrs. Mead then went behind the counter to a sack of white rags, and they took out three or four more brass inscription plates that were concealed underneath the rags; Mrs. Mead hid them in her dress, and walked into the parlour—I ran into the parlour and took them away from her—I have them here (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—when I came out from the parlour, Mead said to me, "Between man and man, I have got some iron down in the cellar; for God's sake, let me go down and put it over the wall of a neighbour of mine"—Sergeant Potter then came with another constable, Bungay, and we took Mead and Grantham to the station—Grantham said, "I am no worse than the others; some other man gave it to me to sell"—we went back to Mead's shop again, and then</p>

               <p>Sergeant Potter commenced searching to see if he could find any more leaden plates—Alfred Grantham told us the names of two or three men, and we went and apprehended them—he gave the name of Groves and another—he said that Groves and the other man were with others working in the vault all together; that they were all the same; they all had the money, and shared it together in beer—I said to him, "I saw you come out of the shop before; you went in and sold something before"—he said, "What I sold before, Mrs. Mead gave me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for"—we came back to the shop to search, and found about 250lbs. weight of lead coffin and plates altogether—we found some underneath the counter; some of it was packed underneath the shop window; and one more lead plate I found in the sack of white rags where they had taken the others from—I was present when Charles Gran<lb></lb>tham, junior, was being taken to the station-house, and Charles Grantham, senior, also—I heard the elder say, when Bungay took him into custody, and told him what he was charged with, "I have expected this before, and if I had known you had been coming, I would have seen you d—d before I would have come"—he also said he was not the foreman; that Bland was the foreman, and had all the money—he said that he had not got any of the money—Charles Grantham the younger said when he was going along in custody, "There is a man there of the name of Cole; he had as much to do with it as I had; he had as much of the money as I had"—the church is about two minutes' walk from Mead's house—on the 5th, I saw Bland about 12 o'clock at night, going down into Praed-street; I told him that I wanted him; that he was charged with others for being concerned in stealing coffin plates and parts of lead coffins; he said, "I am not Bland at all; you are joking with me"—I told him that he must go with me; he said, "Very well"—he walked about a hundred yards very quietly; he then twisted himself round from me and another constable, and ran away as hard as ever he could; I followed him and took him into custody again in the Irongate-wharf—he said, "It is a bad job; we only did it to make a few shillings to get a drop of beer with."</p>

On the morning of 4th October, I went to Mead's shop; it is a marine-store dealer's shop—I found him and Alfred Grantham in the custody of Doble—I did not say anything to Mead before I took him—I heard Doble charge him with having some brass plates and lead in his possession, and he said, "For God's sake let me go down stairs and put some iron over the wall"—we did not allow him to do so, but took him at once to the station—at the station I asked him whether he kept a book or made any entries—he said he had got none—after leaving him at the station, I went back to the shop—I had left a constable there in charge, with Mead's wife—I proceeded to search—I found six plates, two or three brass, and some leaden plates, all with inscriptions on them—they were concealed under one end of the counter, under some other property—I found some lead, a great quantity of which has been produced here to-day—it has been all in court—I found it at the end of the counter nearest the shop, all packed up under the counter—after taking the lead to the station I asked Alfred Grantham bow he got the lead—he said it was given to him by the men at the vaults, mentioning several of their names—he mentioned the name of Cole, Edinborough, and another who was discharged, of the name of Groves—I apprehended Charles Grantham the younger in the vaults—I told him that he must consider himself in custody for being concerned with others in stealing brass plates and leaden coffins—he said that it was a bad job; and, pointing to a man of the name of Cole who was at work at the top of the steps as we were leaving the vaults, he said, "He has had as much of the money as I have;" I then ordered Cole to be taken, and he was taken and discharged—I went to the vaults again next morning and made an examination of them with Merry—I examined four coffins and I found that the plates had been torn away from the tops of the coffins by tearing them away; three coffins were covered with black cloth, and they had rent the cloth very much in getting one of the plates off—among the plates I found at Mead's, there was one bearing the inscription of Major-General Pilkington; I took that and applied it to the coffin; it corresponded and matched the place in every respect, and also the one now lying on the table, of Thomas Beaman, which I also found at Mead's shop—I applied that to a coffin covered with cloth where the plate was missing, and found it corresponded exactly, and the cloth had been torn by the manner of tearing away the plate.</p>

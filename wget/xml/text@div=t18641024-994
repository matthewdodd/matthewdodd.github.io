I am clerk to James Franks, and another, wholesale tea-dealers, 40, Queen-street, Cheapside—on Saturday, 10th September, I left the premises at quarter-past 9—I locked up the side-door—the assistants had previously fastened the door at the corner, between Queen-street and Maiden-lane—I saw that it was properly secured—Maiden-lane runs on both sides of the warehouse—I fastened up the shop-door, and then went out at the private door in Queen-street, shut it, and turned the key in the padlock, which keeps the bar up—it was double-locked and padlocked—the tea was on the third floor—it was there on the Saturday when I left, stowed away in chests, one upon another, and in caddies—the door of the third-floor room was locked—on the Monday, when I arrived, I found it broken open—I found five bags of tea on the office-floor—900 lbs. bad been removed from the top room; about 600 lbs. were taken away—we hang the keys of the inside doors on the ground floor—I have seen the outside padlock since.</p>

On Monday morning, 12th Sep<lb></lb>tember, I was on my beat in Queen-street, Cheapside—about fifteen minutes to 7 I passed Mr. Franks's warehouse; the doors were then closed—when I got to the bottom of the street, I saw a man standing at the corner of Thames-street and Queen-street—he appeared to be watching my movements—that man was not the prisoner—I went part of the way round my beat, and returned—the man was then gone—I went up College-hill, and looked down Maiden-lane, which runs from the top down to Garlic-hill, past Mr. Franks's warehouse—I then saw the warehouse-door open, and a horse and cart going down the lane, from the warehouse towards Garlic-hill—there was a man leading the horse, and three others walking by the side of it—I turned round again, and went down down College-hill, and along Thames-street to meet them—when I got to Garlic-hill I found the horse and cart standing by the door of the church there—I took the cart round to Messrs. Franks's warehouse-door, and sent for the sergeant—there were six bags of tea in the cart—I could see it was loaded with bags at the time I saw it leaving Franks's warehouse—there was not an interval of more than a minute before I saw them again—I saw the witness Pearson at the time I was going round towards Garlic-hill, coming down Maiden-lane—I could see him coming along towards me—he met me close to Mr. Franks's ware-house-door, when I brought the cart back, and I asked him to stop, as there were thieves, and he did so—I found five other bags, filled with tea, on the ground floor—I took the tea to the station, and sent the cart to the greenyard—there was no name on the cart—it was not a peculiar cart—the horse was a chestnut; it had its knees broken, and was lame of the fore-leg.</p>

               <p>No; I was with him the first part of the rooming, and then I had to go to my work—I was with him till something like 11—I was in the same room with him from 6 to 7 that morning—I know Dennis Clark, a constable—I was not looked up about seven years ago for three weeks for attempting to pick pockets, to my recollection—I have got a bad memory—I can't recollect—that is not the question I am come to answer.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of the last witness—I have known Cole a great many years—on 11th September, about half-past 11 at night my husband and Mr. Holland brought him up stairs very much intoxicated—he slept on some of my petticoats and some of the bed clothes—he remained there till between 8 and 9 the next morning—when I awoke he was there—he had recovered from his drunkenness then—he could not have gone out of the room, the door was locked.</p>

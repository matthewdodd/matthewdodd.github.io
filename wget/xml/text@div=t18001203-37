               <p>Court. Q. How do you know those nails? - A. Only that I know he took them from my door; he was carrying them openly in his hand.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What does he deal in? - A. He is a smith by trade; he came in and asked me if I had got any small wire; I said, no; then he came back a second time, and asked for some small rivers; and then he came back the third time, and asked me if I had got any small nails that would make rivets.(The nails produced that were found in the prisoner's apartment.)</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You do not know those to be your nails? - A. I did not see him take them, but there is my mark upon the pans.</p>
               <p>JOHN ELLIS sworn. - I live just by Mrs. Hill, she keeps an old iron shop; I am a journeyman watchmaker; I was standing at the door, and Mrs. Hill asked me if I would fetch Mr. Jones, the officer, and I did, and we found these three pans of nails in the prisoner's room.</p>
               <p>THOMAS WALKER sworn. - I am a paperstainer, I lodge with Mrs. Hill; I went into the shop, and this man was sitting in a chair, and several persons and Mrs. Hill were asking him to confess where the nails were; at last he did, and we found these three pans of nails in one corner of the cellar where he lived; I know the pans, for I frequently helped Mrs. Hill in with them; that is all I know about it.</p>

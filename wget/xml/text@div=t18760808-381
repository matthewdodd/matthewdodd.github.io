                  </hi>. I am fourteen years of age—I assist my father, a gun maker, at 30, Star Corner, Bermondsey—on 15th July about 12.15, I had been to the bank in Tooley Street for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I received 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver—the gold was placed in a wash-leather bag and the silver in a paper bag; I put them in different pockets—I had been accustomed to go to the bank on Saturdays about the same time—on returning from the bank I had got as far as St. Thomas' Street when the prisoner caught hold of my arms with one hand and put the other hand over my mouth; he dragged me down Vinegar Yard about 6 yards—I tried to call out—another man came up and took the 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold out of my pocket and ran away—the prisoner caught hold of me by the neck and threw me down, and said "I am going to take this money to your master"—they both said that—I fell on the back of my head; it made my head ache—I got up and walked a little way down Vinegar Yard—I called "Stop thief!" and then turned back and ran home and told my father—I then went to the station and told the police—later in the day I went back to the station—I was asked if I could point out the man that had robbed me, and I pointed out the prisoner—I am sure he is the man; I had never seen him before—he had some whiskers on his chin then.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He is the man that held me from behind and the other came in front and took my money, it took a very short time—the prisoner was alone at the station when I saw him—the policeman did not show him to me—I said he was the man.</p>

             sworn. - I am constable and watch-house keeper of St. Pancras: On Sunday morning a person brought this woman to me, on charge of suspicion of stealing a watch; she told me that it belonged to a serjeant in the 15th Light Dragoons, quartered at the One Tun, Charing-cross; it getting towards the evening, I could not go myself; I sent to inquire if that serjeant had lost a watch; that serjeant had not lost a watch, but he knew a man that had lost it, and the prosecutor came and claimed the watch on the Monday; he said he had not had it long, and the hour-hand was broke; I produce the watch.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. That is my watch; I described it before I saw it; I know it to be mine, I bought it the same day; the hour-hand is broke.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was coming through the Strand, just by the back of the New-church: this man passed me, and put his hand on my shoulder, and asked me where I was going; I told him I was going home; he told me I should go with him to his rendezvous; he pushed me up a court; I had told him I would not go up the court; he told me he would give me his watch if I would, and he did. On Sunday morning, I was going up Oxford-street, I had the watch in my hand, and a gentleman said that I had stole the watch; he immediately charged me with a constable, and they took me on suspicion; I kept the watch, and never offered to make away with it; I said to the serjeant, when he came to me at the watch-house, I have got your watch.</p>
               <p>Q. (To the prosecutor.) Were you perfectly sober? - A. I had been drinking a little liquor I do not deny.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you were in such a situation that you could not feel it taken - how long had you been up the court with her? - A. Not above five minutes.</p>

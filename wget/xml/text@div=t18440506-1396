In the latter end of 1842 I was in London—the female prisoner was introduced to me in October that year—she was desirous of becoming a companion to me—no arrangement of that sort was come to—I invited her to stay at my house, and she came—she remained with me from about the 10th of Oct. to the 21st of Nov., or thereabouts, as an inmate—after that she was in the habit of coming to my house as long as I remained in town—I understood from her that she was in very distressed cir<lb></lb>cumstances, and she applied to me to lend her 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for an advertisement just before she left—during the time she was with me she had many times the oppor<lb></lb>tunity of noticing my handwriting—I have heard her say that she could imi<lb></lb>tate any person's handwriting—whilst she was with me I had a banking account at Smith, Payne, and Smith's, of London—she had an opportunity of knowing that—I cannot swear that she did know it, but I have no doubt she did—at this moment I cannot call my recollection with any certainty about it—I was in the habit of drawing checks on that house while she was with me—she generally sat in the same room that I did—I was in the habit of writing my checks upon engraved bank checks—that was not always the case; I have written upon plain paper, and signed it, but that was not "Pay the bearer"—the check produced is not my handwriting, nor was it written by my authority—it is very much like my signature—I have never had any communication with or from the female prisoner since Dec., 1842.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 17, Ranelagh-grove, Pimlico, and am the conductor of an omnibus. The prisoners lodged in the same house for some months—they were lodging there in Feb. last—I see my handwriting on this 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, No. 64252—I received it from my wife who is in a very delicate state of health—I got it changed, and put my name on it at the time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of the A division of police. I took the prisoners into custody on Thursday, the 4th of April—I found them liv<lb></lb>ing at Kingston, in Surrey—Thornton and Kend all were with me—I went alone into the room where they were—I was not in uniform—I found the two prisoners in the room—I beckoned Francis out of the room, and asked who that female was—he said, "She is my wife"—I told him I was a police<lb></lb>officer, and that I should take him into custody for being concerned with that female in committing a forgery on Smith, Payne, and Smith, on the 9th of Jan.—he said, "I can explain that"—I said, "Be cautious what explanation you give"—he said, "I hope it is not known in the house"—he said, "Don't let it be known—she is not my wife"—I then left him in custody of one of the officers, and went into the room where the female was—I told her that I should take her into custody for presenting a forged check to Smith, Payne, and Smith, purporting to have been drawn by Lady Nelthorpe—she said, "I am innocent, what did Mr. Francis tell you?"—I made no answer—that was all she said.</p>

I accompanied Pearce to Kingston—Francis was left in my custody, and while Pearce went into the room he asked me what I knew of the affair—I said, "Very little"—he said, "I knew Smith, Payne, and Smith, were Miss Brown's bankers—I know she went with a check on the 9th, 10th, or 12th—I do not know who paid it—I was not present, but money was placed in my hands—I dare say some of the notes will be traced to me, and so I can trace them"—he said the affair quite staggered him.</p>

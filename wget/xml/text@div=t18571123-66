                  </hi>. I am a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man, and live at No. 10, Upper Cleveland Street, Fitzroy Square. I have been a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man about six years—on Friday, Oct. 30th, about a quarter or half past 10 o'clock, I was on my rank in Tottenham Court Road, and a person of the name of Onslow, whom I had known for about nine months before, spoke to me there, and engaged my <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—in consequence of that he came, with the prisoner Moore, at about 2 o'clock in the morning—my <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> was still on the rank—they got in, and Onslow said, "Drive up Goodge Street"—they pulled me up at Charlotte Place—Moore was in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> at that time—when I got to Charlotte Street, a third party came, and they both got out—the third party appeared after they got out—I could scarcely see where they went, but they were back in half a second—they went in the direction of Charlotte Court—it was scarcely a second or two before they returned—Johnson was the third party, he was with them then—that was the first time I had seen him, to my knowledge—they brought two bags which they carried amongst them, I do not know scarcely which, they were all together; at all events they put them in my <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, the three parties did; who put them in I cannot exactly say, and then Moore and Onslow got in—Johnson did not get in—I saw him again when I got to my residence—when Onslow and Moore got in, I asked where I was to drive to, and Onslow said, "Oh! go on;" I said, "Where to?"—he said, "Where you please;" I said, "I don't like that; have you got my fare?"—he said, no, he had not; he said, "Well, I must leave the things in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>; I have no money to pay you; you know me, and if you take care of these things, we will fetch them in the morning, and pay you"—I had known Onslow as a man in the capacity of rubbing up <hi rend="italic">cabs</hi>—I went to my own house with the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> and the goods, and took the bags in them—I suppose it was about a quarter past 2 o'clock then, or something like that—after I had left the bags at my house, I went to take the horse and <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> home to the stables—I said to Moore and Onslow that I was going home; they said they were going my way, and they rode to the corner of the yard—when I had put up my <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> I came out, and saw a fellow servant of mine, named Sleigh, and I walked home with him—I got home, I should think, about 3 o'clock—Moore and Onslow followed me, and another one with them—I think that was Johnson; I could not be certain, because they followed on the other side of the way—they followed me right to my door—they did not speak to me there—I went in and went to bed, and I saw them no more till the next morning, when I saw Johnson and Moore about half past 6 o'clock—they walked into my place, and I was in bed; they undid one of those bags and counted out a quantity of shoes, I should think 100 pairs, and they invited my wife to have a pair of shoes, and likewise the children; they said</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185711230091"></xptr>
               <p>there were plenty—of course it was refused—she said, "If you do not take those things away, I shall certainly fetch some one that will"—they both assured me that it was perfectly right, that there was no occasion to fear at all—they then went out—they had only stopped while they were counting the shoes, it might be ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—I was in bed while they were there—I got up after they were gone, and dressed myself—one of them, Moore, I think, brought another party in to look at the things—it appeared that they could not agree—nothing was said or done in my presence; they came into my kitchen, I was there—the third party looked over the shoes, and then they walked out together—they stopped there about a quarter of an hour doing that, and then Johnson came back directly, and took a pair of boots with him—Moore and Johnson were both in the kitchen when the third party was looking at the things—they left after that—I did not go to the police directly—Johnson came back the second time with some gin and beer—after that he went out again, and then I went down to Mr. Meller's, where I had picked these things up from—I saw Mr. Meller opening the shop, and saw him look aghast to see the things gone; I saw two inspectors, Pethers and Lambert, and I gave information to them of what had occurred, to Lambert, I think it was, and in conse<lb></lb>quence of that they came along with me.</p>

About half past 7 o'clock on the morning of 31st Oct. last I was outside the premises of Mr. Meller, in Charlotte Court, Goodge Street, and Smith made a communication to me—from what he said, I went to Cleveland Street, where I could command a view of his house—I went there about a quarter to 8 o'clock, and remained there till about a quarter past 10—it was nearly 8 o'clock when he spoke to me—I had examined the prosecutor's premises; I had been called to the matter—I saw Johnson admitted into No. 10, Upper Cleveland Street; that is Smith's house—he occupies the kitchen there—I followed him into the kitchen; and when there, told him I charged him with being concerned with others in stealing a quantity of boots from No. 16, Charlotte Street, Goodge Street, at the same time pointing to two sacks of boots that were lying on the floor of the kitchen—he replied, "There are others in it besides me; I only assisted in putting them in and out of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>"—he did not say anything more—I took possession of the property—the bulk has been given to Mr. Meller—I took Johnson into custody, and remained in the premises till Moore came, and another man who has escaped—he was not Onslow, I have every reason to believe—I do not know Onslow, but the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man knew him well; he was there at the time, and he said it was not Onslow—when</p>

               <p>these two men came, they stamped at the railings outside the kitchen—I told the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man to admit them—he went up and admitted them, and directly he admitted them he ran away, leaving the two men to come down of their own accord—I told the constable, 68, Lambert, to follow the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man, and he took Moore into custody, and the other escaped—if we had had the assistance of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man we should have captured them both—I did not hear either of the men say anything when they came.</p>

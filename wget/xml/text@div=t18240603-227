            ; on Thursday, the 6th of May, the prisoner brought a cart load of oats to the stables - he should have brought twenty sacks - he had a man from a coal-waggon with him. I was backwards and forwards; but after I had seen two sacks shot I went away for some little time. He asked me to count the empty sacks, but I had not time. I saw some oats, which appeared to be of the same quality, at Mrs. Catharine's, in the Mews, and brought a sample back with me.</p>

            . I am the wife of the last witness; the prisoner brought some oats - my husband called me, and I went to see them shot. I saw sixteen sacks shot - my husband came back just as Greenfield had done shooting them, and he asked him to stop and see the sacks counted, which he could not do. I had remarked when he came to the fourth or fifth sack, that he put down two sacks instead of one. I was in a loft where he could not see me. I staid there all the time; there could not be more than nineteen sacks delivered at any rate; when he went away, there was a sack of oats lying in the cart, and the others over it - while the men were gone into the public-house, I went to the cart, and saw the oats - they drove the cart, to Mrs. Catharine's, in London-mews. I saw it stop there and turn round. I do not think they saw me at all.</p>

               <p>"Those delivered at Mrs. Catharine's" - he said, he knew no such person. I said,</p>

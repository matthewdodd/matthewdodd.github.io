            . I am a journeyman baker. On the 16th of July, about a quarter before twelve o'clock, I saw the prisoner and another man with a basket of bread; there were eight loaves in the basket; I followed them, the other man was carrying the basket, and the prisoner followed him about twenty yards behind; they turned round Wimpole-street, and went on almost to Oxford-street; I met the policeman, and gave them in charge; they went on to Bond-street; the prisoner turned round and saw me and the policeman; he put the basket down at a shop window, the other man went away; the prisoner had lived fellow servant with me about two years ago; he was secured.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I asked you whether the basket belonged to you. Witness. Yes, you did - I never heard the policeman say he would not take you in charge.</p>

             (police-constable 25 D). I was called by Mr. Newman on the 16th of July, and saw the prisoner carrying the basket - I took him into custody - I asked him whether the basket belonged to him, he said it belonged to him and his mate, the other man ran away when he saw me - I took the prisoner while he was putting the basket off his shoulder.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was not the basket turned round at a shop window, and you asked me if I was minding it? Witness. No; I saw you put it there - I did not say I would not take the charge; I held you by the collar; you could not have got away.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was out of work, and I asked a man if he knew of a place, he said, "Come with me and mind my basket, I will give you part of my dinner;" I did so; he turned down the basket and told me to mind it - the officer came and asked whose it was, I said it belonged to a man who was gone down Bond-street - Newman then came up, and said I had stolen it - the policeman said, as he did not see me take it he could not take the charge.</p>
               <p>JURY to OLIVER. Q. What has become of the old woman? A. I don't know; I only saw her at the corner of the street; she attended at the office, but was not bound over.</p>

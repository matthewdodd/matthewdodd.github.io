                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you worth 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at the time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and more—I sometimes get 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-week by selling flour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I ask you again, have you ever been rejected at bail? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never went in—I would not go in to be rejected—I never attempted to bail any one but Miss Bills—a certain person came into Court, and said, "If you go into Court to bail Miss Bills, I shall oppose you"—I would not go—I said, "If that is what you mean, Sir, I am gone"—I would not be pulled to pieces by the Court—I have been in many Courts, and have been in this, but I have not bailed or attempted to bail any body for the last five or six years—I never was rejected as bail, for I had from 7000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to bail any body at one time—I was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183503020032"></xptr>
               <p>never rejected as bail, to my knowledge, but really I cannot positively swear it, but I do not believe I ever was in my life—I never remember such a thing occurring.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What business had you at the Bail Court on this occasion, the 25th of November? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had been to Westminster to receive some money of a person named Foulkes, and as I passed, I merely called in, nothing more—I knew Warren before several years—I knew Brookes by sight be<lb></lb>fore—I have spoken to him, but I do not know that I spoke three words to him in my life—I never knew him, or spoke to him, till within twelve months—I will swear I have not spoken twenty times to him within the last twelve months—I never saw Griffiths before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came you to stay to see this transaction? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They asked me to go and have a drop of something to drink—they had no money to pay for it—that was at the Horse-shoe and Stump, in the Westminster-road—that was after we went out of the Bail Court.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What caused you to be a witness of this transaction in the Bail Court? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I merely called as I came by, to see what was going forward—I am partial to hearing trials, and have been so all my life, and when I came into the passage, there was Warren—it was purely accidental that I came by and went in—I lent him some money afterwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you mean to tell the Jury just now that you saw Warren affix to the affidavit a false name, swear to the affidavit, and suffered the Court to be imposed on by that fraud? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I knew nothing at all about it till they were parting the money, when they quarrelled and exposed one an<lb></lb>other—I knew nothing of the matter when I saw Warren write the name of "Daniels"—I asked him what he meant by it—he said it was all right, and a matter of course—I knew nothing of the transaction—I asked Warren, when he was swearing the affidavit, what was the meaning of all that—he said, "Oh, it is all right"—I saw him sign the name of "John Daniels," or to that effect—I did not know him as Daniels, but that was nothing to me—I heard him say that was his name and handwriting—I saw the officer administer the oath.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not advance your money to complete the fraud? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I lent him the money to get the discharge—I lent no money at the Bail Court—I would not lend money to assist in a fraud—I never knew of the fraud—I did not know what they were about, or that they were doing wrong, till they shared the money next day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You heard a man perjure himself by assuming a false name, and a residence you knew to be untrue? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had nothing to do with that—I staid in Court on purpose to hear what they would do—he told me he had 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year left him, and as he owed me 180<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I <hi rend="italic">cocked</hi> my ear, and tnought I should get some of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>all done in one day—I saw Warren the same night as the bail was given—I did not know but what he had removed, as he swore he lived at the house where Brookes lodged—I went to his house the very night the bail was given—I found him in the Surrey-road—I had nothing whatever to do with the transaction—I pledge my word I never knew it was a fraud con<lb></lb>templated, though I had suspicion—never till they divided the money, and quarrelled about it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I think you said the person at the King's Bench, (Vernon,) gave them 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. He gave it to Warren—I lent my money to Warren—Brookes had some, and Sheridon had some—it was to pay for different things, the day after the bail was given in—I lent the money to them the day after the bail justified—I did not know it was a false oath—Griffiths might have been worth ten thousand pounds for what I know—Warren re<lb></lb>presented his mother had left him 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How did the attorney, Mr. Pocock, find you out? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I heard there was an inquiry made—they did not pay their reckoning at the public-house—I lent them money to pay, but they did not pay all—I paid for all I called for at the public-house—after I paid my money, they called for some<lb></lb>thing on their own account, and 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was set up to their reckoning, which they went away and did not pay—I paid the money, and Warren was to pay again—I did not pay the 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I first saw Mr. Pocock, the prosecu<lb></lb>tor's attorney, about six weeks or two months ago—I think it was before Christmas—I heard there was an inquiry being made after the parties, and asked my attorney, David Passmore Taylor, about it, and another gentleman in Sergeant's Inn—I have been a bankrupt ten or twelve years ago—I have got my certificate—I had a docket struck against me afterwards—I had my certificate signed by my creditors before I came away from the bankrupts' office—that was ten or twelve years ago—I had a docket struck against me after<lb></lb>wards—Young, a corn-factor, was petitioning creditor—Archer and Miller were petitioning creditors under the first commission—the last commission was never worked through—they offered to do it away altogether if I would pay the expense they had gone to, for they struck the docket on an accom<lb></lb>modation bill I neverowed—I dealt in accommodation bills at that time pretty largely—I have not done so lately—not within the last twelve months, to my knowledge—I have not got a bill in existence at all that I know of—I was never in the Fleet Prison nor King's Bench—I was once, or perhaps twice, in the Marshalsea—I will swear it was not three times—I was seven<lb></lb>teen days in Whitecross-street once, for the very bill I had the docket struck against me—I justified it out—I was never in Horsemonger-lane in my life as a prisoner—I never was arrested for debt except what I have said—I was once indicted for a Bill of Exchange that my son Thomas discounted—the opposite party swore it was my son James discounted the bill—I was indicted and tried in this Conrt—Mr. Phillips was my counsel—I was discharged without calling witnesses, or going to a Jury—the Jury would not suffer the Judge to sum it up—I was discharged, and the money was paid to my son for the bill—I surrendered at Newgate to take my trial—I was not charged with forgery—I was charged with perjury, in giving evidence on a Bill of Exchange, but the parties afterwards paid the bill—I should have indicted them if they had not paid it—I was never in any other gaol, to my knowledge.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When was the last time you were in gaol? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> At the Marshalsea, about two years ago—I have never been in confinement since that, to my knowledge—I am sure I was not in gaol in July last year.</p>

               <p>Pocock; did you go to him, or he come to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I can hardly tell you—I know if he did not come to me he was making inquiry, and I think I was advised to call on Mr. Pocock—I had nothing to do with the quarrel<lb></lb>ling among the prisoners—I got 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., I think—I swear I had not a far<lb></lb>thing more—I saw the money paid away, and Warren kept the remainder—I did not consult my attorney till sereral weeks after the quarre—I had not seen Warren in the interim—I might have seen him since—I will swear I had not seen him ten times—I had nothing to do with Warren—I might have seen him once—I went to Mr. Pocock—I went to the coal-mer<lb></lb>chant once—I did not know who his attorney was—I heard the name of Pocock, when they quarrelled—I never had the notice in my hand which was sworn to be served on Pocock—I saw Brookes hand the brief to Mr. Heaton, and Warren one to Mr. Ball—I saw it done, but I am not going to swear the names that were on them—I saw the name of Palmer on the notice paper—Brookes handed Mr. Heaton the paper—I saw the paper in the public-house—I am not going to swear about Palmer's name being on it, but when they went for the discharge, Brookes was to sign "Palmer."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What induced you to go to Pocock, the coal-merchant, was it to do justice? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> For the purpose of doing justice to myself, as I was in their company—the publican charged me with their bill, and I would not pay it—I went to Mr. Pocock to exonerate myself—I was not to receive any money from Mr. Pocock, or his clerks—I was subpoened here—I was not threatened to be indicted—I had 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. with the subpoena, which is the regu<lb></lb>lar thing—I have not received any money but that.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi>. I am included in this indictment. In November last, I had transactions with Mason—I did not know him before—he was in the King's Bench prison when I saw him—I went on business into the prison, and a Mr. Hutchinson introduced me to him—Mason told me he was confined there for £250, and wished he could get two bail who could justify him out—I undertook to get two persons—I gave notice to Mr. Pocock, the solicitor, of the bail I had found—on examining them, I found they were not sufficient, and would not take them into Court—I afterwards saw Mason in the prison on the subject, and told him the bail had failed to justify—he seemed very much disappointed, and wished me to employ others, if I possibly could, who could get him out—I told him it was very difficult to get two bail who could justify for so large a sum—he said he did not care how it was done, as long as it was done, and he wished to know if I could get two bail, that we might <hi rend="italic">buff</hi> it—he said some thing to that amount—the meaning of that is, to get two men, no matter what they are, and to swear they have served notice, when it was not served—I said I would do no such thing, and never did such a thing in my life—I said I would have nothing more to do with it—after this inti<lb></lb>mation from Mason I saw Brookes a few days afterwards—he asked me if I had been engaged for Mr. Mason—I said I had, and that I put in two bail, which could not justify—he told me be could find two that could justify for 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each—I told him Mason would be very glad to treat with him, or any body else, on the subject, if he could do it, and he was at liberty to go to him, if he liked—Brookes and I parted—I went to the King's Bench prison every day, having some friends there I used to go to see every day—I saw Mason again—I went in consequenca of a messange—I saw him in Mr. Purcell's room, where he was dining—he told me there wers two persons there, named Gray and Warren, who were ac<lb></lb>quaintances of Mr. Purcell's, and they were to be his bail, and came to inquire whether the money was lodged—I said I did not know them—Mason said the bail wanted money to pay the justification—I told him not to give them any thing, but to send some person down to the Court to pay it—he said he had nobody he could confide in, except his mother—he had nobody to send to her, as it was rather late in the evening, and re<lb></lb>quested I would meet her down there to see that it was right—I agreed to do so at the public-house called the Magpie and Stump—I did not see Mason after this conversation—I saw him after the justification, on the same day—in the evening of that day I saw him in company with Warren, Trussell, and Hackham—Warren wanted money to take out the order—they had none, as Mason's friends left me before the justification—Mason said he would give him no money till he brought the discharge—Warren was very angry, and went away without any money—Mason asked me about it—I said he had better pay—he said he would not till he had the</p>

               <p>order—he said he wished to have the discharge on the morrow, and he would give an additional sum, and he wished me to go after him, and say so—I saw Mason the next day—Mason, Warren, Griffiths, and Gmy were with me at the King's Bench prison—Griffiths had the discharge in his pocket—they said they would not give up the discharge—Gray advised Griffiths not to do so till he got his money, till the bail got their money—I saw some money paid by the man in the tap-room, to Warren—Mason, and Griffiths, Warren and I were present—Gmy was sitting in Purcell's room.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came you to say "to that amount?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know that I used the word—it was to that amount—I did not mean those words.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Whet word did not you mean? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The gentleman says, I said "to <hi rend="italic">buffet it</hi>," or words to that amount—I said Mason was very much disappointed that they could not justify, and said he would give any money to get it, and could not I get two bail that could <hi rend="italic">buffet</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> He said that at once? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he asked if I could get two bail to get him out; and I said it would be difficult to get</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183503020037"></xptr>
               <p>persons to so large an amount; and then he said, could not I get two per<lb></lb>sons that could <hi rend="italic">buffit</hi>—I think that followed immediately—he did not say any thing else that I recollect—after the bail had been justified, I went to the public-house, as the parties were waiting there to take some refresh<lb></lb>ment—I had met the other parties there, who were waiting for me—they were writing affidavits and instruction for counsel to support the bail—I had not the slightest notion of any fraud—Mr. Brookes told me he could get two bail to the amount of 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each—I told Mason that I thought it had been regularly procured.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When was it you expressed your opinion that the bail was regularly procured? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That was the night on which they told me that Warren and Gray had called upon me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know that it is a very common thing to give money to persons who are capable of becoming bail, to induce them to become bail? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I know that a great deal of bail is put in at Westminster by that means, and those persons either render their princi<lb></lb>pals or pay the money—I believe Gray and Warren were the two persons whom Brookes procured as bail, but he did not bring them—I suspected they could not be the persons, and I mentioned it to Mr. Brookes, and he said they could bail for double that—Mason was in prison at that time, he could not know this, except he asked them—there was nothing in the transaction that I could detect, as being one of fraud—up to the time it was disclosed to me, I had no idea of fraud—Warran stated to Mason in the open yard, htat the bail had been <hi rend="italic">buffed</hi>, and Mason said he did not care how it had been done, so long as he was discharged—I do not know that Mason knew what had passed in the Bail Court.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a barrister. I was in the King's Bench Court when the bail was justified—I was counsel on the occasion to oppose the bail—I cannot say particularly at what hour I received the brief—it was after the regular justification of bail was over—I do not recollect who delivered the brief to me—I know the defendant Brookes—I took a technical objection in my opposition, and waived it at the request of Brookes—I have written to that effect on the brief—that refreshes my memory of the transaction—I have no doubt it was a valid objection—the Judge seemed desirous I should waive it, as it was beside the merits of the case—to the best of my belief, Brookes mentioned Mr. Pocock's name to me, as if Mr. Pocock wished it to be waived—that it was the wish of Mr. Po<lb></lb>cock, that I should wave all objections—previous to that, some lapse of time had taken place in consequence of the argument on the objection—it was after that lapse of time that I was spoken to by Brookes to waive the objec<lb></lb>tion, and the impression on my mind is, that he said it was Pocock's desire—Mr. Ball was counsel on the other side—the bail justified—I am not sure whether the brief was given to me in the passage, or in the Court—when I went into the Court the regular business was proceeding—I had not the least idea of any thing irregular having taken place till Mr. Pocock came to my chambers about it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi>. I signed this paper—(<hi rend="italic">this was affixed to the instructions to oppose the bail</hi>)—it is a notice of bail; but when I signed it, it was not affixed to either brief.</p>

               <p>made the affidavit in the name of "John Daniels?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have been led to believe Gray did make it, I have been informed so—I was not pre<lb></lb>sent—I do not know Warren's or Gray's handwriting.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Brookes</hi>. A summons was taken out by Mason's attorney after he got out, to change the attorney, (Palmer)—I met Sheridon one day, he told me he had given a consent from Palmer to Mason's attorney. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. I never said so.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever represent yourself as knowing Palmer, and having given his consent? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Never; I said, a summons was taken out to change the attorney, and I was asked if I knew such a person; I said I did not—I wrote Palmer's name from a copy which I had before me, and thought I was doing every thing right and proper.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Griffiths's Defence.</hi> You will find in some part of the proceedings, that I have been completely led into it—I was called on by Warren to become bail for Mason—it is said I have no property to bail with—I am a free-holder, and occupy a house in Fetter-lane—I became bail for Mason—I had no knowledge, until Pocock called on me, that any thing wrong had been practised on me—I did not feel myself bound to satisfy him on all my proceedings—it was the only case I ever became bail for any body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Brookes's Defence.</hi> About the middle of November, Sheridon met me in Chancery-lane, and asked me to introduce him to two respectable persons to justify for about £200—I gave him the names Thomas Gray and Mat<lb></lb>thew Griffiths, and their addresses—I had justified bail for him before, both out of Whitecross-street and other prisons—on the 24th of Novem<lb></lb>ber, the last day but one in term, I met Sheridon in Chancery-lane—I am in the habit of attending Chancery-lane and the coffee-houses—he has met me there repeatedly—I have known him nine months—he said, "I wish you would call early to-morrow morning on the two bail you gave me the other day—I have given their names, and I have given them notice to be at Westminster, at a quarter past nine o'clock—I have seen them myself—I told them Mason was a respectable merchant, and all the particulars"—in the morning I called on Gray, who lives in Brook-street, Lambeth—I live in the same street—he was not at home, but left word for me to call on Warren, at No. 4, Surrey-road, who was going with me to West<lb></lb>minster, and he would be there as soon as me—I did so—we proceeded to Westminster-hall, at least, to a public-house, and there saw Sheridon and Mrs. Mason, and this gentleman sitting opposite Mrs. Mason—Sheridon said, "Brookes, I am afraid you are too late—why were you not earlier?—sit down and copy this for me—yon write quick, and this copy is quite dirty"—I copied the notice, and he said, "While I run down to the Court, will you draw the affidavit of service?"—I did so—he came back, and said, "Make haste—we are just in time"—I took the bail-piece—he left me to finish the affidavit of service—he took Griffiths and Warren down to Mr. Justice Littledale's clark, at the back of the Court, to acknowledge the bail—he was gone longer than I expected—I said, "Why have you been so long? here is the brief for counsel"—he said I had not written a <hi rend="italic">precipie</hi>, as he called it, of the bail-piece, which should have been left with the Judge's clerk—he wrote that himself—I expected the Judge's clerk would have produced the paper here—I went down with him—Warren was there already—he had taken the bail into the Court—Warren went first, Griffiths followed—I went down, and saw Sheridon give the brief to Mr. Thessiger</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183503020043"></xptr>
               <p>—I saw Mr. Thessiger hand the brief over to Mr. Ball—Mr. Ball called Mason's bail, and the usher said it was too late—a gentleman said it was the last day of term—the Judge said at the rising of the Court he would take it, or if then was any opposition, it might be called on any time in the day—Sheridon went back to Mrs. Mason, and told her it was too late, and we must keep the bail there all day till the rising of the Court—Mrs. Mason said she would go, and leave that gentleman to advance the money to Sheridon, as it was wanted to pay the Court fees—he paid 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for putting in bail to one of hit own actions—he did not give Mr. Thessiger the fee, but I saw him give it to Mr. Ball—the gentleman was tired of waiting—Sheridon said, "Why, Brookes, they have not ap<lb></lb>peared to oppose the bail, perhaps they do not mean to oppose it?"—he has always conducted the law business, and I am sorry to say, though I knew it was not legal, I was instrumental in producing bail to him at times—I had no idea but he had, as usual, given notice—he had shown me notice of two men before, one named Farmer, and the other Nelson—he did not think them sufficient, and did not justify—he said, "Here is a gentleman, who will go down to any counsel?" as the Judge said, if opposed, it should be heard—I then wrote the notice—the one notice had been given to Mr. Ball; he pretends he drew the notice from a copy, but he drew the notice, and I at the same time made a remark, "I will go down and see if any body I know it there"—I met Mr. Heaton coming out of the Court—a gentleman and I went down—I introduced him to Mr. Heaton—he gave Mr. Heaton the copy of the notice, and the brief and fee—Mr. Heaton went and spoke to Mr. Ball, and the gentleman said, "I am afraid it will not come on till four o'clock, I will be back by then"—he did not come back—Mr. Ball called the bail, and Mr. Heaton said he was in<lb></lb>structed to oppose the bail, which he did—after the justification, Gray and Warren went over to the King's Bench, to Mason—he said, "I will go over and see if Mason will give some money, now we have justified"—She<lb></lb>ridon went over with him, and they came back and said Mason would not part with any money—Mason said he would not believe Warren was one of the bail, and would give no money till the discharge came—next morn<lb></lb>ing Warren met me and Gray at the public-house, Fleet-street, to procure the discharge—Sheridon said, "I will not go up to the Rule Office, for I am known there"—I had no reason to suppose any thing was wrong, there<lb></lb>fore it is a conspiracy against me, by Gray and Sheridon—I said, "Very well; here, Gray, I will show him as far as the office"—he went and paid the money, came down, and said, "I have got the Rule"—Sheridon said, "You must send down to the signer of the writ, and get the discharge"—I went as far as the King's Bench prison—they went and came out, and said, instead of 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., all they could get was 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Vernon, but Mason had made up 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. out of his own pocket—we went to the pub<lb></lb>lic-house in the Blackfriars'-road, and the money was divided—Warren said, "I shall detain 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. "—he paid Gray, who had borrowed half-a-sovereign at the public-house, which I forgot to mention, at the Gibraltar, in order to pay the expenses, and he received 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for his trouble—so he was right in saying he received 23<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he grumbled at it, saying, "I was the whole and sole person in bringing it forward"—as to Mason knowing any thing of it, I am sure he could not, for Gray was not in the King's Bench till the justification, and Mason knew nothing about him—it was Sheridon asked me to find him two respectable persons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Warren</hi>. I am in a very awkward situation—I never thought Gray</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183503020044"></xptr>
               <p>could have shown his face in this Court—I solemnly declare I never put my hand to paper—I certainly gave my address in Brook-street—I did so for the best of reasons—I gave the account of my property in Bedford-shire—I have been keeping the Rising Sun, in Slater-street, and have not been to No. 4, Brook-street, where my mother lives, tor some time—Gray fell out with me about the public-house score, which Mason's friend, who was with his mother, ought to have paid.</p>

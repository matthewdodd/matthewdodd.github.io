                  </hi>. I am a general dealer, and live at 14, Reddock's Buildings, Finsbury—on 1st April I was drinking at the Rose and Crown with two other gentlemen—I met the prisoner there, we were not all drinking together—I left the public-house about 11. 45 at night, at the same time as the prisoner—I believe I shoved him—I knew him as a bricklayer's labourer—we got about twenty yards from the house—to the best of my belief I shoved him several times as I was going along—I was rather the worse for liquor—I believe I struck at him several times—he said "Will you be quiet"—being very drunk I did not take particular notice of that, and I shoved him again—I then felt a kind of tug in my stomach—I said "I am stabbed"—I did not hear him say anything before that—I found I was bleeding, and I laid myself down on the stones—I was taken to the hospital and was there nine weeks within three days.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I may have hit him several times—he had a knife in his hand at the public-house, cutting a piece of wood—I had been talking to one or two of my friends there; I might have had a dispute with one—the prisoner was not walking home with me, he was going the same way—I had no dispute with him in the public-house, 'nor with any one that I am aware of—after I struck him he walked away and I followed him—I was very much intoxicated and did not know what I was about, or else I should not have struck him—I believe I pushed him in the chest or somewhere about there—I heard him say "Let us take him to the doctor"—this was in Spital Square; it is rather dark there.</p>

                  </hi>. On 1st April I was in Spitalfields, and saw the prisoner and prosecutor together; they were in a fighting attitude—I was only there about two minutes—I did not see any blows exchanged—I saw the prisoner pull out a knife from his pocket and open it, and he said "You b----, I will rip your guts up," and he plunged it into his bowels—there are two lamps there—I was able to see, it was opposite the watch-box—the prosecutor dropped on the ground, and the prisoner ran away—I was not near enough to see what sort of a knife it was, I saw him open it—I did not hear the prosecutor say anything—the policeman and some man helped to take him to Dr. Phillips at the corner of the square.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I can't say which pocket he took the knife from, or what the knife was like—I did not hear the prisoner say "Let us take him to the doctor's," he ran away directly the policeman came up.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a house-surgeon at the London Hospital—the prosecutor was brought there on the 1st April—he had a wound immediately above his left groin, from which a part of the contents of the abdomen pro<lb></lb>truded, not the bowels, but that part which covers it, the lining—I treated him as the case required; he stayed in the hospital till 12th May, to my knowledge—he is not quite recovered; he now has what we expected he would have, a rupture forming on that spot; it is a permanent injury, he is wearing a truss for it now, and will be obliged to wear it always.</p>

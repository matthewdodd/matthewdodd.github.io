                  </hi>. I am a salesman to Messrs. Inwood and Co.m, the prosecutors—on 16th June prisoner came into the shop and told me he wanted goods for an advance note, which he showed me—I said, "You had better go to the City and see Mr. Campbell, my brother"—he said, "I will," and went away—he came back and asked if Mr. Inwood was in—I said, "No, he has gone away, but will be back in a little time if you will wait," but he said he could not, so I agreed to show him the goods, and he chose goods value 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I gave him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—that is the note he gave me (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I gave it to the cashier, and the goods were sent to the prisoner next morning.</p>

I am cashier for Inwood and Campbell—I received the advance note produced from the last witness on 16th June, and gave him the change—I took the goods next day, and got the prisoner to sign the receipt for them—I then called the policeman, and gave him in charge for obtaining goods by means of a false advance note—he said, "Oh, nonsense," or something of that sort.</p>

He said,</p>

I returned to my lodgings and waited there. They were brought, and then the constable came and took me in custody on the charge. It appears that when the note was presented at Messrs. Bailey and Leatham's it was pronounced a forgery."</p>

            . I am journeyman to the prosecutor. On Saturday the 6th of May, the prisoner and I were attending in the shop, while the others were at breakfast: I left the counter, to go to another part of the shop, to a canister of tea, and in the mean time, there came a child in to be served: I saw the prisoner weigh her tea out of a canister, and some sugar out of a tray; I saw it was a small parcel; I imagine he gave her change out of a six-pence; I saw him put his hand into the till to give her change: as she was going out at the door, I observed his hand, and went up to him, and was determined to see what he had in his hand; I laid hold of his hand, and he opened it: I took out three shillings from it, and said I was surprized he should go to do so. I took the money into the counting house, to the young man that was at breakfast, and left it there: it was made known to my master; but I attended in the shop, and did not hear him examined.</p>
               <p>Mr. Charlton. I am a constable, and was sent for to take charge of the prisoner; he was in the counting house, and three shillings lying before the prosecutor, on the tea table. Mr. James charged him with taking the money out of his till; he acknowledged he did take it; and upon the other servant's saying he suspected he once stole half a guinea, the prisoner owned he had stole a 5 s. 3 d. and a shilling, at separate times.</p>

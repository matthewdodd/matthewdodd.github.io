               <p>On the 24th of July I lost some linen; it was from my own house, where I live. I lost two shirts, a sheet, two flowered muslin caps, a pair of white stockings, a check frock, a silk handkerchief, a cotton handkerchief, and a bed-gown.</p>
               <p>Q. What may be the value of them altogether? - About 10s. or 12s. My wife on the 24th of May sent down the prisoner with part of these things to wash in the wash-house; in a little time after my wife went down, and missed her and the things too; directly after that we went after the woman where she said she lived, in Catherine Wheel Alley, Whitechapel; we could not find her out there.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to trust her with these things? - She was a charewoman; I sent my wife to Spitalfields to look or a woman to nurse the child, or to do about the house, and she brought the prisoner.</p>

               <p>I live with a pawnbroker in Barbican.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner ever bring any thing to pawn? - I cannot swear that she did it; I have some things that were pawned that the prosecutor swore to, but I don't know who brought them.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. This cap is mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was hired by this woman as a charewoman on Monday; I was to have six-pence a day, and to find myself; I was there chareing three days; the fourth day was the washing day, and I had the things in the wash-house to wash; on the fourth day I went to empty out a little dirty water, and a woman came to inform me that my child was very bad in the poor- house, and I went to see my child, and left the door open, because there was no fasten- ing to it; and when I went to the poorhouse I begged leave to stop that evening, which I did, and the next morning I returned to this woman again; after this I went into the country a fortnight to hay- making, and when I came back Mr. Houghton took me up on this charge, and took my bed-gown off my back, and said it was his property. I am a poor widow woman, I must leave it to God and your mercy.</p>

               <p>On the 20th of March I went as a servant to Mr. Russell; he said it was a custom with him to settle with his servants the first of every month for their board wages; accordingly he paid me up to the first of April; on the first of April, not having money enough to support me for my board wages till the month expired, I pawned some of these stockings; when I gave Mr. Russell my bill, on the first of May, he paid me; he said he was going into the country; I did not redeem the stockings from this place that day; the next time I gave him a bill of 3 l. 6 s. 6 d. for board wages for a month, and other things laid out; he did not pay me; I asked him for the money; he not making me any answer the second time I asked him for it, that was the third of June, I called Mr. Russel from the dining room to the bed room; I said I was distressed for money, and therefore had been obliged to leave some of his stockings in pledge; he never missed them nor I believe had any suspicion of their being in pledge till I told him; it I had meant to have defrauded him of the stockings, I should imagine no man will suppose I should have produced the duplicate of the stockings.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Russell. Did he tell you of all the stockings?</p>
               <p>Russell. When he was delivering over the things he had in charge after I had dismissed him my service, when he came to the drawer in which these stockings were deposited, before he opened the drawer, he said, Sir, I ask your pardon, but I have been a little distressed for money, I have pawned your stockings, if you will give me money in part of my wages, I will go and redeem them; I said nothing; I told him to give me an account of the things.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say how many he had pawned?</p>
               <p>Russell. He said all the stockings missed out of that drawer were pawned; I knew nothing of the ruffles being pawned till they were produced before the Justice.</p>

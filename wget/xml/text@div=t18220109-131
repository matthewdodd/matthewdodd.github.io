On the 7th of January, at half-past seven o'clock, at night, I saw my watch and keys hanging in my bureau bedstead in the parlour, where I sleep; I rent the house, and let lodgings; a person came and took a a lodging, and the prisoner came while I was out, as his wife. I came home at ten minutes past twelve o'clock, and missed the watch, and inquired for it in a loud voice; two young men slept on the first floor, and the prisoner slept in the same room, I went up and asked the young men what they had done with it, she heard me, and made answer, that the boys were as innocent of the watch as a child unborn; I turned round, and said,</p>
               <p>"Then you know something of the watch," she said nothing, and I said, you shall go into custody, she wanted me to search her, but I would not; I went down stairs for a watchman, went up again in two minutes, and she was out of bed, dressing herself; I have not found it, it was worth 3 l. I had it a year and a half, the seals were worth 4 l. Her husband passed by the name of Johnson.</p>

            . I am wife of the last witness; a man named Johnson came to lodge with us, he was there three nights before this happened; the prisoner came about half-past ten o'clock, on this night for the first time, she sat down by the fire in the room, where the watch was, for an hour; I saw it about half-past eleven o'clock, she and Johnson were then in the room, nobody else - the watch was missed when my husband came home; a knock came at the door about half-past eleven o'clock, I went to see who was there, and left a little boy, (Habitt), sitting in the chair, and while I was standing at the shop-door, Johnson went out at the private door, I have not seen him since; I had no reason to suppose, he was going out - I said, I must go and make my bed, the prisoner then said,</p>
               <p>"Please to give me a light, and I will go to bed; and said to the little boy, my husband is gone into the yard, I wish you would tell him to come up." I said, No, your husband is gone out. Habit went down to see for him, for she would have it, that he was in the yard, he came up and said, he was not there; she then began to cry, and said it was, because she did not give him money to send for beer and things - she then asked for a light, and said, she would go to bed, for he would come in in an hour or two - he never returned. She went up to bed crying, and said, he was always serving her in that way. I began to make my bed, my husband knocked at the door, and the watch was missed. I went up stairs, and do not know what passed; she was dressing herself when the watchman came.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. When you were at the door, did you not let two lodgers in - A. Yes, they went up to their own room, I gave them a light to go to bed, and when I came in, she asked for a light - they were never in the parlour.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. After the man went out, did you see the watch - A. No, Sir.</p>

            . (This witness being questioned, appeared perfectly to understand the nature of an oath.) I am ten years old. I know the prisoner, pointing to her; I remember when the watch was taken, it hung by the wall, on a nail, by the bed side, the prisoner and the man were in the room - the man stood by the parlour door, inside the room. I saw the prisoner take the watch off the bed side, and give it into his hand, and he put it into his pocket - she told him to go away, he went outside the door - Mrs. Watkins was at the shop door at the time. Nobody but me was in the room with them; I went to bed soon after, I do not know the time, but it was late.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. While Mrs. Watkins was at the door, did not Johnson get up - A. Yes; I did not ask what o'clock it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see me move - A. Yes; and took the watch.</p>

I came from the country; I had been to Chelsea two days, and went to my friends who could not keep me; I went to a public-house, Johnson, a man, and woman were there, they made me drink with them; I enquired of them for a lodging, Johnson said he could recommend me to Mr. Watkins; I said I had rather go with a woman - he went out, returned, and said he had mentioned it to Mrs. Watkins, and had said I was a friend of his, and told me not to contradict it; I gave him 6 d. for the bed; he said I could not have one unless he slept with a single man; I went to the house, but never said I was his wife or any thing of the sort; two boys came in soon after. Mrs. Watkins went to answer a knock; Johnson rose and went out at the private door without speaking to me; when she returned, I asked where he was, she said he was gone out; I said he went out at that door, she said,</p>
               <p>"Yes, that is the private door;" she went out to fetch liquor for a man and woman, they were drunk, and she put them to bed; I went to bed, fell asleep, and heard the boys saying</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Charles Oldfield, a builder. On the 21st of Jan. I missed two wheelbarrows from his yard in Sussex-square, Padding<lb></lb>ton—I found them on the 27th, on a piece of waste ground at the back of Charles-street, Paddington—the prisoner was not using them at the time—he said he had borrowed them of Rayner, who was acting as foreman to Mr. Oldfield.</p>

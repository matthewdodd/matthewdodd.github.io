I lost these things on the 8th of December from Mr. Dawson's yard. I lost a jacket, trowsers, shirt, stockings, and a towel, and a coffee mill-barrel. The prisoner did not belong to the ship.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they lost on board a ship - A. Yes. they were. The prisoner came on board a ship as it lay in the dock. About two o'clock in the morning, he found he could not open the half deck; he opened the chest, and took a bundle out; he took a wine-glass also, he hunted all over the half deck, to see what he could take. I could but just discern him. When he went on the top ladder I went in deck; the prisoner struck me, I sung out for the watchman, the watchman came and found the prisoner laying at the foot of the boy's bed, and all the things with him.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he come on board - A. She was laying in the bason.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you see me at the cabin door - No; I heard you. The other boy awaked me, then I heard you making a noise.</p>

            . I am a patrol. I was going on at two o'clock. on the 8th of December. I heard this young man cry out; I made all the haste I could. I went on board the ship. The prisoner was laying by the foot of the boy's bed, and all the things were scattered on the deck. I took him to the watch-house, and as I was taking him to the watchhouse, he said, he had left his shoes under the wind lass. After I had taken him to the watchhouse, I found his shoes where he told me.</p>

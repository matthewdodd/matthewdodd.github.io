            . I am an officer. In consequence of some directions, I was watching for the prisoner Hooper, and saw him on the 25th of June coming by the City-road burying-ground - I followed him to the corner of Chiswell-street, where he joined Buchanan - they then turned down Chiswell-street, and Hooper delivered a parcel to Buchanan - they walked on about thirty yards, then crossed and went half way down Finsbury-street - Hooper then went away, and Buchanan put the parcel into a bag - I followed him to White-street, and then said,</p>
               <p>"What have you got there," he said</p>
               <p>"Paper to make a book" - I said,</p>
               <p>"Where did you get it" - he said</p>

               <p>"I received it from a man, a friend of mine." I said " Should you know that man again" - he said " I do not think I should" - I then took him to the Mansion-house, and Mr. Cook asked him some questions - he said he had been at a public-house (I think the Crown) on the day before and saw the man - that he was going to take the paper to some person to get it ruled - I proceeded to Alderman Keys, and Hooper was called, I took him to the Mansion-house - the prisoners there denied all knowledge of each other - I have seen Hooper before, I suppose twenty times - I went to Buchanan's house, and there saw a working bench for bookbinders.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BRODRICK. Q. You saw Hooper in the City-road - A. Yes, and walked ten or fifteen yards behind him all theway - I saw his face when he passed me before I followed him, in Finsbury-street, he went a few yards beyond Buchanan, and then turned round and came back to him again - I did not stop them when they were together, because I might have lost one of them - there were not many persons in that street.</p>

            , ESQ. I am one of the firm of John Key and Henry Key Garrett. Hooper had been in our employ some years; we had some information, and directed the officer to observe him - I have seen the paper, and know it to be ours, we had made it for particular customers, and no other house has such paper - on the 25th of June last Hooper had no business with any such paper - I had not seen him that morning - his work is a good deal in the part where this paper is kept - he generally leaves about eight o'clock in the morning to go to breakfast, this paper is worth about 4 s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined Q. Had you been at the warehouse that morning. A. No, I was not come to town. I know the paper by a particular mark - we have manufactured it for many<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182407150048"></xptr>years. - it is sold perhaps to three or four persons, but not many quires are sold, except in one particular direction - those persons are stationers and sell it to anybody who may go to buy it.</p>

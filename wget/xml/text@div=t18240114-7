I had it on my shoulder, and a saucer of pickles in my hand. The prisoner came up - I knew him before about the neighbourhood, and cannot be mistaken in his person - he came up and snatched the pickles out of my hand; I had seen him and Benjamin talking together before he came up. I knew them both before. I turned my face to see what he was doing with the pickles; Benjamin immediately knocked me down - I kept hold of the box, and Benjamin snatched it from me while I was on the ground; this was not half a minute after Allen snatched the pickles. I got up as quick as I could, saw Allen, and asked him where Benjamin was gone with the box; he said down the Minories. I called my uncle, and ran down the Minories with my uncle, but could see nothing of him, or the box. I saw the box afterwards at a house in Gulston-street - I did not know where Allen lived; he was taken up the same evening, and taken before the Lord Mayor, and discharged on a second hearing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Was he examined twice - A. Yes. I knew his name before. He took all the pickles, saucer and all and when I asked him what had become of Benjamin he returned me the pickles - he did not ask if they were for sale, but ran off directly towards Petticoat-lane - towards Tuson-street, not towards the Minories.</p>

            . I live at No. 1, Gulston-street. On the 1st of December, my son came home and said he had been robbed of his uncle's box. I went out to look for it - I went to my own door, and in about ten minutes I saw Benjamin come along with the box, wrapped in a green baize and a blanket - he came from Petticoat-lane way, not from the Minories. I stopped him, and told him he had got my property; he d - d me, and said he would have my life unless I let the box go. I followed him about twenty yards, and said I would have the box; I did not care for his threats. The prosecutor is my brother-in-law - he came up; I said,</p>
               <p>"Here is your property;" he went to take the box off Benjamin's shoulder, but Benjamin threw it down, and knocked him down twice, and got off before we could get an officer. We had Allen taken in Petticoat-lane - he said he knew nothing of it, and before the Lord Mayor, he said he only took a bit of pickle. Benjamin and him are constant companions; I frequently see them go out together.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you open the box - A. Yes; it was empty. I had seen it a day or two before; it was well stocked then. I have spoken to none of Benjamin's family. The Minories are about a hundred yards from Gulston-street - a person coming from the Minories might come the way he did.</p>

            . I live in Little Ayliff-street, and am a hawker. I was with Hassan, and gave him my box to take home - I had packed it up myself; it contained the articles stated in the indictment; it was locked; he carried it for me, and had the pickles in a saucer. I went with him to the corner of Houndsditch, and told him to stop by the church while I went into Wright's shop, and in about ten minutes he came in, and said he had lost it. I went with my nephew into the Minories, and in Gulston-street, found Hassan's mother had stopped Benjamin. I laid hold of the box - he knocked me down twice, and ran away, leaving the box behind, with a blanket and a green cloth, which did not belong to me. I examined it directly - found it broken open, and the drawer of it empty. The silks, coral beads, silver, and my license gone; they left some spices in the box. I went to the Mansion House, and got an officer, who took Allen.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I know nothing at all of it.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Raine. I am in the service of Mr. Mortimer, gun maker; On Tuesday last, I was sent to the Bull-and-Mouth with a package, about half past seven o'clock, or rather more; I carried a box to go by the Shrewsbury mail-coach; I delivered this box to the bookkeeper, and desired him, if possible, to put it into the coach; he said, he would, if he could; I paid the carriage of it, and desired him to take care of it; my orders were to deliver it to the book-keeper, and see it off, I waited about the yard till the boxes and all the other things were brought out; I desired that my box might be put in the coach, but they said, it could not, it was a box, and must go into the boot; just after, while it was on the ground, the prisoner at the bar came up and laid hold of it, says I, my worthy, that is not your box; he looked at it, and said, he believed it was not; he put it down immediately; and sometime after that, I saw him get up to the boot, I watched his motions, I knew that my box was in the boot; soon after, I saw him jump down from the box close by the coachman, with a great coat under his arm, and said, he was going by the Shrewsbury coach; a lad in the yard desired him to go into the office, and pay the fare; I did not see him go in, and that made me pay more attention to him; when he jumped down from the box, it appeared to me as though his coat was more bulky then it was before; I watched him, and soon afterwards he went out; I followed him, and I spoke to another man, who followed him with me; I caught hold of him with the property upon him; he said, what is the matter; I said, nothing was the matter; I asked what he had got under his arm; he said, a great coat; I asked him what he had under his great coat; I pulled the coat on one side, and saw the two boxes in his hand; he then gave me a blow, which set me a reeling, and he ran away; the other man followed him, and brought him back; he took the great coat and the boxes, and gave them to Mr. Cooke, the bookkeeper, at the Inn.</p>

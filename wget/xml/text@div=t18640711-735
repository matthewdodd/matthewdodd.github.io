                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

Hicks—I think that was somewhere about the latter end of May—I never knew that the prisoner was called upon to give security to the amount of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he was never called upon to collect moneys—I am not aware that he was authorized to sell at reduced prices—I have authorized goods to be sold at a fixed reduced price, but never at a per centage—I have authorized a reduction from 95c. to 80<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but not to the prisoner—he was never authorised to receive money.</p>

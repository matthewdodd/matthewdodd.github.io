                  </hi>. I am an auctioneer, at 20, Coleman Street—the prisoner came to me desiring to sell his share or mortgage it, under his mother's will—after certain inquiries I placed myself in com<lb></lb>munication with Messrs. Ingle &amp; Co., the then solicitors to the Planet Insurance Corporation, who eventually lent him the money upon therever<lb></lb>sion—I frequently saw him between 1871 and 1875—about February 1875, he informed me that his sister who had been apprenticed to a milliner, was anxious to go into business, and for that purpose required to sell her share, which was similar to his own; under the same will—eventually I purchased it—he brought a person who he introduced as his sister Ellen Ann Offley, a few days after the first interview—she informed me sub<lb></lb>stantially what the prisoner had stated, and came frequently to my office afterwards, seeing my solicitor and myself—he brought a certificate of her birth and eventually this contract (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was entered into; I saw it signed "Ellen Ann Offley," by the woman in the presence of Mr. Stopber, the solicitor, Offley, and myself—I got a receipt, at the bottom of the contract, signed in the same way—I paid the money in three cheques to the order of Miss E. Offley—they are endorsed by the person in whose name they are drawn—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the assignment—the woman had a peculiar scar on the bridge of her nose—your attention would be</p>

               <p>drawn to it immediately, it was something like a tattoo mark—I should add that an insurance being necessary upon the life of Ellen Ann Offley, the prisoner negotiated that with the Whittington Life Insurance Com<lb></lb>pany—this certificate of birth was handed to me by the prisoner.</p>

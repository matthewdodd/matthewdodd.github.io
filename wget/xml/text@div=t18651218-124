I am a commercial traveller, of 24, Somerford-street, Bethnal Green—on 20th November, between three and four in the afternoon, I was in Fenchurch-street, and saw the prisoner on one side of a post and the prosecutor on the others—I heard the old gentleman say, "You have got my watch"—the prisoner said, "Let me go; I have not got it"—I saw the prisoner leave go of the watch, and run away, and the prosecutor put it in his pocket—the prisoner had not got it off the guard.</p>

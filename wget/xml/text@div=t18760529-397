On the 19th May I was in com<lb></lb>pany with Detective Lythel near the—Mansion House—I saw the three prisoners following a gentleman—Murphy, was close up to him and pushing against him—the gentleman turned round and they stood in conversation a short time at the back of the crowd in Queen Victoria Street-shortly afterwards I saw Moore place himself by the side of the prosecutor), and he withdrew, his hand—I saw something in his hand, but could not say what it was—Lythel was on one side and I was on the other—Moore ran away and Lythel caught him—I secured the other two who ran towards me—at the station the prosecutor identified the watch the prisoners were searched and on Moore I found this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) open in his pocket and these two scarves—we bad been watching the prisoners for three quarters of an hour to an hour—they were acting in concert the whole time—Murphy gave an address where he was not known.</p>

I was with the last witness in Queen Victoria Street—I saw the prisoners there together—I saw them first following a gentleman towards Cannon Street, not the prosecutor—I saw Moore go beside the prosecutor—about twenty minutes later the other two were close up, and each had a hand on his shoulder—they stayed by the side of the prosecutor two or three minutes, and all of a sudden there was a move, Moore running in the direction I was standing—the other two in the direction the last witness was standing—I caught Moore-and the prosecutor said "That man stole my watch," and then there was a scuffle</p>

                  </hi>. I am an attorney of 1, Argyle-villas, Barrington-road, Brixton—on the morning of 6th December I was aroused from my sleep, or rather, I awoke about half-past 5, and shortly before 6 I rang the bell for the servants to get up; a few momenta after the servant went down stairs she returned—in consequence of what she told me I went down into the dining-room—I found the table was strewn with wax matches, many of which had been partially burnt—the bottles from two cruet stands, which the night before had been left on the sideboard, were on the table, with the silver tops removed—a mahogany box containing plated dessert knives and forks was opened, and the half-dozen which lay on the top were removed—they had not lifted the tray—a silver waiter was also taken, and a silver caddy spoon, and a meerschaum pipe mounted with silver, and from the hall all the clothes that were there; six or seven coats—I left in the pocket of an Inverness wrapper a pair of gloves which I had recently used in shooting, in Cambridgeshire—I have since seen those gloves—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are them—I saw them subsequently at the police-station—the curtains of the room were pinned with some long brass pins, as long my finger—they had not been left so the night before—I had gone over the house the night before—I was the last up; everything was safe then—when the inspector came I examined the premises with him, and we saw that the entrance had been effected through a water-closet window; that would communicate with the whole of the house—the back door leading from the hall into the garden communicates with the garden by a small flight of steps—there is a balus<lb></lb>trade immediately outside the door; one foot placed on that, and another on the conservatory, would enable a person to get in, or assist a person in<lb></lb>there were footmarks on the balustrade and the side of the conservatory—that part of my garden is gravel; there were no traces there, but there were traces in the next garden by which we distinctly saw where the parties had raised themselves, and also dropped in their departure—I did not find any chisel marks on any of my premises.</p>

On 16th December, in the morn<lb></lb>ing, I was on duty in the Brixton-road, about half-past 12 o'clock—I saw the two prisoners in company with a third man—they came out of the Loughborough-road into the Brixton-road—not liking their appearance, I watched them—they went some distance up the Brixton-road, then crossed into a dark place—they stood there for some few minutes—one left the others and crossed over to the front of Pickford-place, opposite a gentleman's house—they stood there about a minute and a half, then passed over again to the others—in consequence of what I observed I took them into custody—after I had taken them into custody, and we had got within about 200 yards of the station, Welsdon struck me on the side of the head—he said "You b—I will go no farther with you," and tried to escape—finding he could not get away, he struck me two or three times—I was obliged to release the other prisoner, the third man, and he ran away—we then took the prisoners to the station—upon Wood I found this pair of gloves and this box of silent matches—after the charge was taken I went to the place where they commenced running and I found this candle thrown away—as they were running away, I saw Wood throw out his awn, as if to throw something away; I noticed the place—when it got daylight I went there and in the garden in front of a gentleman's house, I found this chisel—Wood wished very much to have the gloves returned to him again—he asked me for them two or three times—I had not been to Mr. Smith's premise, or noticed any footsteps there.</p>

On the morning of the 16th the prisoners were brought to me at the station—I took the charge, and after they were locked up in the cell, I took the two pairs of boots from the prisoners, and after it got daylight, by directions from the inspector, I went to the footmarks where they had attempted a robbery, next to Mr. Smith's, and I found these two boots correspond with the footmarks at 31, Barrington-road—that was at the back of Mr. Smith's house—I saw the footmarks made on the night of 6th December, on the morning of the 7th—I was the first that was there and saw them after the robbery, the inspector followed after me and he covered them over—the weather had been frosty during that time—I compared this pair of boots which I took from Welsdon; there is apecularity about these boots; the right boot is very remarkable, it is worn iu the sole, and it left an impression in the earth—it is much higher on one side, and that left an impression—the grouud was very soft at the time—the marks exactly corresponded with the shoes—there were other footmarks, but not sufficient proof as to Wood's—I saw the gloves found on Wood—he asked for them back two or three times, and I directed the constable to de<lb></lb>tain them.</p>

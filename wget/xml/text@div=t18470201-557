                  </hi>. I am lock-keeper at the City-bason, and live in Graham-street, Islington. On the 31st of Jan., about half-past twelve o'clock, I saw the prisoner walking up the towing-path of the City-bason, with a bundle and a smock-frock over his shoulder—I crossed over the lock-gates, and found him in a barrow, with the bundle—I said, "What have you got here, <hi rend="italic">Tom?</hi> "—he did not speak, he <hi rend="italic">hummed</hi>—I went back, and met an officer—when my back was turned, he snatched up the bundle and ran away—I ran after him, but did not catch him—I saw him drop the bundle—Tay<lb></lb>lor came up, and took up the bundle—the prisoner was afterwards taken on the lock, by the lock-house.</p>

On Saturday evening, the 31st of Jan., about twenty minutes to one o'clock, I was with Sillito, and saw the prisoner on the towing-path—I have known him eight years, and am sure it was him—Sillito went over the lock—I saw the prisoner sit<lb></lb>ting in a barrow—as soon as he saw me crossing the lock, he ran away and threw a bag away—I fell over it, got up, and saw him running away—I picked it up, and took it to the lock-house—it contained a coat, a smock-frock, two waistcoats, two shirts, a handkerchief, and some stockings—I ran up into Macclesfield-street, and met a policeman, who came back with me, and took the prisoner on the lock—I went to where the prisoner had been sitting, and found this Bible in the barrow—I have known him eight years, and can swear he is the man.</p>

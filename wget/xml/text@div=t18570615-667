                  </hi>. I am a detective officer. I watched Messrs. Cooper's premises on Saturday evening, 23rd May, with Scott, another officer; and about 7 o'clock saw the prisoner leaving the premises in Monument Yard—I followed him to Wood Street, Cheapside, and in crossing from there to Falcon Square, I saw him take this bag, done up in this handkerchief, from his pocket, and carry it in his hand—he went down Castle Street into Redcross Square; he joined a woman, whom I afterwards ascertained to be his wife, and they turned back up Redcross Square, and went into a public house—the prisoner came out in about two minutes, having in his hand this canvas</p>

               <p>bag (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and we followed him to Mr. Spicer's, an oil and colour shop, No. 19, Aldersgate Street—when he got into the shop he remained a few minutes, then took one parcel out, and placed it on the counter—I went in and asked him what he had got; he said, "Coffee, tea, sugar, and currants"—I asked him where he brought them from, he said that he should not tell me; I said, "If you came honestly by them you would have no objection to tell me where you got them"—he said that he should not tell me, only that he bought them at a shop where they allowed him to have them at whole<lb></lb>sale price—I told him it was not satisfactory, and asked him if he brought them from Mr. Cooper's—he said, "No, I did not bring them from Mr. Cooper's, Mr. Cooper will not sell us anything," or, "let us have anything"—I asked him if he had an invoice of the goods; he said, "No; I have got a piece of paper, an account of the goods," taking this piece of paper (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>) from his pocket—I asked Mr. Spicer, who had heard it all, if he had given him any order for these goods; he said that he did on Wednesday, and that the prisoner told him that he brought the goods from Mr. Cooper's; the prisoner heard that, but I do not think he said anything—I said that I should take him to the station house; he said, "There is nothing that Mr. Cooper can swear to"—Mr. Spicer gave me, in the prisoner's presence, seven ounces and a half of tea, saying that it was part of a pound of tea which he bought of the prisoner some time ago—when we got to the Smithfield station, I asked him what he had done with the parcel that he took from his pocket in Wood Street; he said that he had given it to his wife, and that it was a little candy—Scott afterwards brought the wife to the station, and produced this bag and handkerchief—I said, "That is the parcel that he took out of his pocket in Wood Street"—the prisoner said, "Yes, it is a little sugar candy that I brought from the warehouse"—he gave his address, No. 3, Charles Street, Hackney Road—I went there the same evening, and found six pounds and a half of tea in a bag, in a drawer in the front room, and in a different bag I found nutmegs, ginger, cocoa, and other articles; I told him at the station what we had brought from his house, and asked him to account for them—he said that it was tea and sugar which he had bought at Rose's, in Bishopsgate Street, at different times in small quantities, and took home, and shot them into a bag—I said, "Did this white paper bag come from Mr. Rose's?"—he said, "No, this is Mr. Cooper's bag, I brought it from the warehouse"—he said that he bought the cocoa some time ago when he was ill, and that he intended to send it into the country by the Great Western Railway, as he had been in the habit of doing at Christmas and Whitsuntide—I found on him a savings bank book; it was given up to him by order of the Magistrate—it contained entries amounting to 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., as paid in by him in the space of sixteen months—I found 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on him.</p>

The prisoner has been in my employment about three years, and was employed on the fruit and refined sugar floor, as a porter—he had access to goods of this description; the tea was not in his depart<lb></lb>ment, but he had access to it—there was similar sugar candy to this on his floor—our servants are occasionally permitted to purchase goods, and an entry of them is made in a book at the counter by one of the men—there</p>

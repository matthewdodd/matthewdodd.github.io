               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You said you took the key? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In first first instance I took the key, and then I think he had it again; but I found it in the door—my son was backwards and forwards, looking after the things—the prisoner got the key from me—he said he wanted to put some things in, and I found was two crates—I cannot charge my memory whether he asked me for that key after that occasion—it passed backwards and forwards two or three times—I cannot say what was the last occasion on which I gave him the key—it was to move out what he had got in—I did not ask him for the key after that—I considered the things were safe, and therefore did not ask him for it—I considered he was taking care of them—these pre<lb></lb>mises had formerly been used for a pewteier—the things in this indictment were articles for the purpose of pewtering—the prisoner was a beer-shop keeper—he put up some things for the purpose of carrying on the Alton<lb></lb>ale business—there was not less than twenty squares of glass to be put in when he got into the house—he put some in—I agreed to allow him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a foot for the glass, and 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a square for taking the old broken glass out—I did hot come after he had been in some time, ask him It he would dispose of any of the articles at the back of the shop—none at all—I know Mr. Barnett—he bought the things—I do not know Mr. Church or Mr. Paisley—I have seen Mr. Church within the last two or three days—I have seen Mr. paisley two or three days in Court—I have not told them that I authorised the prisoner to sell these articles for the best price he could get—to the best of my knowledge, I never saw them till I saw them in this Court—I did not call on the prisoner on the 2nd of May, to my know<lb></lb>ledge—it might be on the 2nd of May—he did not tell me he could get 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the things, if I approved of that sum, nor that if he were to sell these things I must allow him 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to paint the back and front windows, and to paint and grain the shutters—he did not paint the back</p>

I live in Lant-street, in the Borough—I have known the prisoner about two years—he has been an honest man as far as I have known and heard—I called at his house one morning, in May, and heard Mr. Rice drive up with his horse and gig, with footman with him—he got out of the gig, came in front of the bar, and said, "Mr. Crussell, have you sold those things of mine yet?"—crussell's reply was, "No, I have not yet, Sir"—he said, "I wish you would"—Mr. Crussell said, "I had an offer for them yesterday, and I can get 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them, half in money, and half in goods"—Mr. Rice's reply was, "What goods?"—he said, "Coppers"—Mr. Rice made a reply, and said, "I wish you would sell them, and do the best you can with them;" and he said, "Good morn<lb></lb>ing," and went away—Mr. Crussell sard, "That was ray landlord."</p>

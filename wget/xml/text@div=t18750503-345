                  </hi>. I reside at Brussels—in March, 1872, I first had some business relations with the prisoner respecting these pictures—I sent him several pictures to London on many occasions to sell and subsequently, not hearing from him I wrote—the letter was returned to me by the postoffice—some time afterwards I saw the prisoner at Brussels, in March, 1873—I saw him through a window and went and asked him for the pictures and he said he had them no longer—I explained the matter to, the Queen's prosecutor and the prisoner was taken into custody—an arrangement was then made, by which the prisoner sold his furniture for my and a Mr. Vanderton's benefit—the arrangement was to pay us for the pictures that he could not account for—the amount, due at that time was 1, 950 francs (78<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.)—after the sale about 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. remained due to me—prisoner. Afterwards came to see me and told me he would make a clean breast of it, that he had disposed of the pictures in different pawn shops and now that he had sold his furniture to pay for them he was a totally broken man, inasmuch as the pictures were all in different pawnbroker's hands in the city of London; but that the tickets were of a certain value and would I buy them of him—to see that he was not playing me false I wrote to the. different pawnbrokers as to the authenticity of these tickets—having done this I agreed to give him 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. sterling for himself and to take the pictures-out of the pawnbroker's hands at my own expense—this was to settle all his claims on the pictures, and they were to become my individual property—I came to London with the prisoner bringing with me a picture "The Arming of Minerva at Vulcan's Forge"—he had had that picture in his possession for re-varnishing—it was not one of the pictures I had sold to him—the man of whom I bought it gave it to the prisoner to re-varnish—it was deposited at Thomas Newell's in Jermyn Street—I then redeemed the pictures he (prisoner) had sold to me and deposited them also at Mr. Newell's—it was about April 15th, 1873, that I came to London—the prisoner returned</p>

               <p>to Brussels to take his trial and I followed—in June or July of that year I heard some report that induced me to come to London—I went to Mr. Newell's office, and finding some pictures had been removed I went to Vine Street to take out a warrant against the prisoner—I saw him once in Richmond Street, West End—I could not say the date—that was on a subsequent visit to London, about August or September the same year—I asked him for my pictures back as I did not want to be bothered in the matter—he then said if he had them The would give them me, he had dis<lb></lb>posed of: them, and if he had any trouble in the matter he would knife me if he had to go across the water for it—that was said in French—there were thirteen pictures missing—"The Arming at Vulcan's Forge" was amongst those stowed away at Mr. Newell's, and which he told me he had made away with—I went over to Brussels the next morning—this was 8 o'clock at night—some time after, in this year, I received information about one of my pictures, and I went to Richmond Street on the 14th of last month, I believe, and saw it in the window—it is by Teniers—I can identify it—I told the prisoner that it was my picture, and he then said something to me in Flemish which I did not understand, and the detective took him in charge—I have discovered some of the other pictures—two have been produced by Mr. Cox, pawnbroker—five I stopped some fortnight after the robbery, and it has been at Vine, Street ever since—I am in no way indebted to the prisoner—he owes me about 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—when I bought the pictures and returned to Brussels there was an arrangement by which, if the prisoner brought a customer to Mr. Newell, he (prisoner) was to be allowed 10 percent.—I made no arrangement giving him authority to re<lb></lb>move them from Mr. Newell's—I would not have allowed him to have the pictures outside the door.</p>

When I asked Mr. Newell three or four months afterwards if any pictures of mine had been sold he said "No, the prices for your pictures are a great deal too high," and he then asked me to make out another list which I did at a lower price than the former one. If, therefore, these pictures were not my property, that I could not have done either; I should not have thought of selling the pictures for 2, 500 francs—40 odd pictures—when for 15 of them alone I had paid to Wilkin<lb></lb>son and others 5, 000 francs.

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, of 5, Bell-lane, Spitalfields. The prisoner is my wife—on 26th May I came home between I and 2 o'clock in the morning—I was not sober; I knew what I was about—when I got in, my wife was sitting on a chair in the centre of the room—I do not know whether she was asleep or not—that was the room where I was to sleep—I asked her to fix the bed for me to let me go to bed—she began abusing me; she said she would see me d—d first—I asked her repeatedly to fix the bed, and she said, "You w—son, go where you were all night"—she still kept abusing me, and I told her if she did not fix the bed for me I would turn her out of doors—she did not appear to me to be tipsy—I struck her, and turned her out on to the landing, not into the street—the boy then fixed the bed for me, and he and I went to bed—she burst the door in, and began</p>

               <p>gave him an abusive answer—she called him a w—e's ton, and a black-guard, and other names—he told her to settle the bed, he wanted to go to bed—she would not do it—he told her if she would not do it, he would turn her outside the door—he struck her, and turned her outside the door—Clifford and I went to bed together—his wife burst the door in, undid the cupboard, took this knife out, and said if he came out of bed, she would stick him with it—she dared and aggravated him to get out of bed—she was scolding him, and calling him all the names she could think of—she said, "You robber," and all that—he got out, went to lay hold of her, and she made a stab at him—he put up his hand, and received the stab in the hand; and while he was looking at his hand, she stabbed him on the head—he bled a great deal—he sent me for a constable.</p>

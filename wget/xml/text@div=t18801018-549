                  </hi>. I carry on business with my brothers as millers at 10, Mark Lane—on May 6,1878, the prisoner entered our service as traveller, and this agreement was entered into between us (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—I sub<lb></lb>seqnently received from him this letter of May 18, 1878, agreeing to all the terms and conditions—his duty was to take orders and send them up to us, and we should send the goods and invoices—it was also his duty to collect accounts, and either to hand them to us when he came to the office, or else pay them in to our credit at the head office of the London and County Bank, or to any branch of the same, promptly, either the same day or not later than the day following—cheques made payable to bearer he was to deal with in the same way as cash—cheques to order he would either hand to us at the office or post them to us for our endorsement—he had no authority to endorse cheques for us by procuration or in any way—from 1878 up to July this year he pursued that practice so far as we were aware—the endorsements on these two cheques of 17th July for 39<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of Mr. Packer's, and this of August 7th for 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of Mr. Rayner's, are in the prisoner's writing—he had no authority to endorse them—we were not aware until he was dismissed that he had received those moneys—we have never received the money—in consequence of other matters he was given into custody—these lists are in his writing; they were left at our office by some one representing the prisoner, after his dismissal.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He was to be paid by a commission ranging from 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a sack when we received cash for payment of the flour; he had no salary—we were to decide whether the commission was to be 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; it was determined by the price at which the flour was sold; that fluctuates very much—in taking orders from customers he would agree to a certain price within our limits; it was at our option to accept or not—we always supplied the flour as agreed upon—he has not complained that we did not—he did not make any claim for commission subsequent to his dis<lb></lb>charge—an accountant did not come on his behalf and go through our books—I can't say whether an accountant came for that purpose; I did not see him; I never heard of any one calling to look at our accounts; I heard of some one calling to leave these lists of moneys which the prisoner said he had received on our account; I believe they include the sums in this indictment—we knew that he travelled on commission for Mr. Enever—his is a seed business—I do not know that he was in the habit of supplying the same customers with our flour and Mr. Enever's seed, or that he was paid for both in one cheque—I think this amount of 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is included in a charge for embezzlement—he was originally com<lb></lb>mitted</p>

               <p>for embezzlement; we did not know all the facts when before the Magistrate; we had not seen the cheques then; we did not know of the endorsements—from the lists sent to us we believed he had received the money, but we did not know it was a forgery—we received security for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. according to the agreement—the prisoner came to the office about three weeks before he was given into custody, and I then said to him "Can you explain to me how it is that after advising us that you have received payment from several customers you have not paid those in directly to the London and County Bank to our credit, but we have reason to believe that you paid them to your own credit or that of a relative of yours at a bank the name of which we do not remember?"—I did not know that he had paid cheques in; I thought he had paid some cash in—there was some delay in our receiving the money he had received, and I wanted his explanation of the delay—the prisoner said in answer, "I thought it would expedite the payment of the money to your credit," and I said "Such a thing must not occur again"—he said it should not—we did not discharge him then—we gave him into custody on 2nd September;. we found out more irregularities—these lists were left after we gave him into custody—I won't be certain; I think it was three or four days before he was arrested—when he came to us he said that he had been in a firm of millers on his own account—it is not a fact that most of the customers he brought to us were his own customers—some said they were and some not.</p>

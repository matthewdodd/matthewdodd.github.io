On Wednesday, the 20th of May, about seven o'clock in the evening, the silver coffee-pot was standing on a tray on the kitchen dresser, about a yard from the window - A person in the street could see it; the window was open. I went into the back kitchen - I left nobody in the front kitchen. In about five minutes I heard a noise, I immediately went into the kitchen, and saw a person in the area with the coffee-pot - I believe the prisoner is the person. I said there was a thief, ran to the street - door, and called out Stop thief! I saw the man running along the square, and the coffee-pot in the area. I did not see him drop it. In about five minutes the prisoner was brought back to the house by Hardy - I believe he is the man who was in the area - I thought so at that time. I went to the window, and picked up the coffee-pot. There is no railing round the area-there is a railing in front round the fore-court, and a gate. When the prisoner was brought back there was red lead on his knees-the area had been cleaned with red lead. He must have knelt in the area to reach the coffee-pot. The dresser is nearly on a level with the bottom of the area.</p>

            . I was standing at the railing of Mr. Gough's house, and saw the prisoner get up off his knees at the kitchen window, with the coffee-pot in his right-hand - He got off his knees as soon as he saw me. The servant gave the alarm at the door-he ran off, and dropped the pot by the window. I ran after him, overtook him, and took him into custody. He ran down a court; I ran round the other way, and caught him - He was not out of my sight - I am sure he is the man. The knees of his breeches were all over red lead.</p>

               <p>` And it is hereby further Enacted, That all and ` every Person or Persons who shall so Take, Apprehend, Prosecute, or Committ such Robber or Robbers, as aforesaid, as a further Reward shall have and enjoy to his and their proper use and behoof the Horse, Furniture and Arms, Money, or other Goods of the said Robber or Robbers that shall be taken with him or them; Any their Majesties Right or Title, Bodies Politick of Corporate, or the Right or Title thereunto of the Lord of any Manor, Liberty or Franchise, or of him or them Lending or Letting the same to Hire to any such Robber or Robbers in any wise notwithstanding.</p>
               <p>Provided always, that this Clause, or any thing therein contained shall not be Construed to Extend to take away the Right of any Person or Persons to such Horses, Furniture and Arms, Money or other Goods from whom the same were before feloniously taken.</p>
               <p>But they still refusing to plead, the Court acquainted them with the Ill Consequences of their Refusal, and what a heavy Judgement they would draw down upon themselves if they persisted in their Obstinacy; and the more effectually to convince them of their Folly and Error, ordered the Judgement to be read to them, which if they continued Mute must be Pronounced against them, and put in Execution, which Judgment was to the Effect following,</p>
               <p>That the Prisoner shall be sent to the Prison from whence he came, and put into a mean House, Stopped from Light, and there shall be laid upon the bare Ground without any Litter, Straw or other Covering, and without any Garment about him, saving something to cover his Privy Members and that he shall lie upon his Back, and his Head shall be covered, and his Feet bare, and that one of his ` Arms shall be drawn with a Cord to one side of the House, and the other Arm to the other side, and that his Legs shall be used in the same manner, and that upon his Body shall be laid so much Iron and Stone as he can bear, and more, and that the first Day after he shall have three Morsels of Barley Bread, without any Drink, and the second Day he shall drink so much as he can three times of the Wa`ter which is next the Prison Door, saving running Water, without any Bread: and this shall be his Diet until be die. And he against whom this Judgment shall be given, forfeits to the King his Goods.</p>
               <p>All this having no Effect upon them, the Executioner was called and ordered to tye their Thumbs, as usual in such Cases; but all being in vain, and they still peremptorily refusing, and declaring that they would not Plead notwithstanding all the Admonition that could be given them; the Court proceeded to pass Sentence against them to be prest to Death, as the Law directs. Whereupon they were carried back to Newgate in order to undergo that Judgment the Law had inflicted on them; but when they came to the Press, Thomas Phillips alias Cross desired to be carried again to the Bar, saying he would Plead; and Spiggot continuing still Resolute, was put into the Press according to his Sentence, where after he had been some time, he also desired that he might be carried to the Bar again, to Plead which being Granted, they were indicted by the Names of

               <p>Q. Was your bundle snatched away, or did you receive the blow first? A. I received the blow first; I would not part with my bundle - I kept it as long as I could, but they overpowered me; I called out "Watchman, I am robbed! Stop thief!" and I ran after them myself - I never lost sight of them, and am certain they are the women; White knocked me down and the other ran away with my bundle: the watchman got it from them in the same state as I had lost it - I received a terrible cut on my ear from the blow; it was two hours before my wife could stop the blood.</p>
               <p>Prisoner WHITE. I have been so ill, I could not knock him down.</p>
               <p>ABRAHAM JACOBS. She was hearty enough at the time - she was quite well then, and made fun of me at the office, and dared me very much - she was in perfect health; the blood was drawn by a blow from the fist, when I was knocked down.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Whitechapel. On the 8th of May, about half-past ten or eleven o'clock, I was standing opposite Swan-yard on the right hand side of the way - I was looking over and saw the prisoners talking together for about three minutes; I was standing there and kept noticing them - I saw the two prisoners run away, and he immediately hallooed out Stop thief! he ran after them and fell down - he did not fall before that; I crossed over, and they ran up Swan-yard - I secured them up in the corner of the yard, which is no thoroughfare - anybody might see them: I found the bundle on the ground, between them both - the prosecutor came up as soon as he could; he had a little blood on his ear, which I suppose had arisen from the fall - he certainly was not knocked down; he described the bundle before he saw the contents; the prisoners said they had met him, and he asked them to go home with him - that he took them into a shop, and gave them liquor, and he had given the bundle into their hands, to take care of for him - White appeared rather white and delicate, but was able to run.</p>

            . I am a watchman. My attention was attracted by seeing persons running; I saw these persons running down Swan-yard; White came out of the yard, and I stopped her - Williams was at the bottom of the yard; Bennett picked up the bundle; White looked pale, and was certainly ill, but not so ill as she is now.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182805290026"></xptr>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>WHITE's Defence. We met him - he asked us to take him home; he took us into a liquor shop, and gave us some gin - he gave us the bundle to carry, but we would not go home with him; he was very tipsy, and with attempting to run to catch hold of us he fell.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH BREN. He was so intoxicated; we were obliged to lead him to the watch-house.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at Eagle House, Herne Hill—on the night of 8th January I went to bed, about 10.45—I left my watch and chain, and a diamond ring, in my dressing-room—I got out of bed at 4 o'clock the next morning, and went into my dressing-room—I found the window open—I had shut it when I went to bed—I missed my watch and chain and ring—I gave information to the police—a box of matches had been taken from the drawers, and placed on the window sill—there is a wall near, by which access was obtained to the window—I saw the watch, chain, and ring on the Wednesday morning following, at a pawnbroker's shop, in the Borough.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker, in High Street, Borough—on Monday, 9th January last, about 9.30 in the morning, these articles were pledged at my shop by the prisoner—I received them myself—Mr. Wood-gate, my foreman, was present—the prisoner asked me 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the watch and chain, and 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the ring—I asked him whether it was his property, and he said they belonged to his governor—I asked him what his governor was, and he said he was a butcher, living at 4, Ash Street, New Kent Road, that he was fined at the Police Court on the Saturday, and he had to pay 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to get him out of prison—I was talking to him about ten minutes, I should say, before I made the advance—I received the police notice on the following morning, in consequence of which I went to the Police Court and gave information—on the 16th or 17th of February, I received some further information, and I went to the Lambeth Police Court, where I was shown eight or nine men—I picked the prisoner out from amongst them—I sent for Woodgate afterwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Sometimes we take 500 pledges in the course of the day, sometimes 200, and sometimes 100—I have not got my book here—I should say that I took at least 470 pledges on 9th January—perhaps eight or ten watches—I have five assistants—this watch was pledged in the name of Edward Herbert—I did not ask the man to let me buy the ring—I value the watch and chain at 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I went to the police-station and said I had got a watch and chain and diamond ring—I saw it in the notice—we get a list regularly every morning; I saw it, and that made me go to the Police Court—before the prisoner was in custody someone came about the watch and the ring—I did not see who it was—it was before I came in the morning—my foreman saw him—I have never been troubled by the police at all about things I have taken in pledge—I have never been summoned to the Police Court, only on this occasion, when I was summoned by the prosecutor to give up the watch.</p>

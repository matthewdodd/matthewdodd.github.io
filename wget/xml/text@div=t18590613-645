I keep a Berlin-wool shop at 14, Stock well-terrace—on Friday, 13th May, the prisoner came for some cotton which came to 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she gave me half-a-crown, and I gave her 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—she left and I put the half-crown in the till where there were two other good half-crowns</p>

               <p>and some small silver—I had taken them out the previous night and examined them, and they were good—I had taken no half-crown from any one else—about 10 minutes after the prisoner left, I gave my servant Rebecca Cross the three half-crowns to pay a cooper's bill, and she left the shop for that purpose—she returned in about half an hour, gave me this half-crown and I found it was bad—Dixon came in about that time and I gave it to him—I am quite sure the prisoner is the person, she had been often in my shop—I put the 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. I gave the prisoner into this paper purse (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) which has my name and address on it—the inspector I think brought it out.</p>

               <p>"It is very strange, then, that he did not return with you, to give you the countenance of his support and protection" (he had walked down the road)—I sent a boy for a constable, telling him also to keep a watch on the old man, but finding he did not understand, I went to the door, saw the old man, and beckoned to him—he came into the shop, and the prisoner said to him, "I will get you to take all the money I have," and passed all the money out of her sundry pockets to him, and he took it—I saw silver and one or two half-crowns, and there were what appeared to be two foreign coins laid on the counter for me to look at—I believe the man took them all—she said to a boy in the shop, "That is foreign coin"—she appeared anxious to conceal the purse—after she left the shop I picked up a paper with Miss Pinder's name on it—a policeman was brought, and the prisoner was taken to the station—after the old man got the money, he said, "I will go and look for a policeman," and went out—he seemed very anxious to get out—when the policeman took the woman from the house, the old man had wandered back to the shop—he had no policeman with him—he walked with us to the station—I gave the half-crown to Hyde which Miss Pinder gave me—I showed her this piece of paper, and then gave it to the inspector.</p>

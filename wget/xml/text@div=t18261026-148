On Wednesday evening, the 11th of October, between seven and eight o'clock, these things hung on a chair in the room; we were alarmed by a stack of chimnies falling; I snatched the child out of bed, ran into the court, leaving the room and street doors open, and in about five minutes there came a second crash, two doors off- we ran further off, and in about ten minutes I returned for my shawl, to cover the child, and it was gone; the prisoner is quite a stranger - I saw him in custody with the shawl under his coat.</p>

            . I live in Whetstone-park. I heard some houses were falling - I went out; Mrs. Harvey said she had been robbed, and in half a minute I saw the prisoner brought back; he said he had not been in the house, and had nothing about him; he partly took his hat off, and I saw something in it - Mrs. Harvey knocked it off, and the coat was found in it; the shawl was at the back of his coat; he was very impertinent, and knocked out the watchman's light.</p>

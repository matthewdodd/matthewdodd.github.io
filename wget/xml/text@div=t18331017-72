On the 5th of October, I opened the pantry door accidentally, and there I saw the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183310170049"></xptr>prisoner - he must have come in at the window which was open - he could not have gone in at the door, as that is close to the kitchen door, and he must have been seen if he had come in there - I saw him with the footman's coat on his arm - I cried out "Thief," and he got out of the window and ran out at the gate and I after him, calling "Thief," and then the coachman pursued him - I did not see him taken - I had seen the coat safe only a few minutes before he took it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. I take it for granted the man was an old acquaintance of yours? A. No; I never saw him before - it was about eleven in the morning - I was looking at him for about a minute - I cannot think that I can be mistaken in his person - his face was towards me - my sight is very good; he was between the window and the place he took the coat from - he had the coat on his arm and bent his head down till he got out of the window - I cannot tell how many seconds there are in a minute; I know there are fifteen minutes in a quarter of an hour - he had a black handkerchief on; the coat he had on was a green one - and a dark waistcoat - this coat was found just outside the window which he got out at - I could always distinguish one person from another - I was not frightened when I first saw the man, but I was afterwards - it startled me when he got out of the window - I cannot be mistaken in his person.</p>

            . I live at No. 6, Wilson-place, Little Chelsea, and am a gardener; I was at work that morning; and heard Edward Bradfield call out "Stop thief" - I saw the prisoner running in a stooping form in Thistle-grove; I saw him throw something over the hedge - I then opened my master's garden gate and took him - I gave him to the prosecutor - the coachman and I went over the hedge and found these silver spoons - I am sure the prisoner is the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You did not see him come from the prosecutor's house? A. No; I only saw the coachman running, because I turned to the left - there might be other persons running - I had never seen the prisoner before - I found nothing on him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You know nothing of the prisoner being on the premises? A. No; my son is fourteen years of age; he is in the service of the same master as I am - I find him in clothes, and he sleeps at home; his master finds him in food.</p>

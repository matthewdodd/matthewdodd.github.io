I am sure he was one of the gang, and he took it, and handed it to another. I rescued myself from the rest, ran after him, and he ran down the passage, I followed and lost sight of him for a moment as the others came behind and knocked me down; I got up in a moment, and continued the pursuit; I saw four or five of them run behind some casks, and the prisoner ran from the casks. I am sure he is the boy who took my watch, I got up to him in about one hundred yards - he then put his back against a wall, he was quite exhausted, and out of breath. I said</p>
               <p>"You are the man who took my watch." He could not answer me at first, he said he was innocent. I said if he would give me the watch, he might go where he liked. I secured him, and he was taken to the watch-house. I have not recovered it - I think four or five held me.</p>

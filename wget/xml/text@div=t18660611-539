                  </hi>. I mind carts in Newgate Maiket—one Friday morning, in May, at five minutes to 9, I was standing in Newgate-street, and I saw the prisoner get up in a van and get bold of a pair of hind quarters of mutton—he lifted them on his shoulder, got out of the van, and walked up Giltspur-street as far as Cock-lane—there was a cart there, and he chucked them in the cart—I saw a policeman and called him over—the policeman asked him where he got them from—he said a porter gave them to him to carry them out of the market and put them in a cart—he was taken in custody.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-Policeman</hi>, 202). On 11th May I was on duty an Giltspur-street, and saw the prisoner coming with a pair of hind quarters of mutton on his shoulders, and saw him put them into a cart standing at the corner of Cock-lane—the last witness called me up and told me, in his hearing, that he had stolen it from a van in Newgate-street—I asked the prisoner where he got it from—he said, "A porter gave it me in the market to bring down here to put in a cart"—I asked him who the porter was—he said he did not know his name—I asked him if he knew the owner of the cart he was to put it in—he said, "No"—I then took him to the station—I found 31/2;<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on him—the address on the cart he put the meat in was "William Smeeton, slaughterman, Newgate-market"—I afterwards ascer<lb></lb>tained it was not his mutton.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher at Highbury—my cart was in Newgate-market on 11th May, standing in Newgate-street—I had several hind-quarters of mutton in it—I afterwards missed one—I had not given any one authority to get up and take it—I had the mutton back again shortly afterwards—I could identify it by its having a black piece of woo—at the lend.</p>

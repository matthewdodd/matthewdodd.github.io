                  </hi>. I live at Well Hall, at Eltham. The prisoner was employed by me to thresh wheat—I did not find any wheat on him my<lb></lb>self—Rainsley, the horse patrol, did—there had been some barley threshed in the same barn—it is possible to identify so small a quantity—it is dif<lb></lb>ficult to miss corn from my premises, but a great deal has been missed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a horse-patrol. In consequence of information I received, I stopped the prisoner as he was coming from his employ in the field between Eltham and Well Hall, about one o'clock in the day-time—I searched him, and found on him a little bag, containing about 31b. 80<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of wheat—I gave it into the hands of Petro, with the prisoner—I then went and searched his house, and found a bushel of wheat, which he said his family had gleaned—this was on Tuesday, the 2nd of January—he was coming in a direction from the prosecutor's when I stopped him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did not he say it was what he had for his pigeons? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; poor people are in the habit of leasing and gleaning about the fields—I have known the prisoner twelve years—I do not know of his liv<lb></lb>ing with Mrs. Smith, of Chadwell-street, Middleton-square, but I have known him in respectable service—I never knew any charge of dishonesty against him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> There was no gleaning on the 2nd of January? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JEFFRYES</hi> (<hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi>.) I have compared the wheat found on the prisoner with that in my barn, and they correspond—there is a mixture of barley in the sample found on the prisoner, and the sample from the barn, but in a very small quantity—barley had been threshed previous to the wheat—I have sufficient knowledge of corn to say that the wheat is the same growth and appearance as mine in every respect—I am able to say with certainty that it is part of the same wheat.</p>

PHILLIPS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You would swear to it if you saw it one hundred miles off, would you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know that—I should have great difficulty in swearing to it then, but not under these circumstances—he was at work that day at my house—he passed me as he went to dinner, two hundred yards from my barn—he has been a month in prison.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police sergeant, P</hi> 15). I received information of this robbery on the morning of 12th December, 1856. On the 20th December I went to the Old Bell-yard, Westminster; I searched the whole of the buildings there, the stables, cellars, cottages, and every place—the Old Bell was not at that time occupied, and the place was in a very dilapidated state—a man named Lush, and his wife, occupied one of the cottages—it was in consequence of a statement made by Lush at the Marlborough-street police-court, that I went to the Bell-yard—some carts and horses were standing in the stable there, belonging to different tradespeople in the neighbourhood—I saw the prisoner that same evening—at that time he kept a beer-shop in Regent street, Westminster—I went there and saw him—I told him that a man of the name of Lush had told me that there had been a large quantity of boots nailed up in a cupboard in a cottage in the Bell-yard, and that I had two pairs of them, which Lush had been taken up for—he sat himself down in a chair in the bar-parlour—I told him I should have to search his house—I don't know that he made any remark—I did search the house, but found nothing in reference to the boots—I did not take him into custody then—he went with me to the Bell-yard—I requested him to do so—(I left two officers to watch the house while we were gone)—we searched the place at the Bell-yard—my attention was directed to a cup<lb></lb>board in a cottage there—I saw a place where there had been a nail, but the door was then open—there was a nail sticking in a hole, and I pulled it out—I don't know that the prisoner said anything particular on that occasion—he said something to Mrs. Lush about holding her tongue, but I could not exactly catch it—in consequence of not finding anything, I ordered the prisoner and a person named Hyde both to appear at the police-court—I think that was on the 27th of December—I told him that a statement had been made, and he had better come and explain, and answer for himself; and if he did not, I should come for him—he did appear on that occasion, and the case was heard, and the magistrate ordered him into custody—he was bailed out that day, to appear on the 2d of January, but he did not do so—I never saw him again until the 29th of November last—he left his beer-shop; the place was deserted, and I was informed that he was gone to America—I inquired hundreds of times altogether to find out where he was; we were told he was gone to America in a ship which was lost—on 29th November he was brought over to the Marlborough station by one of the B division—he is not here—I said to the prisoner, "Well, Reuben, we must detain you now, upon this certificate which I hold in my hand, granted by the Court, for being coucerned in this robbery of Mr. Rabbits' in 1856"—he said, "Yes, I understand"—I said, "Therefore you will be locked up now"—he said, "It is a bad job; it has been the ruin of me"—an observation was made about these boots which I have produced—the prisoner said, "I suppose they are disposed of"—I said, to No; I have them locked up in the cupboard"—he said, "Do you mean to say you have taken care of them all this time?"—I said, "Yes, I have; they have been in my custody ever since."</p>

               <p>not here; he was examined here at the first trial—he was not considered necessary on the last trial, and I did not subpoena him—I know the circumstances under which Lush was taken into custody—I went to the police-court where he was in charge, for having these two pair of boots in his possession, and not giving a satisfactory account—he was taken into custody while pawning them—the pawnbroker was at the police-court; he is not here, and never has been examined here—Lush's wife was not in custody—a woman named Ann Sage was taken—her husband has absconded up to the present moment—there is a true bill against him now—Lush was taken into custody on 13th December; and was examined that day before the magistrate—I was not present then—he made a statement to me—I went to the Marlborough police-court, where he was in custody, and saw these boots—I made a statement to the magistrate in reference to the robbery, and the magistrate then told me to take Lush and the boots to my own court, at Lambeth—it was not on the way there that Lush made the statement—he made it there and then—he said, "I did not know it was a robbery," and then he told me ail-about it—I was taking him to the police court at Lambeth, upon the charge of being concerned in it—the case was remanded several times at Lambeth; I think more than seven or eight times—Lush was not detained in custody the whole-of that time—I think he was in custody during five or six of the examinations—he had given hit evidence before, but he was remanded for safety, he being a witness, and a poor man—he was then let out, and bound over to appear here.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a stable-mam. I am now working for a gentleman named Glover, and have been doing so for upwards of ten months—in December, 1856, I occupied a cottage in Old Bell-yard, Westminster—Mr. Watts, the prisoner, put me in—my wife was living with me—the Old Bell was not tenanted at that time; it was when I first went in, but not afterwards—I was there four or five months—after the tenants left the Old Bell, my wife kept the key for some time—about the middle of September I recollect Johnson driving a cab in there—he went <hi rend="italic">parts</hi> in a cab with a man named Banbury—I remarked a couple of sacks on the top of the cab, and I believe there was a buudle as well—it was about 7 o'clock or it may have been a quarter or twenty minutes past, I cannot say exactly to ten minutes—it was on the 12th December—I was taken into custody the next day—Johnson put the sacks and the bundle into a closet in an empty cup<lb></lb>board—he drove a nail in the cupboard to fasten it, and went away—I never saw any more of him until he was in custody—about half-an-hour after Johnson had left the yard, Watts and Hyde came there; they moved the things out of the cupboard, and put them into the Bell—I saw Hyde move the things—Watts was opening the door—I did not see him assist—he opened the door of the Bell—I did not assist in carrying the things—I was standing there, living just by, the same as I might be looking out of doors—my wife got them a light—I do not remember who had the candle in his hand, it is so long ago—when they had moved the things into the Bell, they locked the door and went away—I could not see which of them it was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185812130098"></xptr>
               <p>that locked the door up; I was not close enough to see—Watts and Hyde were in company—they took the key with them, I believe—I did not have the key after that, nor yet my wife—I believe Mr. Watts asked my wife for the key before the things were moved—that same evening Watts asked me to carry a bundle up to his house—he gave me the bundle in the yard—I cannot say that I recollect what colour the wrapper of the bundle was—I was to have a pint of beer for carrying it—I cannot swear to what was in the bundle; I never untied it to see—it appeared hard; but I could not say what it was—the last time I was here I said I saw a hole in one of the sacks, not in the wrapper—I saw the impression of the bottom of the sole of a boot in the sack—I could not see what was in the bundle; it felt hard, as I shifted it from one shoulder to the other; but I could not say whether it contained boots, or what it was—it was a kind of a round bundle; lumpy—it was a goodish-sized bundle—I should say 40 or 501bs. weight; it was tied tightly—I don't know whether my wife saw the bundle; she knew I went with it—I took it to Mr. Watts's house, and had my beer—when I came back from Mr. Watts's I came into the yard—it is a very dark yard, and I nearly fell over the shafts of a cart, and as I was pushing back the cart, I kicked up against something—it was these boots, which I believe are here now—they were tied up; not loose—I don't know whether they were pairs—I afterwards went to pawn these boots—the pawnbroker detained me, and I was given into custody—I did not tell exactly where I lived at the time—I told Sergeant Coppiu about it afterwards at Marl<lb></lb>borough-street—I made a statement before the magistrate—I then told the truth of the matter—I was in trouble about fifteen years ago; it was a very trifling matter.</p>

In December, 1856, we occupied a cottage in the Old Bell-yard, Westminster—the Old Bell was not occupied when we first went there; we had the key of it; there were things in it; Mr. Watts gave us the key—one night in the middle of December, I recollect Johnson's coming into the yard with a cab, which he drove; it was the evening before my husband was taken into custody, which was the 13th; it was dark at the time; I cannot say what time it was—I did not see anything on the cab; my attention was not drawn to Johnson, or to what he did, any more than seeing something come in—Johnson went into a cottage; there were some goods there; Hyde was there also—I was in my own cottage I suppose that was about twenty yards from the other cottage—Johnson went out again—in about an hour, or it might have been more, Mr. Watts came and asked me for a light, and the key of the Old Bell; I gave it to him—Hyde was with him; they went from the cottage into the Bell—I could see that there were parcels carried, but I could not tell what they were—the key was brought back to me on the Saturday night by Miss Watts, the prisoners daughter—I had seen Watts and Hyde go away that evening, after the goods were moved—I saw my husband with a bundle that night; Mr. Watts gave it him to take up to his house—I saw him go out of the yard with it—he was taken into custody next day—I saw the police at the place next Saturday; they were searching about—at the time they were searching the house.

               <p>I cannot recollect what it was—I think it was, that it was nothing to me, or something like that—I did not see him with anything on the night of the 12th, except the bundle that he gave to my husband—on the Saturday morning I saw him go out with something, it was like a boot in a silk handkerchief—I don't know when I saw Johnson again; I saw him that week—I never saw him after the police came and searched; he never came into the yard till a long time after that, not till the summer, a little time before he was brought up here.</p>

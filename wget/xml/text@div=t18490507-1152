                  </hi> I am in the employ of Messrs. Jones, of London-wall. The prisoner came to our warehouse in the early part of last week—he said we did a large trade in hair seating, and sent out a large lot yesterday—I said, "Yes, we have got a fresh lot in"—on 3d May I went to the ware-house, about eight o'clock—there was no one else there—I went into the adjoining room where the horsehair seating is kept, and counted the packages; there were nineteen—the prisoner came to the warehouse with his cart, a little after nine, for some feathers—no one had been before he came—the door was not fastened that morning—I had been in the warehouse down-stairs—I</p>

               <p>am able to say no other person had come in the warehouse—I locked the door, and we went up-stairs together to where the feathers were—I think he had 30lbs.—they came to 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he said he must have change for a sovereign—I said I would go down and lock the door after him—he said, "No, never mind," he would send the boy for change, and he would stay and mind the warehouse—he was not away above four or five minutes—I had done up the feathers, and brought them down by the time he came back—I put them into the cart, which was standing close to the pavement—immediately he was gone I went and counted the packages; one was gone—I told Mr. Jones.</p>

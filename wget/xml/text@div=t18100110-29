On the 6th of December between six and seven in the evening, I lost the boots; the prisoner Johnson came into the shop, he asked for a pair of leather boot laces, I said to my young man cut him a pair; I was busily employed, and while he was turning his head to get the leather to cut out the boot laces, he turned himself round to me and said have you moved the boots, I said I had not; he said, they were here just this minute, and when I turned my head they were gone; Mr. Walker came in, I said you have not been playing any tricks with these boots have you; I saw the boy Johnson with a ring on his finger, I said who are you; he appeared small but he is above twenty years of age, I said who are you; you litle rascal you are a thief, I said where do you live; he said, in Sun-street, his father was a shoemaker and kept a room; I said that will not do, if your father was a shoemaker you would not come here to buy boot laces, you would know better how to get them. Johnson came in before Clarke, I asked him about the boots; he said, he knew nothing about them, I said Joe you go for an officer; I made the prisoners sit down in the shop. All in a minute the shop door bursted open, in came a great fellow; he said, Johnson come out, I said what do you do here you rascal; I took him by the collar put him out in the street, Johnson came after me I put him back: the prisoner Clark seized me by the collar and another by the left and pulled me right out on the pavement, as soon as I got out at the next door I saw a man standing, I said, Sir, will you be so good to assist me, these are three thieves; he hit me on the temple and Johnson hit me with his hands both sides of my head; I still held the man, the man said d - n your eyes let me go, I said I will never let you go while I have strength; they then said serve the b - r out. They all hit me as hard as they could, one hit me under the ribs, I struck the man on the head, and whether they struck me at the same time I cannot say; however three of us went down in the mud, I jumped up in a moment, I saw Clark go up Camomile-street, the two others ran another away, I said I will run after you if you go to the devil; I overtook Clark against the Coachmakers Arms in Camomile-street. Johnson was taken up on another indictment, I am sure he is the same man he was in the shop some time, he said his name was Johnson. We never found the boots, we made three more to match them.</p>

            . I am a servant to Mr. Archer, I was present at the time that Johnson came in the shop; he said, he wanted a pair of boot laces, and while I was going to get a piece of leather to cut these boot laces, I turned myself round and missed three boots and four pair of pattens. I directly said to master, have you taken these boots away; he denied it, my master suspected the boy of the theft; he told me to fetch an officer, I did; and when I came back, Johnson was gone, and

            . I called upon Mr. Archer to ask him about a pair of boots, the prisoner Johnson was in the shop; the boy immediately missed the boots, Mr. Archer accused Johnson; the door was burst open by a man, he called out Johnson, Mr. Archer pushed him out of the shop, a scuffle ensued; Johnson made his escape, and Mr. Archer brought back Clark.</p>
               <p>MR. BARR. I am a cheesemonger in Bishopgate-street. Mr. Archer gave Clark into my custody, I searched him and took three handkerchiefs from him.</p>
               <p>Johnson's Defence. I went into Mr. Archers shop for a pair of boot laces, the young man was going to cut the boot laces he said, master have you taken away the boots from here; he said, no, he said they were here when this lad came in, I said I was sure they were not, they sent for an officer; somebody pulled Mr. Archer out of the shop, Mr. Archer pulled hold of me, I went to the door, there was a great skirmish I walked away.</p>
               <p>Clarke's Defence. I was on the opposite side of the way when this affray happened, and directly I crossed over, I was struck in the neck, I ran away to avoid being struck and Mr. Archer pursued me.</p>

The Evidence for the King (in the general) deposed; First, that Mr. Levingston and the Deceased Mr. Howard, with some other Gentlemen, were at play at Tennis together, and a distaste was taken amongst them about a Buckle that was lost out of one of the Gentlemens Hats, which increased to such a heighth between Mr. Levingston and Mr. Howard, that on the morrow (which was on the <rs id="t16931206-22-cd96" type="crimeDate">18th of October</rs>

Howard calls Mr. Levingston aside, (as if to whisper with him) and told him, that he had led him a dance about to no purpose, and that Mr. St. Leger and he had combined so to do, and therefore he desired Mr. Levingston to make him satisfaction; Mr. Levingstone endeavoured to wave the fighting part, but Mr. Howard still urged it; so they drew, and wounded each other, and Mr. Howard received the wound aforesaid; and Mr. Levingston had several wounds, one in the Belly above an inch deep, which was a slant wound, or else he had been kill'd too; Mr. Levingston called a great many Credible Witnesses, and persons of good quality, who said that he never was a person that was given to quarrelling, and had always been very kind to Mr. Howard, giving him money several times in his necessities; and that very morning, before they fought, Mr. Howard was taken with a vomiting, and M. Levingston was observed to be so kind to hold his head, and was never known to carry himself disrespectfully<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="16931206003"></xptr>towards the Deceas'd, nor never offer'd any thing to him that did in the least favour of malice.

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you see me with that man? Witness. Yes: you had been with him nearly an hour - he then left you, and went across the road and took the fender - I went into the box in a public-house ground; but there is a board out, and I had a full view of you, and heard you - I had known you before - you put out your foot, and tripped my heels as I was going to him.</p>

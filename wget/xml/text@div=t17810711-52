On the morning of the 28th I was alarmed; I found the house had been robbed; it had been locked the day before, and an inventory put into the clothes press of the linen; part of the linen was sent into the country that day, and the maid put up the inventory of the rest. On the 28th I found the cupboard wide open, and part of the linen gone.</p>

               <p>Where did the clothes-press stand? - In the two pair of stairs back-room, on the abbey side of the house.</p>

               <p>Going to bed, between ten and eleven o'clock at night, on Wednesday, the 27th, I found the inventory of the linen in the passage; it lay before upon the linen that was taken away, in the clothes-press that stood in the little room facing the abbey. When I went into my room, I found the window open.</p>

               <p>Was that the room where the clothes-press stood? - No; one pair of stairs higher: I had no suspicion of thieves till next morning: I wondered how the inventory came out of its place. When I got up in the morning, a little after eight, I went down to put the inventory in its place: then I found the doors all open, and the things gone: I was the first up in the morning.</p>

               <p>Was your window shut over night? - I left it shut when I got up in the morning: I was not in the room afterwards till I went to bed. Mr. Lewis went out of town that day. There was no other maidservant in the house; nor any other person but the butler,

               <p>Did you go by it when you went to-bed? - Yes; but did not take any notice of it. I went up at nine in the evening, and shut all the doors.</p>

               <p>Are you sure it was shut between nine and ten? - I am very sure it was. When I went into the room, I saw both the press-doors stand wide open; and it struck me so much, I did not know at first what was gone: when I came to consider, I knew there were eight table-cloths, four large and four small, and the inventory lying upon them; there were eight table-cloths and a pair of sheets missing: the sheets were taken off the bed in another room on the same floor.</p>

               <p>Was Mr. Lewis from home, as well as Mrs. Lewis? - Yes. I ran down stairs into the butler's room, and told him we had been robbed: he got up; and we went up stairs, and found the little window in the passage, where I had found the inventory, open; that opens on to the leads: the next house is repairing, and is empty.</p>

               <p>Is that window big enough for a man to get in at? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Jury. Did you observe that the napkins were in the press the night before? - Yes; I saw them in the press between six and seven o'clock.</p>

               <p>Did you observe the other things there at that time? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Do you know any thing who did this? - No.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman. I was sitting at the back part of this house between ten and eleven o'clock, on the 27th of June, in St. Margaret's church-yard: three of these chaps, the prisoners and another, were there; they were coming by me through a passage out of Old Palace-yard into St. Margaret's church-yard: two passed me; the other, which was Grant, turned back. I pursued him, and took him in St. Margaret's street, with the property under his arm.</p>

               <p>Did you observe that he had any thing, which caused you to follow him? - Yes; this (producing a bundle). I delivered him to the constable at the watch-house. He told me he was an apprentice in Bow-street, Westminster, with a Mr. Southby, a chimney-sweeper: he said he found the things. I went to some ruinous houses opposite his master 's; there I found the other prisoner concealed, with this bundle by him (producing another bundle). I never saw any more of the other. When I took Bland, he began to d - n and swear, and said the bundle was not found upon him, and denied any knowledge of it: it lay about a couple of yards from him.</p>

               <p>You first met them between ten and eleven o'clock at night? - Yes; nearer eleven. I conveyed him to the watch-house.</p>

               <p>To M'Noland. Did you observe the passage-window<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178107110140"></xptr> the day before? - No; I do not recollect observing the passage-window the day before: I cannot say from my own knowledge whether it was shut or open.</p>

               <p>To Taylor. Do you know whether the passage window was shut the night before? - It was shut in the morning part of the day; I swept down the room, and shut that window: I did not observe it in the evening.</p>

               <p>Where does the window of your room open to? - Upon the leads facing St. Margaret's street.</p>

               <p>(The goods were deposed to by Taylor.)</p>

               <p>I had just done work: I went to my mother; I go to her every other night, in order to carry what money I get to her: she was bad a-bed; I staid by her all the afternoon till about ten o'clock. I was coming home: I went to make water up in a corner; I kicked the bundle with my foot. I saw this man come after me: he took hold of me: he asked me where I got this; and he took me to the watch-house.</p>

That man came up to me, while I was easing myself: he asked, what I was doing? I said, easing myself. Then they came and laid hold of me. They got a lantern, and found a bundle up in the corner. The man said. This belongs to you. I said, No, I know nothing of it. My master was here yesterday.</p>

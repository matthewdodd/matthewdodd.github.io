On the 21st of July, about three o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came into my house, I had laid my watch down on the table; I was putting on my breeches; I stood against the window on the side of the door, he did not see me; my street door was open, when he came in I said what do you want friend, he said he had come to thank me for giving him some short pipes; I told him that I never saw him, and I did not know that ever I gave him any pipes; I turned myself and thought he was gone in the road. I went to speak to one of my boys in the burning room I heard this man's voice immediately; I turned and said to him what do you want; he said I will treat you for giving me some short pipes; I told him I was going out, I could not be treated, but I thought he was a thief. I said where are you going; he said he would go to the Two Brewers, I sent him there. Then he went away and I missed my watch, I ran down directly to the public house, he was not there, but from information I went again to the public house, and there he sat; I told him if he would come to my house I would give him some more short pipes, if I had ever given him any. He came to my house, I gave him in charge of an officer; the officer found the watch.</p>

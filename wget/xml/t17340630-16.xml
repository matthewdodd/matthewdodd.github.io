            , Surgeon. On Thursday Night I was sent for to Mr. Evans, the Deceas'd's Master, but when I came, the Deceas'd was gone to my House. I went home, and drest him. He was wounded in the left side of the lower Belly. A Piece of his Cawl hung out: It was cut, and I cut it off. I did not probe the Wound, for it went quite through; I drest him again, next Morning, but he dy'd between 9 and 10 at Night. I open'd him on Saturday, the Knife had divided the Epigastrick Artery, and the great Gut, and the Wound was the Cause of his Death.</p>

I told him it was too late, and we had better go to morrow; but he would needs have me go that Night, and so at last I went. When we came to Tower-hill, he could not find the House. Then he said it was in Bishop's-gate-street. We went to Aldgate, and he said it was somewhere there-abouts. He look'd at several Houses, but could not find the right. Thence he carried me into Fenchurch-street, where he said he was sure the House was not far off; but still was <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173406300015"></xptr> at a Loss; and so, to humour him, I went from one Place to another, 'till I was out of Patience, and so I brought him back to Tower-Hill, where I left him.</p>

            . The Prisoner, when he was upon Custom-house Duty, lodg'd 2 or 3 Nights a Week at my House, the Cock at Iron-Gate. About 10 at Night he came home, and said, he had been with Mr. Clay. He seem'd much disturb'd; he drank 2 Pints of Beer, and I bid him go to Bed and sleep. He said the Devil would not let him; but at last I got him up Stairs. Then he cry'd, Fire! Murder! and swore and tore at a strange Rate. By degrees he grew quiet, and I heard no more of him, 'till 3 in the Morning, when he came down, and my Maid let him out. He return'd about 9 the same Thursday Morning, put up his Oars, and seem'd very sober, 'till he call'd a poor Man in to give him some drink, but threw it all in his Face. He ask'd me to lend him a Guinea; I refus'd it. Then he said he was going to buy three Great-coats, and a Dozen of Fowls, which he would send home, and desir'd me to pay for them. To humour him I said, Yes. He went out and came in again. I was then mincing some Meat. He catch'd up the Knife, held me by the Head, and swore, Damn you for a Bitch, you would not lend me a Guinea, and now I'll cut your Throat. My Daughter, and Maid crying out, he turn'd round and threw the Meat and Pans in the Ashes; then he push'd the Knife against my Belly, but it being blunt, and my Coats thick, it did not hurt me. Then he went up Stairs, and made a great Uproar. I ask'd him what he was doing? He damn'd me for a Bitch, and said he was breaking the House. He threw Bricks out of the Window, came down with his Cloaths unbraced, ask'd me where his Knife was, spirted some Beer in my Face, and so ran out.</p>
               <p>E. Smith, Wade's Maid. He call'd all Night upon the Devil, and, in the Morning, threw some Flowers, that stood in a Pot, about the House, went out and threw. Mud in Peoples Faces. He met a Soldier, ask'd him if he was a Man, anp then threw Dirt in his Face. The Soldier drawing his Sword, he ran away, and said, Will you kill a Madman? He threw a Girl's Walnuts, and a Woman's Greens about the Street. Then he ask'd me for some Soap, to wash himself. He rubb'd his Hands and Face with it, and then smear'd them all over with Soot, and so ran out, and blacked an old Man's Face. We went up into his Room, and there he had broke all the Windows to get out, I suppose, and break his Neck, tho' he could not because of the iron Bars; but he had thrown his Shoes into the next Yard - The last time he went from our House, was between 5 and 6 on Thursday Evening, and the Deceas'd was kill'd that Night.</p>
               <p>Sam. Davis. I was his Partner in the Boat; we went out about 4 in the Morning, and he was pretty quiet 'till about 8, and then he swore he'd go to a Justice, and swear Treason against his Wife, for damn her, a Bitch, she lov'd the Pretender. He drank nothing while he was with me.</p>

            , a Shoemaker; on Thursday Noon, the Prisoner came, and went up into the Garret, where the Men work; but none of them being there; he threw all their Tools about, and then came down, and said, he had made them a Holliday, and asked us to treat him. We gave him 3 d. Now, says he, I'll go, and buy as much Bread, and Cheese, and Gin, as you all can eat and drink. He came back with 3 penny Loaves, threw one at a Man's Head; and another thro' the Window, and the Woman calling to him to pay for the Glass, he ran away.</p>

On Thursday Afternoon, he came to my Office, in the Custom-house, and said, he had seiz'd a Cart-load of Co-chineal in Stock's-Market; but the Basket-woman had rescu'd it, and taken his Commission from him, and therefore he had got ten Men out of the Tower, to recover the Seizure, and wanted me to give him more Assistance - Some say, I talk like a Madman, says he, but what do you say? Will you lend me Assistance? I answer'd, No. Why then God damn you, says he, I'll serve the Crown no longer.

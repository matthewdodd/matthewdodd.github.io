                  </hi>. I live in Plummer's-row, Whitechapel-road; I have known the prisoner about five years. On the morning of the 2nd of June, I was at the warehouse-door of Galley Quay, and saw the prisoner sitting on a basket on the quay—he rose from it—I stopped him, and asked what he had been about, and what he had been doing—he said, "No<lb></lb>thing, I have been doing nothing"—I saw a large hole in the basket, and, suspecting he had been committing a robbery, I took him into the count<lb></lb>ing-house</p>

               <p>—I know the basket had no hole in it a short time before—it contained parcels of patent screws.</p>

                  </hi>. I am superintendent of Galley Quay, and live in Portland-place North, Clapham-road; Mr. Joseph Barber is the proprietor of the wharf; the goods on the quay are under my charge. In consequence of what Moss said, I accused the prisoner of baring robbed the basket—be pulled two packages of screws from his left-hand pocket, and said he was very sorry, he hoped he should be forgiven, he had not had any work for the last fourteen days, and in consequence of that he was induced to do it to find him bread—I insisted on searching him, when he took three more packets from the other pocket—if these things had not been forthcoming I should have been answerable for them, indeed we have paid the value for them—they were goods in transit, about to be shipped for Guernsey.</p>

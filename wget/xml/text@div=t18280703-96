               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESSWELL. Q. The other man took the handkerchief? A. Yes - there was a great crowd there, looking at a drunken man; the prisoner was close to me when it was taken - he ran away, the other walked; the prisoner threw the handkerchief out of his pocket at the end of Arlington-street - I was about one hundred yards from him; I had seen him by the New river. near Sadler's Wells, with some persons who were fishing - I saw the constable at Hatton-garden; he called at our house on Sunday night to see my father - he spoke about this transaction a little, I believe; he did not tell me what to say when I came here - my father did not wish me to prosecute at first, so I did not go to the Magistrate's the next day; the day after that the constable came with a summons - I am in my thirteenth year - my father uses the handkerchief sometimes; I have the care of my own clothes, but I did not buy that handkerchief - there is no mark on it, but I know it by the pattern; a lady picked it up and gave it me: when the prisoner was stopped he went very quietly and said he had picked it up - when we got up higher, the constable came up; I had had the handkerchief just before it was taken - I did tell the Magistrate I saw it taken from my bosom.</p>

            . I saw the prisoner running on the 3d of June; there was a cry of Stop thief, raised by the prosecutor - the prisoner had nothing in his hand when I saw him; I saw the handkerchief, which he flung out of his side pocket into the middle of the road - a lady picked it up and gave it to the prosecutor; I stopped him about half a second after he threw it down - this is the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Will you swear he was running? A. I will; there were not many people after him; only the prosecutor; the prisoner was coming towards me - the street is about two hundred yards long; they tell me the crowd was by the Woolpack public-house, but I did not see it.</p>

            . I am a constable. I received the prisoner and produce the handkerchief; he told the Magistrate, he picked it up, lying by the curb stone.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been to the back of Hornsey Wood, and fearing I should be too late for Sadler's Well, I hurried; there was a disturbance with a drunken man, but I did not stop above a moment or two - I turned from the crowd and saw the handkerchief; I took it up, and going down Arlington-street, I heard the cry Stop thief! I turned and saw the prosecutor running - I did not proceed a yard from the place, but, being flurried, I own the handkerchief did drop from my hand: I said I had picked it up and would go with him anywhere.</p>
               <p>COURT to J. L. VORLEY. Did you see the handkerchief taken up? A. Yes, about two hundred yards from where I had been - I am sure I had not dropped it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a good character.</p>

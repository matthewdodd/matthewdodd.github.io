                  </hi>. I am a merchant dealing principally in silk plash; I carry on business in London at 86, Upper Stamford-street—I have also a business in Paris, at 9, Rue Chaveleau—the prisoner, Woillez, was clerk in my employ in April last, and had been so for about nine months previous to that time—he had to keep my books, to be careful about the goods when I was not there, and to furlough the orders that were transmitted to him from France, and to carry out my directions—I kept at this office in Stamford<lb></lb>street, a stock of silk plush—he had no authority from me at any time to sell any of it—I left London on 15th April—previous to leaving I had a stock of silk plush in my office in Stamford-street—it was worth about 1,830<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that was the cost price—I left that all safe on the premises when I left London—I returned to London again on 22d May, in consequence of a telegram which I received on 26th April; in consequence of my engage<lb></lb>ments I could not come back till the 22d May—on my arrival in London I went to my office in Stamford-street; I did not find my silk plush there, it was all gone—in consequence of some inquiries that I made I went to the premises of Mr. Soloman Abraham Hart, in Bury-street, St. Mary Axe—I there saw some silk plush that was my property—my tickets were on it—that was the silk plush that was safe before I left England—I know Hart now; I had never seen him before that time—I never gave Woillez or anybody else any authority to dispose of that silk plush to Hart—I was at the police-station in Tower-street, Lambeth, when woillez was brough there on 30th July—I saw him and he said, "I am guilty, I am very sorry for it; take pity on myself and my wife"—I have since received these two letters from him (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they are in his handwriting—when silk plush came into my office in England from Paris, it was the duty of Woillez to enter it in a stock-book—I have that stock-book here—I also keep an approbation book—when goods were sent out to persons to look at, it was</p>

               <p>the duty of Woillez to enter these goods in the approbation book—these goods were entered in the stock-book by Woillez—they were never entered in the approbation book by him—they were not entered in the stock-book as sold to any one—there is an entry as having come in, but not as having gone out—when I give an invoice to a customer of mine I always state in it all the numbers and yards of pieces of plush, and then all the prices of each piece—Woillez was in the habit of making out these invoices in that style—he never made an invoice while in my employ up to the time he left, without doing that, stating all the prices and so on—on Saturday, 7th July last, I accompanied Jones, a police-officer, to the lodging of the prisoner Bliss—I saw him there; he was charged in my presence—the police-constable said he charged him with being the accomplice in a robbery and stealing about 6,000 yards of goods, my property—he mentioned Woillez's name—Bliss said to me in French, "I know, Mr. Gilly, you are very un<lb></lb>lucky to lose your goods; but I cannot do anything, it is not my fault"—he repeated several times, "I know it is very unlucky for you"—I then asked him if he knew Mr. Woillez for any length of time—he told me he had known him a year—I asked him if he knew Mr. Soloman Abraham Hart of Bury-street—he said, "I have known Mr. Hart all the time I have been in London, ten years; Mr. Hart would not see me in this embarrass<lb></lb>ment and trouble even if it cost him 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>"—I answered him that he was very lucky to have such friends—he was then taken from his lodging to the station-house; I there gave a charge against him to the inspector—I did not appear against him on that charge before the Magistrate, because I was in the Court of Common Pleas—I had an action there; that was the action of Gilly against Hart—I did not appear at the hearing before the Magistrate, because I was appointed for 10 o'clock in the morning, and I only left the Court of Common Pleas about half-past 5, or something like that, so that I could not keep my appointment.</p>

GIFFARD</hi> (<hi rend="italic">for Bliss.</hi>) <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say you went to take Bliss in custody on Saturday the 7th? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the case of Gilly against Hart was appointed for the Monday morning—I did not know that Bliss was going to be examined as a witness on behalf of Mr. Hart—I mean to swear that—the effect was that he was left in custody until, my not appearing, he was discharged—when I took him in custody, I knew I should have to appear against him as a witnssss—the officer did not tell me that I must appear on the Monday morning—he did not give me any notice of what time I should be required to appear before the Magistrate on that morning—I knew at that time that the trial of Gilly against Hart was fixed for Monday morning—I did not know that Bliss was kept for a considerable part of Monday in custody before he was discharged; I did not know any<lb></lb>thing about it—I said that if I took a man in custody, I would take the responsibility of that taking him in custody—I did not inquire what had become of the man whom I had given in custody—I supposed that if I could not go there on the Monday, my solicitor could ask the Magistrate to remand him till the day after—I sent my solicitor to ask for a remand—I don't know whether he is here to-day—the first time I saw Bliss after I had given him in custody, was on the Monday; it was not on the Tuesday—the trial lasted two days—he was examined on the Monday; I am certain of it—I did not give the policeman instructions not to allow Mr. Bliss to communicate with Hart; I am sure of that—Woiliez was iu my employ nine months, beginning, I think, about last August—there was not a person of the name of De Jardin in my employ before Woillez, in the same</p>

               <p>capacity; nor a person of the name of Westley, not at that time; there was before—I had De Jardin about three, years since—the very first day I took my house in London, De Jardin was with me; about two or three years afterwards I took Westley with De Jardin—I kept Westley perhaps six or seven months, or something like that, and I dismissed him in the month of April or May, 1859—I always kept De Jardin with me; and in August, three or four months after I dismissed Westley, I took Woillez—De Jardin was always with me—he is not in my employment now; I did not dismiss him, he left me at the end of August, 1859—Westley and De Jardin had not authority to sell without consulting me, more particularly Westley, who was a traveller going to collect orders—my house was a French house—the authority of De Jardin was decidedly larger than the authority of Westley, but he had not authority to sell without consulting me—I did not say in the Court of Common Pleas, that both Westley and De Jardin had authority to sell on my behalf, or if I did say so or something like that, there has been probably a false interpretation, because I only could say what was true—they had not authority to sell without consulting me, and I think they never did so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not, in the Court of Common Pleas, draw a distinction between the form in which Woillez was employed by you and that of the other two, and say that the other two had authority to sell, but that he had not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I could not have said that, and if it was understood so, it must have been a mistake—I never gave the authority to our clerks—Woillez's education allowed him to write a letter with an autograph, and Westley could not—I think Woillez was a person of superior education to Westley—I always corresponded between my London house and my Paris house—I wrote a letter from my house in Paris, and Woillez had authority to open it—my clerk, like Mr. Woillez, was the only person who had authority to open it—from February till April, I corresponded with my London house—Woillez was the person who was attending to the business of my London house from February till April, 1860—I expected and intended him to open the letters and attend to the business—I received several letters from him with reference to the pecuniary position of the house—they are here, I have got a machine copy of them in a book—I have also got the letters which I wrote to the house; they are here too (<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">here called for the letters, and put them in as his evidence</hi>)—I have in my book a letter of 27th August, 1859, from Woillez to me—it is a letter by De Jardin, and here is a letter of 19th December 1859, from Woillez to me (<hi rend="italic">The witness read the letter in French, and Mr. Albert the interpreter translated it, as follows</hi>: "I have received your letter of the, 17th instant, and I received yours of the 18th. Be persuaded that I regret as much as you do yourself, perhaps more than yourself, that I have not sold any goods, or anything, during your absence, but that it is not my fault, I do the best I can for you, but business is very bad at this moment, and particularly for us; besides, this is not the month to sell; almost everybody postpones giving orders till January next. De Jardin is not more lucky than I am; since the plushes have arrived he sent thirty pieces on approbation, but not one has been sold yet: with the fancy hats, I am not mote lucky; these are positively difficult to get a customer for, there are a great many of these hats in the market." <hi rend="italic">The rest of the letter was not read, being considered immaterial</hi>)—here is the letter of 20th December, (<hi rend="italic">Read in part</hi>: "I have received your letter of the 19th; I went four times to Mr. Hart to-day without being able to see him, and I waited for him</p>

               <p>till half-past 5, and therefore must wait till to-morrow morning. I have no news yet about the paletôt, and I have not been able yet to obtain anything else than the goods from Ferrari: when you are in London, doubtless you will be more lucky than I am. De Jardin and I are both very much grieved by your reproaches, but against force there is no resistance; it is impossible to sell anything. I saw to-day Mr. Gilham, who is in London for some months; I did every thing in my power to sell him something, but he cannot take the Reynard plushes, he wants some plushes from the manufacturer, Martin, or none at all; and he will wait till you come back before treating with anybody about it; and this is the promise he has made to me. If the two pieces of plush that you are about to sell remain on the shelves, that will not be my fault either."</p>

               <p>

                  <hi rend="italic">proposed to put in the transcript of the summing-up, but tlie Court was of opinion that it was not admissable</hi>)—I was present when the verdict was returned—it was for the defendant—it was in these words, "We find the verdict for the defendant, but we couple it with this, the jury consider that the defendant's system of making purchases without inquiry is highly reprehensible and pernicious in its effects on trade."</p>

I could not say which—I understood Bliss to say, "We are waiting"—Woillez then went up stairs, put on his hat and coat, and they both went out together—Woillez was not gone very long—he returned by himself—I did not see him come in, but I heard him let himself in with the key—I remember a cart arriving on the following morning, Wednesday—there were two men with it—the plush was carried out and put into the cart—Woillez was present during that time—I said, "Why, you are making quite a clearance"—he replied, "Oh, no; it will all come back again; I am sure they will not buy"—I don't remember his saying anything else just then—he afterwards called me to give me some orders, and he said he was going out about the plush, as the old gentleman that was there the day before did not know anything about it—he said, "That old man is just like a child stroking a cat; he puts it all the wrong way"—he said there would be some gentlemen there to meet him that morning—he left a letter to take somewhere, and he took the paper himself—he said, "I suppose I must take it, but it will be no use, you may be sure"—it was a blank invoice—he said, "They will offer me about half-a-crown a yard; it will sure to come back to-morrow"—he then left, and returned at ten minutes to 3 in the afternoon—a Paris letter arrived for him in his absence—I put it on his desk; I saw him open it—he said that Mr. Gilly had had some goods detained at the Customs at Boulogne, and then he took the letter up as though he were translating to me, and he said "Mr. Gilly says,' if I cannot ascertain at the Customs here, I must go to Boulogne at once, or it would be condemned if it was not claimed before Friday,' that is, the goods"—I said, "I suppose if you go to Boulogne you will take Madame with you, as she wants to go"—by "Madame" I meant Mrs. Woillez—he said "Oh! no; the weather is very bad, and I cannot be troubled with two children"—he then went out, and returned again at half-past 7, and said he was going by the half-past 8 o'clock train to Boulogne—his wife was then present; he said to her in my presence, "Are you ready?"—she said, "I will be ready in a few minutes"—they both went up stairs—at a quarter past 8 they both left in a cab; Madame Woillez, the two children, and Mr. Woillez—they took one black trunk, a small square box, and a bundle—I saw nothing of them afterwards.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been for some years porter to Mr. Gilly—Woillez was his clerk—on 15th April Mr. Gilly was obliged to leave England suddenly in consequence of the death of his mother—when he left there was a large stock of plush left on the premises—it consisted of 139 pieces—when Mr. Gilly left London, the persons left there were Woillez, his wife, who was allowed to live with the children, on the premises; myself and my wife—on Monday, 23d April, Woillez told me there was a gentleman coming to look at some plush, and that he was coming to-morrow morning—on Tuesday, 24th, a gentleman came about 10 o'clock in the morning—that gentleman was Mr. Hart, the gentleman who is standing in Court now—I was about my usual work, and I heard a knock at the door; I turned and opened the door—the gentleman said, "Mr. Gilly?" said, "Mr. Gilly is not here"—as soon as the knock was given at the door Mr. Woillez began to descend down stairs—he said, "Good morning, sir," and showed Hart into the warehouse, where they stopped, I think, twenty minutes; not more than half an hour—I saw Hart look at some of the stock of 139 pieces of plush—there were about fifteen pieces; apparently taken out of the stock to be looked at—I have been three or four years in the business—the stock varies in quality—every piece must be looked at before a gentleman can form an opinion on it—when Mr. Hart went away Woillez showed him out—I did not hear what passed between them—during the Tuesday, Woillez said that the gentleman was a large buyer of plush, and was going to have the bulk of the goods on the premises, so that he might have a few friends to look at them—next morning, about 10 o'clock, a cart was driven up to the door, a couple of men attending—I saw written on the cart, "S. A. Hart, St. Mary Axe, Houndsditch" or something of that sort—I opened the door to the men with the cart—Woillez was up stairs—he came down directly I opened the door—he said, "It is all right, get down the plush"—it is not usual to have the plush put in in bulk, without being checked off or something of that sort—I got them down, and I said," Mr. Woillez, shall I call them off?"—he said, "No; it is no matter now, as I am not dressed"—he said he could check them out of the book—there is a book kept called an approbation book—he said, 'Ton need not mmd that now"—the 139 pieces were then taken and put in the cart, I assisting, and Woillez directing; and then it was driven away—I had occasion to go out almost immediately afterwards—I think I went out before Woillez—I got back about a quarter-past 3 in the afternoon—as I was coming back, towards Stamford-street, I met Woilles in a cab between Blackfriare-bridge and Stamford-street-the stopped me—he asked me how I got on with my business—he asked me if I would get a glass of ale; I said, "Thank you"—when we got to the Cross-Keys public-house he pulled out a Paris letter he said, "Here, look; the property that you packed has been stopped by the Customs"—I had packed a case of pro<lb></lb>perty—I cannot read French—he read what appeared to me to be a trans<lb></lb>lation; he had it in his hand—he said that he was then going to the Customs—I said, "There is no use in that"—he said, "I shall do as Mr. Gilly told me; I shall go to the Customs; I shall—go to Boulogne to-night; if I am not there by Friday the goods will be condemned"—he had still the letter in his hand while he was saying this about what Mr. Gilly had told him—I took that as the instructions which Mr. Gilly had given him in the letter—I said, "How about the plush T he said, "I have nothing to do with it; Mr. Hart has telegraphed to Mr. Gilly, offering him 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., a yard for the</p>

               <p>bulk; do you think he will take it?"—I said, "Well, I don't know; the price is very low, and there are many good plushes amongst them"—he said, "Well, I have nothing to do with it; it all rests with Mr. Gilly and Mr. Hart"—I got home to Stamford-street about 4 o'clock—about 8 o'clock that evening, or a little after, he left the establishment in Stamford-street, taking with him his wife and children—there had been a habit of having a letter from Paris every day—as he was going out I said to him, "How about the Paris letter?" he said, "Oh; there will be no Paris letter, Mr. Gilly knows I am going"—as I was going to bed my wife drew my attention to the doors being open—I turned into the room and my attention was turned to the grate, where there was a large quantity of burnt paper—next morning a Paris letter did arrive, and the prisoner having told me that none would arrive I opened the letter myself—not knowing French myself, I got it translated by a person who does know French—the letter was translated to me, and in cousequence I went to Mr. Sydney, the solicitor, and he telegraphed to Paris—I did not see him do so, but I saw the tele<lb></lb>graph dispatch written out—this letter, dated the 25th April, is in Mr. Woillez's hand<lb></lb>writing (<hi rend="italic">This letter was here read, it was addressed to Mr. Gilly, acknow<lb></lb>ledged the receipt of a cheque for 1551. which arrived too late for him to deposit it in the bank; it referred to matters of ordinary business, but made no re<lb></lb>ference to the plush</hi>)—I went with Mr. Sydney the solicitor to Mr. Gilly, to Mr. Hart's premises that very day—I myself did not see the 139 pieces of plush on his premises at all.</p>

I said, "I expect he will be in this country on Thursday next"—Bliss said he was innocent—he did not at that time say anything more about Woillez—I searched his luggage, and found this envelope, with some other papers—he did not say anything at that time, when I told him there was a man in custody—on the way to the station he said he had only acted as an agent for Woillez, and he had received 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as his commission—I said, "It is a very bad job for you, but you must make the best of it;" he said, "It is a very bad job for me"—I said, "Have you known Woillez long?" he said, "I have known him</p>

               <p>complete confession, I take the liberty to write you again. Believe as certain, Sir, that in everything which took place I have always been the iustrument and the victim of a swindler, who is to-day the cause of all my misfortune, and by whom I have been incited and advised. It is himself alone who has trained this business, and who made me conclude with Mr. Hart's connivance, and who had not the slightest doubt that he was not doing with Mr. Gilly. Before introducing me to Hart, Bliss had been to his office to settle this business with him; therefore Hart asked no questions. The fact is, that Hart and his clerk both together had recognised myself as your clerk, having seen me before when they went to Cannon-street to buy plush, and when De Jardin, with whom they had to do, said to them, in my presence, that Mr. Gilly was in Paris, and he will write to him about his offer—very evident proof that Hart was quite knowing that he had not to do with Mr. Gilly. It is by Bliss that anything <hi rend="italic">have</hi> been made; he did all himself. I have followed wrong counsels, and I have fallen in the snare laid by him. He did assure me upon his word that in three weeks we could have the plush again and restore them, and then work as partners for ourselves. This deceived me to commit this fault, and without his counsels I should never have thought of doing such a thing. I have always been an honest man, bold, and good father of my family, always working to educate honourably my children; my antecedents are able to prove it. I am born of an honest family, and should never have done anything to dishonour it without the counsels of a man without any faith, heart, or honour, like Bliss. It is <hi rend="italic">him</hi> who pressed me to leave London to go to Hamburg, where he ought to go with me on the 25th, but we missed the mail-train at 8 o'clock, and I took, with my wife, this one of half-past 8 for Dover; but not being able to take the luggage, Bliss was forced to remain till the morning, day after, and meet me at Ostend, from where we left the same day for Hamburg. He stays there with me ten days, Hotel de l'Europe, and thence to Eppendorf; he stops there some more time with me, and left to return to London, but he was not certain if he would go to see his father. He only writes to me about three weeks afterwards, telling that he was in the Queen's Bench, where he had been put by your order. I have received this letter at Eppendorf, and received there another, in which he said that I had to leave at once, because you knew where I was. Bliss has named on his passport, my wife and my two children, and also a maid. He went to have his passport on the 24th, afternoon, or 25th, morning, to the Consulate of Payrbas. Now you know what remains. This affair (will mean robbery) has been performed between Bliss, Hart, and me; and I do not doubt one minute to have been the dupe of those gentlemen, who well know all that passed. I have been unhappy enough to follow this bad advice. I have nothing else to do than to hope in your mercy and God. I have confidence that both together you have pity for me, my wife, and my poor children.")</p>

On the 8th of May the prisoner at the bar came into my shop; my servant charged her with stealing a piece of ribband: I came to him, he said, he saw her put a piece of ribband into her pocket; she drew a piece out of it; I said, perhaps she may have more: I took up her pocketand felt a piece through it. My servant will give you an account of the first piece.</p>
               <p>Q. How many yards was that you found in her pocket ?</p>
               <p>Jones. It was about 10 yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it is the same ribband?</p>
               <p>Jones. I am sure it is mine, here is my mark upon it. (Produced in court.) She was carried before the sitting Alderman, and there confessed she stole it, and that the woman that came with her persuaded her to do it: there was another woman that stood at the door. I believe my servant can give the court a more satisfactory account.</p>

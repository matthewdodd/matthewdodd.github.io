                  </hi>. I am a sub-warder at the Middlesex House of Correction, Coldbath-fields—the prisoner was undergoing a sentence of two years' imprisonment with hard labour there—on Tuesday, 2d July, I noticed that he had not picked his quantity of oakum—it was my duty to take it from him, and it was three-quarters of a pound short of his weight—it would be my duty to report him on the following day—I did not my anything to him; I only took a brass number off his breast—on the following morning I was in the yard with six prisoners—I cannot say whether I was sitting at the time; I had been—the prisoner was going through the yard, with some others, to the report-office, to answer the report I had made against him—my back was towards the treadmill-yard, where he came from—he seized me by one of my arms, and struck me three violent blows on the neck, saying, "You b—r"—I looked round and saw this weapon in his hand (<hi rend="italic">a staple</hi>)—one of the blows made a wound at the back of my neck, and another went through my coat collar—I have got the coat on now (<hi rend="italic">showing the hole to the Jury</hi>)—one of the other warders and some of the prisoners then came to the rescue, and the prisoner was secured and taken away.</p>

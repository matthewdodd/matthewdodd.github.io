               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. knapp. Q. you lost sight of him then? - A. Yes, about ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q.And, during that time, he might have received the butter from some other hand? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - I am a petrol belonging to Bow-street: On the 4th of this month I heard an alarm in the Strand of stop thief, and I saw a great number of people round the prisoner; I took hold of him, and asked what was the matter, and I was informed he had stole a tub of butter.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of your own knowledge? - A. No; he said he thought the people were going to murder him, he had not stole any thing; I secured him, and took him to the shop; and Mr. Eastgate said, this one of the men that came into his shop; Mr. Eastgate desired me to take him to Bow-street.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179804180097"></xptr>ELEANOR READ sworn. - I keep a chandler's shop, in Marygold-court, in the strand; Mr. Eastgate's side-door comes into the court; I went to throw some dirty water out of a pan, about seven o'clock in the evening, and I heard of the loss of a cask of butter from Mr. Eastgate's. Our court goes into another court; it is not a thorough-fare; the other court is called Bennett's-court. He put this cask of butter off his shoulder upon some gratings which look into a cellar where the water comes in; I let him put the cask of butter down, and let him go by our coal-shed door; I threw down the pan, and ran on tip-toe after him and collared him; my husband came to my assistance; and I said, this is the man that had the cask of butter upon his shoulder; my husband and I held him all the way down the court; he struck me several times, and the mob said we were murdering the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your husband and you beating him? - A. No; but he struck me several times; my husband let him loose, and then I was obliged to let him go, for I could not hold him; he got away, and when I saw him again, he was in the hands of the patrol; that was in about ten minutes; I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light enough to distinguish his person? - A. Yes; I was sure he was the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You never saw this man before? - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. This is a very narrow court? - A. Very narrow.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any lamps alight? - A. Yes, I think there were.</p>
               <p>Q. And, though he was beating you and your husband, neither you nor your husband struck him at all? - A. Not till he got to the bottom of the court, and then I did over the head, but he got away directly.</p>
               <p>Q. You lost sight of him for ten minutes? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And when he was brought back, he was in custody? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Therefore you knew you should find a man in custody? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his Counsel, and called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

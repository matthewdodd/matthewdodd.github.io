                  </hi>. I am a general merchant of 3, Leadenhall-street—I had some transactions with the prisoner on, or about, 28th July—he called on me, and said that several days ago he had written to Mr. Walker, the storekeeper of the Brighton Railway Company at Brighton, offering to make up fifty tarpaulin sheets at 57<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each, less 2 1/2 discount for cash one month after delivery, and that Mr. Walker answered the application, by calling and telling him to make them up, and to let him know when they were finished—he asked me to take the order off his hands and employ him to make them up at 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a sheet—I consented to do so, believing his statement to be true, and consequently I gave an order for the canvas to be sent to his shop by Messrs. Russell—I afterwards paid 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for that canvas—I was from time to time to make advances to the prisoner on account—I advanced him 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 13th August, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on 16th September, 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 24th December, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 24th October, and 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on 5th November—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the receipts for these sums the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., closed the transaction—the payment was made to the prisoner partly by paying for six hundred weight of oil for him at 34<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per hundred weight, for the purpose of the tarpaulin that would make up the price that made 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—about 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. October the prisoner came over to the city to tell me that he had just delivered twenty-four of the sheets at New Cross station I saw him frequently after that, and afterwards received this letter from him—(<hi rend="italic">This was signed by the prisoner, and stated that Mr. Walker was very cross that the sheets had been sent in without orders, and that if he did not take them the prisoner knew where to sell them</hi>)—I saw the prisoner after that—he told me he had since seen Mr. Walker, who had consented to take forty-nine of them, and the remaining twenty-five were to be delivered at Willow-walk, which is the goods department—that was about 8th November—he said that he had sent forty-nine because the canvas was not enough for fifty—he afterwards gave me this receipt—it is in his handwriting—he also signed this other docu<lb></lb>ment—(<hi rend="italic">This was a document resigning all claim against the railway company, for the forty-five sheets, in favour of the prosecutor, who had paid him for the same. Signed, J. Kimber.</hi>)—I was to take this bill and receipt to the railway company and get back in exchange their cheque—up to this time I knew nothing of Mr. Walker, or the Brighton Railway Company—I sent them a duplicate of the bill before going—I made it out in the prisoner's presence, and complained to him of the railway company not having paid the first item before—he said that he did not understand it at all; that Mr. Walker had said to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186001300044"></xptr>
               <p>him it would be paid—I sent the duplicate bill with the letter to the railway Company—on 22d December I saw Mr. Walker—I afterwards heard from the Company that they had not received the forty-nine tarpaulins, but I had written them another letter before that, and the prisoner signed it—this is his signature to it—(<hi rend="italic">This was to Mr. Walker, from the witness, stating ilwt if he did not meet certain engagements on the next day, he should be served with a writ; that it was therefore imperative that the account should be paid, or else a writ would be served on the Secretary of the Company</hi>).—I went to the accountant's office at 2 o'clock, to see Mr. Walker, but could not get a cheque for my money, and in consequence of what he said I went from him to the prisoner, and after hunting about for two hours I found him in the street, and said, "I want you to come with me to see Mr. Walker, at the London-bridge station"—he said, "I will not come till to-morrow at 10 o'clock"—I said, "That will not do; Mr. Walker lives at Brighton, and is going down this evening: have you delivered all those sheets?"—he burst out crying, and told me that he had not—I said, "What have you delivered?"—he said, "Only twenty-four," the order for which was a recent date, and that if I would not prosecute him he would work it out by making them up without charge—I said, "I cannot trust goods in your hands to make up after what has happened," and asked him what he had done with the canvas—he said he had sold some of it in a manufactured state, and some in an unmanufactured state; that he had got a fair price for some of it, and the rest he parted with for a mere nothing—I said, Had you any order, as you represented to me, at the end of July?"—he said, "I had not; neither did I deliver any of the tarpaulin at the times I specified to you"—I gave him in custody a day or two afterwards—I should not have parted with my money, or allowed him to have the canvas, unless I had believed the state<lb></lb>ments he made—I should not have given him the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in November unless I had believed his statement, that he had manufactured and delivered twenty-four tarpaulins.</p>

               <p>obtained from Russell and invoiced to the prisoner, but without my authority—the bill was drawn payable to my order, and accepted by the prisoner—the prisoner had furnished the Brighton railway with a quantity of tarpaulin as lately as the April preceding, or about that time; but the money was not paid by the railway to him; it was paid to me on his order—I did not give him his share of it—I only employed him as a workman, and had paid him previously for making up 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a sheet—before he was given into custody he said that I might have a cheque for 68<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which was due to him from the London and Brighton Railway Company for the two dozen—in my books I have credited Russell with this transaction, they are at my office—the conversation was on Friday, and I gave him in custody on, I think, the Tuesday following, at his workshop—I gave him this work to keep him employed, and decidedly refused to give Jbdm a share in the profits—I declined to take any risk.</p>

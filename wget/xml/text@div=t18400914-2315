                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was in Lamb's Conduit-street, on the 29th of August, about half-past twelve o'clock at night, and saw the prisoner in that street—my attention was attracted by seeing him at a shutter there, the bolt of which I had found loose about a week before—i did not see him doing any thing with the bolt, but having found it loose just before, and knowing that he had just inspected it, I was induced to watch him—I followed him to Chapel-street, and saw him go into the doorway of Mr. Hicks's house, No. 2—I stationed myself in Mr. Hayward's doorway, nearly opposite, and saw the prisoner's arm in motion, as if he was wrenching something off Mr. Hicks's door, as if he was twisting something round—I watched him for about five minutes altogether—he came out of the doorway, and cried the hour, "Past twelve o'clock"—I believe he is a private watchman—he then went back again, and I observed him wrenching at the doorway again—he left the doorway shortly after again, and I went to it, and ascertained that the brass knob, which I bad seen safe shortly after twelve o'clock, was gone—I followed the prisoner, and overtook him in Chapel-street—I said, "<hi rend="italic">Jack,</hi> what have you done with that knob?"—he is known among us by the name of Jack—he ordered me to stand off, and then raised his stick, and attempted to strike me on the side of my head—I caught the blow on my arm, and told him I should search him—he again told me to stand off—I said if he did not submit to be searched, I should take him to the station-house—I laid hold of him, and I believe I unbuttoned one button of his great coat, but he unbuttoned two or three more, took the knob out, and threw it on the ground from the bosom of his great coat—I am not certain whe<lb></lb>ther he had a pocket in that great coat or not, but he took it from the bosom—he made some observation, which I do not exactly recollect, but I think it was, "There, take it," or something of that kind—I sprang my rattle, and Frier, another policeman, came up, and we took the prisoner to the station-house—when Friday came, the prisoner said he had not touched the knob for the night—on my return from the station-house I rang at Mr. Hicks's bell, but it was not answered—on the following morning, about nine o'clock, I gave information to Mr. Hicks—I got a nut-screw from the house, and it fits the knob—on our way to the station-house the pri<lb></lb>soner said he knew the knob to be safe at ten o'clock, which he had pre<lb></lb>viously denied any knowledge of.</p>

               <p>obnoxious to the police, because he often obstructed us in the performance of our duty—I have never been chattering to the servant maids when he has come up and interrupted me—i am a married man—I have never known it done to any of my comrades in the police—from what I have seen of my comrades they are not in the habit of doing it, and do not re-quire a-man to interfere with them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you never said, "There is a b——d old watchman down the bottom of the street, I will roll him in the kennel before the night is over, and will have him off the beat if possible; there are two or three on the look-out for him, and he shall not be on the beat another week?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never said that—part of your statement is correct—I have said, "There is an old watchman down here, who has been a great deal of trouble to us, obstructing us in our duty," but I have said, "He is too old and insignifi<lb></lb>cant, he is not worth more trouble about him, I shall roll him in the kennel"—I never said there were two or three on the look-out for him—I have said, "We are on the look-out," but never mentioned two or three—we had received orders to look out for him—I said it was likely he would not be on the beat another week; and I will state what induced me to say so: about ten days before the knob was missed there were two bolts missed from the shutters of Mr. Hay ward's shop; I gave information to the sergeant that these bolts were gone, and he was impressed with an idea that the prisoner had taken them, because from the manner I go round my beat it is almost impossible for a man to go into Chapel-street, and be there two minutes, without my knowledge; the sergeant went and searched the prisoner very slightly, and afterwards in coming down the street I heard him in conversation with a bricklayer, who, I believe, lives in Robert-street, and he told the bricklayer that the sergeant was a d—fool, for he had the knobs in his pocket all the while he was searching him, and if he had searched him properly he would have found them—he was not taken before a Magistrate on that charge, because we did not find them—he was not taken before Mr. Rogers at Hatton-garden, nor did Mr. Rogers reprimand the police for it, to my knowledge—I do not know Mr. Rogers—I should not say that the prisoner had reason to know we were watching him—private persons are not to know the orders we have from our superior officers—it is not to be expected if a thief knows I am to watch him, that he will commit a robbery on my beat—I do not know Mr. Tyler—I have seen the name—I recollect two or three gentlemen speaking to me once, whether Mr. Tyler was one of them I do not know—I do not recollect his saying to me that I seemed to be a very young man for a policeman—I will not swear he did not say so—I might have answered, "I look younger than I really am"—I do not know whether I said, "I am a foreigner, a Spaniard, but it is not generally known, or I suppose I should not be in the police"—I will not swear whether I did or not—I do not know a Mr. Wilson—I know there is a gentleman of that name in Chapel-street.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you remember telling him you would roll Butler in the kennel, and have him off the beat? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not remember saying I would have him off the beat—you must recollect I am on oath, and I will not violate the sancity of an oath to please you or any gentleman—I will not swear I have not said I would have him off the beat if I could—I have brought Sarah Ducker here as a witness—I believe she is servant to a lodger at Mr. Hicks's—she was not before the Magistrate—I have had some conver<lb></lb>sation</p>

               <p>with her here, but never to prejudice her—I have not told her I would be sure to convict him if I could, nor any thing of the sort—it is not for me to convict, it would be absurdity to say so—our conversation has been on different things—sometimes we have expressed a wish that the trial would come on—things may have passed, but not what you mention—I have been asked what he would be done to, and have said, "I do not know, it is left in the hands of an intelligent Jury, who will do justice"—I filled different capacities before I was in the police—I was a miller before I entered the police, not a labourer; does my appearance appear like a labourer?—I was never a subordinate—I was a partner with my father at Eskin, at the parish of St. Germains, in Cornwall—my father is living there now, I believe—I was not a partner by articles—I assisted in the business—I assisted him, on and off, for years, but I have filled other ca<lb></lb>pacities, among others, a schoolmaster—I have no doubt you recollect that the Ironmongers Company have endowed a school at Landsdrake—I was schoolmaster there for nine months—I superintended it for Walker, who was ill—he was then able to take it himself—I left the mill because it did not agree with my health, and I wished to be employed in a more active sphere—I certainly did not intend to come into the police, but we must take what we can get—I do not mean to say that I am not qualified for a better situation.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cabinet-maker, and live in Green-street. On Sunday evening, the 22nd of August, I had occasion to speak to Pomeroy—I asked what countryman he was, he said he was a Spaniard—he said, "There is a b—d old watchman down the bottom of the street; I will roll him in the kennel; there are two or three looking out for him, and he shall not be on the beat another week"—I have not seen the prisoner annoyed by the police.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an oilman, and live at the corner of James-street. I have known the prisoner ever since he has been on the beat as an un im<lb></lb>peachable character—I would trust him with untold gold—I have seen him annoyed by the police at various times—they appeared anxious to get rid of him—he was in the habit of trying the different bolts.</p>

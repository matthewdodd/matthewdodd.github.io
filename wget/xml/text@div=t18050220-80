               <p>Q. What do you accuse these men of? - A. On the 22d of January I had strong suspicion that the prisoner Dorseter robbed me; I watched him once and saw him go into the two prisoners' stall, and I saw him come out twice: on the 23d I went out in the morning, on purpose to watch him, and went into the Crown public-house (which is opposite to the prisoners' stall), and called for a pint of beer; in about five minutes I saw the prisoner Dorseter come out of my shop and go into their stall; I immediately followed him and opened the door of the stall, and asked the prisoner Dorseter what he was doing there; (he was then in the act of loosening down his breeches, but on my appearance he shoved them up again;) he said he had come after a coat that was being mended; the prisoner Ellis was sitting on a board; he said he had got it, and Dorseter, after that, said it was at my house; I immediately put my hand here (the witness shewing) to Dorseter, and said, you have got something of mine; yes, master, he said, I have, I hope you will forgive me. I had made a signal to my wife and she sent the maid; I sent her for a constable to Marylebone; the constable searched Dorseter and found a handkerchief full of flour in his breeches, and a bag; this was the state it was found in; there were 6 pounds 6 ounces, but I did not weigh it myself; we took them to Marlborough-street, and they were all committed; we had a search-warrant, and we went to the prisoners' stall, and there we found some flour-bags empty, and some handkerchiefs in which had been flour, and there were two half-quartern loaves.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Clifton. Q. How long had Dorseter lived with you? - A. Three or four months.</p>
               <p>Q. You received a character with him? - A. No, he was a man that I brought home; I told him I was distressed for a man; I told him he might continue with me till I could get a country lad, or till I was suited with a man.</p>
               <p>Q. You watched him to the tailor's shop? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He said there it was the first time, and he hoped you would forgive him; what did you say to him to induce him so to say? - A. I did not say any thing; I said, you have got some property of mine here; he said, Yes, I hope you will forgive me. It was a handkerchief of flour.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not mean to swear to that flour, flour is a very particular thing to swear to? - A. I think he got it from my house, I saw him come out of my house with it; and I never lost sight of him.</p>
               <p>Q. So he might, and yet get the flour from the other end of the town. Has he not got a wife and three or four children? - A. I believe he has.</p>

               <p>Q. (To prosecutor.) What is the worth of that found at Ellis's? - A. Eightpence; I could not swear positively to flour, I am certain some of these things are mine.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 27th of February last, I lost my watch in a street opposite Chancery-lane, in <placeName id="t17840526-11-crimeloc62">Holborn</placeName>

               <p>Was he ever out of your sight? - Only when I fell down, and I got up directly.</p>
               <p>Was he so out of your sight, as that you could mistake one person for another? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Had he your watch when you took him? - Not when he was searched, we did not examine him immediately, I never got the watch since.</p>
               <p>Are you positive that the watch was in your fob when you stopped? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long before had you seen it? - Not a great while.</p>
               <p>Had you stopped in any croud before? - No I had not, the prisoner said he had not the watch himself, but he knew who had.</p>
               <p>Court. Was there any promise made? - I told him if he would let me have the watch, all should be well.</p>
               <p>Did he tell you who had it? - No, he said his father lived in very good repute.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow Prisoner's Counsel. How long had you been in the crowd, before you observed a hand in your pocket? - Not a minute.</p>
               <p>Was there a very considerable crowd? - Not many.</p>
               <p>How many do you think? - Very likely a score.</p>
               <p>This was in the evening? - Yes, it was a very light evening, I clapped my hand down as quick as I could, I pursued him and never lost sight of him at all, till I fell down.</p>
               <p>How far did he run down Chancery-lane before he was stopped? - About two hundred yards.</p>
               <p>Nothing was found upon him? - No.</p>
               <p>From the time you took him, till the time he was searched, had he any possible opportunity of conveying away the watch? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Before you got hold of him, you never lost sight of him? - No, only when I fell down.</p>
               <p>Did you see him throw any thing away or give any thing to any body? - No.</p>
               <p>Have you enquired whether what he told you respecting his father is true, that he is a reputable Watchmaker? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And this young man is by trade a Watchmaker? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And all the private conversation between you was relative to you getting your watch again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. That declaration went to the returning of the watch.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>On this evening, I was going down Chancery-lane, and I turned my head and there was a great mob, and a cart was fell down, in about a minute and a half, two young fellows shoved against me, and shoved me down, I had my fife in my hand, I heard the cry of stop thief! that gentleman came up, and bid them search me directly, and coming up Warwick-court again, the prosecutor said give me my watch, or make me recompence for it, says I, my father is a watchmaker; a gentleman said you had better settle it, and said he had rather do any thing in the world than see me in trouble.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Did you search him before you delivered him to the constables? No, we did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The prosecutor searched me in Chancery-lane.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner called five witnesses, who all gave him a good character.)</p>

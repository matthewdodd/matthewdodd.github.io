            . I am a Police-officer. I took the prisoner at his father's on the Sunday evening; he had these rings, a bunch of keys, and several other articles in his possession, but only 14s. in money.</p>
               <p>MARY ANN CUMMINS re-examined. He came home about eight o'clock on Sunday evening - he told me he had the rings, and stated how much silver he had; we called in a Policeman - we took the prisoner to the Magistrate, and he advised us to proceed, in hopes to get him into some asylum; I do not think he meant to make away with the property - I think he would have returned it; his father found him some distance from home.</p>

I found him in St. George's-fields, opposite the Orphan Asylum - his schoolmaster had sent four boys to look for him; I can do nothing with him - he has been the same by night and by day for three years past; he has been away for a month or six weeks together - if this had been the first time by one hundred it should never have come<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183104070072"></xptr>to this; it has been a great trouble to me to do what I have done, but the Magistrate and my friends advised me to do it - his master has logged him for a week together, and the moment he has slipped the log he has been off again.</p>

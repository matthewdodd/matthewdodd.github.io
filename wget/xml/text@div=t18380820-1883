                  </hi>. I keep an eating-house in High-Holborn. The prisoner lodged with me about five months up to the time in question—he left on Sunday the 15th, when he was taken into custody by the police-while he lodged with me I missed a great many things-seven or eight shirts, and as many silk handkerchiefs, eight sovereigns in a purse, and two handkerchiefs—I had no suspicion of him till Sunday evening, when about five o'clock I went up stairs to my bed-room and found the kitchen-maid there—I asked if she had untied a bundle which came from the wash—she said, "No"—I missed a shirt from the bundle, and two shirts from a drawer, which was safe on Saturday morning, and there being no strangers in the house I made inquiry, searched several rooms and found nothing—the prisoner retired to bed before dark—we tapped at his door to search the room—he would not open it, but I heard his window open, and some things were brought in-doors by the policeman and other people—he was taken to the station-house, and my purse, which had contained eight sovereigns, was found upon him—I had lost sixty pounds that same day from our money cupboard—he has heard me say the first person I found robbing I should certainly prosecute, as a female servant had robbed me of fifty pounds worth of goods.</p>

I am a French-polisher, of 14, Mount Street, Bethnal Green—the prisoner and I lived together about seven years, and I shall be only too happy to have her back—we have quarrelled at times—last Wednesday I had been drinking very hard from the Monday—we had been quarrelling and I had a fight with her and beat her most unmercifully, and so I had on the Monday—I don't recollect any more till I found myself at the police-station, bleeding—they dragged me through the streets like a dog—had I been sober I should certainly have gone to a hospital—the doctor</p>

               <p>merely put a bit of strapping on my finger and head—I was able to go to work next day—under no circumstances should I be willing to prosecute her—I don't recollect anything that she did to me—we were both very drunk indeed, or she would not have been here.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in the same house with the prisoner and prosecutor—previous to this Wednesday evening they had been drinking violently all the week—he gave her a severe beating on the Monday night, and on Wednesday morning he nearly strangled her on the stairs—in the evening she went out and had a drop of drink and came home very tipsy, and seeing the chopper lying on the floor, she took it up—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is an old chopper without a handle, which she used for breaking coke—she came down to me and said "Oh, Polly, see what I have done"—I went up—he was lying on the bed bleeding, but not very much, from his head and hand—I got some water and bathed him—I told him he ought to be ashamed of himself; indeed I consider he ought to be there, (<hi rend="italic">In the dock</hi>) instead of her—the police came and took them away—the prisoner, when not in drink, is a nice, quiet, comfortable woman, and very clean—when she is in drink she is excitable, because her brain is not right—she is 50 years of age, and certain things have settled in her brain.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of Spital Square—on 31<hi rend="italic">st</hi> July I saw the prosecutor at the station and dressed his wounds—he had a clean cut at the side of the head, about three inches long, reaching to the bone; the nail of his ring finger was separated, and the soft parts of the finger separated from the bone; he also had several minor cuts across his knuckles; he will probably have a stiff top joint of his finger for life—the wounds would be caused by such an instrument as this—I saw the prisoner at the station—she was excited by drink—she said she was sorry she had not taken his life.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman H</hi> 148.) I went to the house and saw the prosecutor bleeding very freely from the right side of the head, and two of his fingers were hanging—he said he wished to charge the prisoner, and I took her into custody—she said she wished to kill him—she had been drinking very freely, and was in an excited state from drink—I asked her what she did it with—she said with a chopper—I asked her where it was—it was secreted under the bed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. He has always ill used me; several times he cut my hand and I have a stiff joint, and he kicked both my eyes open. We were very drunk on the Wednesday; I can't say I did not do it, but I don't remember anything of it; I am very sorry for it, for we are happy and comfortable when we don't drink.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an Inspector of Letter-carriers, at the Branch Office at Pimlico. The prisoner was employed there as a letter-carrier—about the 1st of this month I had reasons for paying particular attention to the prisoner's conduct—on that Saturday morning a cash letter arrived from the Chief office—this is it; it is addressed, "Miss Jane Manning, No. 25, Wilton-terrace, Wilton-road, Pimlico"—it contains money—I placed that letter in the prisoner's desk for the purpose of its passing through his hands—it would not be his duty to deliver it; it would not be in his walk—it would be his duty to sort it to the Pimlico walk—his walk was Vincent-square—he was then engaged in dividing the letters on the Vincent-square walk, between hit own ground and his partner's ground—after he had done that, I looked among the letters which were sorted for the Pimlico carrier, and did not find this letter amongst them—the prisoner then left, carrying out with him the letters of his own walk tied in a bundle—I followed him, and brought him back to the office—I told him I had missed a letter addressed to "Miss Jane Manning, No. 25, Wilton-terrace, Wilton-road, Pimlico," and asked him if he had seen such a letter; he said he had not—the other letter carriers were present—two or three may have gone out, but the majority of them were there—I desired them all to put their letters down, and to stand away from the desk; they did so—I took the prisoner's letters from his hand, and put them down—I examined them; I did not at first find this letter—I then asked him if lie had any letters about him—he put his hand into his side coat pocket, and pulled out one letter (not this one)—I asked if he had any more; he said he had not—I then proceeded to search him, and I found one letter in his back coat pocket, and on taking off his hat, in a small cotton bag I found between sixty and seventy letters—I said, "You don't call these letters?"—he made no reply—after finding those letters, I again looked at his bundle, and then found Miss Manning's letter amongst them—he was then taken to the chief office, and given into custody—these are the letters—they have been posted—none of them have been delivered—they would all be in the prisoner's delivery.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of letter carriers, in the London district Post-office. On 1st Oct., I received sixty-six letters from Mr. Fricker—they were all in the prisoner's delivery, and all unopened, except one old one—in company with a letter carrier, who knew the district well, I took them to the persons to whom they were addressed; some few of the parties were not found, but I delivered sixty-three of them—the parties to whom I delivered them opened them, and I took possession of the envelopes—these produced are them—one or two of them bear date 27th Sept., and the rest the 28th, two or three different hours of that day—one is addressed to "Miss Burrows, Mrs. Henessey, George and Ball Hotel, Orchard-street, Westminster;" that would be in the prisoner's delivery—that contained a letter which Miss Burrows took possession of—this envelope, addressed to "Mr. Cooper, Yarmouth Ale-stores, Millbank-street, Westminster," contained a letter for him—there were three for that same address; I delivered them—Miss Burrows'8 letter was posted on the 27th, and all Mr. Cooper's on the 28th, this one at 1 o'clock—they all bear the London post mark, showing they have been through the Post-office in the London district—here is one addressed to "Mrs. Thurger, Dartmouth-street, Westminster"—it contained a letter, which is in it now—she read it and returned it—that was posted on the 28th.</p>

Q.</hi> Does the mark on the cover indicate when it was put into the Post-office? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The receiving house stamp is on the back of Miss Burrows's letter, and there is the hour stamp, showing that it passed through the office at 8 o'clock at night on the 27th—it should have been delivered that same night—I cannot say how many letter carriers there are for that district—there are two for each delivery, unless it is very heavy, and then they would ask to have assistance, which is sometimes granted by the inspector—there are nine deliveries a day, not all falling to the prisoner—Mrs. Thurger's letter should have been delivered on the afternoon of the 28th, at 4 o'clock—it came in at 8 o'clock at night—the prisoner or his partner would have to deliver it, I cannot say which—Cooper's letter should have been delivered with the 1 o'clock despatch of the 28th; the prisoner or his partner would have to deliver that—I took a letter carrier, named Wiltshire, with me to deliver the letters—he is not here, to my knowledge—he was on that walk—I knew the district myself generally, but not minutely—these letters extend over the whole of the Vincent-square district—I succeeded in delivering all but three; one party had gone away, and the others were not known.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">re-examined.</hi> I know that part of the neighbourhood which constitutes the prisoner's walk—I have examined all these letters, and looked at the addresses—they are all addressed to persons living within the prisoner's walk—there are six regular men who deliver letters in that walk—they take different deliveries, at different hours of the day; they go over the</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You cannot say which of the letter carriers had these to deliver? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot; the prisoner is one of those who might have bad them—he had no authority to keep these sixty-three letters in his hat.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> With the exception of the double class, there are two carriers employed at each delivery? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; there is a joint bundle, which has to be divided between the two—on 1st Oct., it was the prisoner's duty to divide them; in the ordinary course, that would have been the duty of Tijou, the prisoner's partner—it would have been his duty on the Friday, but the prisoner was not on duty Thursday or Friday—he came to me between 11 and 12 o'clock on Thursday, and asked me to allow him to be absent for those two days; I granted him leave, and he was absent—it was Tijou's duty to divide the bundle on the Wednesday—the letters are first sorted into walks by six men, two for one walk and four for the other, at 4 o'clock—there are five walks—they first sort their letters into walks, and then they are sub<lb></lb>divided between themselves and partners—a particular district is assigned to each—a letter carrier would not go over the same ground at each delivery—the prisoner was on duty on the 27th and 28th.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">re-examined.</hi> The stamp of 8 o'clock on these letters might possibly be put on soon after 6 o'clock, because we commence stamping for the succeeding delivery as soon as the letters arrive from the different receiving houses—the stamp indicates the time the delivery is intended to take place—there is a 6 o'clock delivery, and as soon as that is despatched, we begin to stamp for the 8 o'clock delivery—all that come in between 6 and 7 o'clock would be marked 8 o'clock—there is no despatch at 7 o'clock; it requires from 7 to 8 o'clock to sort them—the letters are sent to Pimlico in two despatches, the bulk a little before 8 o'clock, and the rest about a quarter past 8 o'clock.</p>

A boy snatched at my cap, but did not get it - I laid hold of it, and then the prisoner snatched it off; I turned round, and caught him by the coat, and then he called to the other boy, who took it from him, and went off with it; the other had a hat on, and one in his hand. The prisoner's coat tore, and he ran off into my brother's arms, who kept him. We took him to my mother's house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Did you not hear that he had lost his cap - A. No; he had none on. The boy who ran off with it is bigger than him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Some one snatched off my hat, and as I went along somebody collared me, and said I had taken another boy's hat off.</p>

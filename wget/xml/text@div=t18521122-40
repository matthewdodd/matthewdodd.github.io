                  </hi>. I am waiter at the Alton ale house. I remem<lb></lb>ber serving the prosecutor with a pint of ale—I saw the prisoner there—they called for a pint of ale, which the prosecutor paid for out of his right hand side pocket.</p>

Q.</hi> Your house is a frequented house? has a great many in and out? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; we do not look into the characters of persons who are there—the prosecutor came in about five minutes before 9 o'clock, and went out about twenty or twenty-five minutes after—none but themselves were in the back parlour.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you unload any sugar from the Nile, on account of Messrs. Thellussons, on the 24th of September? - A. I did; the prisoner was a <rs id="t17991030-77-deflabel442" type="occupation">carman</rs>

               <p>Q. Look at that ticket? - A. This is my handwriting; I delivered it to a man that we generally employ to load the cart, and he gives it to the carman who drives the cart with the goods.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether the prisoner drove the cart, No.385, that day? - A. Yes, I saw him with the very sugars in his cart; the goods should have been delivered at the Doublet warehouse, Upper Thames-street, in a strait line, just by Dowgate-hill; it belonged to Mr. Georgius Street: we always deliver the carman one of these notes, and they give us their number, and we tell them where to go. The carmen sometimes come to us for it.</p>
               <p>Q.Whereabouts is the value of this sugar; is it worth forty pounds? - A. Yes, and more.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What becomes of that ticket? - A. It is signed by the warehouse-keeper when the goods are received, and brought back to the master carman, as a voucher that those goods have been delivered by his carman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Did you deliver these very sugars to the carman? - A. No, I ordered them to be delivered in our presence.</p>
               <p>Q.Is that person here, or did you see the two<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179910300063"></xptr>hogsheads of sugar put into the cart? - A. Yes, I saw them put into the cart.</p>
               <p>Q. The hogsheads of sugar have been delivered to Mr. Street, have they not? - A. Yes; the prisoner was apprehended by the officer of police, and then the sugar was delivered; he was in custody then.</p>
               <p>Q. Does it not very often happen in Thames-street, that there are stoppages of carts? - A. Certainly it does.</p>
               <p>Q. Does it not frequently happen when there is a stoppage, in order to save time, that the carman goes forward, and gets a ticket for the delivery of the goods? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever know a carman receive a ticket from the warehouseman before the goods are delivered? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I mean between the time you deliver the goods with the ticket, and the time that it arrives with the warehouse-keeper, have you not known, from the stoppages in the street, that the carman has applied for the ticket before the goods are delivered? - A. I have certainly heard that they have done it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not heard that while they have been doing so, and applied for the ticket before the delivery of the goods, that persons have gone away with the cart, and the cart has not been to be found? - A. I never heard of it.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am a carman; On the 24th of September, between eleven and twelve, I was coming through Chambers-street to take up a load, and I saw a cart with two hogsheads of sugar, or three, I am not certain which, standing without any driver at all; it had the name of Barnjum upon it, but I do not know the number.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you recollect you had been examined on this business before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, do you know who was the driver of that cart? - A. I did not know till afterwards; I went to load a load of timber in Mill-yard, Chambers-street; I was there a long time loading the cart, I was there an hour, or an hour and a half; and as I was coming out of the yard, I saw the prisoner driving the same cart towards Leman-street; I asked him where he had been stopping so long; he told me had lost his b-d cart for two hours.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him if he had been to look for it? - A. No; he said he was going to street's; I said I had been there twice to-day; he said he had lost it from Mr. street's.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way was he driving the cart? - A. From Chambers-street towards Leman-street.</p>
               <p>Q. You were examined before the Lord-Mayor how long after this? - A. I was there two days.</p>
               <p>Q. One or two days after you had seen this man? - A. It was some time after; I went afterwards to Mr. Street's; I always had my note signed before I delivered the goods; but Mr. Street refused to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179910300064"></xptr>sign it, because he said there had been two hogsheads lost.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say one word of this before the Lord-Mayor? - A. I was not asked as to it.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you not know that he was charged with stealing these goods? - A. Mr. Street told me the cart was driven away; I thought I was to give an account what was become of it; I was not asked about it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. If you had been asked these questions, I presume you would have answered them? - A. Yes, I should have said what I have now said.</p>
               <p>Q. Where you an hour and a half in the yard that you speak of? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And the horse and cart were then standing without any driver? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And then it was that he told you he had lost his cart? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear to have been walking or running? - A. He seemed to be vexed like, and his face was very red; but whether he had been walking or running, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it usual for a carman to get a ticket signed before he delivers the goods? - A. Yes, if there is one cart or more under the crane.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you staid there at a time before you could get your ticket signed? - A. Two hours; There has been sixteen carts there.</p>
               <p>Q. But how long have you staid before you could get your ticket signed? - A. Sometimes there is nobody in the way to sigh it; I have staid, I dare say, ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Any body might drive your cart away in the mean time? - A. The warehouse is up a gateway.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. When you were examined before the Lord-Mayor, Smith was there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to mention one word of this? - A. To tell you the truth, I am a poor man, and have got but one cart, and could not well afford to lose the time, and therefore I did not say any thing about it; I once lost a cart with sixteen chests of tea in it, and found the horses in Cornhill going homewards.</p>
               <p>Q. He was going to Leman-street; is that the way to Mr. Street's? - A. The way that the horses stood when I first saw them; there was a waggon stood across the street; it certainly was not the nearest way.</p>
               <p>Q.What number is your cart? - A. 69. 101.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the man at the bar? - A. Yes, I remember him very well; I never saw him before; I was standing at the front door of my house in Petticoat lane, the back-door is in Cobb's-yard: On the 24th of September, between twelve and one, within a few yards of the India warehouses, I saw the prisoner looking about; I asked him what he was looking for, and he said it was not material; he then asked me if I knew one

               <p>Q. What was he? - A. A. dealer in iron and copper; he said he owed him some money for some articles that he had sold for him; says he, by his using me so ill and so roguish, I will not go to him any more; I said, have you got any thing particular to say; come in, and I may answer you, may be; he said he had two hogsheads of sugar to suppose of, in a cart in Chambers-street; he said, if you have a place to put them in, I will take fifteen guineas for them; says he, they are worth eighty pounds; he then pulled a paper out of his pocket, and said, here is the note that they are delivered; they have signed the bill, says he, and they cannot mils them; I then told him I had no place sit to take two hogsheads of sugar, neither did I know any people that would take them in; he went out at the front door in Peticoat-lane, and I went out the back way up to Red-lion-street, to see if there was a cart with two hogsheads of sugar in it; and I saw two hogsheads of sugar in the cart, but did not know that that was the cart. I immediately ran to the office to see if there was any officer there, and I gave information to Smith, and Mr. Thompson, the clerk of the office; Smith, the officer, went with me to see if there was a cart standing there, and I shewed him the cart; I pointed out the prisoner, sitting at the public house; I told Smith I did not wish to come forward; I saw Smith apprehend him; he had got to the cart, and was driving it from the street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You did not know the prisoner before? - A. I never saw him before.</p>

               <p>Q.What was the day of the week? - A. I cannot recollect.</p>

               <p>Q. And they suffered you to go away without laying your information before the Magistrate? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I dare say, before the Lord-Mayor, you were extremely willing to give the account you have now given? - A. No, I will contradict you in that; for I was not. I told the Lord-Mayor I did not wish to come to the Old-Bailey; I thought my duty was finished when I gave information.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the Lord-Mayor threaten, or not, to commit you, if you did not give an account of it? - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you would not give your account before the Lord-Mayor, in public? - A. His Lordship heard me in private.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you not refuse to give your account, unless you could do it in a private room? - A. I deny it; his Lordship ordered me to go into his parlour, and I then told him the same as I had told the officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever been a witness here before? - A. You must know that.</p>
               <p>Q. That won't do; were you ever a witness here before? - A. Yes, in a just cause.</p>
               <p>Q. You have stood at that bar, I believe? - A. Yes, and honourably acquited.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you were honourably convicted once? - A. Yes, that was for bad halfpence. I was convicted for three months.</p>
               <p>Q. For coming? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the only time you have been here; how many times have you been at the bar, though you have been lucky enough to be acquitted? - A. About six or seven months ago I was tried here, and false sworn against.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times have you been tried in any one session? - A. You know very well that the fellow took the advantage to try me both in the city and in the country.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with the prisoner in the Compter? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you talk with the prisoner at all about any money that you were to have? - A. No; when I went in, he said, I was terribly frightened that you were coming against me; no, says I, I am not; says he, were you ever in a place in King-street, that encourages all these kind of things: I asked him if he had offered them for sale there; and I said, may be somebody might overhear him there; he said, no, there was nobody in the shop but a woman and a child.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you always gone by the name of Barnett Solomons? - A. At the time I was convicted for three months I was ashamed, because my friends were very honest, and then I put in the name of Barnett Barnett.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not gone by the name of Bullhook? - A. That is my Hebrew name.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never gone by the name of George Britton? - A. I cannot help what people call me; they call people twenty names there, and I cannot help it, when we are drinking in company.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you ever at Guildhall? - A. I was never tried there.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor ever there upon any charge? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor perhaps ever in a little strong place that we have in Bridge-street, Blacksriars, called Bride well? - A. A good many else have been there; I was not there long; I was looking in at a lottery-officer, and I was taken up for insuring. I was very innocent of it, and in nine days I got a pardon.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath were you there but nine days? - A. I cannot tell; it might be nine or ten weeks.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Would you have come forward as a witness against this man if you could have helped it? - A. No.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am an officer belonging to Whitechapel; I apprehended the prisoner by the information of Solomons, in Chambers-street, Goodmans-fields; I I found the cart standing there with two horses, and two hogsheads in it, apparently of sugar; Solomons and I went into a public-house, facing the street, where we could see the cart as it stood; he described the prisoner to me, and I went round into Rosemary-lane to see if I could see him; as I came back, going into the public-house, I saw the prisoner driving the cart; Solomons was in the public-house at that time; the prisoner was coming out of Chambers-street, and turned up Leman-street.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know the prisoner was the man? - A. Because I went into the house and asked Baruett Solomons; I went after him up Leman-street, he had got half way up Leman-street, from Chambers-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the nearest way to Thames-street? - A. No; he was going the direct contrary, while he was in Chambers-street, but when he was out of Chambers-street, he turned the nearest way that he could go; when I laid hold of him, I asked him what he had got; and he said, some sugars;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179910300066"></xptr>I told him, he had been offering them for sale; he he said, no, he had not, he was going to Mr. Street's warehouse with them, and he pulled out a note with the name of Street upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that? - A. I have no doubt but this is the same, it has not been in my proffession; he told me, he had taken the sugars from Wiggins's quay, and had lost his cart; I asked him, how long he had lost it; he said, he had got his note signed about ten o'clock; he said, he had been running about a long while, and could not find it, and at last he met a man in the Minories that told him there was a cart standing in Chambers-street; I then went with the prisoner to Mr. Street's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. How long have you been an officer? - A. Four years next February.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever, in the course of your experience, upon the apprehension of a prisoner for felony, find a man more ready to give you information than the prisoner at the bar? - A. Never; he said, you need not take me into custody, for I will not run away; he was one hundred yards from me at one time, for I was talking to the foreman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever differ in his story at any one time whatever? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And he pulled out this very note? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you went down to Wiggins's quay to know if he told the truth? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel.</p>
               <p>For the prisoner.</p>
               <p>RAINSDON sworn. - I manage Mr. Barnjum's business, he is in the country; I have myself lost my cart for two and three hours, and found it two miles off, it is a very common thing; I drove one of these horses myself, and I know he is very spirity, and if he can get his head on one side he will go away, and very often ill-disposed people will do it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Where did you keep your horses? - A. In Woolpack-alley, near Houndsditch; he has always bore a very good character; his master gives him more than he does the other men on account of his good behaviour.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called six other witnesses, who gave him an excellent character.</p>

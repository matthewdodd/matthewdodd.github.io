                  </hi>. I live with Mr. John Lee, a grocer, at No. 8, Dorset-place, Old Clapham-road. On Tuesday, the 28th of July, about two o'clock, I hung out in his garden two table-cloths, three pairs of stockings, a pair of totters, four pairs of drawers, a cotton waistcoat, a sheet, not a shirt, and light pocket handkerchiefs, and there was a shift in the wash-house—I saw them all safe on Wednesday morning at two o'clock, as I was sitting up for Mr. Lee half-past six the same morning, I missed the articles—I found the wash-house door wide open—it had been shut the night before—I observed a chair by the wall, by the side of the back door, between Mr. Notley garden, which is next to ours, and the Clapham-road—a person could get from there to our garden, and get out by going back again—these the articles—some of them belong to Mr. Lee—this cotton handkerchief belongs to Mr. Robert Scrivener, who is lodging there—this shift is my own, and was in the wash-house—the other things were out to dry.</p>

On that Wednesday morning, at a quarter before four, I was near the Swan, and saw the prisoner within basket, going in the direction of Clapham—he asked me the way to Brixtoo, and said he had been sleeping in a garden, but he was glad he had not lost the basket—he afterwards said he had got over the wall at the Greyhound and had been asleep—he did not say he had been turned out of the Grey, hound, where he had been drinking—the basket appeared t ob ef all of some thing—there was a kind of handkerchief or apron on the top of it—on the 30th of July, in consequence of what I heard, I went to Mitcham, and found the prisoner reaping in a corn field—he had his white trowsers and shirt on, and that was all—I charged him with stealing linen in the Clapham-road—k said, "Linen, what linen—I took no linen; so long as you don't take me for a deserter, I will go with you"—he went about ten yards, and pretended to be looking for his jacket—he then set off running—I ran after him about half way across the field—he then turned, and gave me a blow on the bead—I stopped him till another constable came and assisted me—I am certain that the prisoner is the same man I had seen in the morning—after I took him he said he had been to the Dorset Arms, and went to sleep there, andhad left his stock there.</p>

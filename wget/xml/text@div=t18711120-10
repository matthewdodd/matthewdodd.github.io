                  </hi>. I am a labourer, of 6, Claude Street, Millwall—on 27th October, about 7.30 p.m., I was in the Glengall public-house—the prisoner came in with Taylor (<hi rend="italic">See next case</hi>)—they were talking together, and I saw them go away in the direction of the Kingsbridge Arms, talking and walking together.</p>

                  </hi>. I am barman at the Kingsbridge Arms, Millwall—on 27th October, about 8 o'clock, Taylor came in for a glass of half and half—he gave me a shilling, which I broke, and gave to the head barman—the prisoner was the next customer—he came in two or three minutes after<lb></lb>wards, and asked for some beer—Taylor had then left—he gave me a shil<lb></lb>ling, which I broke in the tester—the prisoners were then both in front of the bar—Taylor had returned, and I broke both the shillings in their pre<lb></lb>sence—Stevens was sitting in a chair while I was studying the shillings, but I do not know whether he saw me doing so—I then accused them of giving me a bad shilling each—the prisoners said nothing—the head barman opened his band, and found another shilling in it—I got over the bar, and shut the door—I spoke to Taylor—he said he was not aware it was bad, and gave me back the 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change which I had given him, and he had gone outside—I gave no change to the prisoner.</p>

I was called, and found the prisoner and Taylor in front of the bar—Smith gave me two bad shillings—I took this shilling out of the prisoner's hand, and told him it was bad—he said that he did not think it was—I called Mr. Apsell, and gave him the two broken shillings, and one not broken.</p>

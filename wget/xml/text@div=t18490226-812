                  </hi>. I am employed as a watchman at the goods station of the London and South-western Railway, at Nine Elms. On Thursday morning, 22d Feb., I was watching—the luggage-train had just arrived from Southampton—on one of the tracks was a wagon loaded with fish—over the wagon was a tarpaulin belonging to the Company, and under that was a covering of white calico nailed down tight all round—I got up and examined it—I kept my eye on the wagon till it arrived where these things are unloaded—I then got into a gentleman's phaeton; but thinking I might be seen, I got out—the phaeton was then quite empty—soon after that, the prisoner and three other men came to this phaeton—after that two of the men went away, leaving Brumwell and the prisoner at work—the prisoner asked Brumwell something, and he went away, leaving the prisoner at the head of the wagon containing the fish—in two or three moments the prisoner left the wagon, and came to the phaeton, and I heard a rustling, a lift up of the apron, and then something dropped—the prisoner turned to the wagon, then came to the phaeton, and 1 heard something drop a second time—he was walking away; I called him, and went to the phaeton with a light which I had, and found five mackerel—I asked him if he knew anything about these</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of the London and South-western Railway Company. On the morning of the 22d I was employed with the prisoner in moving a wagon from the truck—there were four of us—we took the wagon off the truck on to the ground, and then two porters went away—the prisoner and I were left to put the shafts on the wagon—as soon as we got them on, the prisoner said to me, "You may go now, I will put the keys in"—I then went away—the wagon was all right when I left it—I did not return any more—I saw the phaeton near the wagon—I did not go nearer to it than the wagon was.</p>

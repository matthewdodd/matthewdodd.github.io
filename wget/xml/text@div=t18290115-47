On the night of the 26th of November I secured the premises - there is a room called the summer room; it looks towards the river - I saw that it was all fastened at half-past ten o'clock at night; it is part of the dwelling-house: the property stated in the indictment was then safe in that room - I went to bed at eleven o'clock, and arose at half-past six next morning - it was not day-light; I went to the summer room at half-past eleven o'clock, but could not get in, for the door was fast- I had locked and bolted it on the outside, at night, but I found it fastened within; Kinchlea came, and I went into the room about twelve o'clock - the articles were gone off the mantel-piece; and these curiosities from the cabinet, the pheasant's tail, five or six shells and the chap-sticks: I saw the vases, the box, and the pasteboard ornaments in Gros<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182901150023"></xptr>smith's possession about four weeks after the robbery - I have since seen the articles in the possession of Mr. Willis.</p>
               <p>MICHAEL WATSON. JUN. I am nephew of Mr. Watson and live with him. On the night of the 16th of November the cabinet of curiosities was safe - the China ornaments were on the mantel-piece; I went out early in the morning and, on returning, I heard here had been thieves in the house - I tried the door on the landing-place about twelve o'clock, and it was fastened inside; I went to the top of the house, and made a rope fast, then got out of the kitchenwindow: Kinchlea came and got up the bow-window, over the water - he ascended by the rope, got in at the window and opened the door on the landing; I went into the room and found it in a very disordered state - some things had been packed up in one of the chair-covers, and several were gone; there were dry and footmarks of more than one person having been there - the ornaments were gone from the mantel-piece, and a variety of other things, which we have not found; a great many things were taken out and put into a chair-cover - the China box was gone from the mantel-piece, and the pasteboard ornaments; the sterling value of all the property lost was about 7l. - I gave information at the public-office, but could find nothing out. On the day after Christmas-day, I was dining with my uncle, and, in consequence of a communication, he went out - after dinner I went out, and found Brinkley with my uncle; he asked my uncle if he had been robbed, he said he had; Brinkley said he could give him information (a reward had been offered by the parish for the discovery of several robberies) - the prisoner then said he could give him information respecting the property, but as he was then at dinner he would go and get a pint of beer and come when he had done: we finished our dinner and my uncle sent me to tell him he was at liberty - he came and went into the parlour; I was not present then, but on his coming out I was desired to go with him to a neighbour, named Holiday, who had been robbed, and on our way he asked if we had lost any stamps, or a small silver milk-jug, very stout and thick, or a Canary bird; I said No, and asked if he had seen any thing of some Maunday money - he said he had, and that all the things had passed though his hands: while we were waiting for Mr. Holiday, he described several articles they had lost, as well as a table-cover which we had lost - they had lost one, but ours was a blue one; he sat down for a little time, and seemed to be in thought - he said as they were very busy over the waters, he had a great mind to go and unbosom himself at the office below (the Thames Police), and that there was a man in custody at Union-hall -I asked how he supposed they could have got info our premises; he said the usual method was for two or three to go in a boat and row under the premises; one of two would get in at the window, the others row about, and when they had got what they wanted they gave a signal, and the boat rowed underneath and took them away - that the young fellow in custody could climb like a squirrel, and he had no doubt he was one of the men; Mr. Watson came and took him to another person - I saw him again at my uncle's, next day; he wanted him to give him money as he had been the means of giving information - he said he was a poor man with a family, and had lost a great deal of time in trying to find out an owner for the property: my uncle said he had not offered any reward, but (pointing to a bill in the shop) said the parish had; he then said he hoped he would speak a good word for him, as he was the first - he then went away; on the first day he came we received a letter from Union-hall, and my uncle went there.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.What is the value of all the articles? A.7l. - they are fancy articles.</p>
               <p>MICHAEL WATSON. I live at Wapping. On the morning of the 27th of November I found my summer room had been entered, and missed this property. On the 26th of December Brinkley came and asked if I had been robbed; I said I had lost a pheasant's tail and the chap-sticks, and he mentioned the shells as pearl plates - I believe I asked if he had seen a pair of sugar-tongs; he said Yes, they were marked on the bow - he described several articles which I had lost, and said they had all gone through his hands - that he had been disposing of several things, and a person was in custody in whose house some of the property had been found - that he had called at the Borough Compter that morning, and was acquainted with one of the turnkeys; he said he was a poor man with a family, and hoped I would give him something for his day's work, for he had lost a great deal of time about it; I took him to the summer room and shewed him the mark of a screw-driver, near the lock - he said he knew a tool that would fit that. I found at Union-hall next day, the vases, a small round China box, three shells, the pasteboard ornaments, and the pheasant's tail; I afterwards saw a pair of large shells and the chap-sticks in possession of Willis.</p>
               <p>JOHN GROSSMITH. I am an officer of Union-hall. On the morning of the 23d of December I accompanied Pople to the Minories and apprehended Williams - Brinkley was present and spoke to him; we had been in conversation with Brinkley, and agreed that if he touched his shoe, we were to apprehend Williams - this apprehension was made in consequence of a communication made to us by Brinkley; we went that day to No. 12, Wickham-street, Vauxhall. where Williams lived - he has since told us it was his house, and I have since seen his wife, who was there; he is a waterman and lighterman - I found these two vases and a snuff-box on the mantel-piece in the front room, the phesant's tail in the cupboard, and three shells, the pasteboard ornaments were on the mantel-piece, Brinkley had before that mentioned these articles to us, but never said to whom they belonged - he said nothing to me about the robbery at Mr. Watson's: I recollected an advertisement in the Police Gazette - Mr. Watson was written to from Union-hall, and identified the property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Williams was not present at this conversation with Brinkley? A. No - Brinkley never mentioned Mr. Watson's name to me; I saw Williams' wife in the house, and she was in the coach with him to Union-hall - he called her his wife, and spoke about his children; I never took him to the house.</p>

               <p>noise in my son's bedroom, and heard him cry out "Oh, Em, don't murder me!"—he used to call her "Em"—as soon as I opened my door my daughter-in-law rushed into my room, and I went to see what was the matter—I went into the room and found my son all over blood—he was, I believe, stooping to get his things on—he went down stairs and went out of the house—I did not help him down—he left while I was dressing, and I found him at a neighbour's house—I left him there and returned—the prisoner afterwards came back into his room, and I saw this small white<lb></lb>handled cheese-knife on the wash hand-stand—there was more blood on it than there is now—it was covered with blood—there was blood on the carpet where he was standing—my daughter was stark naked when she came into my room—I did not see her clothes in the bedroom—when she came to my room she said "Oh, father, you must get up"—she had blood on one of her arms.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's husband—we live with my father—on 11th December, just before 11" o'clock, I went up to my bedroom and began to undress—I had got everything off but my trousers and stockings, when my wife rushed into the room and said that I had been with some b—whores—I said "For God's sake don't poison your mind, because there is no truth in it"—as I was sitting and pulling off the leg of my trousers she knocked me off the bedstead with her hand on to the floor—I fell on my back, and found my throat bleeding—I had not felt anything before that, but I found her cutting me while I was on the floor—it lasted about two minutes, but I cannot say how many cuts I received—I said "For God's sake, Em, don't murder me!"—she said "You b—, I will!' and she cut me across the back of my neck and left me—I then heard her calling out to my father, and he came into my room—I did not see the instrument it was done with—I had no sharp instrument when I went into the room—this knife belongs to the house—I did not see it, and I did not take it up with me—I went to a neighbouring house, and a surgeon came to me. I believe my wife had her <hi rend="italic">shimmy</hi> on when she came in, and she had it on when she left—I did not see whether there was any blood on it—I was not drunk, but I had been having something to drink.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of Old Brentford—on the night of 11th December I was called to a beer-house there, and found the prosecu<lb></lb>tor, with five cuts on his face, and two on his throat, and one on the back of his neck, which was the most severe; it almost divided the right ear, and went downwards and inwards across his face, into his throat; it was about six inches long, but not very deep, his life was not in danger—the cuts on his face were quite superficial, the two on his throat were each about four inches long, but not deep—they were clean cuts, such as might be inflicted by this knife—it would be extremely difficult for him to have inflicted the cut on his right ear himself, and the cut on the back of his neck; it would be impossible for him to do it himself—he had been drink<lb></lb>ing, and was much the worse for liquor.</p>

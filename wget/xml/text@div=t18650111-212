I am a widow, of 6, Stoney-lane, Tooley-street—I was Binding at the corner of Stoney-lane, and the prosecutor was coming along rather intoxicated—the prisoner came alongside of him—I have known him many years—he placed him up against the wall of Mr. Powell's, the undertakers—he then called out to two others, "I have got him to rights"—the two men came up, and the prisoner struck him on the mouth, and knocked him down, put his hand over his mouth, and one of the others kicked him—I called them three unmerciful villains, and went up to them—the prisoner used very bad language to me—the prosecutor was then lying on the ground insensible—I stood by him and screamed; others came to his assistance, and he was taken by my means to the house of Eliza Egan—the men stooped over him, and one of them said, "We have got it," and ran into a little alley—it was after they struck him that they picked him up and put him against the wall.</p>

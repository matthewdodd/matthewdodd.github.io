             was dead. I then said, is it the man that there is a piece of work about so often; she said, yes. I said it can't be; for I saw him but a while back, which I did. I asked her when he died? and she said, at three o'clock. I asked how? and she said when they came to move him for dinner they found him dead. I told her I was certain he did not die at that time, for I saw him at six o'clock. I asked her if she was sure he was dead, for very likely he was only in a fit; I then asked her who was with him when he did die, and she said, nobody but Hannah; Hannah meant Mrs. Mahoney. I told her to send for a doctor, and by no means to let the body be touched, for there must be an inquest held upon it. She went with her hands together, and begged for God's sake that I would not say the man was dead. She then asked me to let my servant fetch her some wood, as she was so frightened she could not fetch it herself. I then served her with half a pint of gin that she wanted.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you recollect how much she had in the whole day-A. About a pint and half a quarter. I did not see her again in the course of that night. I had not seen Mahoney that afternoon. My house is so situated, that I can hear every noise in the house in which Mahoney lives. After this conversation I shut up my house immediately and went to bed. I had been to bed some time, and I believe it was between eleven and twelve when I was awakened by a tremendous crush, and in fact I thought it was my own street door that was broken open. I got up, and threw up the sash, as I slept in the front room, and I saw a short woman rush out of Mrs. Mahoney's house, and run into the street, saying, Mary, you have murdered him.</p>
               <p>Q.Was that said to any one - A. I don't know. She turned round as she was coming out, and she came out as if she was pushed out. She said that, I thought to someone in the house. I knew that woman; I knew her very well; her name is Doe. I watched her into the next turning, and watched a considerable time to see if she would return; but: she did not return; I did not see or hear any thing more that night. I could not tell what part of their house that tremendous crash came from; but I know by the sound that it came from No.3.</p>

The window shutters were shut; the curtains were down, and Mahoney was there when I came in; I spoke to her.</p>
               <p>Q. Now tell us, as near as you can recollect, every thing that was said - A.When I went into the room and found the corpse in the situation I have described, I asked Mrs. Mahoney how she came to remove the body? I said, I supposed she was aware that if that man died suddenly, there must be a Coroner's Inquest held on the body? she said, she was aware of that. I told her it ought to have remained in the clothes the man had on when he died? she said, as to that, it was her country fashion to lay them out as soon as they were dead. As I said before, I told her it was extremely wrong? and she said, she knew nothing about that. She said, that she hoped, or wished, or words to that effect, that the Coroner's Inquest might be delayed as long as possible. I told her that rested with the Coroner, and not with me. After that, I looked at the body; I saw some marks on the face; and seeing them, it struck me very forcibly, that the man had not died a natural death. I thought there appeared to be a blow on the left jaw, two scratches on the right jaw, and a scratch on the nose. I left the room immediately, and went to the Coroner for his warrant. That was all that passed on the Tuesday. Afterwards I saw the body more particularly; I saw it with Mr. Burges; about one o'clock. I went to Mr. Burgess after I had obtained the warrant from the Coroner. Mrs. Mahoney and three or four more were present when Mr. Burgess was there; I firmly believe that Mrs. Killivar and Mrs. Doe were there. The second time there were five or six candles. I assisted in examining the body more minutely the second time. I then saw the marks I had observed the first time, and also observed a mark round the neck, as if a small cord had been tied round very tight, and under the jaw on the right side there was a black mark as if the skin had been drawn up, or twisted up.</p>
               <p>Q.Did Mahoney say anything - A. I forget. She said the first time, that he had died with the cramp in his stomack. I don't recollect that she said anything the second time. She attended before the Coroner's Jury, and so did Killivar. I had no conversation with Kilivar until I took her on Friday night; she told me she knew nothing about it; she stated to me as I was taking her in a coach to Marlborough-street, I am very sorry, but I did not speak the truth before the Coroner and the Jury. The answer I made was, you acknowledge not to have spoken the truth before the Coroner; she replied, that every word she spoke before the Coroner and Jury was false; she told me so herself, without asking any questions. She said, she was under great obligations to a certain person, who induced her to swear by the Holy Cross of Christ not tell the secret. She then informed me that after she was so sworn, she was shewn the dead body of Walsh; she said the body was lying on the bed, and the bed was very wet, as if water had been poured over it, and the body was nearly cold. She said, when the oath was sworn, a certain person said, she would shew her something, and then that certain person said, Maurice Walsh is dead, and then shewed the body; Killivar expressed something, that it was a shocking thing; and I told her it is not too late to tell the truth now, if you spoke falsely before; speaking of the nature of the crime she had committed. I told her, I was sorry at a married woman's swearing falsely; and she said, oh! we don't care for your oath. She did not speak to me any farther on the subject. Then we got up to the office. The day that the Coroner's Jury sat was the 7th of

            . I live at 31, Little Portland, street, in the parish of St. James's. I remember Mrs. Mohoney calling me up on Tuesday morning, the 6th of August; it was the mother of the prisoner Mahoney; her mother said, she wished me and my wife to go to Mrs. Mahoney; accordingly I went; I got to her place between three and four o'clock; I saw a man laying dead on a bed there in the back parlour; he had part of his clothes on. I saw the prisoner Mrs. Mahoney there, her mother, and my wife, and several more who came backwards and forwards during the time; I knew Johannah Doe was one. The prisoner Killivar came in a short time afterwards; Mother Mahoney, the mother, asked me to lend a hand to undress the man, and I did; I took off a blue jacket, and stripped the body. The prisoner Mahoney assisted me; we striped the body entirely. I observed no marks of violence whatever. All the mark I could see was a small speck on the point of his nose; there was on neckcloth about his neck; I did not observe any mark on the neck I asked Mrs. Mahoney how he died? and she said, she did not know. Killivar did not say any thing that I know of. I was in the room nearly the whole day; I put the neckcloth on the dead man; it is customary. I don't know whose neckcloth it was; Mrs. Mahoney, the mother of the prisoner, gave it me. I held the candle when Mr. Burgess examined the body.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any marks that you had not seen before - A. Mr. Burgess pointed out a small crease, he thought about the neck.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe it was so - A. I could not discern any more than the regular and natural wrinkle round his neck.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you leave the appartment of the prisoner Mahoney - A. I was there backwards and forwards until the man was buried. I knew that Killivar lived in the same house. I asked Mahoney how the man came by his death? and she said, she did not know. I did not ask Killivar that question. The body was not shaved when I first saw it; I shaved it; Mrs. Mahoney requested me; she borrowed a razor for me to do it; I had never shaved a dead man before; I did it as a good natured act for a man whom I knew. I did not go to bed after three o'clock that morning.</p>

            . I lived at this house, No. 5, I know the prisoners at the bar; I knew the deceased also; the deceased had lodged in the second floor, but he had removed. He was at that house on the Monday, in Mrs. Mahoney's room; I did not see them together there, I only heard them. I had such<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181609180023"></xptr>a knowledge of their voices that I was enabled to say with certainty that it was they.</p>
               <p>Q. At what hour in the evening was your attention drawn towards them - A. I believe at six or seven o'clock, but I can't say exactly to half an hour. I heard a fighting and quarrelling for an hour or two, and I heard the deceased call out, Oh my God! my God! my Christ! my Christ! That was between six and seven o'clock. or it might be later; the fighting and quarrelling was before this; the quarrelling was all in two voices, which I could distinguish; I could hear Mahoney's voice, she was calling him a bitch's son, and all such low language as that. Their room window was open, for I heard it shut; it was shut immediately after the cries I have described. I went out at half past nine o'clock; up to that time I observed nothing farther than what I have observed already. At the time I was going, which was at about half after nine, I saw persons in the passage, and heard them talking in the back parlour, and I saw the woman from the Black Horse with a can of beer; they were talking in the back parlour as I went by; the door was shut. I returned at half past twelve; there was a woman sitting on the stairs I took no notice of that. At eleven o'clock the next morning I heard of this business.</p>
               <p>ANN MITCHELL. On the 5th of August, I lived in Mrs. Mahoney's house. I went out on the night of that day, about half past nine; I came home about half past twelve. Mrs. Killivar let me in; the house was all quiet when I came home. About five o'clock in the morning Mrs. Maboney came up to my room, to fetch my table. She knocked at the door, I said who is there, she said Mahoney; and I asked her what she wanted, and she said she wanted to borrow my table; she asked me if I did not think it strange she should fetch the table, and I said yes, meaning so early in the morning; I asked her what she was going to do with it, and she said she was going to lay out a man on it; I asked her what man, and she said Walsh; I asked her how he came to die? and she said ask me no questions. With that she takes the table down stairs; I asked her if I should assist her, and she said no, she could carry it herself. At nine o'clock in the morning I went down and found Walsh laid out. This was a long deal table with four legs. When I was going down in the morning for wood to light my fire, I saw the body laid out, and Smith the beadle was coming in at the door. I heard no noise. I saw the body of Walsh, but did not go close enough to it to see any marks.</p>

             was dead; I went along with her, and saw the man lying in the bed room with his clothes on; that was in the back parlour. I began to cry, I found him dead and cold. I went into the next room and was crying there until I was very ill indeed and I fell asleep in that place, and never left it until Dr. Burgess came that morning. I saw Mrs. Mahoney, she was crying, I did not ask her how he come by his death, nor did she tell me, not a word. I never said anything about how he died, so help me God, not a word.</p>

            . I live at No. 4, George-street St. Giles's, next door but one to where Mrs. Mahoney lived. I saw a woman come out of her house between eleven and twelve on the night in question; she came out and slammed the door after her, and said, the man is murdered, he is murdered. I heard nothing more that night.</p>
               <p>ROBERT M'CLELLAN. I am an upholsterer, I live in Russell-street. I was passing through George-street on the night of the 5th of August at about a quarter before ten. At the house where the body was afterwards found dead. I heard a noise in the back parlour, like some people fighting; I heard them wrestling and fighting, and I heard them come against the wainstcoat and door three or four times. I did not hear any voices at that time. Immediately after that I heard something heavy fall on the ground as if one or two people had fallen down together. I then walked away, and had not gone above four or five paces, when I heard a person make a loud scream; it was very piercing, and seemed to come from a person convulsed, and in great agitation of mind. I then returned to the door, and heard a noise in the farther end of the passage, of people coming out. Instantly two men and a woman came out. There are two steps at the door, and they did not come down step by step, but they came all out in a lump down both, and ran down the street as fast as possible; they came out as if there had been a person behind them with a drawn sword; if there had been, they could not have come out with more hury. When they were gone, I looked in at the door to try if I could see any person, or if I could hear any noise; but I could neither.</p>
               <p>MARY KILLIVAR. I am the child of one of the prisoners at the bar. On the 5th of August last, when Walsh died, my mother lived down in the cellar at Mrs. Mahoney's house. About six o'clock in the evening I came home, I did not hear any noise then. It was Sunday Mrs. Mahoney, and Mr. Walsh made the noise; they were fighting; it was about my father. Mrs. Mahoney and my father had a dispute, and Mr. Walsh interfered; one struck the other and so it began; they were fighting all night; she called him a b-y bitches son; and a b-y whore's son, and he called her a whore. I was on my mothers back stairs whilst this was going on. When I came home on the Monday evening, all was quiet, only Mrs. Mahoney cried on the bed. She was in the back room at the time, sitting on the bed crying. I went into the room, Mrs. Mahoney asked me to light the fire, and to get her a drop of water to get a cup of tea for us.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you do as she desired you - A. Yes; I struck a light with a tinder box in Mrs. Mahoney's room; there was a little water in the kettle; my mother was in the same room with Mrs. Mahoney talking. Walsh was on the bed, where Mrs. Mahoney was sitting; she had been crying for a long time. Mrs. Doe was not in the room at that time. Mrs. Mahoney sent for her about three o'clock in the morning? She told my mother to go for a quartern<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181609180024"></xptr>of gin and bitters; she went, and came back; my mother had one glass, and Mrs. Mahoney had another. I don't know what they talked about. The tears were coming out of my mothers eyes; my mother asked Mrs. Mahoney what was the matter with her; and Mrs. Mahoney would not tell her.</p>
               <p>Q.What made your mother cry then - A. Mrs. Mahoney would not tell her what was the matter. I saw the old man in bed, he was stretched out, and his hands were laying down. Only part of the clothes was over him, I think a blanket, a sheet, and a quilt; he was dead.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you know that - A.Because when I was putting the tea-things on the table, Mrs. Mahoney said she would not have any tea; at this time my mother was gone down to wash her hands and face. There were no clothes on Mr. Walshs's face, so I went over to the side of the bed, and saw he was dead; I was not alarmed, but when I found it, I set the tea-things on the table, and went down to my mother; my mother knew he was dead.</p>
               <p>Q. How-A. Because Mrs. Mahoney told her, and made her swear by the ten crosses of Christ, not to tell any one that Mr. Walsh was dead.</p>
               <p>Q. How is that done - A. She told my mother to put two fingers of one hand, across the fingers of the other; my mother was not to tell that old Mr. Walsh was dead. Mrs. Mahoney said no more at that time. My mother asked Mrs. Mahoney to lend her a bonet, and then she went to Marlborough-street, because there was a man had stuck my uncle. Mrs. Mahoney did not say anything to me after my mother was gone away. When I saw Mr. Walsh in the bed, he had no clothes on; he had his neck-cloth about his neck, and he had a shirt on, but no waistcoat; it was a white handkerchief. I looked at his face, it was all black and blue. I did not observe anything else. My mother came back from Marlborough-street about half past nine; she went into Mrs. Maboney's room. I went to bed, and told my father Mr. Walsh was dead. I heard

             crying up stairs at the door, and I went up to her; she was in the parlour, in which the man was lying, she was at the bed along with Mrs. Mahoney, crying. I was going into bed, but I heard such a noise up stairs that I would go up. I went up to the door of Mrs. Mahoney's room, and my mother opened it for me; then I went down stairs again, and went to bed. There is a hole in Mrs. Mahoney's door for the key; a person can see through that hole; if you look through, you can see the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see anything through that hole after the door was shut - A.That night.</p>
               <p>Q. Yes - A. No I did not look through the hole that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen anything through the keyhole before - A. Yes, I could see Mrs. Mahoney go into bed with Mr. Walsh. In the day time of that day I saw Mrs. Maboney at the bed through the key hole, that was when it was day light. My mother was not in the room at that time; I found the door locked, and I looked through the key hole, and saw her on the bed; he was inside the bed, and she was laying outside, I could see his hands; his hands were outside the bed clothes; one of Mrs. Mahoney's hands were under her own head, and the other was on her body; she appeared to me to be asleep. I heard the people say the next morning, that the work-house doctor was there. My mother did not come in the morning until three o'clock. I do not remember carrying any water to Mrs. Mahoneys, nor seeing any water made use of until I was there. I did not see any scattered about the room or bed. I did not, while I was looking through the key-hole see anything done to the body. My uncle's name is Desmond. I have been staying with him since my mother has been in prison. When my mother came down at three o'clock in the morning, she spoke to my father but it was in Irish, and I do not understand that. My father asked her what made her so late, and she said she had been up with Mrs. Mahoney. On the Sunday when Mrs. Mahoney, and Mr. Walsh were fighting, Mrs. Mahoney beat him with the poker and shovel about the head and shoulders. Walsh knocked her down with his hands. When she beat him, he had been at the step of the door speaking to my father.</p>
               <p>Q. The next morning had he any marks - A. Yes, he had a bite on his nose. Walsh aad Mahoney had dined together.</p>

            . I am the mother of the prisoner Mahoney. She sent for me on the Monday night, between twelve and one; Old Walsh was as dead then, as he is now; he looked as though he was asleep. My daughter told me that Maurice was dead. I went over to the bed, and I said La! so he is sure enough.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any marks on his face - A. No, not that I saw a hap-worth. He look as though he was asleep in his clothes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear your daughter say how he died - A. I did not ask; I did not want to hear anything more about it again. Mrs. Killivar did not tell me. I did not see any knives or forks or plates in the room, and there were no clothes on the man but his own. I did not see anything about his neck.</p>

            . I am apothecary to the parish. On the morning of the 6th of August, I was sent for to this house, in George street. I found a dead body there; I was shewn into the back parlour, by Smith, the beadle. I saw Mrs. Mahoney there, Smith, and others, whose names I don't know. The body was laid out in the usual manner for an Irish Wake; it was stript of its clothes, but had a sheet about it; it had a neck cloth about its neck. Mrs. Mahoney knew me perfectly well. I examined the body externally; I observed no kind of mark about it; whatever, by which I could account for its death; my attention was then directed to the head and neck, and I took the neck cloth off; I observed a very extensive bruize on the left jaw under the ear, and several scratches on the face; this was in the presence of several persons. I think I observed it in the hearing of those who were present; I am not positive, I also found a very plain and decided mark extending all round the neck. I concluded in my own mind that the mark about his neck was the cause of his death. I asked Mrs. Mahoney wether she had sent for any medical man, and why not for me, as she knew me? her reply was, that she was so<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181609180025"></xptr>agitated that she did not know what she did; she did not say any thing more to me. I did not examine his hands the first day. I concluded that the mark round the neck must have been produced by a rope or some such thing tight about the neck. I concluded it must have been produced by a rope; but I can't take upon myself to say it was; it night have been produced by a tight-bandage, a silk handkerchief twisted tight would have produced it; it was such a mark as satisfied me that it must be produced by something small, it was regular all round. On the day the Coroner's Inquest took place, I examined it in the presence of the Coroner and of the Jurors I pointed out the same marks upon the neck as I had observed before, although they were not quite so very evident. I then examined the arms; I found them very much discoloured the lower arms; they looked as if some ligature had contained then so as to impede circulation. I think the mark round the neck would produce stragulation and death. I should think the bruize on the lower jaw would not produce death it was not in a part where a bruize would be fatal</p>

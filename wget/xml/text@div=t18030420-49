We went to the pawnbroker's, Mr. Harris, in Fleet-street, and found the thirtytwo diamonds in a box, taken from my shop; we use melting-pots in our trade, and I found the gold in one of them in his box.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Have you any partner? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Don't you weigh your brilliants before you deliver them out? - A. No, I thought him honest.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. What form was the thirty-two brilliants to be worked into? - A. A crescent; he asked me if I should like that shape, which you will see the impression of in that box. (Produces a box.)</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot speak to a brilliant without knowing the exact weight? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You usually buy them by weight? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at those - (shewing a box with a brilliant crescent) are those or not the brilliants you gave the prisoner? - A. I don't believe them to be, but I cannot swear they are not.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the utmost value of one of those brilliants? - A.Perhaps eight or ten shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. It is near twelve months ago that you gave the prisoner the brilliants to work? - A. Yes, it might be.</p>
               <p>Q. You never gave him the gold? - A. No, he took that out of the skins.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it possible to remember the precise value of the diamonds you gave him twelve months ago? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner worked for himself, and sometimes for Mr. Gibson - did not he? - A. I did not know it till I made this discovery.</p>
               <p>Q. You ordered him to work the diamonds up at his leisure, and when you first accused him, he said he had some diamonds in pawn? - A. He acknowledged there were thirty-two diamonds of mine in pawn, and begged I would not expose him.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there not thirty-two diamonds in the box I shew you? - A. I cannot tell.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. What is the utmost value of any one single piece of the gold? - A. There may be a piece worth twenty or thirty shillings; I have not weighted them separately.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Watson. The prisoner gave the name of John Watson? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been in the pawnbroker's business? - A. Many years; it is seldom persons give their real name when they pledge things.(The diamonds produced.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Hobdell. They are brilliants, and of a similar quality to those I delivered to the prisoner; every working jeweller has such; I cannot swear to them; no man can swear to diamonds, unless he marks them; I had told him he might work them at his leisure.</p>

             sworn. - I am a constable, and went with Hobdell to the prisoner's; Mr. Hobdell asked him what he had done with his diamonds; the prisoner said, he had them; the prosecutor said, then deliver them to me; he said, I cannot do it directly; I said, very likely you have sold them, or pawned them; he said, he had pawned them for a guinea and a half, at Mr. Harris's, in Fleet-street; I took him into custody; we searched his lodgings afterwards, and found the duplicate in his breechespocket, in his box; we went to the pawnbroker's, and saw the diamonds.(Thomas Reynolds, a constable, confirmed the testimoney of the last witness.)(The duplicates produced.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. The diamonds I am accused of stealing are my own, and those which my Counsel presented to the Court are Mr. Hobdell's; I pledged my diamonds, as I wanted money to make up a bill; it is customary for every one who works at home, to buy a few diamonds, as they are in the habit of working for a number of people, and are called upon to furnish a diamond or two now and then.</p>

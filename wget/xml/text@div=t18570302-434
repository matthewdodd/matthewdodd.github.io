                  </hi>. I am managing assistant clerk at the Southwark County Court. I produce two certified copies of entries in the minute book belonging to the Court; they are certificates of the judgment under the seal of the Court; they purport to be signed by the Registrar of the Court—here is likewise the plaint; it represents the entry of the cause of action in Judd <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Green, on 18th Dec, 1856, marked J. 14535—the amount is 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—here are the particulars which they are bound to deliver.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ROBINSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is that the original? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the defendant is served with a copy of it; there are two copies filed—I can say that that was so in this instance, because we annex them to the summons—I did not serve the summons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LOCKE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did Green appear? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He did—the next document is the judgment—on 16th Jan. it was adjourned to 3rd Feb., for the produc<lb></lb>tion of the books, and also of the plaintiffs wife, as there was a dispute about the bread book—on 3rd Feb. Mr. Hughes appeared as counsel for the defendant, and this book was produced; I have it in my possession, the Judge ordered me to impound it, and also the I O U and a copy of the certi<lb></lb>ficate—this is the I O U (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was produced by Judd, the plaintiff—I affixed the seal of the Court to it, and it has been in my possession ever since—this is the certificate—it was produced by Green, and also this book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they have not been out of my possession since—the wife was examined—I was present on both occasions—I recollect the circumstances, and the particular caution which Mr. Clive gave the defendant—this (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>) is an extract from the book, made under the 111th section of the Act of Parliament. (<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ROBINSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">objected to this being admitted, and contended that, even if the book was produced, the entry in it would not be the entry of the cause of action, which could only be proved by the production of the plaint note, and proof of it being served on the defendant, it being necessary that the evidence he gave should be material to the issue, for which purpose it became necessary to prove that he knew what the issue was, which could only be done by proving the plaint.</hi>)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LOCKE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is that the plaint? (<hi rend="italic">produced). A.</hi> That is the entry of the plaint, which is the record of the Court—if the defendant had not appeared, the officer would have been called forward, and sworn to the ser<lb></lb>vice. (<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LOCKE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">produced the Act of Parliament, which stated: "Such entries, or a copy thereof, bearing the seal of the Court, shall at all times be admitted without further proof</hi>" <hi rend="smallCaps">THE COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">was of opinion that, if the defendant was proved to have sworn falsely, it was not necessary to prove that he was aware of the materiality</hi>). On 3rd Feb. Mr. Judd was examined, and afterwards his wife—the claim was likewise for board and for rent—the defendant tendered himself as a witness—he was sworn by the last witness, in the presence of the Judge—he gave evidence, and was cautioned by the Judge over and over again—the Judge told him to be cautious in what he was stating—as near as I can remember, after frequent cautioning on the part of Mr. Clive, he told him that three of the wit<lb></lb>nesses were in Court, Ford, Cuttress, and Dallor, and that he should</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185703020111"></xptr>
               <p>take his answers down—he then asked him if he knew Reynolds, Ford, Cuttress, and Dallor?—he replied that he did—the Judge then asked him whether he had admitted to them owing Judd any money?—he replied that he had never admitted to any of them that he did—as near as I can recollect, he said, "I never said to any of them that I owe Judd money"—he was then asked about an I O U—he was asked whether he had stated to any of the witnesses that he had given Judd an I O U? and he said that he had never seen the I O U till the last Court day, meaning 16th Jan.—he was then asked about board and rent, and said, "I never said anything to anybody about board or rent," or "about money I owe to Judd for board or rent," as near as I can recollect, that was it—three of the four persons mentioned to him were called, that was after he was put into the box—they were Ford, Cuttress, and Dallor—their evidence decidedly contradicted him; judgment was then given for the whole amount—the Judge ordered him into custody, and he found one bail in 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the money was paid, with the costs, ten days from that day—it was what we call a short order—the defendant came to the office, and paid the money himself—this is the certi<lb></lb>ficate of the Judge; it is under the seal of the Court, and is signed by Mr. Clive. (<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ROBINSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">contended that this was not evidence, and</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">THE COURT</hi>., <hi rend="italic">having looked at it, considered that it ought not to be read.</hi>)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How many causes are you in the habit of hearing in a day? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We enter sometimes 200, sometimes 250 causes in a day—I cannot help listening to them—I endeavour to dismiss them from my mind, but cannot always succeed—the plaintiff having completed his case, the defendant was examined before the other witnesses—the plaintiff being examined, an adjournment was taken, as he repudiated the name S. Judd; he said that it was signed by the wife—he did not say that he saw her sign it, or that the money was paid by a person named Pocock; he said, "My lad paid the money and brought the book"—I do not know whether Pocock was the name, I never beard it till yesterday—Pocock was not examined—I do not know that Pocock was his lad; I only know it now from what I have heard—he did not tell me that that was the way it was usually paid; that the lad took the money and brought the book—the Judge took down what he said, and I have his notes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi>. I am a baker, and live at Broad Green, Croydon. In Dec., 1850, I took a house in Redcross-street, Borough; the defendant was occupying apartments in it when I took it, and continued my tenant—that is how I became acquainted with him—he paid 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week for his apart<lb></lb>ments—I cannot say how long he paid it; the man who collects my rent, made this bill (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) out at my direction—he paid the 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week up to 2nd June, 1851, when he told me that he was coming into a great deal of property, and if I would allow the rent to run on, it would be a great benefit, and would enable him to get certificates from the different Courts—I allowed it to run on till Jan., 1853; 103 weeks, which amounted to fifteen guineas—this account is neither in my writing, nor my wife's, not the figures—my wife principally served him with bread, and she kept the books—I sued him for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, for bread; my wife will prove that—he had</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185703020112"></xptr>
               <p>his bread of us during those months—I said that I could not let the bread and rent go on without money; and he said, "You have behaved very cruel to me, and I will leave"—I said, "If you leave, you must give me an acknowledgment for what you owe me;" and he went up stairs, and sent down this I O U (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) by his servant—I received it—we then had a fresh arrangement, and he paid me 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week regularly, till I left the house; about the half quarter, 1854—I then went to Croydon—I met him several times at a public house, and he said, "I am ashamed to see you"—I heard that he had received the money—he said, "I cannot pay you, but I will pay you in June"—I went in June, and he said, "I do not know when I shall pay you"—I said, "I shall not come, I shall send somebody else," and employed Dallor to go for the money—I did not make out a bill to him till I was at the County Court; it was given to him; this is a copy of it—the agent made out the bill, and he said to me, "You hold this as a copy"—I will swear the defendant had it because I gave it to him—that was the same day that Pocock brought me the I O U—I afterwards proceeded against him in the County Court, for the amount, 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and received the money out of Court for it—I never saw his writing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is he a person of rather weak intellect? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know that he is—there is a suit in Chancery, and he has told the witnesses that he has got the money, or received a portion of it—he was to receive some millions; all Woolwich—I do not know whether there is a Chancery suit at this moment—I know there was one at the time he was allowed to go in my debt: that is the reason I let him go on—he told me that he would give me a house in Woolwich when he recovered the property.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> From 1853 to 1856, was not the arrangement between you, that when he got into possession of the property, he was to pay you, otherwise he was not to pay you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He cannot produce any writing to prove it—I received this I O U after he went up stairs, from his servant, a boy; I do not know his name, or whether it is Long; I know the person—I never saw any of the defendant's writing—I know that his servant gave me this piece of paper—I do not know that that servant has gone to Australia; he was in Court to day; that is him (<hi rend="italic">Pointing to Peacock</hi>)—I made no demand upon him till 1856, when I heard that he had come into some of his property—I never showed him the document at all—he did not say that he had not given it; he never mentioned about it, and I never mentioned it to him that I know of—I asked him for the money he owed me, and he said, "In June I will pay you the whole amount;" that was said in the street—I went home directly, and found that I had this I O U for 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my cash box, and looked at the amount; I kept it there as money—I do not know the name of Long at all.</p>

               <p>was there—when I asked for the acknowledgment, he said, "I will," and went up stairs, and the I O U was sent down during the same day—the fresh arrangement was made after that—I did not say anything to him next time I saw him about the I O U, and I never asked him for the money till last May—I never showed it to him, or mentioned it to him till I was at the County Court at Southwark, but it was in my cash box all the time—he complained that it was very cruel of me to make him give an acknowledgment; I said, "It is quite right that I should have an acknow<lb></lb>ledgment after all this money you owe me"—he then went up stairs, and then went into the hospital about his business—I cannot say how long it was before the I O U came down, but it was all in the same day; it might be an hour, or it might be two hours afterwards—I bad other business to attend to—no message was brought with it, only, "Here is the acknow<lb></lb>ledgment that Mr. Green owes you the money"—(<hi rend="italic">There was no signature to the I O U.</hi>)</p>

I was in the County Court, Southwark, at the hearing of Judd <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Green—I had been subpœnaed, or I should not have attended—Mr. Green told me eighteen months ago that he owed Mr. Judd for board and rent between 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was when I first knew him, and when he lived with Judd and with Ford—he has said that half a dozen times—he also said, "Mr. Judd has an I O U from me"—he has talked to me about the I O U several times, when we have been smoking our pipes together in the parlour—he was sober at the time—I do not believe I ever saw him the worse for liquor—I heard him examined at the County Court; the Judge asked him whether the debt was just, and he said, "No;" and whether he gave an I O U to Mr. Judd, and he said, "No;" but it was proved—the Judge or the Counsel asked him whether he had ever said any<lb></lb>thing about the I O U to me, or told me about it, and he denied it—I was asked by Green to arrange the debt for him, but I cannot tell you when; it was before this action was brought, but after the debt was due—I told him that if he would give me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay over to Mr. Judd, I would arrange it with Mr. Judd, and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. afterwards in a month, and he promised to bring it to me, but no money came, and it was not done—Mr. Judd would have accepted it then—it was to be altogether liquidated for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this was twelve months ago, but I cannot say exactly; it was before he went into the shop—Green said that he was going to have some money by some lawsuit—he asked me to make an arrangement, and I said that I could accommodate him—he did not ask me if I thought Judd would press him for the amount.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You managed to persuade him to promise to give the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Yes—I had not received my instructions from Mr. Judd, but I spoke to him afterwards, and he agreed to it—I told the defendant that I thought I could manage to settle the debt of 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at the end of a month—I of course had had a conversation with Judd before that, and arranged it, and if he had brought the money it would have been all right—I have known Judd eighteen months or two years—the defendant was living with him when I first knew him, and he shopped in the house when Ford took it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say that he told you he owed Judd a sum of money for board and rent? was not it that Mr. Judd said that he owed him a sum of money for board and rent? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, he did claim that money of him—I shall not say more than I know—he was put in one box at the County Court at the same time that I was put in the other box—I do not think he is a man of very strong intellect; I think his upper works are a little soft, from his</p>

               <p>talking, for some time, and I really do not think he if quite right—he is not very excitable, he is not big enough for that—I mean that I never saw him quarrelsome.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a house agent, of Charlotte-street, Blackfriars-road. I know the prosecutor and defendant—I was subpœnaed by Mr. Judd to the Southwark County Court on 3rd Feb.—I had before that been employed by him to apply to Green for a debt which he owed—I saw Green two or three times, about Aug., 1856, and applied to him for 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. rent, and something for board, about 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. together—he stated that he owed. the money, and referred me to his solicitor, stating that some property was coming to him—I went there, but they did not seem to entertain the idea that he had much prospect—I saw Green again several times, and had con<lb></lb>versations with him, and suggested to him that he had better pay it; I offered to take it at 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week at one time—I was present on 3rd Feb., when he denied the debt—the Judge told him to be particularly guarded and read over the evidence to him, and said, "I will again read it over to you that you may know what you are stating;" and he asked one of the officers of the Court whether he had been sworn, and was told that he had; he then asked him whether he owed the money or not, and he denied it—the Judge ordered the payment forthwith, and ordered him to be committed—the Judge asked him whether he had signed an I O U, but I do not recollect his answer.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you know his writing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I never saw him write, I had not known him before—his solicitor is at Hibernia Chambers, Gooddy, or some name like that—they did not seem to think he was the party entitled in the Chancery suit; he had broached the matter to the solicitor, but he did not think it sufficiently strong, they said that they had made inquiries, but did not feel disposed to go any further.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 10, Horsley-street, Walworth, and know the prosecutor and defendant—I have been at Cuttress's house with Green several times, and recollect Green telling me that Mr. Judd held an I O U for the amount, 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not know the exact amount—he said that more than once or twice—after he had received the summons from the County Court, I had a conversation with him at my house, he said, "I have got it at last;" I said, "What?" he said, "I have got a summons from Mr. Judd;" I said, "Well, you owe him the money, you know, and how do you think you can pay it?"—he said, "I do not know how I can pay it"—I said, "You had better try and settle it, if you can," he paused a bit and said, "It would be the best way"—I said, "Perhaps I can settle it for you for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. "—he said, "If you could, I wish you would," and pro<lb></lb>posed for me to write to Mr. Judd—I said, "No, perhaps I may see him"—on the next Sunday, Mr. Judd called on me about something else, and had tea with me, and I spoke to him about it—I do not think I saw Green after that, but he has spoken to me about the debt, I dare say as many as ten times.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How was it you told Green that you could settle it for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I thought Mr. Judd might settle it, as there was not much prospect of his getting it—on my oath, I do not think I had had any</p>

               <p>conversation with Mr. Judd before I offered to settle it for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; it was my own imagination, I thought I might settle it for that—I had never heard a word about it from Judd that I recollect—I had heard Mr. Judd say many times that he owed him money, and if he did not pay him, he would summon him for it, but he said nothing about taking 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was not at the County Court—it is ten or twelve months ago since the first state<lb></lb>ment was made to me about Green, or perhaps a little more—Green and I smoke our pipes together—he is not a man of very strong intellect, I think he is very forgetful—I always considered him a very honest man, he fre<lb></lb>quently talks very strangely, and is very forgetful; he lived with me three or four years, and I have had abundant opportunity of knowing his character, and believe him to be a very honest fellow.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a store-house clerk to Combe and Co. Mr. Braithwaite was employed some time ago, casing some tank columns with copper—the copper was bought in sheets, and made to fit the columns—we had to make some alterations afterwards, as the copper was carried too high up the columns, and we cut oif six pieces, which I took charge of—I kept them in the counting-house, till within the last fortnight—the last time I saw them was about last Wednesday week—they were then in the store-room where I had taken them to—this is one of those pieces of copper which I placed in the store-room—I know it, because instead of being copper pipe, which is the general material we hare on the premises, it is copper sheets, which were lapped instead of having a joint, and sol<lb></lb>dered afterwards; we faced them first with anti-corrosin, and part of the paint has run down the copper; and I also know it by this peculiar joint—here is red paint, which is anti-corrosive paint, inside it, and here is one corresponding piece, which I brought from the brewery this evening—it exactly matches the other, except in length; in diameter it is nearly the same—I missed in particular these six pieces, and I have missed within the last six months a considerable quantity of copper—the firm is Harvey, Combe, Delafield, and Co.</p>

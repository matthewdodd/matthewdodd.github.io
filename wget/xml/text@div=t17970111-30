               <p>Court. Q. Did you hear of this at the time of the first marriage? - A. No; not till two or three months after.</p>
               <p>Q. After that was heard of, did the prisoner and and Kitty Wilcox live together? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long? - A. They might, for ought I know, a twelvemonth; but I have known very little of them since they were married. The circumstance I was going to mention was this, that some time ago, she wanted Mr. Rowe to go with her to Ireland, to live there, but not to pass for her husband; it was a strong presumptive proof, to the Magistrates, that she had a husband living, and that she wished to conceal her present marriage.</p>

               <p>Q. And so this is to decide a settlement, by a prosecution for bigamy, to get rid of a pauper?</p>
               <p>Dobson. I was summoned to Worship-street, and there I heard that he was married to the woman, he was obliged to marry; he told them the suspicion that his first wife was married, and they gave it as their opinion, at the Commons, that he might marry again, and he, being an ignorant man, was married.</p>
               <p>Court. You see, Gentlemen, the Hampstead officers make this man marry Susannah Redwood, and it is reported that the first husband of the other woman is alive. It appears to me to be a prosecution by the parish, merely to decide a settlement.</p>

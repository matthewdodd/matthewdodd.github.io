                  </hi> I am the wife of John Herbert, of Clarence-yard, West<lb></lb>bourne-street, Pimlico. The prisoner lodged with us—on Wednesday morning, 16th Feb., about a quarter to eleven o'clock, he came and asked me yet the duplicate of a pair of shoes which he had given me to take care of—I gave it him—he said my husband had told him I was to give him 9 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to redeem them—I said I had not got it—he said I could make it up of something—I said I could not—he then went to his bed and sat upon a box, near which there was a clothes-horse with three of my husband's shirts on it—he then went into the next room, and then into his own room again where the shirts were—I then heard him go down stairs—I went into the room, and missed two of the three shirts and a silk handkerchief—I was going after him, but my baby fell down, and that prevented me—I saw him put a bundle under his jacket and go away—he had bad a little to drink—he came back about twenty minutes past nine at night, and my husband said to him, "You are a pretty fellow," to take these shirts"—he said, "Let this sleep, I will pay you for them."</p>

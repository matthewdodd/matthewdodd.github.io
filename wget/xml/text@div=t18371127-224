                  </hi>. I live at Great Ealing, and am a hay-binder in Sir Felix Booth's service. Blake was also in his service as carman—on the 22nd of November, I made up fifty-four trusses of hay to go to Brent<lb></lb>ford—they were all my binding—I have since seen one of them, and can swear to the band I made, but not to the hay—this is the band (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—only fifty-two trusses got to Brentford—I walked behind the team from Mortlake—I never saw Penstone before he was examined at Wandsworth.</p>

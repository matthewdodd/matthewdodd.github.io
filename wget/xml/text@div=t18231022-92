The prisoner was in my service for above twelve months, and entrusted to receive my money. On the 3d of May, here is an entry of his writing, in the day-book; it is an entry of several articles sold to Hutchins - it is not his business to make entries in the day-book - I keep a clerk for that purpose. I have the day-book, in which entries are made of all the monies received; he has entered no amount whatever of money received from Hutchins.</p>

            . On the day in question, I went to the prosecutor's shop, and bought goods, amounting to 2 l. 3 s. The prisoner served me - I paid him a sovereign in part - he said he did not wish me to pay it unless it suited me. He went to the till with the sovereign; I cannot say whether he put it in. I told him to take care of it; he said he had put it into the till.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Has he not set up a tally shop himself - A. Yes, in Goswell-street; I called there on Michaelmas-day, and said I was going to settle with Mr. Dimmock; he said very well. I said nothing to him about it after I heard of the sovereign not being entered. I ordered goods amounting to 2 l. 3 s., and paid him 1 l. on account - he was attending to no other customer.</p>
               <p>MR. DIMMOCK. He never accounted to me for this sovereign - there is no entry of his having received any money all that week - he should have entered the money as received, in the waste book, but had no business to make any entry in the day-book. The rule is, for the person selling goods to call them over to another, who enters them, and puts the name of the person receiving the money against it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. What is the amount of goods sold according to the entry - A. 1 l. 3 s. If the clerk was absent any other young man might make the entry, but not the one who sells the goods. He left me in August or September, and I understand has set up in business for himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not this money have been put into the till - A. No. Each shopman has a separate till with a look to it; all ready money should be entered in the book; they give their money up to me every night; I compare it with their account; his being in business could not injure me. Mine is a tally shop; there was no difference on or about the 3d of May between the cash and the entries. He should give credit for 1 l., and enter 1 l. 3 s. as due. The whole goods should be entered, and if he forgot to enter 1 l. as paid, still the money should have been in the till.</p>

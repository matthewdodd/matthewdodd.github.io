               <p>some antidotes—I went with him to the Coach and Horses, up to the top room of the house, and directly he got within the door he asked if she was dead—I do not think any answer was given—I went into the room, and found the woman lying on the bed, quite dead—I asked when they saw her breathe last—a person said, "About five minutes ago"—she appeared to me to have been dead about five minutes—the prisoner was in very great distress in the room, and said, "Oh, I must tell you all about it, if even I should be hung for it"—he then said he had been following her about the previous evening, along the bridges, and bad great difficulty, in preventing her from throwing herself into the Thames—at the same time he gave me a letter from his pocket—I gave it to the officer, after reading it—this now produced is it—he said that letter had been written, expecting they would have been both dead—he then brought two small pieces of paper out of his pocket, marked, "Oxalic acid, poison"—ow printed and the other written—I observed a red stain on his trowsers—he said he had been sick, and vomited—he then gave me a glass tumbler, tod it had the remains of a salt at the bottom, and part of an orange in it—I think he said, "That was the glass I drank"—he said they had agreed to take poison together, but that he himself felt very sick, and brought bit up—a few white particles dropped from this paper marked "B," and I could feel a crabbedness on it—here is a paper with a few grains of oxalic acid in it—I can tell it by the taste—after saying they had agreed to take poison, he said they had been in very great distress, they had been discharged from their situation at a moment's notice, and they did not know what to do with themselves, they were without a character—I asked him why they had been discharged—he said he had been seen coming out of her bed-room—he asked me what he was to do—I told him to keep himself quiet, he had better consult a law-man, but that I must give him in charge, which I did—the tumbler is not here—I analysed the contents of it—the result was that it contained oxalic acid—a few minutes after I got home another tumbler was brought to me by Davis—I had no conversation with the prisoner about that—I asked him where he purchased the poison—he said he west towards Islington, and got some there, bnt could not tell me where, ex<lb></lb>actly, and the other parcels he got at different places—I should say half—an ounce of oxalic acid would destroy life—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination of the deceased's body—I attribute her death to inflammation of the lining membrane of the stomach, and the whole of the intestines, particularly the small intestines—that could be produced by any acrid poison—the kidneys and spleen were very much congested, filled with dark coloured blood—there was dark coloured blood in the cavity of the chest, the pericardium or bag in which the heart rests, and the abdomen and pelvis, and a dark thick fluid blood in the stomach, of the consistence of tar—I attribute all that to the poison—oxalic acid is the most likely poison to produce it, it was so general—I have no doubt her death was caused by poison—I forgot to mention that the walls of the heart were thin and flabby—I analysed the contents of the stomach, but could detect bo oxalic acid by any test—persons generally vomit very freely before death, and the blood would very likely, and does decompose oxalic acid, and oxalic acid decompose the blood, so that it is very difficult when oxalic acid is once mixed with blood to find it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon of the police. On Tuesday night the 27th of May, I was called to the Clerkenwell station, and saw the prisoner, who complained of heat in the pit of his stomach, and sick<lb></lb>ness—he said he had taken oxalic acid, that a female had taken oxalic-acid at the same time—he said he had bought 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of oxalic acid, she had mixed it, and they had taken it in equal proportions—4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. would buy an ounce or an ounce and a half, but I do not know the price exactly—I pumped some prepared chalk into his stomach—half an ounce, or pro<lb></lb>bably less, of oxalic acid would kill a person—I was not present at the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—I have heard Mr. Pollock's account of the appearances—they are consistent with the person having taken oxalic acid.</p>

               <p>have done wrong; I had better state the whole I know: a little after fire I was told by the landlord of the public-house to get out of his house in ten minutes; I did not say nothing to him, but went up stairs, packed up my things, and the porter brought them away for me to the Horse and Groom; I then waited for her coming away with me, about half an hour, and the porter took her things with mine into the Horse and Groom; then we came outside and asked, both of us, the landlady of the Horse and Groom to take care of them, and said we should be in again in the morning; she said 'Very well, I will do so for you;' we then stood out in tit Horse and Groom yard for a few moments, and talking a moment or two together what we should do. I asked her what Mr. Ridler said to her; (be is the keeper of the Bell and Crown,) and she said he gave her ten minutes to get out; then we went into the Horse and Groom and called for a pint of half and half; we both sat down there and cried for about half an hour, and then she pulled out her money and laid it on the table, and she said, 'You take that, for I'm going to make away with myself in the Thames,' and she got up and went out; I immediately followed her and catched her, and said, 'I won't let you do anything of that sort;' I advised her to take hold of my arm and let me take her home to her friends; she said, 'I cannot think of doing so;' I walked down Holborn-hill with her, and then she ran away from me again and said, 'I will go and throw myself in the Thames;' I caught hold of her again and said I could not let her do so; we went up Brownlow-street, went into a coffee-shop, and called for two cups of coffee; she said to the landlady, 'Can we have a bed to-night:' (this was on Monday night;) she said 'Not for ladies;' we came out of that house and asked one another where we should go and what we should do; I said, 'Let us go up Gray's-inn-lane, that is the most likeliest place, I know where we can get two beds;' she said, 'If you don't be with me this night I will destroy myself;' I said,' How can you think of doing so;' we inquired in two or three houses in Gray's-inn-lane; we could not succeed there; then we went into Leather-lane, and asked a man in a coal warehouse if he had accommodation; he said, 'No,' but be directed us to No. 6, opposite, the Coach and Horses; there the woman said she had no accommodation, and then we got the accommodation as you have heard stated at the Coach and Horses; we were shown up stairs, as you have heard, and went to bed together; in the morning she got up and grasped hold of a knife on a side-table, and she said, 'I will make away with myself now;' I immediately seized it from her and told her I could not see her do so;—we then dressed and went down stairs; she asked the lady if we could have the bed to-night, and she said, 'Yes, if you are com<lb></lb>fortable,' and the girl advised me to pay for the bed for the next night; we came out of the house and came away; we went to a coffee-shop in Hatton-wall; I called for two cups of coffee and two rolls, and she called for two eggs; I read the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> newspaper, and read of the suicide of a young wo<lb></lb>man by taking oxalic acid; it so preyed upon her mind that she deter<lb></lb>mined to do so herself; we came out, and I said, 'What shall we do;' so she said, 'We will take a walk up as far as Islington, and in the chemists' shops as we go along get the oxalic acid;' I said, 'Is there no means left but destroying ourselves;' she said, 'No, not anything;' I then said, 'As you have so fully made up your mind to die, I must die too;' we then walked up to Islington, and going by the chemists' shops I went in and she stood by the door; I asked for a penny worth of oxalic acid at four</p>

               <p>different places; we walked along and came to a public-house opposite the Angel; we went in and asked for 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of hot gin and water—but I must go back: I went into a shop in the City-road to get a sheet of writ<lb></lb>ing-paper—we went into the public-house and asked for the hot gin and water; she asked for a pen and ink, and I then wrote as the letter stated, and this is the letter; we then walked away and went into a public-house in Charles-st., Hatton-garden; I there called for a pint of half-and-half and some bread and cheese, and sat there some time; we then went to the Coach and Horses; when we got there she asked if the bed was ready, and the woman said, as she has stated before, 'I will go and get ready for you directly;' she said it would not be long before the old gentleman came down and we might go to bed—in a few minutes the old gentleman came down and said, 'It is all ready now:' then the girl asked the old gentleman for some cold water, and then she said to me, 'Run out and get two oranges to take after the stuff;' I did so; she took the water; I did not state where I got the oxalic acid; I bought it, 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth at each place; before I went into the Coach and Horses I bought the tumblers, she went in with me to buy them; she took the cold water and I fol<lb></lb>lowed her up stairs; she then took the oxalic acid out of my pocket and put two lots in each tumbler and put the water to it; it would not dissolve in cold water, and I went down and asked for some hot; they gave me some hot water. I then went up stairs to her again; she said, 'What a time you have been gone, I am waiting to die.' I put a little hot water into each tumbler, and she stirred it up. I then said, 'Now don't be in a hurry, come kneel down with me, we must pray first; where shall we go to?' she said, 'I don't know how to pray.' I said, 'I will pray fir you,' and I prayed God to take us, and she was in such a dreadful way after we prayed; she jumped up off her knees, and stirred it up again, and gave me the glass in my hand, and she came and took the other. I said, 'Stop one moment, let me lay this letter out of my hat on the side<lb></lb>board.' I did so, and we then both drank it together; in about five mi<lb></lb>nutes after we were both very sick; I brought mine all up off my storaach, and I thought she had, but I found she was dying, and I ran down stairs, and asked where was a surgeon's, the nearest place, and then ran into a baker's shop, and the young man here ran with me to a druggist's, a few doors further. I ought to have said I asked for a doctor. I asked in the druggist's shop if there was a doctor there; they told me to go to No. 26, Hatton-garden. I did so as fast as I could run; a boy was standing at the door. I asked if the surgeon was within? he said, 'Yes.' I asked the surgeon to come with me with the stomach-pump, for ihe young woman was dying; when we got there she was dead."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The letter was as follows</hi>:—"Dear friends,—I hope you take this to look at, to see how unfortunate we were both situated, quite from all happiness in this world, without friends or character. I have tried my best, but everything seems to turn out against me; so as she is determined to destroy herself, I thought I should never be happy any more, as it was through me she was ruined, as it was reported, but it cannot be proved. I can safely say I never knew to be comfortable in the house, for they was all against us; now, as you see it is come to this—I hope you see after our clothes, and bury us both together. I hope he may get his reward in heaven for us, and others before us unfortunate, unhappy creatures—no way of redeeming a character. Tell all those who inquire after us the reason we did it. Thope</p>

So no more from us unfortunate creatures—Daniel Johncock and Hannah Moore.—God bless us. Amen.—For the Bell and Crown, Ho<lb></lb>born, London; or 45, King-street, Soho; or J.

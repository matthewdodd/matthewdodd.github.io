                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Lisle, a pawnbroker, of 5, Exmouth-street—on the morning of 24th March, I was called up by a policeman at about a quarter to 5 o'clock—I went to the top of the house and found the trap-door wide open, that is over a loft, under which is a room where goods are kept—some of the tiles were removed that would enable a person to open the trap-door, it fastens with a bolt—the moment I went into the room, I missed some silk handkerchiefs, and Cashmere scarves with duplicates—it is my master's dwelling-house, in the parish of St. James' Clerkenwell—this handkerchief (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was in pledge, I know it by the way in which it was rolled round as we always roll them—I do no know these scarves—I swear to these in the large bundle, we have had people apply for them, most of them were pledges, but some were out of time goods—there are no marks upon them, but I know this one has been in pledge at our place; it was in the room safe with the others.</p>

I am servant to Mr. Matthew Lisle, pawnbroker, of 5, Exmouth-street—on 23d March, between 2 and 3 in the afternoon—I shut and fastened the trap-door at the top of the house—the tiles were all safe—nobody had any business there after that time—next morning I saw that the trap-door had been opened and the tiles removed.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, D</hi> 52). On the morning of 24th March, about a quarter to 5, I noticed a plank between the roof of No. 9 and No. 10, Exmouth-street—No. 10, is an unfinished house; No. 9, is five houses from Mr. Lisle's—you could get from No. 9 to No. 10 by the plank, and could then very easily get to No. 5—I got to the plank by getting up a ladder half way, I then climbed up the wood-work of No. 10, drew the plank on to the roof of No. 10, then returned, went to Mr. Lisle's, and called Mr. Smithers up, it was then a quarter to 5—I went up to the trap-door and saw several tiles removed which were close to it—it was wide open—those tiles being removed would enable a person to open the trap-door if bolted—I went out at it—a person standing in the gutter could very easily take off those tiles—I searched the houses from No. 5, to the roof of the unfinished house; I then went to the roof of No. 4, where I found the prisoner con<lb></lb>cealed in a gutter—I said, "Now then, come on out of that," meaning that gutter—he said, "Oh, all right, I suppose it is a case with me now"—I took him to the station and found these three handkerchiefs on him, this yellow one was one of them—he was wearing the scarf (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) round his neck.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> That was the yellow handkerchief and the scarf which I had round my neck. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> You mentioned nothing about the scarf before the Magistrate—you asked for one handkerchief and fivepence in copper, which was found on you—five or six tiles were removed.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, G</hi> 8). I searched the roof of the house after the prisoner was taken, and found seventy-nine silk handkerchiefs tied up in a bundle, and two loose on the roof of No. 9, and seventy-four duplicates (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), I also found three handkerchiefs on the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I was going home at a quarter-past 4, and saw some<lb></lb>body on the roof; I had heard of a robbery at Mr. Lisle's the week before, and went up the ladder as I could not see a policeman; I crossed the plank and found two handkerchiefs; the policeman then came up the ladder and removed the board; I thought if I did not get down some other way he</p>

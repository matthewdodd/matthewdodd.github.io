I pursued him, and took him in Stonecutter-street; I told him he should go back, and he said for God's sake let me go, and I'll give you the halfpence: the constable came up, and the halfpence were taken from him: there were three shillings and ten-pence-halfpenny: the prosecutrix said, he was the boy.</p>

On the 5th of March I lost a gold watch, six table spoons, four tea spoons, a silk camblet coat, and a waistcoat with 24 gold buttons; there were so many things that I could not put them all down in the indictment. I had given the prisoner warning, and gave her leave to go out on the Sunday; she said she was going to the Hermitage to see for a place. I went that day to my Lord Peterborough's, and staid there from Sunday to Tuesday. On the Tuesdays she came to me there and said, Madam, I have got a place. She desired me to give her the key of the dining room, which I delivered to her, and the key of my drawers, desiring her to bring me some things I wanted, for I was going out with the lady. When she returned I asked her if every thing was safe, and she said yes. At my return on Tuesday night I found the prisoner in the passage, as I believe going out. I asked her what she did there, and she made a frivolous excuse, saying, Nothing at all. She went up stairs with me, and the moment I came into the dining room there was all the sugar strewed over the table. She then asked me if I had taken the silver sugar dish away, I said no. On my going into the closet the spoons were missing, and looking at the bedside the watch was gone. I then called up a man and woman who lived in the house. They said they had lived there twelve years, and never lost any thing in their lives.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is it from Lord Peterborough's to your house?</p>
               <p>Bulley. Not a quarter of a mile; she might go in ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason have you to charge the prisoner with being the person who took these things away, when you was out so long?</p>
               <p>Bulley. My Lord, if any body had opened the outer door they could not have opened the locks without breaking them; but there were no locks broke.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find any of your things again?</p>
               <p>Bulley. I found nothing but the handkerchief, which was in the prisoner's box. [ The handkerchief produced in court.]</p>
               <p>Q. Where was that box?</p>
               <p>Bulley. It was left in my lodgings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever give her that handkerchief?</p>
               <p>Bulley. No. I never gave her any such thing in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear her confess any thing relating to it?</p>
               <p>Bulley. She always said she knew nothing of it. I have sent to several pawnbrokers, but could not find any thing out. She is a Danish woman, and I believe the watch is gone to Denmark.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear any thing of your spoons?</p>
               <p>Bulley. No, I never did, nor of any thing else but the handkerchief. There was a boar's head upon four of the spoons.</p>

            . I was the constable that was sent for to Mrs. Bulley's to take charge of the prisoner; she told me she had lost so many things. I asked the prisoner several questions, whether she knew any thing of these goods; she told me no. I desired her to tell me whether they were pawned any where; she said no, and that she knew nothing of them. She said she had no money but a penny. But two women searching her found this box, [which he produced in court ] with three guineas and half a crown. They were delivered to me, and have been in my custody ever since.</p>

            . I was present when the prisoner's box was looked over in Mrs. Bulley's room, and saw the handkerchief teken out of it; her mistress said, That is mine, I can swear to it, and the prisoner said, If it is yours take it, and threw it on the floor. This is all that I know.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you present when she was searched?</p>

            . Q. I believe you are watchman of Clerkenwell church yard - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. On the night of the 30th of June, or in the morning of the 1st of July, did you observe any thing in your beat - A. As I went round a little after two o'clock I saw some muskets and a blunderbuss hid behind a board.</p>
               <p>COURT. How many fire arms were there then - A. A musket, a gun and a blunderbuss, they were concealed behind this board; I took up this blunderbuss and laid it down again where I found it. I went round the other way, to watch the other entrance of School house yard, there I met the superintendant, I shewed him them; he wanted to take them away, but I said no; he ordered me to lock up my box and go carelessly away.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon afterwards did you see any body come - A. Going on towards three o'clock, it was not day light when I first saw the muskets, it was twilight, I saw three men coming down Aylesbury street, making towards where them things stood, then it was light; when they got down Aylesbury street they turned down St. James' walk, as though they were going towards the prison; when they came to the corner of School house yard they stopped there; that was where the fire arms were; I was about fifty yards from them; the other watchman was in the rear. My companion sprang out and went after them; two of them ran through School house yard, and one of them went down Aylesbury street; he that came towards Aylesbury street escaped entirely; Smith and I assisted in securing him in the passage leading to St. John's square. Simpson was the first man that laid hold of Smith, I came up and assisted; he went down to the watchhouse very quietly, he made very little resistance; when I returned from the watchhouse I saw Meyrick in my two partners hands, he tried to kick and throw them up if he could. I helped in bringing him to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q Did you then go back to where the fire arms was - A. Yes, they had been moved; then I found that bottle, about twenty yards off from where the things had been concealed in School house yard, it was lying down.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. When you first saw the muskets it was twilight - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It was so light you could see muskets - A. Yes; it was not very light, the day was breaking.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got these persons you had got your cutlass - A. I had not; the superintendant had it drawn.</p>
               <p>Q. You say that Smith, when he was taken, he went very quietly with you to the watchhouse, but Meyrick he was very resolute - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he desire you to tell him what he was taken for - A. He did say he had done nothing; he asked why he was taken, I said for running away; we did not know at that time where the robbery had been committed.</p>

            . Q. I believe you are superintendant of the watch - A. I am, of St. James's, Clerkenwell. In consequence of Parker's information I went to the spot and looked at the arms; the blunderbuss was laid behind a post, and the musket was laid behind the board of a rail.</p>

               <p>Q. What time was this that you saw the watchman - A. I think it might be ten minutes past two o'clock, it was twilight, the day had not completely broke.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe after this you and the watchman concealed yourselves to watch for the persons that came after these things - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did any person come - A. The chimes had just gone a quarter before three; there were three men came, they came off Clerkenwell green.</p>
               <p>Q. That is the way from Aylesbury street - A. Yes. The two prisoners were two of the men, I could plainly see them; when they came to the spot they made a dead halt and looked round them, as if to see if any person was watching them; after they had looked round, the prisoner Smith stooped and picked up the blunderbuss, he had it in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did either of the others do any thing - A. Two of them were stooping behind the post; Meyrick was further in School house yard, just by the musket. When he stooped down I sprang out; the other watchman followed the two prisoners down School house yard, and the other turned round; Meyrick let fall a bottle, it broke, I have got the neck of the bottle with the cork<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180807130044"></xptr>in; the liquor was spilled; I tasted it, it was wine.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the blunderbuss that Smith picked up - A. He threw down the blunderbuss before he run down School house yard; I pursued Smith and overtook him at Jerusalem passage; I apprehended him. Parker came up in a minute afterwards; we brought him to the watchhouse, with the assistance of a third man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing - A. I put the point of the hanger to his breast and told him if he resisted I would run him through. After I had taken Smith to the watchhouse I immediately ran back, and just by the church rails Meyrick was in the custody of Burns and others; he was tearing about in a dreadful way; I told him if he did not submit I would cut his head off; he was quieter after that.</p>
               <p>Q. When you took him into Smith, did you ask Smith and him any questions - A. They were put in separate places; we took Smith out; the fire arms were upon the table; we asked him if he knew any thing of these fire arms, he said he never saw them in his life.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure that you saw him throw the blunderbuss down - A. I am positive; I searched him, he had nothing upon him but a snuff box with some snuff in it; I asked Smith what his name was, he would not tell; we entered it in the charge book name unknown. Meyrick had given me another name at another time, that of Foster.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it light enough for you to see if you had been so near them as you are now - A. Not so light as that; in the morning at two o'clock I could see the person of a man certainly; I could not distinguish the features.</p>
               <p>Q. Then at the time when you first saw them, there was not light enough to see their features - A. Not when I first saw them; at three o'clock there was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Who did you give these pieces to - A. I laid them on the table before the police magistrate - the musket and bayonet were fresh with oil; they fitted exactly.</p>

               <p>Smith's Defence. In the morning I passed by the place; I was coming from No. 63, Brick lane, Old street; I was going to the Black Horse, Rathbone place, to borrow a horse for a friend of mine to go to Fairlop fair; as I was going by this place, that man sprang upon me like a tyger, he swore he would cut my leg or arm off; I ran, not with any fear fear for what I had done, I thought the man would run the sword in me; him and the watchman took me to the watchhouse, there they locked me up in a little hole, they called me out to know if I would own to either of these pieces; I told them I never saw either of these pieces in my life; I knew nothing at all about them; in the morning they took me to Hatton garden, from there down to the House of Correction; Mr. Trott and Mr. Hunt went to my place of residence, they secured my wife and young child sucking at the breast, and left two children to the mercy of the street for five days, without bread and meat, or any body to give them any thing; they took the landlord of the house away and shut him up in prison the same length of time.</p>
               <p>Meyrick's Defence. Since the landlord of the house wife has been dead, I have lodged in the same house with Smith in the one pair of stairs. On that morning I got up, I believe about three o'clock, to go to a friend of mine, his name was Sims, he had promised me various times he would indulge me with the use of a horse to go to Fairlop fair; when I had got there I had got to go to Whitechapel, to my harness and chaise cart; when I came to this place they sprung upon Smith. I am a younger man than he; I ran swifter; I had no arms in my hand; I certainly did resist a little when I was taken. I acknowledged to being present to where this property was, but I never stooped to it.</p>
               <p>Meyrick's Q. (to Simpson.) You say that I threw a bottle out of my hand, in what place might I be when I chucked the bottle out of my hand - A. You were running across the road.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance were you from me - A. About seven yards.</p>
               <p>Meyrick. I never had any bottle in my hand.</p>
               <p>COURT, Q. to Simpson. How far distant was he from you when you saw him throw the bottle away - A. About five or six or seven yards; he was in a light coloured coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think that you are able to say that he was the person that threw away that bottle - A. Most assuredly.</p>
               <p>Meyrick. I had a handkerchief on, they pulled it tight had I not made resistance I must have been choaked.</p>

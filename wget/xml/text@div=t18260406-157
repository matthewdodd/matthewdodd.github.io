On the 15th of March I was ironing in the back parlour, when I heard a noise - I looked round and saw the prisoner go out of the shop - I went to the door and saw him with several boys - I could not perceive whether he had any thing in his hand, but I sent my daughter after him - I then missed these boots from my shop, which I had seen just before.</p>

I was in a garden by the fields, and heard the cry of Stop him; I saw the prisoner run across the garden and drop something - I followed him, but he was stopped before I got up to him - I then returned to see what he had dropped, and found these boots, which I took out of some water and gave the officer - I had never lost sight of him.</p>

               <p>Is your warehouse part of your dwelling-house? - Yes; when I came down in the morning, the door of the dwelling-house was on a jar, and it rather alarmed me; I observed it fast the evening before; and part of my property being missing, I was flurried; over the door there are some windows; and I observed above the door, the window was broke; and part of the glass was withinside the warehouse, and part in Oxford-street; I did not find any of the screws forced; the bar had been lifted from its situation; it dropped down to its natural center, as put on by the watchman.</p>
               <p>Could a person by putting their hand into the window which was broke, remove<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179001130014"></xptr>that bar? - No; the door was open when the window was broke; there must be some instrument let down to lay hold of the bar, and to raise it from the catch; I saw that there had been a kind of a friction, from the brightness, which I suppose was the instrument that had been let down; no other part of the house had been broke; I did not know either of the prisoners; I went immediately to Litchfield-street; and the first part of my property that I thought was mine, I found at Litchfield-street; I should suppose it was on the Wednesday after; it was in the possession of Kennedy the constable; it was a part of the Irish linen; I saw nothing else; there was no mark, but according to the number of these cloths that follow one another regularly; and I thought there was a part of my private mark, but part of it was gone; had I been on my oath, I think I must have identified it: either on Wednesday or Thursday, the woman prisoner was called before Justice Barnfather; and her pockets were searched immediately, and there were duplicates found of Payne the pawnbroker; there I found a part of the black velveteen, and a part of the thickset; I had great reason to believe it was my property, because it corresponded with our's in the meanness, and was not well finished; but there was a piece of paper with the private mark of the gentleman we bought it of; but I am not acquainted with it; our private mark was removed; I know nothing of the man prisoner; nothing was found on him; he had pawned the piece of black velveteen.</p>

               <p>(The files handed to the Jury.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The linen was never washed in the middle at all; it was only washed at the end to try the quality of it.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Stiles. Look at the place which the last witness has spoke of as being washed; can you say in your judgment, whether it has been washed or not? - It appears as if there had been some water put upon it, and that it has been rubbed with it; when the cloth is folded up as it comes from Ireland, just about the place<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179001130015"></xptr>where the blue mark is; sometimes it may so happen that it is not there; but we generally mark it near the maker's private mark, about four inches from the edge of the earth.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My wife washed one end of it, to see how it would wash.</p>
               <p>Court to Stiles. Is that usual? - It is generally supposed that they would wet a corner in such a case.</p>
               <p>To Kennedy. You said this two pair of stairs of room was the lodging of Leonard? - He was brought to the rotation-office at that time; and the watchman belonging to Marylebone had got the key from his wife.</p>
               <p>Is the other prisoner his wife? - She goes as his wife.</p>

               <p>I live at Mr. Martin's, of whom Mr. Pownal bought a piece of velveteen that corresponds with the mark of this paper: it has Mr. Martin's private mark, and my own hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Leonard. Do you always mark the goods at your master's shop? - Generally.</p>
               <p>When that came away, was there no more of that quality left? - I cannot say that; this is the paper I marked in Mr. Martin's warehouse.</p>
               <p>Did you mark others of the same quality at the same time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You have perjured yourself already; it was property I bought and paid for honestly.</p>

            's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>This prosecution is against me on account of a prosecution last sessions, in which I was tried, and acquitted, before the recorder: the magistrates asked me where I lived, and I told them; they found these things which I bought of a man in Oxford-road, a pedlar; I gave eighteen-pence a yard for the Irish; there were forty-eight yards; this velveteen that I bought, that the paper was wrapped in, was a piece of Irish wrapped instead of the velveteen; I also bought five yards and a quarter of velveteen, at five shillings and six pence a yard.</p>
               <p>Court to Thurston. What paper was the linen brought to your house in? - The velveteen and linen were both together; the linen does not belong Mr. Stiles; it is at our house now.</p>

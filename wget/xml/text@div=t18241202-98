            . I am an officer. I apprehended the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182412020047"></xptr>prisoner on Friday, the 26th of November, about seven o'clock in the evening, in Playhouse-yard, Golden-lane, close to an iron shop door - Attfield took him first, and he threw some lead away, but not this. I then searched him, and round his body I found this lead, which was afterwards claimed by Mr. Nixon. I went to the house, and compared it - it matched exactly.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was it cut straight across? - A. Yes; Hackman was taken up, and the master said, he thought he was the worst man of the two.</p>

            . I am an officer. I saw the prisoner near the iron shop, and went over to him. I found this lead under his jacket. Gleed found some more round his body - they were both claimed by Mr. Nixon.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not he say he got the lead from Hackman? - A. Yes; Hackman was taken up, but discharged, as there was no evidence against him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Benjamin Griggs, who keeps an eating-house at 10, Lower East-street, Greenwich—on Wednesday evening, 7th September, Williams, Rail, and another person, who I am not positive of, £ went into the back parlour to have something to eat, and on Friday, 9th September, about twenty minutes to 1, the three prisoners came and sat down to their dinners in the back parlour—there was another person there, who left not more than four minutes before them—I took their dinner in, and they paid me—they acted like friends, and walked out together—I then went to a drawer to look at my watch, and it was gone—I had seen it safe about ten minutes before they came in—I informed the police, and afterwards saw it at the station.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman</hi>, 97 <hi rend="italic">R</hi>). On 9th September I received infor<lb></lb>mation from Mrs. Griggs—she gave me a description, and I went down Trafalgar-road, and saw the prisoners turn down Prospect-place—they then came up another opening, called Orchard-place, which is a short street—they went towards Woolwich, and after they had gone a little way, they stopped—I asked them if they had been to the cook-shop to have some dinner—they said, "Yes"—I asked them to come back, they said, "Yes," and Williams asked what for—I said that there had been a watch missed there, and wished them to come to the station about it—they asked me to let them go and see the woman—I said "No"—I searched them at the station, and found this watch on Rail—the turning they went down was rather a roundabout way to Woolwich.</p>

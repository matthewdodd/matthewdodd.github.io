                  </hi>. I live in Buttesland-street, Hoxton. I know the pri<lb></lb>soner—we are both unfortunate girls—on 29th July, about eleven o'clock, I was walking in Buttesland-street, Hoxton, with a foreign gentleman, and was going home—I heard some one running after me, looked behind, and saw the prisoner—she came and looked in the gentleman's face—I made a stand still—she said, "I thought it was Robert Bruce"—I said, "You are mis<lb></lb>taken"—she said it is very much like him, and asked me where I had left him—I said T had not seen him—she said, "He was in your house"—I said, "I am going home, you can come and satisfy yourself"—she walked as far as the third house facing where I live, by the side of me, with her hand in her pocket all the way—she then turned on her heel, as if she was going back, took something out of her pocket, I cannot say what it was, and cut me on the nose—I caught hofd of the gentleman's arm, and put my head under his arm, and I received another wound in my thigh, and another in my neck—I</p>

               <p>screamed out "Murder!" and "Police!"—my clothes were cut through, and I bled very much—a policeman came up and took me in<lb></lb>doors, and afterwards to the station, where a surgeon came and dressed my wounds—while I was at the station I heard the prisoner say, she was only sorry she had not cut my nose off.</p>

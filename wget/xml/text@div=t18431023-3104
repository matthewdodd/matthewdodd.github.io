                  </hi>. I am the only surviving son of the late Thomas Ghorst Tawney, and shall be forty-seven years old in December. My father had a vault in the chapel of St. John's, West-street, Walworth—he died in Nov. 1803—I was not present at the funeral, but I recollect his death, and the funeral going from the house—at that time I had an elder brother living, named Thomas—he died on the 1st of Jan. 1837—I have no reason to believe that the tomb had ever been opened for the purpose of interments, between the death of my father and that of my brother, who was also buried in that vault—my mother died on the 27th Oct. 1837, and was buried in the same vault in Nov.—I attended the obsequies of my brother and mother—a person named Ashley opened and closed the tomb at both those interments—on both those occasions my father's coffin was entire, the lead part was—the wood, the external case, had decayed—it was wood cased with lead—it was safe and entire, as to the leaden coffin, both in Jan. and Nov. 1837—there was no other coffin interred in the vault in the meantime—I believe my father built the vault himself—I am a solicitor, and carry on business in King-street, Cheapside—I live in Regent-square—on Monday, the 11th of Sept. last, I received information, in conse<lb></lb>quence of which I went, accompanied by Ashley, to the house of the elder Mr. Bridgman, on the same afternoon—the door was opened by a servant, and when I inquired for Mr. Bridgman, she asked my name, which I gave—I saw Mrs. Bridgman—the public entrance to the chapel-yard is through the chapel—the coffins are taken that way into the burial-ground—there is no opening to go into the chapel-yard round the chapel—the only entrance is through the body of the chapel—Mr. Bridgman's house adjoins the chapel—Mr. Courtnall's is on one side, and Mr. Genet's on the other—I did not make known my business to Mrs. Bridgman—I sent my name in, and she said Mr. Bridgman would be there shortly—I saw Mr. Bridgman—I told him I came there for the purpose of opening my family vault, as I wished to see what it contained, and I had the bricklayers at the door for the purpose of opening it—he said nothing—I said, "I have the bricklayers here, I will let them in," and I walked into the passage, and opened the street-door, to let them in—it is a very small house—the parlour-door and street-door were close together—Mr. Bridgman said nothing to me—I walked towards the back part of the house, wishing to go through that way, from information I had obtained that there was a passage through the kitchen—Mrs. Bridgman met me at the door of the kitchen, and told me I could not go that way—I cannot say whe<lb></lb>ther Mr. Bridgman was present—she showed me another way, through a little door by the front parlour-window, which led into the chapel, and from the chapel into the chapel-yard—I went through the chapel into the burial-ground, and went to the tomb of my late father, I saw that the large stone at the top had evidenly been removed, and the brick work damaged—the bricklayer's men re<lb></lb>moved the stone quite off the top of the tomb—I then observed that my mo<lb></lb>ther's</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184310230206"></xptr>
               <p>coffin was turned on its side, on to my brother's, and my father's coffin was gone—that is the leaden coffin which I had observed safe in Nov. 1837—there were some pieces of wood lying at the bottom of the tomb, and a patch of hair about the size of my hand—that did not call my particular attention at that time—on the side of my mother's coffin, was a large patch of tallow, at if a candle had been stuck there and guttered—I desired to have my mother's coffin put on its bottom, that I might read the coffin plate on the top of it, and my brother's—the men had a great deal of difficulty in removing it, and talked of taking away the brick-work, but after looking between the lid of my mother's coffin they found this bed-winch jammed in between the lid of mother's coffin and the tomb, so as to make it fast—they could not move it—it has been in my possession ever since—after removing that, they put my mother's coffin flat on its bottom, on to my brother's coffin, not in the place where my father's had been—I directly went through the chapel into Mr. Bridgman's house, I should think that was not exceeding ten minutes after I first saw Mr. Bridgman—I saw the servant, but he was denied to me—I then required to see Mrs. Bridgman, and Mr. John Bridgman, but did not see them—in consequence of what the girl told me with reference to Mr. John Bridg<lb></lb>man, I inquired for the hospital to which I supposed he was gone—I have since ascertained that he was at that time studying for the purpose of becom<lb></lb>ing a surgeon—I did not see him, or any of the family before I left the house that afternoon—after this, I consulted Mr. Clarkson on the subject, in consequence of which, on Saturday the 16th, I went to Union Hall, and applied for a warrant with reference to the younger defendant—I tbink no warrant was granted at that time—the elder defendant was summoned—he attended, and engaged to produce his son, who he represented to be away on the 27th—he did not appear on the 27th—on the 19th of Sept., I wrote a let<lb></lb>ter to Mr. Bridgman, and received an answer—in consequence of further in<lb></lb>formation, on the 21st, I applied for a search warrant, and proceeded with it and Pritchard to the chapel-yard in question—I observed a spot which denoted that the earth had been recently removed—by my direction the earth was re<lb></lb>moved from that spot, and within five or six inches of the surface, a wooden coffin cased with lead was discovered—that was fifteen yards from the defen<lb></lb>dant's back premises—there was no lid to it—there appeared to have been one—the nail holes were perceptible at the side where the lid had been made fast—it was filled with loose earth, and some bones—the officers emptied it, and took it out, and it was left for some days in the chapel-yard in the custody of the police, day and night—after some days, the fragments of wood that I had seen in the tomb, on the 11th, were applied to the coffin, and it formed the entire wooden lid—it had been broken to pieces, and a hole knocked in the middle at the widest part, and when the whole was put together it fitted exactly, might have been nailed on through the old nail holes—I think the coffin was found on Wednesday the 21st, and it occurred to me on Saturday the 24th to do this—I made an appointment with the police on the Monday, to have the tomb fresh opened, and was obliged to have the bricklayers again to re<lb></lb>move the stones—every possible search was made to find the lead belonging to the lid, but we could not find it—there was a little fir tree which appeared to have been recently planted a few feet from where the coffin was found—we searched there, and everywhere else where we saw any earth recently removed, but did not find the lead—we found bones, and skulls in different parts—close to the head of my father's coffin, we found three skulls, and in an<lb></lb>other spot quite close to the loose earth we found another skull—the part where the coffin was found, was in a little border to the left of a gravel walk that leads from the back of Mr. Bridgman's premises up to the stable—it was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184310230207"></xptr>
               <p>not a place that appeared at all used for burial—in searching for the leaden lid, there was a tombstone raised on brick-work, which had evidently been pulled out—it was all loose—the bricklayers put their hands in, and pulled out three coffin plates—that was not my father's tomb.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in Messrs. Richards and Co.'s linen factory, in Bread-street, Cheapside, and am the son of Mrs. Courtnall; at the time in question I resided with her and my step-father, next door to Mr. Bridgman's, in West-street, Walworth. On Wednesday night, the 6th of Sept., I went to bed about eleven o'clock—I slept on the second floor, at the back of the house, which overlooks the chapel-yard in question—I put out my candle and drew up my blind, and on doing so, I fancied I saw some<lb></lb>thing moving in the burial-ground—it immediately attracted my attention—I looked again, and in about five minutes' time I observed three men coming from the direction of the wall that separates the burial-ground from our garden, and go in the direction of Mr. Tawney's tomb—that was in the direction they would have come from Mr. Bridgman's house, without going through the chapel—I did not at that time know whose tomb it was—one of the persons appeared to have nothing on but a shirt, and a cloak over it—one of the others had a cloak, and the other, as far as I could see, was dressed in plain black clothes—I did not see the tomb opened—I observed that it was open—the stone that had been on it was removed to the side—I saw one of the men, I believe the undressed one with the cloak on, descend into the tomb, and saw something handed from the tomb—I also saw it carried away by two of them, one carrying it at each end—they appeared to carry it with great difficulty—I saw some ropes—I could not distinguish whether or not it was lifted up by those ropes—there was perhaps not sufficient light for me to dis<lb></lb>cern whether what was taken out was a coffin, but I made the remark at the time that it was a coffin—it made that impression on me at the time—the third man then got out of the tomb—the other two carried the coffin in the direction of the wall from where I first saw them come—that is in a direct line with Mr. Bridgman's passage—after they got to a certain extent under the wall I could not see them, from the position of my window—it would lead them towards the house—(before I saw the coffin taken from the tomb, I had given an alarm to my father and mother)—the men afterwards returned from the wall where they appeared to have deposited what they took away, and all three returned to the tomb again—I then saw a lantern—it appeared to be brought from Mr. Bridgman's stable, which is in the burial-ground—one of them descended into the tomb with the lantern, the other two remained about the tomb—after the space of about ten minutes, I observed the party come out of the tomb again—I saw nothing more of the light after it was taken into the tomb—I saw a man bring a lever, or long wooden pole, from the direction of the stable, and replace the stone.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you, in the course of this time, an opportunity of observing any one of the three persons, so as to enable you to speak to him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Only from his general appearance and action—I could not see his face, on account of the distance—I have known young Bridgman for a long time—I believe him to have been one of the three, the one that was undressed and had the cloak on—I could scarcely see whether he had shoes and stockings on—the wind blew about his cloak, when he had the lantern, which gave me an op<lb></lb>portunity of seeing his person and appearance, and that assisted me in coming to the belief that it was young Bridgman—I had not seen him wear a cloak at any time that I remember.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in Mr. Courtnall's service. On Wednesday evening, 6th Sept., a little before seven o'clock, I was looking out of the window up stairs, and saw the elder Mr. Bridgman in his garden, coming in a direction from the stable to the back part of his house—a little time after, I was down</p>

               <p>stairs, and heard a digging in Mr. Bridgman's garden—I slept in the same room with Miss Courtnall, and my attention was called to what was going on in the chapel-yard that night—I saw Mr. Garford follow one of the men next evening—after that I heard some two or three men's voices in Mr. Bridgman's house—one of the men said, "I will tell you what it is, John," and, "As sure as my name is Bridgman"—those two observations I heard at intervals, in the course of some conversation—I did not know the first voice—I thought the second voice was young Bridgman's—I have no belief as to the other voice—it was not familiar to me—I continued listening and looking out of window after that, and saw a woman look out of Mr. Bridgman's second-floor window—I thought it was Mrs. Bridgman—I also thought that I saw a man's hat at the other window of that bedroom—about eight o'clock next morning I heard young Bridgman's voice in the garden, calling "Father"—I heard no answer—he went down the garden, towards the stable, as if he was going to his father, as he did not hear him—I had not seen or heard the elder Mr. Bridgman that morning—I do not know exactly when I next saw him—I think I saw him next day in his garden, but I am not certain.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the Custom-house, and live on one side of the chapel, and Mr. Bridgman on the other. I have a lodger who keeps a little dog—it is a very sharp little dog, which barks at strangers and persons coming in and out—I used sometimes to be <hi rend="italic">bothered</hi> with its barking of a night, and have gone out to see what was going on—about a month before this transaction, I heard from the servant at No. 17, that some persons had been seen in the burial ground the night before—I mentioned the circumstance to Mr. Bridgman next evening, and his son was in the yard at the time—Mr. Bridg<lb></lb>man made use of a scriptural quotation, and said it did not matter so much if the spirit was at rest, about the bones being disturbed; but if I thought there was any likelihood of anybody coming into the chapel-yard, he would have a watch set—I said I thought it might be a fancy of the lady next door—he said perhaps it was his servant-girl, that she walked in her sleep, and per<lb></lb>haps she walked into the chapel-yard—he said he had occasion, some years since, to attend at Union-hall about a transaction of that kind, which took place in his yard—I saw a fir-tree planted about the 11th or 12th, which was not there before, to my knowledge.</p>

                  </hi>. A lodger of ours had a dog, which used to disturb us by constantly barking—I heard from a lady at No. 17, that some persons had been seen in the burial-ground, and remember my husband stating that to Mr. Bridgman, who replied, that he did not think any one came after the bodies in the ground—he made some scriptural allusion, and said if the spirits were at rest, it did not so much signify about the bodies—I do not recollect the exact words, but he said if my husband thought so, he would have a watch in the yard—my husband said, no, he did not think it was required—Mr. Bridg<lb></lb>man said he did not know that any persons had come there for a very long time, once there was a case of some persons being taken up, and he had to appear against them—about a fortnight or three weeks before this tomb was disturbed, young Bridgman borrowed the lodger's dog—he said his father's horse shyed at dogs, and he wanted to make it used to dogs—I think he had a little fancy dog of his own at that time—he returned the lodger's dog in about a week.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the dog bark then in the same way it wed to do, or had it become much more quiet? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If strangers came into the ground it barked, it would not bark at young Bridgman—the dog constantly ran in and out the burial-ground, and seemed acquainted with the whole of the family—I do not know whether it barked at them after this, it might occasionally—it did not some<lb></lb>times—when young Bridgman returned it, the lodger offered to give it to him—he said he thought the horse was broken to the dog, and he had no fur<lb></lb>ther use for it, that they were going to dispose of the horse, to they would not wish it any further—on Thursday, the 21st of Sept., I was in my garden and saw Mr. Bridgman digging in his garden—I saw the spot where the coffin was afterwards found—it was not at that spot I saw him digging—it was on the same side, but nearer the stable—he was spreading the earth about with his spade—there was nothing hanging there at the time—I saw a coun<lb></lb>terpane or sheet hanging there the day before, but he was not there then—the coffin was found, I should say, three or four yards from where I saw him digging—it was in the same direction.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was this on the 18th of Sept, which has been spoken of? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know the day of the month—it was on a Tuesday, I think, about eleven in the day—I never saw young Bridgman's dog—I heard him say he had one, but it would not bark, and therefore he wished to borrow one to accustom the horse to it—the fence dividing our premises from Mr. Bridgman's, has gaps in it—the palings have been broken down in places, which the dog could get through—he had been in the habit of going in and out of Mr. Bridgman's premises as he liked, ever since we have been in the house—it had the same opportunity of being familiar with Mr. Bridgman's family before it was borrowed as after.</p>

               <p>speaking to him on this occasion about the sermon we had heard, and about his stopping down at Ramsgate—Mortlock Daniels preached that night—I have lived eighteen years in Staverton-place, and am a miller as well as a baker—I left my family in town while I went to Ramsgate, at least I left my home; but I left my wife where she has been for some time, she is out of her mind—I have one child—he is grown up.</p>

I reside in West-street, Camberwell—I hold, an ap<lb></lb>pointment in the Trinity-house, and have done so thirty-seven years—I have known Mr. Bridgman twelve or thirteen years, ever since he has been there—I was at Ramsgate previous to Sept., and remained there up to the 14th or 15th of Sept.—I met Mr. Bridgman there on Wednesday morning, the 6th of Sept., about a quarter or twenty minutes past nine, in Ramsgate harbour—I spoke to him, and was in company with him on and off for an hour and a half, witnessing the landing of some troops and horses from a transport—I saw him again, about a quarter past five that afternoon, coming from Camden<lb></lb>square, between there and High-street, on my way to Broad-street—I merely passed the compliments of the day to him then, as a lady was with him—I saw him again either on Thursday or Friday morning, but I cannot say which, at Ramsgate.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 9, Chancery-lane. I was at Rams<lb></lb>gate in the early part of Sept., and saw Mr. Bridgman, whom I knew, there on Thursday the 7th, as near as I can recollect, between twelve and one o'clock—a particular circumstance enables me to speak accurately to the day—not knowing how long he might continue at Ramsgate, I asked him to fix a time to dine with me—he named the next day, but as I was engaged on the next day to dine with some friends, I told him I was sorry I could not receive him then, but should be glad if he would dine with me that day, and after some little hesitation, he said, "Well, I did not promise to return to my friends, and therefore I will do so," and accordingly he dined with me on Thursday the 7th—but for that circumstance I certainly should not have recollected the day.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Cottage-terrace, West Ham. About 2 o'clock on Sunday morning, 19th Dec, I was awake in bed—I heard a noise, but did not know whether it was in my house or the shed—I went to the window and found there was some one in my shed—I awoke John Roberts, who lives in my house—I afterwards saw the prisoner under my window—I jumped out of my bedroom window and took him—I found a spade underneath the window, and a pickaxe, and a fork—the pickaxe belonged to Mr. Roberts, and the spade and fork belonged to me, and a powder canister which the policeman found on the prisoner is mine; I had kept it in the shed—I had seen these things on the Sunday before, all safe—I went to the station, and gave the prisoner into custody—I knew him before, and he knew my premises—these are the articles.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Is this your canister? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I can swear to it—the policeman took it out of your pocket—I did not see any of the other property in your possession, it was so dark I could not see it.</p>

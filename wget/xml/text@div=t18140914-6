I heard nothing that passed particular. Immediately I heard the report of a pistol, I heard a female scream. After the report of the pistol, I found it was Elizabeth; I caught her in my arms.</p>
               <p>Q. She had not fallen then - A. No, sir. She was then in the passage. The door of the house was then open.</p>
               <p>Q. When you caught her in your arms did you perceive any thing about her person - A. Yes, under her right arm I saw a black mark, as if by gunpowder.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say anything - A. She did, but I cannot say what; she spoke, but not for me to understand what she said. She was followed up the passage by the prisoner, into the house; he said let me kiss her; it was not granted; somebody prevented it; by this time, several people had come. I saw her clothes tore down, and I saw the wound on her right side.</p>
               <p>Q. At the place where the black spot was did you observe any rent in her clothes - A. I did. Afterwards I saw her clothes torn down, and I saw the wound. She was taken into the parlour, and laid upon a chair. There was not much blood. I assisted in taking her up stairs. That is all I know. This was on the 4th of July, a Monday. She died on the Sunday following. The prisoner was secured in my presence; he made no resistance; he said something; what it was I am not able to say.</p>

I heard the report of some fire arms; I instantly ran to where I thought I heard the report spring from; on my coming up to Mr. Cartwright's door; the door was half open; I saw a man stand in the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner at the bar, is that the man - A. That is the man; he had a pistol in his right hand. Mr. Cartwright was singing out watch; I made answer, here I am. He said, that is the man, seize him; I instantly laid hold of the prisoner. The prisoner said, do not seize me, I shall not run away. I said, no, I shall take good care you shall not run away. I said, I believe you have killed the woman. He said have I; I answered, I believe you have. He said, is she dead; I said, I believe she is. He then said, let me kiss her cold lips, poor girl, I loved her. That is all I know. I secured him, and took him to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Did you observe this glass and poison - A. No. I did not stay with him in the watchhouse; I went on my duty.</p>

               <p>Mr. Gurney. Did the prisoner bring any thing off his stomach after he arrived at the watchhouse - A. Yes, he vomited; it was washed away; he asked for cold water; I let him have it. He drank between three and four quarts of cold water, and vomited a great deal in the course of the night. I did not confine him as other prisoners are; I let him sit in my chair. I went to Mr. Cartwright's two or three times in the night, and enquired the state of the poor woman's health. I found one pistol in his pocket. This is the pistol that was fired off; it is bursted. It was loaded too full I understood. That pistol was delivered to me at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. to Martin. Did you take that pistol out of the prisoner's hand - A. No; Mr. Cartwright did.</p>

            . I am a surgeon. I was called in about eleven o'clock on the 4th of July, in the evening; I saw the young woman who had been carried up stairs. On examining her, I found the wound on the right side; it was a gun shot wound. She lived until three o'clock on the Sunday following, and then she died. I opened her body; I found there was a wound, and three hundred shots in her liver alone.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of shots - A. I understand they are called No. 2; very small ones.</p>

               <p>Mr. Deane. I have some of the shots that were found on the steps; here are three of them I produce.</p>
               <p>Mr. Heaviside. They were about that size, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181409140009"></xptr>three hundred were in the liver, and two hundred in her bowels. I have not the least doubt that was the cause of her death.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had a most serious regard for the young woman, as I had for my own child. I never thought, nor never had it in my mind to injure the poor girl. I respected her, and loved her, and would have done as much for her as I would for my own child. I declare, in the sight of a just God and your lordship, as to the manner I fired that piece off I know no more than your lordship. If I am found guilty, my sentence is just, I acknowledge in the sight of God. I hope it will be a warning to all. If I die, I die; sure am I, my soul will be happy with God.</p>

            What did you observe in his deportment that made you think he was a man not of a sound mind - A For some few days the carpet was always drawed up in a morning, and the room was wetted all over; and several times in the morning, and late at night, I have heard him singing; his singing was humming, not singing a song. My wife was very much frightened at him; at last he seemed very wild indeed. My wife wished me to speak to him to get him out of the house; I did not; he remained in the house until the time this unfortunate affair happened. At other times he was melancholy.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you thought he was deranged - A. Near six weeks before the 4th of July.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you sleep in the room under him - A. No, he slept in the front parlour, and I in the back parlour. I have heard him get out of bed as I supposed, as I supposed he tumbled out by the noise; he would be singing and making a noise; he was more so the night before the 4th of July than he was before.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you ever observed anything in his department which gave you reason to think he was deranged - A. Yes, often; I have seen him very melancholy; he talked rather incoherent; he was often writing, scribbling; his writing was not as other people usually write; it was scribbling. I was afraid of staying in the room with him. I always got out of the room when I could. I thought he was deranged.</p>

            . I am a baker; I live in Deane's-buildings, Lock's-fields, No. 9. I lived next door to the prisoner for seven years. I have not known much of him for this time twelve month; he left his lodgings, and went into the Kent-road. I have observed a great deal of derangement in him when he lived near me. I was called in one evening by his daughter; I went up stairs, and found him laying on his bed; he was biting the sheets on the pillow. This is about a year and a half ago. I asked him the reason; he said it was for Betty. He was considered by all the neighbours to be in a deranged state. I remember once he talked about throwing himself over London bridge; that was at three o'clock in the afternoon. He was formerly a clerk in the Excise; it is better than two months ago he has been out of that office; he was suspended or what they term put back.</p>
               <p>MRS. BENNETT. I live in Dean's-buildings, Walworth, within two doors where the prisoner did live. I believe the prisoner to be a very insane man indeed at times.

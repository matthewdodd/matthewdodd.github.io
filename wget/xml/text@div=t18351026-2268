                  </hi>. I live in Maddington-street, Lisson-grove. In the beginning of last week, I wrote a letter to Mr. Farrar, of Great Russell-street, Covent-garden—I enclosed two half-sovereigns in a bit of brown paper, and put them into the letter with a bill of sixteen shillings, for two dresses, which I had bought of Mr. Farrar, which the two half-sovereigns were to pay—I sealed it up, and put it into my pocket on Friday night, and on Saturday morning I wrote another letter, and enclosed the former one in that, so that the money was in two enclosures—U sealed it with my initials—the prisoner came to my house on Saturday, with a friend of hers—I had made dresses for her—I said I had a letter to send; and as I was confined for time, would she post it for me down the road—she said she would—I told her there was money in it—this is the letter.</p>

               <p>I went to the letter-box, and found a letter in it, with two seals—one of them had been opened, and it appeared as if something had been taken out—this is the letter; it had our post-mark on it before it went out—I have no idea that there was any money in it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a horsekeeper to the South Eastern Bail-way; I lire near the Kent-road. On the morning of 25th July, I saw the prisoner Delora coming out of Mr. Ballard's front gate, a few minutes before 1 o'clock—that was at No. 1, Terrace, Old Kent-road—there was no one with him—I did not see him with anything—he passed me, and I lost sight of him—I did not see him at any other time that morning—after he came out I saw Gover and another person on the other side of the street—the other person left Gover, and went into the house—that was about five minutes after I saw Delora come out—I saw Gover afterwards—he was going from the house down the Kent-road, and he returned—I was opposite him the width of the Old Kent-road—I have no doubt Gover is the man—Delon came close to me as I was passing the front gate—I have no doubt he is the man.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 31, King-street, Kent-road; I am a horse-keeper keeper in the South Western Rail way. On the morning of 25th July I was walking past the house, No. 1, Terrace, Old Kent-road—I looked round, and saw a person beckon to some one to come out of the house—I did not stop, but directly I saw two persons come out at the door at the side of the house, and the three walked together for a short distance, and then one who had a cloak on advanced a little way ahead, and they kept that distance till they got to the end of Kent-street—the prisoners are the two persons that came out of the house—Gover was the one with the cloak.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q</hi>. How near were you to them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Opposite—the road is about as wide as this Court is long—I had never seen them before—it was daylight, but it had been raining, which made it rather dark—they walked on one side, and I on the other—they walked on to Kent-street, and went on—I went down there—I am sure it was a loose cloak, with a fur collar—I noticed it because I thought there was something amiss—I did not see the door before they came out—the door is at the side of the house—I was opposite the passage which leads to the door—I saw Delora come out first, and the other afterwards—they came out smoking; that made me notice it—the passage is about the length of this Court—I might be double the length of this Court when I saw them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean that you saw the door? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I saw the doorway—I cannot say whether the door was shut or open—I saw the doorstep—I will swear I saw them come out, and step on that door step—they joined the other man at a short distance—those houses have a little green lawn in</p>

               <p>front—the houses have about six windows in front—I do not know anybody that lives in these houses—I should think they are not such houses as the prisoner might have—I cannot say whether persons might get up that passage, and lie about at night—there is room for it—I cannot say whether No. 2 is inhabited.</p>

               <p>9th October, I was in Oxford Road, Chiswick, near Beaufort House—I saw a light in the house—I went round to the back and found the water-closet window taken out, and a ladder placed against the window sill—I waited there twenty minutes or half an hour—a man came by and I asked him to ring the front-door bell—the prisoner Sullivan then put his head out of the window, and I told him to come out, I was waiting for him—he then put his head back—I sprung my rattle—another constable came up—I had a pistol, and said I would shoot them if they tried to get away—they then came to the front-door and gave themselves up—I searched them at the station—Cousins had this set of studs in his left-hand coat pocket—I found all this property (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in the front bed-room, where I saw the light—there were five coats, two pairs of trousers, and other things, lying about the room—the drawers were broken open and the things taken out—Cousins was in his shirt sleeves—his coat was in a building close by—I saw Sullivan three times at the back window.</p>

I am the owner of Beaufort House—I live there, but had been stopping away for a time—I had been to the house a few days previously, it was safe then—this poker was left in a room down stairs; it had no business in the bed-room—the house was shut up—all these things produced belong to me; the studs as well—they were put away in a drawer, which was broken open—I found the clothes I had left in the drawers, on the bed and all over the room.</p>

            . I am the wife of the prosecutor. On the 2d of January, we went together to his father's. Before we went out, I brought the pocket book down stairs and laid it on the table for him to take, and fearing he would forget it, I put it into his great coat pocket while he was in the next room; his great coat laid on the chair ready for him to put on; I did not tell him that I had put it there. I had put a 10 l. note and four sovereigns in it before I brought it down.</p>

            . On Saturday evening, the 4th of January, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to my shop, and looked out articles to the amount of 2 l. 4 s., and tendered me a 10 l. note - I wrote the address she gave me on it; she said her mother lived at No. 9, Cromer-street, which I put on it. I afterwards found that address to be wrong; she left the note with me, and would not take either goods or change that night, and suspecting she had got it improperly, I followed her home, to Mr. Bishop's, Turnmill-street; she opened the door with a key, and about half-past eleven o'clock that night, I went to Mr. Bishop's, and took her to the watch-house. Here is the note, (producing it;) I wrote Lewis, No, 9, Cromer-street, on it.</p>

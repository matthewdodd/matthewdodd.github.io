                  </hi>. I am a baker in Trafalgar-terrace, Greenwich—the prisoner was my second hand under the foreman—it was his duty to assist in the night with the bread, and after it was done to bring it into the shop, directly it was done—on Whit Monday, I was in my parlour about a quarter past 6 o'clock—there is a passage between the parlour and the shop—I can hear in that parlour what passes in the bakehouse—about a quarter past 6 o'clock, I heard the foreman call "Charles," which is the name he generally called the prisoner—I heard the foreman begin to draw the bread and I heard the prisoner come up stairs with it after it was done drawing—he came up several times, and I heard him go into the stable—I know it was him by its being his place to bring up the bread, and no one else was employed to do it—I afterwards went into the stable—I saw the cart there with the shafts up—the cart has a tilt to it, and by lifting the tilt you can put anything in it, while the cart is up, or they might put it in at the door—the door was fast, I lifted the tilt and discovered on the left side, ten half quartern loaves, and six on the right hand—they were just as they came out of the oven—that bread ought to have been in the shop—the pri<lb></lb>soner goes out to the customers with bread, between 9 and 10 o'clock—that bread is told out to him—about 7 o'clock, the cart was moved to the side of the house in the street—I was on the premises when the bread was delivered to the prisoner for the customers, and I saw the pony put in the cart—I went with a policeman to Hogg-lane—I saw the prisoner coming along the lane with the cart—I stopped him and asked him to tell me what bread he had in the cart—he said he had not got any but what was counted out to him—I opened the door of the cart to count the bread, but I found it was impossible, as there was so much—we took it into the station and counted it there—there had been twenty-six quartern loaves counted out to him, and there were thirty-four—he had no right at all to have those additional ones in his cart—the sixteen half quarterns were in the same place in which I had seen them in the morning—supposing a person to load the cart from the door at the back, he must have seen those loaves—I told the prisoner at the station that there were sixteen half quarterns more than there ought to be, and he said he knew nothing about it—I gave him in charge, and he was searched, and on his person was found a new 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. bun—he said it was mine; but that is of no importance, the value of the bread was 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to the last witness. On Whit Monday I came down at half-past 6 o'clock, and opened the parlour door—I was in the shop till about 7 o'clock—I saw the prisoner come with bread from the bakehouse into the shop while I was there—I was present about 10 o'clock that morning when the bread was delivered by my mistress to the prisoner to take out—she delivered twenty-six quarterns to him—he put it into the cart which was standing by the side window—no one helped him to take the bread from the shop to the cart, he did it all himself, and put it in the door behind the cart—if there had been sixteen loaves in it he must have seen them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is there any division in the cart? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I saw him load the cart at the back—it could be loaded at the top—there is a tilt goes over the top of the cart to keep the bread dry.</p>

                  </hi>. I was foreman to the prosecutor. On that morning I began to draw the bread at a quarter past 6 o'clock—I called the prisoner, and he took it away as usual to carry it into the shop—I looked into the cart before it was loaded, I saw the sixteen loaves, they were part of what I had made that morning.</p>

I then found the prisoner, Badger, by the warehouse door, with his hat laying on the ground, with the crown downward; I see in his hat this quantity of coffee, which is three pounds and a half; it has been in my possession ever since; I then took him into the counting house to search him further, and I found in his breeches this quantity consisting of eleven pounds and a half, not in his pockets, but put round him, I took it from him, and I have had it in my possession ever since.</p>

I was going down Thames-street and I saw the constable, and he said, I have got a charge, you are a judge of coffee, will you go down with me? and I went down and was an eye witness of the coffee being taken out of the crown of his hat, and the knees of his breeches. For satisfaction, I offered it to be weighed in my shop, and it weighed upwards of fourteen pounds.</p>
               <p>Q.to Tealing.

He was coming out of the warehouse when I see him, I suppose him to have been at work there.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any coffee on Mr. Hanson's premises? - A great deal; a great many casks.</p>
               <p>Q. Was these casks open? - It is their business to open them, and inclose them again, to cooper the casks.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it was easy for any one so employed to take the coffee if he was disposed? - It was nothing but coffee that these coopers came about then.</p>

            . I am inspector of letter-carriers to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182309100078"></xptr>the General Post-office. I know the prisoner, he acted as a General Post letter-carrier. Every letter on which the postage was paid, he should write on it paid, and the sum he received, and send it up in his paid bag, and he would be charged for it on the following morning; this is the regular course of business - He had been in the office, since March 1818. The receiving of letters is distributed into walks - his was Wardour-street walk (looking at a letter.) It would be his duty to send this letter up in his paid bag, if the postage was paid - it is directed</p>

            . I am a messenger of the Parochial office, and live in Poland-street. On the 8th of January I wrote a letter, and on the Saturday following the postman came to receive his weekly pay for letters. I delivered the letter to the prisoner - it was the one produced; I paid him 2 s. for the postage, and received some halfpence in change. I met him in Poland-street, some months after, and told him I had received no answer to my letter; he said, he could not be answerable for packets. I expected the letter to reach my son before he got to Calcutta, as he had just left the river. I am sure I paid him a shilling.</p>

            . I am assistant inspector of letter-carriers. On the 23d of May, in consequence of information I called on the prisoner, and was induced to search his drawer. I found this letter in it, together with others (looking at some) these are some of them. There were fifty-six in all, most of them were deliverable in the prisoner's district; six of them were letters on which he must have received the postage; fifty were letters in which the postage had been paid in the country, but were not delivered. Foreign letters are all post-paid in this country. There were six foreign letters, the postage of which he ought to have received and accounted to the office for; the one in question was among them. If he could not discover the persons to whom the fifty were directed, he ought to have returned them to the Returned Letter Office, after having kept them a month to make enquiry. Some of them are many months old.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is it part of his duty to receive foreign letters - A. Yes, he is bellman; the letter has no post mark on it.</p>

            . I gave him the letter towards the afternoon, before he came round with the bell; he came to receive the money for the week's letters. I knew him as bellman and letter-carrier, and as such gave it to him as a friend, thinking it would be more safe.</p>

            . The bellman commences his duty at five o'clock, he received this on his collecting money for postage; it is his option whether he gives credit or not. I cannot say he received it in the course of his office, they are restricted to the hours of from five to six o'clock to receive letters.</p>
               <p>The Court ruled that the letter was not received by the prisoner by virtue of his office.</p>

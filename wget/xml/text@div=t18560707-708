                  </hi>. I am a widow, and keep the Plough public house, Fore-street, Cripplegate. On Tuesday, 13th May, I lost a gold watch—I missed it about 6 o'clock—I had seen it last about 11 in the morn<lb></lb>ing, on my watch stand on my dressing table, in the bed room—I sent for Bull, the officer, and told him of my loss—I afterwards had an interview with Poulton, and in consequence of what passed between us, I went on 15th May, with Ballard, the billiard marker, and Poulton's father, to the defendant's premises—I saw him in his shop, and said to him, "Did you buy a gold watch yesterday"—he said he did, and he had sold it again; that he had purchased it for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and sold it for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it cost me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. guineas for workmanship only—I should say it was worth a great deal more than 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said to him, "You being a Jew, ought to know better the value of gold than to sell a watch at 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., when the case would weigh down five sovereigns"—I asked him where he sold it—he gave three dif<lb></lb>fent statements; first he said he had sold it the day he received it, then that he had sold it the next evening, and thirdly, that he had sold it on that morning—he then said he should not say anything more on the sub<lb></lb>ject, as he had communicated to Poulton's father the whole of the affair—I told him I should not leave his shop without my watch or him—he said, "I defy you to take me"—I sent Ballard for Bull, who came, and I gave the prisoner in charge for receiving my watch, knowing it to be stolen—he was examined two or three times, and then let out on bail—he came to my house on Sunday the 25th, with an old gentleman, who he said was his father—Mr. and Mrs. Bates followed us into the kitchen—the prisoner said, "Mrs. Stanton, I have brought you your watch, and I hope you will do as you said you would, give me 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>." or, "three guineas," I would not swear which, but I rather think it was "3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—he produced the watch at the time—I replied, "I shall not give you three farthings, I shall com<lb></lb>pel you to give it up without"—he made a show of offering me the watch, I declined taking it; he then offered it me without money, and I also declined—I told him if anybody else had brought it besides him, I should have given them into custody, but I considered him in custody, therefore there was no necessity to give him into custody—this was the day before his final examination—I attended at Guildhall on the Monday—I then got my watch back—the prisoner gave it to Mr. Solomons, his solicitor—Mr. Solomons gave it to Bull, and Bull gave it to the Magistrate, and I received it back from Bull—I was present here last Session, when Poulton was tried for stealing the watch—the prisoner was then examined as a witness.</p>

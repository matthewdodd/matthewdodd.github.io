                  </hi>. I keep the Rose and Crown beer-house, in William-place, Walworth-road. On 2nd Feb. I had nine bagatelle-balls, and I lost them between a quarter-past nine and ten o'clock, as near as possible—I saw the prisoner that night at my house—he came up-stairs into the room, and requested to play bagatelle—I did not know him before—I am quite sure he is the person—he came with a person named White, who has been convicted—I knew White before—they played up-stairs, in the club-room—there was no other person there—I saw them leave both together, and I had my suspi<lb></lb>cions—I sent my wife up-stairs the next moment—she called out, and I went out after the men—I ran them down a street, and they escaped into the gardens—they ran, and got away—White was afterwards taken—I am quite sure the prisoner was one of the two.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> You say two persons came into your house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; there were more persons down-stairs, but only two in the room up-stairs, you and your companion—I gave information to the police, and gave a description of the two parties—I went to Horsemonger-lane to prosecute White—I know Rawlings—my testimony and my wife's did not convict him and White—that was for another offence—Rawlings was not at my house on 2nd Feb.—I do not know your wife—she might have called at my house—since you have been taken on this case, no one has called to ask me to give them infor<lb></lb>mation respecting White and Rawlings—your father called on me one night—I did not swear that White and Rawlings were in my house—you were dressed in a check coat.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Robert Graham. On 2nd Feb., about a quarter or half-past nine o'clock at night, two persons came into our house—I am quite sure the prisoner is one of them—they asked if any one was up-stairs—there was no one but my husband—they went up, and asked my husband for a pint of beer and two pipes—my husband left them in the room, playing at the bagatelle board, which he gave them—I suppose they had asked for it—I had seen it before, and it was quite safe—I afterwards saw the two men come down-stairs—my husband was not in the room some part of the time—when the men left he was in the bar—when they came down the other man paid for what they had had—the prisoner waited for him, and they went out together—after they had left, my husband told me to run up-stairs—I went up, and the balls were gone—I am quite sure the prisoner is the man.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Were you a witness against White? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; Rawlings was tried with him—Rawlings was sentenced to four months, and White to twelve months—I and my husband were not the only witnesses—we did not swear that those two men were the only men in our room that night—we did not swear to Rawlings—White was the person that came in with you—Raw<lb></lb>lings was not convicted on our case, but on Mr. Gardener's case—White and Rawlings were convicted for Mr. Gardener's case.</p>

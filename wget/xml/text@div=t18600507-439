                  </hi>. I am a jeweller, carrying on business at 34, Boulevard de Temple, in Paris—I arrived in London on Sunday, March 11th, and went to stay at the White Hart Hotel, Bishopsgate-street, while I was in London—I brought with me, in the course of my trading business, a large quantity of jewellery—on the following Saturday I went out between 5 and 6 in the evening—previous to going out, I left some of the jewellery in my portmanteau, which I locked, and left safe in my bed-room—I returned at a little before 12 o'clock that night—I went to my bed-room, and found my portmanteau there, broken open—the contents were gone—some clothing, that I had left hanging in the room, was gone—the jewellery which I had left in the portmanteau was in a little bag—on my return I found that bag on the mantle-shelf open and empty—all that was left in it was a return ticket to Paris—I called the girl that does the rooms, and gave information—the assistance of an officer was procured—here is a cameo brooch, a pair of diamond earrings, and a gold watch, (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) they are all my property—here are also four diamonds which I believe to have come from a brooch that was my property—this property was left safe on the night of 17th March in the way I nave described.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tobacconist at Marlborough-street—I bought these ear rings (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on the 27th March from the prisoner, and gave 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them.</p>

Q.</hi> Are you a Frenchman? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I knew the prisoner as a licensed man—he goes to coffee-houses to sell things—it was not in a French coffee-house that I bought them; it was in my own house—I met him in the street—I had seen him before, and known him as a dealer and a hawker, and he asked me to buy something of him—he gave me a receipt—parties do go to French cafes to sell their goods, and they also ga there to buy—a Frenchman coming over with a lot of jewellery would go to a French cafe—I don't know whether he might meet a purchaser who wanted to sell the articles again to get a bargain—one Frenchman will sell to another.</p>

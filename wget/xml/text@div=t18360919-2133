                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the 3rd of September I met the prisoner about nine o'clock in the evening, in Duke-street, nearly a quarter of a mile from the house where this copper came from—he was carrying it on his head—I asked where he was going with it—he said to North-street—I then asked him where he brought it from—he said, from North-street, and then said he had been to Oxford-street to a man whom he was to deliver it to—I took him to the station-house and then he told me a man had desired him to go to No.1, North-street, and go through the passage, and he would find the copper, and to take it to Oxford-street, where he would find a man to take it—he said his father and mother lived in North-street—I found they lived at the place where the appear came from.</p>

This copper in mine—it was fixed in the wash-house at No.1, North-street, where the prisoner's father and mother' lived, but he did not lodge there—he lodged, I believe, in Stephen-street, Lisson-grove—the copper was seen secure about eleven o'clock on Satur<lb></lb>day morning—he stole it that night.</p>

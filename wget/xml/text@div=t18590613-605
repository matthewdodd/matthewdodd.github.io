I am a pointsman on the West London Railway—I saw the points all safe at the Shepherd's Bush coal-yard on the 6th of May, at half-past 4 o'clock—they are the points which enable carriages to go aside from off the line—about 5 o'clock I came back, and I saw the prisoner with the point-iron in his hand, shoving it hard over; and there was another lad sitting on the side of the road—I went towards the pri<lb></lb>soner, and when I got within a few yards of him he saw me, and he and the other lad ran away—I found the bolt had been pulled out, and the points were partly open—they were half brought over, so that a train would run on the side—the effect would have been, that if a train had come, it must have gone aside the line to some cottages where there were some workmen.</p>

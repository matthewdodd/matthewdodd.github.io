I live at 3, Lant-court, High-street, Borough—on Sa<lb></lb>turday evening, 21st October, between seven and eight o'clock I was going up Lant-street, when French, who has been convicted, came up to me and said; "Well, old boy, how are you?"—I said, "I have no knowledge of you "—I had 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my pocket which I took out and held in my right hand—he tried to get them out—I halloed out, "Thieves!" as loud as I could—I cannot say how many other men there were; there were three or four—two shillings dropped but they were afterwards found—I was quite sober.</p>

On 21st October I was in Lant-street, and saw the prosecutor there, followed by the prisoner French, Hill, and another man who I don't know—I saw them attack him and he called, "Police!"—I was in plain clothes—I ran up and caught Hill's arm round the prosecutor's throat; he has been convicted—I saw the prisoner among them in a stooping position, as if he had hold of the prosecutor's legs, with his hand near his chest—I saw his face distinctly as he passed the doctor's shop at the corner of Lant-street—I have known him five years—Hill dropped some money—the prisoner ran away—I met him again on 6th December, I was about fifty yards from him—he stopped and looked me steadfastly in the face and then ran away—I found him but could not catch him—I saw him again in Mint-street on 6th January, and he again ran away; I afterwards met him again, and said, "Antill, I have had a good many runs after you, but I shall not have any more, I want you for a garotte robbery in Lant-street"—he said, "Not me, Mr. Brisklayer"—I said, "I am sorry to say it is you; I had such a good view of you on the way down"—he said, "I cannot help it."</p>

I am employed by the South-Eastern Railway—on 21st October, about quarter to eight, I saw Brisklayer in Black<lb></lb>man-street—I saw six men following the prosecutor—I am not sure whether the prisoner is one—Hill and French were apprehended on the spot, and I believe the prisoner to be one of the other two—we saw the four attack the old gentleman—I saw the one I believe to be the prisoner, in a crouching position, but I did not see his face, I saw his dress—I knew him before and know that he used to wear a dress of that description.</p>

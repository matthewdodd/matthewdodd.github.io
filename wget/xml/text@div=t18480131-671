               <p>Newcastle-court, on my way from Lincoln's-inn-fields to the George hotel, Strand, where I was staying—the prisoners Ringall and May were standing at the door of a house—they pulled me back into the house, and I fell upon my back—while I was on the ground, I felt their hands at my waistcoat<lb></lb>pocket—I got up to make my retreat out of the window—they attempted to detain me—Orrell came up—I do not know at what part of the transaction—I do not think she ever touched me—I called "Police!" and she called to the others to let me go—she did not assist me—as I was getting out of the window, Ringall laid hold of the hair of my head, and held me for some time, while I was calling "Police!"—I at last got out—they them came out of the door, ran me out of the court, and followed me some distance—I found, on feeling in my waistcoat-pocket, which was torn, that I had lost a half-crown—I am sure I had had it a few minutes before I went into the house—I had some gold in the same pocket—I met some policemen, went back with them to the house, and gave the three prisoners into custody—they took of my hat in the struggle, while I was half-way out of the window, and I got back for it, and got it.</p>

About three o'clock in the morning of 2nd Feb., the prosecutor spoke to me, and I went with him to a Newcastle-court—he pointed out the three prisoners in the parlour there, and said that they had drawn him into the house, and robbed him of half-a-crown—Orrell said, "I have the half-crown, he gave it to me to get some gin with"—she gave it me at the station.</p>

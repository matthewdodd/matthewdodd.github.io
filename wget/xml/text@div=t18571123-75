                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Offin, of Halton Hall, East Ham. He rents from 300 to 400 acres in the Marsh—he had fifty eight cattle there on 8th Nov.—I counted them that afternoon, and they were all right—I went to the cattle market on the following morning; and saw the prisoners there—Bradshaw was sitting on a rail—George Matthews came up to him, and he said, "George, I have got to give you some money," tapping him on the shoulder—he said, "You have not got to give it to me; you have got to pay Tom Haydon"—he said, "No, I have to pay you," and he gave him 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold, and two half sovereigns—I did not look at the cattle that night, but my brother did—I missed one of them on Tuesday morning—I saw Bradshaw that evening, and said, "<hi rend="italic">Joe</hi>, it is a strange thing; I lost a bullock on Sunday night or Monday morning, and cannot hear of it"—he said, "Well, I will bet my life it is not off the land; meet me to-morrow morning at 7 o'clock, or before, and bring your jumping pole with you; I will bet my life we shall find her before night"—I went home and went to bed for two hours, and went with him the next day to do so—in consequence of something Mr. Matthews said, I afterwards went to Mr. Wright's slaughter house—I found the skin at another Mr. Matthews's, in Long Lane, Bermondsey, along with some more skins in the yard—it is here—I have no doubt about it—I valued the bullock at 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I find it cost more.</p>

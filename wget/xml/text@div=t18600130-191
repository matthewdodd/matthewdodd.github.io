                  </hi>. I am a watchmaker at 62, Cornhill—I was in my such in the evening of 19th January, about 6 o'clock—the prisoner came in and asked to look at a gold hunting-watch with a white dial to it, which was in the window—my son brought a tray of gold hunters out of the window which contained fifteen gold hunting-watches—I placed them before the prisoner—he directly picked up one with a gold dial to it, saying as preferred a gold dial to a white one—he looked at a number of the saying he and said that his brother had purchased one of me before at 28 guiness—after some time he selected oue for himself at 30 guineas, which was placed on one side for him—he then asked to look at some gold chains—my assistant got several out of the window, which I showed to him, and he selected one at 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I then sat down to make out the account, and by the time I had finished it the prisoner said he should like to have his initials engraved on the seal which was on the chain—he said his initials were R.S. and that his name was Robert Somers—I told him that the engraving of the seal would take until 1 o'clock the next day, at which time he said he would come for the watch and chain—he asked me if I should require a deposit—I told him it was usual in such cases, and he put his hand in his pocket and threw down a sovereign—while I was making out the account, I saw him take up this chain (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from the counter—it was one of those which he had been looking at—it is a very pliable chain—lie put it✗ the palm of his left hand, and immediately after that I saw him take up this large chain, and put that into his left hand—he held the two in that way, dangling one end of the large chain over his finger—it attracted my attention—I saw the seal of the small chain distinctly in his hand at the time he was dangling the larger one, so that I knew he had two chains in his hand—I watched his hand very closely, and I saw him afterwards drop the large chain on the counter—I am perfectly confident he only dropped the large one—he soon after that left the shop—I followed him and</p>

               <p>beckoned to my assistant to follow me, and the moment we got outside, the door I said something to my assistant, and he brought the prisoner hack—I then told him that I thought I should like to show him one or two other chains before he want and I desired young man to get a tapered wire chain out of the window to show him—that was the chain which I knew the prisoner had got in his pocket—my young man looked through the window, and told me the chain wap not there—that was said in the hearing of, the prisoner—just at that moment I saw under the prisoner's left hand something shining through the fingers—I had seen the prisoner immediately after he came back into the shop pass his left hand behind him, then bearing of the prisoner—Just at that momet I saw under the prisoner's left hand something shining through the finger—I had seen the prisoner immediately after he came and place it on the counter—I the moment I saw something shining through his fingers I went round to the side of the sounter and lifted up his hand, and there was this gold watch—I "Halloo, what watch is this?" taking it up—I looke at to satisfy myself that it was one of my yatohes, and finding that it was, I said, "This is my watch, you have stolen it; you have just now taken it out of your pocket, and you have a chain of in your pocket"—the prisoner made no reply concerning the watch, but he began to talk in rather an incoherent manner, and said, "You charge me with having one of your chains in my pocket, Mr. French; you had better see if it is not upon your counter amongst your other chains"—I said, "No; if it is not there"—but I looked again, and there I found the chain—I had looked in the tray where the chains were when the prisoner came back, and after I had told my young man to get the chain out of the window—the prisoner at that time passed his hand amongst one or two chains on the counter, just touched two or three of them, and said "No; I don't thick I shall change; I shall keep the one I have selected"—before he said that, while my young man was looking for this chain in the window, I passed my hand through all the chains on the counter to see if this one was there and it was not there—the chain is worth eight guineas, and the watch 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—my house is in the parish of St. Peter, Coruhill.</p>

               <p>that he had taken the chain, and I am quite certain of it still—I have an doubt that he placed it afterwards on the counter when he was looking over the chains—I don't know how the watch went; I did not see it go—he was in the shop the second time probably three or four minutes before I saw the watch near him—when I said, "This is my watch "the prisonor made no observation—I sent for a policeman immediately, and, as he did not produce the chain, I gave him into custody—I rather think it was before I gave him into custody that I found the chain, or else it was immediately after<lb></lb>wards; but I gave him into custody for stealing the watch—both the watch and the chain were prominent in my mind—after I had seen the watch and under his hand I knew that he must have stolen it, because I knew it was not there when he came back—I had handed all the watches from the counter to my young man—my assistant and I were not half-a-minute out of the shop when we went after the prisoner, and my son was left in the shop during that time—there were two other persons also at the back part of the shop, one a watchmaker, and the other an assistant, both in my employment.</p>

I am assistant to Mr. French—I saw the prisoner these on the evening of the 19th January—I did not see him take anything—I only got the chains out—I did not assist with the watches—I cleared the watches from the counter before I got the chains out—I am quite sare I removed every watch—when the prisoner returned to the shop with Mr. French, Mr. French asked me to look for a particular chain—this is the chain that he asked me to look for—he described it—I knew it well, for ve have had it in stock for years—I looked in the window and it was not these—during this time the chains that had been shown to the prisoner were lying on the couster—I looked amongst those chains, and it was not there—I looked over every one separately, after the prisoner had come back to the shop—I afterwards saw Mr. French find the chain—I had before that seen the prisoner fingering those chains—it was before he did that that I examined them, and found that the chain was not there.</p>

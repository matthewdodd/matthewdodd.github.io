             on the 21st of November last (producing it.) I knew, upon seeing it, it had been paid many years ago: the proper date was scratched out with a knife: it was originally dated in 1754, but now it is the 4th of May 1765. It was canceled by making a cross upon it. We never file them, but settle our accounts once a month. Mr. Honeywood died in the year 1763, and this was drawn upon Honey-wood and Fuller. The house has since been altered to Fuller and Cope. We secured Parkinton, then we traced out Simonds: it appeared Parkinton was innocent, and he was discharged, and the prisoner Dixon was apprehended by Simonds that night: he did not deny it, but said he had it of Lesley.</p>

            . I live in Bambridge-street, St. Giles's. I am a shoemaker (he takes the draft in his hand). I had this of the prisoner. He told me he received this of one Sylvester, a marine officer, his brother-in-law, and desired me to get him change for it; he said it certainly was good. I carried it to Mr. Simonds's, and bargained for a suit of cloaths, and said, if he could not change that banker's draft, I could not deal with him. We bargained. I gave it him, and desired he would give me change for it. He said, go into a public house, and get a pint of beer, and you shall have your money in half an hour. He sent, and found the thing bad; then he took me before a Justice of the peace.</p>

About the 18th of October I missed some gold, I thought 9 or 10 l. He left me in August. On the 9th of Nov. my maid was in my bedchamber; she came down, and said, she thought she had heard some body at the chest. I went up, and found somebody had been there, and had strove to break my buroe; I went out of my house, my neighbours told me there had been somebody upon my house. I mistrusting the boy, went to his father's house and asked for him, but he not being at home his father came to me; then I charged the boy (who was with him) with robbing me of 10 l. the boy denied he had stole so much, but owned he had taken 7 guineas from me; and that the time my mind heard some body in the closet he owned he was there, and not having time to break open my buroe, he took a parcel of halfpence out of a bag that stood by, and he had been and hid them among some bricks in Lincoln's Inn Fields; where we went and found about 20 d. in halfpence; I have them now here.</p>

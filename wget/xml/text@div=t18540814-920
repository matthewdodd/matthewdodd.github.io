                  </hi>. I am a reporter for the public press. I was at the Thames Police-court when the charge was entered into against Mr. Massey—I took a note of the evidence given by the prisoner—I took a note of the proceedings; I can pledge myself to its accuracy—<hi rend="italic">read:</hi> "July 27, 1854. James Smith. I am a seaman, in the naval service of Her Majesty, and belong to the ship <hi rend="italic">The Duke of Wellington</hi>, in the Baltic—I entered the Royal Navy in Bristol, about eleven months ago—I brought home a prize brig from the Baltic; I and another seaman brought her home—we brought her to the East India Docks—I was to go on board the <hi rend="italic">Crocodile</hi>, off the Tower, to be victualled—I had no orders to go there—I arrived at the East India Docks at half past 3 o'clock in the afternoon—it was four weeks ago last Sunday—next day I and the other seaman, the same who came home with the prize from the Baltic, came on shore, and we were passing Mas<lb></lb>sey's house, in Upper East Smithfield, when a man called me to go into the shop—I saw the defendant, who said, 'Where the h—have you been to all this time?"—I said, 'In Her Majesty's navy'—he said, 'Do you want the sight of an American ship?'—I made no reply—he said, 'I will ship you into the <hi rend="italic">Victoria'</hi>—I made no objection, and I was sent to the American consul and shipped as James Ryan.—Mr. Swainson. How came you to alter your name?—Smith. Mr. Massey told me to alter my name; he also told me to go into the parlour and change my man-of-war clothes—he gave me other clothes—I went to the American consul, and signed the ship's articles of the <hi rend="italic">Victoria</hi>,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185408140048"></xptr>
               <p>and when I returned he gave me half-a-crown—we were to go away at 4 o'clock in the morning—I went on board with Kelly, Massey's servant, but I did not join the ship when she was going away the next morning—I went afterwards to Massey's shop, and Kelly said, 'You have done a fine b—y job; you have missed the ship'—I was afterwards shipped on board another American ship, the <hi rend="italic">Princess Corby</hi>, and Massey gave me an advance note, and he said I was to take half out in clothes and half in money—I went down to Gravesend in the <hi rend="italic">Princess Corby</hi>—before that I had a conversation with Kelly, and I asked him for my man-of-war clothes, and he said they were on board the ship—when I reached Gravesend I wanted to leave the ship, and the chief mate said, 'If you offer to leave the ship I'll kick your G—d—d head off'—at Cardiff I left the ship and was stopped by a police constable, and I said, 'I wish to give myself up as a deserter'—the quarter-master came and took me out of the ship.—Mr. Swainson. Are you quite sure you told Mr. Massey you belonged to Her Majesty's service?—Smith. I told Mr. Massey I belonged to Her Majesty's service and to the <hi rend="italic">Duke of Wellington</hi>, in the Baltic—he said I was not to tell any one, as he was fined 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a fortnight before for doing so.—Mr. Yardley. For doing what?—Smith. For shipping a man from Her Majesty's service, I suppose.—Mr. Yardley. How much wages per month were you to receive in the American ship?—Smith. Why, 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per month.—Cross-examined by Mr. Bal<lb></lb>lantine. I know that if I go back to Her Majesty's service I shall be tried by a court martial—I do not know what sentence will be passed—they may inflict a flogging; I cannot answer for that—I do not think it will be so in my case—I really do not expect to get a flogging—I was drunk, Sir, when I had the conversation with Kelly; I was drunk nearly all that week—I got sober when I got into the other ship—I am not a deserter until I am twenty-one days away from Her Majesty's service—I wanted to give myself up before the ship left the docks—I was born in Dublin, and bred in England—Mr. Ballantine, Then you are an Irishman?—Smith. I was brought up in London; I am not an Irishman, I am half-and-half—I have sailed in American ships—I took the name of Ryal when I entered the <hi rend="italic">Princess Corby</hi>—Massey persuaded me to call myself Ryan or Ryal, I do not know which it was—it was on a Monday, I think, when I went into Massey's shop first—I came into the East India Dock at half-past 3 o'clock—I left her at 11 o'clock at night of the 26th, I believe—I have shipped in the <hi rend="italic">Typhoon</hi>, an American ship before—I was in the <hi rend="italic">Great Western</hi> and other American going ships—Mr. Massey once shipped me in the <hi rend="italic">Typhoon.</hi>—By Mr. Yardley. I was drunk when I changed my clothes at Massey's—I was drunk at the time—I was not sober when he told me not to say anything of the <hi rend="italic">Duke of Wellington</hi>, as he was fined 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. before—I signed articles the second time—I had been to Masuey's between the first and the second time of signing articles—Kelly was in the shop too—it was Kelly who called me into the shop the first time—three other seamen went into Massey's shop with me one day—I was not sober then—I had 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. when I left my brig in the East India Docks—when I was on board the <hi rend="italic">Princess Corby</hi> in the dock, Mr. Massey came on board in a barge, and settled with the men—my name and number on the ship's books of the <hi rend="italic">Duke of Welling<lb></lb>ton</hi> is 125—"James Smith" was on my man-of-war clothes—I wore a serge shirt and blue trowsers—I left a pair of new blue trowsers at Massey's—I lost my hut on board the <hi rend="italic">Duke of Wellington</hi> one night, reefing topsails—a man named Spiers, a shipmate, was with me when I went into Massey's shop the first time—Massey said he would not ship him because he was a</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is your business? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A shipping agent—I have carried on that business seven years in the same place—in the course of my business I ship in the American service only—I am not allowed to ship for English ships—I have known the prisoner five or six years—he had been in the habit of coming to my shop—he had been shipped several times in American ships in my house—I did not see him on 26th June—it is above twelve months ago since I saw Him—I think the last time was in Oct., 1852, when he shipped in the <hi rend="italic">Typhoon</hi>—I did see him on board the <hi rend="italic">Spencer Kirby</hi>—I was then on board the <hi rend="italic">Spencer Kirby</hi>, I had just got over the rail—he spoke to me, and asked where his 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was—I knew his face—he saw me pay two other men, who presented their notes to me, and I gave them their money for them, and he said, "Where is my 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.?"—I said, "Where is your note?"—he said, "I have not got any"—I said, "Then there is nothing coming to you"—with the exception of that interview I had not seen the prisoner at all from the Oct. when I shipped him on board the <hi rend="italic">Typhoon</hi>—I have heard the evidence read by the short-hand writer—it is true, with some omissions—I have heard the evidence in which the prisoner attributes to me my having sent a person out to call him into the shop—that is false—I did not see him in my shop at all on that occasion—I did not induce him to take off his clothes—he did not tell me he belonged to a man-of-war—I did not per<lb></lb>suade him to leave the man-of-war—the whole of that statement is false.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Have you any notion where you were when he was either called in or went into your shop? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know what time he came to my shop—I had servants—about half-past 9 o'clock, on Monday morning, 26th June, I went up to Mr. Gumm's—he is a shipbroker, and lives opposite the Royal Exchange, in Cornhill—I myself do not attend to the sailors—if I were to ship a sailor on board an English bottom, without a license, I believe I should be liable to a penalty—I have been a shipping agent seven years—I know what would be the consequence of persuading a seaman to quit the Queen's service and go in another service, either foreign or English.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When was Kelly convicted of persuading a man to quit the Queen's service? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think on 9th Dec.—he was fined 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I paid it—there is not a parlour at the back of my shop, there is a small office—the parlour is up stairs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know, or have you reason to believe, that on the day when the prisoner was induced to come, or did come to your shop, his clothes were changed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have heard Kelly give evidence that they were changed in the office at the back of the shop—I was not present at any time when the prisoner asked for his clothes—whether he were drunk or sober I never saw him that day—I have three persons who attend my shop—I have no other witness but my three servants.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> This originated in the charge made by the Admiralty against you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not by the Admiralty, that I know of—Mr. Swainson made the charge—I confine myself entirely to American vessels; I always have done so—I was not present before the Magistrate on the occasion when Kelly was called up—Kelly has been in my service about a year—I have never kept any</p>

               <p>familiar company with the prisoner, certainly not—whatever I may have seen of him was in ship transactions—there was 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a month wages for the American vessel—half of that I took for clothes; the other part I paid in money—I paid it to the person that he said he owed the money to—I have brought my book to show—I never at any time, in the course of dealing with this man, heard that ho had come home as a prizeman—where I saw him was when I was going out of St. Katharine's Docks—he was then on board the <hi rend="italic">Princess Corby</hi>, as he called it—it is very common indeed for a sailor to get drunk when he comes on shore—I never saw one remain drunk for a week or a fortnight together—we fit them out in that state—if a ship were going away to-day I could not fit them out to-morrow—I believe the prisoner knew one of my men, Hayes, well—I do not think he knew the other—I became acquainted with the prisoner by his coming to my place for ships—all the time I have been in business I have known his face.</p>

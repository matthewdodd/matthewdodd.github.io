I went out at a quarter to nine o'clock, left the door locked, and took the key with me, and on returning about ten o'clock I found the box of the lock broken off, and the door open. I missed the articles stated in the indictment from my drawers, which were not locked; I do not know where the prisoner lived, not having seen her for some time. I went in search of her, and could not find her, but on the 28th, about half-past one o'clock at night the watchman came to me; she had given herself up to him; she had a black dress on, but it is torn all to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182406030009"></xptr>pieces - I know it to be mine by my own work on it. When I got to the watch-house I asked how she could do it; she said because she choose. Howard asked her to give up the things; she said she would sooner have an halter round her neck than give them up. We have not been on bad terms particularly. The street door is kept on the latch - there are three other lodgers.</p>

            . I am a watchman. About half-past one o'clock in the morning the prisoner came to me at No. 9, Charlotte-street, and desired me to take charge of her, saying that she had been guilty of felony, and if I would go with her she would shew me where her sister lived; she said,</p>
               <p>"Though she is my sister, I am sorry to call her so, for she is now in bed with my husband," and that she had committed a felony in her husband's apartment. I went with her - she threw some dirt against the window, and desired me to call out</p>
               <p>"Arnold," which I did, and the prosecutrix came out. I asked if she was robbed, and told her to come with me, and she claimed a black gown, which the prisoner wore. I did not go into the room, and saw nobody but the prosecutrix. She said she put the gown on in purpose for it to be owned, that she might be hung or transported, for she could not live in this country with the idea of her sister living with her husband. I understand that the prisoner has lived in that house with her husband, who is a blind man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I think I told him that my husband had kept my clothes from me, and my sister had worn them out. I was in the greatest distress, and anything was better than the life I was leading. I did not go there intending to thieve, but to stop there, whether I might or not.</p>

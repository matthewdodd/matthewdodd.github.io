               <p>Q. What is the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Ward. I have known him about two years. He came down the yard in a poor dishabille; he said he had been sick, but I found since he had been in Tothilfields Bridewell. I having a regard for him, I offered to take his clothes out of pawn till he could raise money to pay me again. He helped to put my horses to my carriage sometimes, but very seldom. I was a friend to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you charge him?</p>
               <p>Ward. I found all his clothes which he had on under the manger, and he was not to be found. I was told he was an acquaintance of Ogilvie's. I went to Tybern, expecting I should see him when Ogilvie was executed; there I met with him. He had none of my things on. I got a constable and charged him; he confessed he had pawned my coat to Mr. Jones, in Westminster. I went there and found it. (Produced and deposed to.) He said he had sold the rest of my things; he owned to every thing but the money.</p>

            . I am fourteen years of age. I live with a pawnbroker in Tothil-street. The prisoner at the bar pawned this coat with me the second of May, in the dusk of the evening. I asked him where he lived? He said, in Tothil-street. He pawned it in the name of Haddock.</p>

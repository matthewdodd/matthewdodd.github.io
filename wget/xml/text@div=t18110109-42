            , I live in High-street, Marybone. On the 2d of this month I was sent by Mr. Ballinger to fetch a bundle from Greenwich; I got my bundle of linen and brought it safe to London; it was about nine at night. When I got near Oxford-street I met the prisoner at the bar, I asked him the nearest way I could go into Marybone. I have lived five years in High-street, but was never much out of the place; the prisoner said he would direct me the nighest road, he went along with me; when we came to Marybone-street there was a cooks-shop, I proposed to have some soup, as I was tired, and to give him some for his civility, he went in with me; we staid there about a quarter of an hour, he took part of the soup. When I left the cooks-shop I went up <placeName id="t18110109-42-crimeloc255">Marybone-court</placeName>

               <p>Q. After that treatment from the man were you frightened - A. I was very much frightened indeed. I saw the prisoner again at the watchhouse in an hour or an hour and a half; I am very certain he is the man that robbed me of the property; I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what the contents of the bundle was - A. Yes, I do, a black silk gown, a muslin dress, a cotton gown, two pair of stockings, a cloak; the cloak, silk gown, and the cotton gown, were worth a pound, the muslin dress, ten shillings, a shift, a coral and necklace, I do not know the value of these things, a lace cloak I dare say worth ten shillings, a silk shawl and a silk handkerchief that was the whole contents; I had these to return to Mr. Ballinger.</p>
               <p>Q. Has the bundle ever been found since - A. I have never seen it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. What time of the night was it you were going through the street - A. It was near about nine o'clock, I met this man, it was dark.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever said that the person that robbed you wore a soldiers coat - A. No not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the man that robbed you a soldiers great coat on or not - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you did not make observations enough to speak to that fact - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you could not make great observation of the man - A. Yes, I knew him when I saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. This is a charge for a highway robbery, forty pounds would pay for the bundle - A. I do not know. I saw the bundle at the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. We heard you swear upon your oath, distinctly, that you never saw the things - A. I saw the bundle at the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Be attentive to your answers, you are upon your oath, how long might the man be with you - A. An hour.</p>
               <p>Q. And it might be an hour before you saw him in the watchhouse - A. I cannot say, it might be half an hour, from the place that he knocked me down and took the bundle out of my hand, before I followed him to the watchhouse, and saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. This man at the time he was taken he had no great coat on - A. Not as I know off, from the fright I was in, I hardly knew who he was in the watchhouse for the mob.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you would not have known him except he had been pointed out to you - A. No, he was not pointed out to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the man, at whose house you had the soup, here to day - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you say you know the contents of the bundle, had you seen the contents - A. I had a proper knowledge of the bundle when I lost it, I had seen the contents, and tied it up myself.</p>

               <p>Q. At the time that you first saw him running, had he any thing with him - A. Not as I perceived, he was the person I saw running; I pursued him and cried, stop thief; there was nobody running after him but myself; he got down the mews and returned back, and went up alongside of the dead wall.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a night was it - A. It was not a dark night, it was the second of this month, frosty weather. When he tureed back I ran up, I was within a yard or two, I asked what he had been doing to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181101090041"></xptr>person that cried murder. I saw him drop the bundle, he gave me no answer; I picked up the bundle, he run off; I pursued him and kept him in sight, crying out stop thief, watchman; he was stopped between the officer and me, I saw the officer stop him. I lost sight of him turning the corner of Paradise-street, I was not above seven or eight yards from him at the time that he dropped the bundle.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the man that stopped him - A. Flowerdeau.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you - A. I am a carpenter, No 4, Spring-street; when he was stopped, the constable took him to the watchhouse, I saw the constable search him, he told the constable that he lived in Green-harbour-court, in the Old Bailey, the constable asked him what he did up there, he said for a spray or for a lark.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You are a carpenter, you live in that neighbourhood, in the New-road.</p>

            Perhaps twenty yards.</p>
               <p>Q. You pursued this man, this man was the only man that was running, he ran up the Mews - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It seems rather strange to me, from the account that I heard before, did not you hear the man say that she saw him drop the bundle crossing the street - A. I do not know half what she saw, I speak the truth, the man is a stranger to me.</p>
               <p>Q. You know there is such a thing as a forty pound reward - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you upon your oath did you never hear it - A. I have heard that there is such a thing, I do not know what it is, for I have heard them say if a man is found guilty, there is a reward of forty pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you know the fact - A. I do not want any such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. All that is avoiding my question you will not be believed. Answer my question, when you came into this court, did you not expect, and believe, that you should share of the reward - A. I did not expect any such thing, only that I should receive for my loss of time.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the man dropped the bundle up by the dead wall - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that the man dropped the bundle by the wall, or whether it was not dropped in crossing the street - A. By the wall, that is where I picked it up.</p>
               <p>Q. When you found the bundle did you go back to where the cry was - A. No; I never saw the woman until the man was taken to the watchhouse, then she came crying out who has got the bundle.</p>
               <p>COURT. Could any person that was in any part of Marybone-court, see a bundle drop where it did drop - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. How was the man dressed that you pursued, that dropped the bundle, in a soldiers coat - A. I took no notice of his coat at all.</p>
               <p>Q. How can you pretend to say, not having taken any notice of his coat, that the prisoner at the bar is the man that dropped the bundle - A. I only missed him when he turned the corner.</p>
               <p>Q. And although you cannot swear what his coat was, you could swear to his face - A. I cannot swear to his coat.</p>
               <p>Q. But you can swear to his face - A. Yes.</p>

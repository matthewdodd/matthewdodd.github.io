I was fetched to the warehouse on the morning of the 15th of April, about seven o'clock, and found Thomas in custody there; I said,"Have you got some oakum?" he said he knew nothing about it, but the two Smiths had asked him to bring two bundles of oakum to our warehouse, and they had each brought two themselves; I know the oakum by one bundle having been cut open on the Saturday before, and on the Monday morning they were all taken away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Is not Scott a dealer in marine-stores? A. Yes; I only know the oakum by the parcel which is cut open, and it is picked off Russian hemp; I am convinced of it; there is a good deal picked in that way.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. QUIN. Q. Has Scott any partner? A. Not in this trade; the oakum was taken away, and then brought back.</p>

            . I am a warehouseman to Mr. Scott. On Saturday night I examined the premises; there was a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182705310107"></xptr>quantity of oakum there; I can swear to this bundle, as I cut it open and tied it again; I know my own tying. On Monday morning, the 15th, I went there, and found the warehouse-door had been wrenched, and was obliged to take the lock off to get in; the brass handles had been wrenched off; I went up to the loft where the oakum was kept, and found the windows, which had been nailed down, were forced up, and the oakum gone; I came down again, and the Smiths came and asked if I had lost any thing; I said, Yes; they went away, and each brought two bundles of oakum; Thomas then came with two, and said, "That makes the sixth;" I looked at it and knew it; I sent for Brown.</p>

I was sent for, and took Thomas - I took him to Mr. Scott's; he said all he knew was, that the Smiths told him to take the oakum there; that they had stolen it, and he was to sell it, and share the money; he said at the warehouse that he got it from Smiths' father's parlour; and that they rolled it out of the front door.</p>

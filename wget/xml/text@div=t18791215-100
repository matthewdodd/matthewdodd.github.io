I am farm bailiff to Mr. East—the prisoner is a hay-binder, and has worked for me—on Saturday, 30th August, when I went round at 6 o'clock in the evening there were 200 sheep in a field at I Brentfield Lane, Willesden—next morning, at 6.30, I missed a wether I sheep, marked with a red painted dot on the rump—we found the skin in I a ditch, with the entrails wrapped up in it—this is the skin (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the value of the sheep was 53<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.,</p>

                  </hi>. The prisoner is my father—I live at Willesden—I remember in August last my father taking me to the Spotted Dog it I Leavesden and giving me some beer, but I do not know the day or week or mouth—he afterwards sent me to bed—when he got home km fetched me out of bed and well thrashed me because I would not go with him—he asked me to go down Brenttield Lane 16 kill a sheep—we went down Brentfield Lane into Mr. East's field, and father told me to go round I the sheep and drive them up in a corner—I did so—then he told me to I kneel down and hold it while he cut its throat, and he knelt down too—before he killed it he drew it from one gap to another, a distance of 200 yards, through the gap and under a willow tree close against the feeder in an adjoining field—then I held it while he cut its throat—he skinned it and threw the skin and entrails into the ditch, and then cut the sheep in halves with an axe which he took with him, and put half in each bag, and we each carried half to father's allotment, and put some potatoes and greens on top of it—about two hours after he took it home and put it in salt and water—he told mother that he brought it from Newgate Market—this bag (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the one in which father carried half—there was blood from the sheep, which stained my shirt and jacket.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I do not know how old I am—I was taken in custody and charged with killing the sheep, and after I was charged I said it was my father—when before the Magistrate I spoke of the sheep being taken to the allotments and covered up, but I did not say anything about its being dragged 200 yards—I was not asked—I do not know who was in the house at the time it was taken home—Mr. George lodged there then; father and I mother ate it, and I had nothing to do with it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector</hi>). On 31st August, about 9 o'clock, I went to Brentfield with Constable Bedford, and saw where some sheep had been driven up in the corner of the field; I traced where something had been driven to slaughter, and found blood and marks of one knee of corduroy trousers in the mud—I traced blood marks through the gateway into the adjoining field under a willow-tree, and saw the akin produced rolled up in a ditch with the entrails in it—the nearest highway is about 100 yards from where the slaughter took place—on the ground under the willow there were small pieces of bone and blood, as if something had been cut up—I followed the traces across the field to a fence adjoining another field, and I saw blood on a fence in the direction of the prisoner's house—on 19th November I went with the last witness to Brent Lane.</p>

They would not have to pass the allotments to go to the prisoner's house from the field—from the field where I traced the marks he would go to the Midland and North-Western Junction Railway where the witness took me, and then he said "We took up the line to the allotments"—the line runs between the allotments—I failed to find any traces farther than the railway.</p>

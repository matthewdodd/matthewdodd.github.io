On Thursday evening, the 5th of Oct., I was employed in the Exeter and Devonport division—I went to him, and said I wanted him in Mr. Bockenham's room—he went there, I followed him—Mr. Wynne was there, and said to him, "Thurgood, it has been communi<lb></lb>cated to me, that you have been seen to put a letter into your pocket"—he said he had not done so—Mr. Wynne asked him if he had any objection to be searched, in order to clear away all suspicion—he said, "None whatever"—Mr. Wynne asked me if an officer was in attendance, I said, "Yes," I left the room to fetch one, met Peak at the door, and be and I returned together—Mr. Wynne then said, in the prisoner's presence and hearing, "Blott, he has thrown the letters into the corner"—he pointed to the corner at the time—I went to the comer, and picked up three letters, crumpled up, and handed them to Mr. Wynne—these are them—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I told the prisoner he might say what he pleased, but whatever he said might be used against him—he said nothing, and in the course of a minute fainted away—the letters were afterwards opened in my presence at Bow-street—they were in the same state as when I picked them up—two of them contained half a sovereign each, and one a shilling—when I picked them up, I did not feel or discover whether there was anything in them—I handed them immediately to Mr. Wynne—this letter is addressed to Miss A. Ford—it bears the Fulham post-mark, and the Inland post-mark of 5th Oct.—the secoud one, addressed to Mr. Cane, bears the post-mark of the Great Surrey-street receiving-office, and the Inland office paid stamp of the evening of the 5th Oct.—the third bears the St. Alban's post-mark of the 5th Oct., and the Inland office paid stamp of the same day—the letters might pass through the prisoner's hands in the course of his duly.</p>

My husband destroyed himself—previous to his doing so, he very often exhi<lb></lb>bited symptoms which led me to conclude he was not of sound mind, for two or three years previous at least—he exhibited such symptoms the whole of the time I was pregnant with tke prisoner—(he is twenty-two years old)—he was very violent indeed—he attempted to throw me violently out of window—I was then some months advanced in preguancy—he also carried me up stairs by one arm, without allowing ray feet to touch the staires—that very much affected my mind, and I was exceedingly ill the whole time—Dr. Clutterbuck attended me—previous to this he was, generally speak<lb></lb>ing, a kind husband—I had no reason to complain of him tiil he deve<lb></lb>loped these symptoms—at tke time he committed suicide he was very comfortably off—nothing of that kind was preying on hit mind—I have heard that father's brother also committed suicide, but I do not know that—I have heard so in the family—my own brother also committed suicide in 1809—the prisoner was married about three months ago—we thought he had married properly and respectably—it was with my knowledge—he has very often committed very strange acts—when he was about eight yean of age, on returning from school, he went away somewhere, and, after advertising him, we found he had been sitting in a boat by the Tower the whole night—he had no object in running away—I had not treated him harshly or unkindly—on another occasion, about the same time, we had locked him in a room, and on opening the door, about an hour afterwards, he said, "It is very lucky, for I should have been dead in few minutes"—he had cut a cord from the window,</p>

               <p>and was going to destroy himself—he was tying it in a knot, giving the appearance of being about to hang himself—when he was about ten or eleven years old he had saved some money—he took a coach, and went off down to the Isle of Wight, and roved about there—we found him there—he had no reason for leaving me at that time—he had not made any complaint before he left—his general conduct was very peculiar—he was very fond of me and very affectionate, yet at times he would do such acts as would almost kill me, and then would not believe that he had committed them—that occurred at times during the whole period of his life, from eight years old to the present time—he did not associate much with other boys, but was rather lonely at home—he went into the employ of the Post-office three years ago last September—he has not been pressed in money affairs—I was always able and willing to assist him, and he knew that—about two years ago I had some pictures in my parlour—he broke every one of them, and put them into the fire—one of them was a portrait of his brother—I valued them, because the parties were dead, and they were my mother's—he knew I valued them on that account—he himself valued his brother's picture very much—I told him of it afterwards—he was extremely sorry then, and said he would not have burnt it on any account—he was not able to give any rational cause for having done so—he would lay in bed, and if we did not hear him he would throw the water<lb></lb>jug full of water at the door to make us bear him—he is my only son—I have four children—he has very often broken articles, which he appeared at other times to prize, when he has had a paroxysm of that kind, and has forgotten it immediately after, and denied that he has done it—that has constantly occur<lb></lb>red from the period of eight years of age to the present time—about a fort<lb></lb>night before this occurrence, be came into the room, when his wife was present, shook his arms violently about, and said, "I feel I want to fight, I could fight anything, I feel so strong"—we said, "Don't fight us"—he said, "What shall I? I cannot resist"—I said, "Oh, hit the door, or anything"—he then hit the door with his knuckles, and burst the panel—he then sat down for a few minutes, and looked quite bewildered, then got up, tried to replace the panel, and said he did not think he was so strong, he did not think he should have done it—he lived at home with me at that time—he always kept pistols in his room—I think they were kept loaded—his wife was alarmed, and said she had unloaded them—he has let them off at the top of the house—some time ago, as he and his wife, a young lady named Howe, and myself, were at supper, he suddenly jumped up, and threw a glass of ale that was on the table into the young lady's face—he afterwards said he was sorry for it—she kept looking at him, and said, "I am expecting a second"—she thought, from his manner, he was likely to repeat it—within the last few months he has been unusually unwell, so much so that I proposed to him to go to the office and get him leave of absence, telling him he was very unfit for business—he said, "If you do, you will get me dismiaied"—he was attended by a medical friend, who has known him from his infancy—he was constantly taking medicine, and was particularly abstemious—I never saw him tipsy but once—he appeared to be suffering from his head—on the morning of the 5th, the day on which he is said to have stolen these letters, myself and daughter were out, and on our return, about one o'clock, he was in the passage—appeared very wild and excited, so that my daughter said she thought he was mad—I do not think I have detailed all the circumstances that have occurred, but my mind has been all anxiety and trouble, and my memory is not good—on one occasion he began talking very violently to me, and he took up the poker; I turned my back, to leave the room, and he struck me on the back with the poker—this did not arise from general unkindness towards me—he</p>

I am married, and live with my mother—I am the prison<lb></lb>er's sister, and am some years older than him—I was in the house at the time of his birth, and observed the treatment my mother received from her husband at that time—my father was subject to fits of insanity for some years before he died, and when in those fits he used to ill-treat my mother and all his family—I have had a great many opportunities of observing the prisoner's conduct and disposition from his boyhood—at times he was extremely vio<lb></lb>lent, and at times you could not understand what it was for—without any apparent cause he would do the most inconsistent things—there were con<lb></lb>stantly complaints of him from his school-masters, and that kind of thing, of a different kind from those ordinarily made of boys—about twelve months back he cut the eye out of his own likeness, and said, "That is my eye"—I said, "What have you been doing? you have destroyed your picture"—he laughed, and said he liked it much better so—I said, "You must be devoid of sense"—he said, as it was so good a likeness we must fancy the rest—I was very angry, and told bim it was the act of a simpleton—on another occa<lb></lb>sion I was playing at cards with my sister and two ladies, when the prisoner came in, took the cards up off the table, and threw them into the fire, also the cribbage-box, and after that he upset the table—nothing had been said to pro<lb></lb>voke him—he also broke all the tea-things that were set ready for him to take tea—he has been very much worse lately—he has continually complained of his head, and want of rest—he requested every one of the family that were present to rub his head, and comfort him—his marriage was his own act—it was got up so vciy quick from first to last, that we hardly understood it at</p>

               <p>all—my mother was extremely kind to him, and I believe I was so myself—on the morning of his marriage he was in the most dreadful state of excite<lb></lb>ment—he said he would not be married, we need not dress; we need not at<lb></lb>tempt to think he should, he had altered his mind—he knocked the clock off the shelf, and broke it, then collected the pieces, put them on the bed, and knocked them into smaller pieces.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Eldridge, a carman. I was in the service of the prisoner's mother, from Jan. 1841, till the following Dec.—during that period I had opportunities of seeing the prisoner's con<lb></lb>duct—about a month or six weeks after I entered the service, he came house, and insisted on having some money—he was very violent to have it—his mother refused to let him have the money at first—he would insist on hav<lb></lb>ing it—he used very bad language, and knocked her down with his fists—his conduct was like a madman—when she was on the floor he threatened he would murder her if she did not give it him—she got up and put gold and silver out of her purse on the table—there was about 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold—the prisoner took it up, threw it right into the fire, and held her on the sofs till he thought it was very nearly burnt—he dared his mother to touch it, and was like a madman—he then left the room, and went into his bed-room—I and his mother succeeded in getting all the money, but two or three sovereigns out of the fire—some was very black—on another occasion, about a fortnight or three weeks after, I remember his coming home from the Post-office—his mother asked him what made him so late—he said that was his business—he up with his fiste, smashed all the things on the tray, and threw the tea-pot under the ashes—he threatened to knock his mother down, and she walked into her bed-room—in the same week, after he returned from the office at ten or eleven o'clock at night, I was in the kitchen—I saw him go up stairs, and heard a terrible smash—he rang the bell—I went up stairs, and saw the looking-glass all broken to pieces—on another occasion he re<lb></lb>turned from the Post-office with a terrible knock ready to split the door—I let him in—he sat himself down in a chair just within the parlour, and said, "Mary, I am going mad, but I will see them all at hell before I go into any mad-house"—he then put on his hat nnd went out immediately—I remember</p>

               <p>once his going out to walk with his mother—she was in the habit of wearing a cloak—he snatched it out of her hand, twisted her wrist round, nearly put out her thumb, and twisted ft from her—he tore it off, and threw it on the sofa—he only tore the pin-hole—he then broke the handle of the parlour<lb></lb>door right in two, and threw it on the floor—he used dreadful language to<lb></lb>wards his mother, then left the room, and went into his bed-room—I remem<lb></lb>ber when a gentleman was coming to dine with him, I think it was about May—among other things, there was a ham for dinner—the gentleman did not come—my mistress was getting the ham ready—the prisoner came down stairs into the kitchen, snatched the ham from her, and flung it at her—she escaped out of the kitchen—I told him about the looking-glass, and said what a thing it was for him to break to many things—he said I must have been dreaming, it was not him, it must have been me—from what I saw of him, and from the transactions I have detailed, in my judgment he did not appear in his proper senses—I knew Mrs. Green, a lodger—I do not know where she is now—I remember her giving warning to leave in consequence of his conduct, and she desired his mother to put him under restraint.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon and apothecary, and lire at No. 10, Howland-street, Fitzroy-square—I know the prisoner's family—I knew his father, but very slightly—I have been in his company, and seen him—I re<lb></lb>member his death—I did not see him after his death—I have attended the prisoner professionally for some years—he was always a very eccentric, ex<lb></lb>traordinary behaved young man—I think there were periods, when from the state of his mind he could not distinguish between right and wrong—I have been in Court, and heard the evidence which has been given of his general conduct—from what I have heard and known I should have thought him capable of committing any violent act—I have not witnessed acts of his similar to that with which he is charged—I have been consulted by his mother—she once consulted me as to the state of his mind, not as to putting him under restraint—I should think that is nearly twelve months ago—I have drank tea at his mother's house several times—I remember, on one occa<lb></lb>sion, when the prisoner kept playing on a barrel organ which was in the room, very much to the annoyance of the persons in the room—his actions were not particular at the time, except that of grinding this organ—he Was stand<lb></lb>ing—I do not think he was moving, more than moving the organ—I remon<lb></lb>strated with him—the effect of the playing was, I thought, to disturb all the persons present—he continued playing for a considerable time—he has com<lb></lb>mitted most extravagant acts, which I could not conceive to result from any other cause than derangement of mind—I am not aware of any other motive to which it could be attributed.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But may not that state have been produced by the violent indulgence of intemperate passion, and not the result of alienation of mind, that rendered him incapable of proper conduct? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> When I have seen him I have been called to him in consequence of his being in ill-health, and at that time his mind was in a most unsettled, disturbed state, and unconscious of what was passing during the time I was with him—he had a fever—the last time I saw him delirious in a fever was probably about twelve months ago—he was then in bed for a week or ten days—I never saw him in a similar state after that—when he was not in this state of delirium I should say he was generally capable of knowing right from wrong, and conducting ordinary affairs—I was present at his marriage—I knew it was intended before it took place—I knew nothing of the young lady, and gave no caution to her or her family—I thought it unnecessary to interfere.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, living in the Edgeware-road. I have known the prisoner about two years—I have seen him sometimes very much excited—about six months since I went to the house, and saw his mother fainting—she said, "My son will be the death of me; he is up in his bed-room"—the first thing I saw was a chair broken to pieces, which she said her son had done in bis excitement—I afterwards went up stairs—his door was locked—I went in to him—he was excited then—I calmed him a bit, and came down again—I saw that the painted window on the landing was broken—his mother said he had thrown his slipper through it in going up stairs—he was then walking backwards and forwards in the room—I have seen him quite mad with excitement, throwing his arms about, not like a rational being at times—I have never been able to learn from him any cause or motive for being in such a state—it was evident that his mind was affected, because he had not been drinking at the time—I did not know his father, or uncle, or family—about seven or eight weeks since, in the middle of the day, he came into my surgery, which he generally does as he passes to and from the Post-office, drew a pistol from his pocket, and placed it within nine inches or a foot of my breast—he was throwing his arms about rather excitedly—I told him to be still, and put it away; that he ought not to carry such things—he did me no injury with it—I did not examine it to see whether it was loaded—I have seen him from time to time in states when I believe he was out of the pale of self-control—I really cannot say whether that arose from an obstinate, perverse, or wicked disposition, or from his mind being disor<lb></lb>dered—he</p>

            . I am a patrol of the City. I saw Mr. Coles in Bishopsgate-street; I saw the prisoner at the same time: the prosecutor turned down Wormwood-street, and went into a boot-maker's shop. The prisoner went to the window, and waited till Mr. Coles came out; he then followed him into Camomile-street, and just by the corner of Camomile-mews I saw him take Mr. Coles' handkerchief out, and put it into his breeches; he turned round, and saw me following him; he immediately pulled the handkerchief out, and threw it into the kennel; I did not know him before, but I had been watching him for a quarter of an hour; he ran as far as Houndsditch before he was stopped; I am certain of him.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

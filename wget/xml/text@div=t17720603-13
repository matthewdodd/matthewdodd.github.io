He said, my dear, I have not seen you a long time; I thought I knew him at first, afterwards I found I did not; then he said again it is a long time since I saw you; I said, sir, I do not come home but once a week, I live at my master's.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is your home?</p>
               <p>Ingram. My parents live in Robinhood lane. He asked me to come over the hedge into the field, I did not go over; he said he would give me six-pence; I said I did not want any of his money, I wanted to go home to my grand-mother; then he said he would give me a shilling; I said I did not want his shilling, I must go home to my grandmother; he got over the hedge and stooped down, he saw me run away, and ran after me.</p>
               <p>Q. You was in the lane?</p>
               <p>Ingram. Yes; when he overtook me there was a boy came, and said run along my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177206030017"></xptr> girl, do not talk to that man; I ran away as hard as I could; when the boy was gone out of sight, he came up to me again, and said, I have a knife, I have a knife; then there were three more gentlemen came along, and they asked what the man was going to do to me, but I was so bad I could not speak to them, they talked to the man; when the gentlemen were gone he run to me, and took away a little plate, a little apron that I worked in, and a bit of a white handkerchief that had 4 s. 6 d. wrapped up in it.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the dish?</p>
               <p>Ingram. A penny earthen dish; I then run over the field, and saw one

I asked which way the man was gone? she said along Bow lane; I went after him immediately; as I was going along, I met a gentleman that had the apron and dish, he had called to the girl, but she was afraid to go back; the gentleman said a man gave them to him, and said if they were owned, to give them to the owner; if not, he might keep them; he gave me a description of the man, and I went after him; just before I got into Bromley, I saw a man at work, and called for assistance, and we ran after him; when I came into Bromley, a man had stopped him, but let him go; I went after him, and secured him; I called the girl, and she said that was the man. When I stopped him, I asked him if he had any money; he said he had not; he put a shilling out of his pocket on the ground, and tried to cover it; a little girl stooping to buckle her shoe, saw it; he had three shillings more in his pocket; we found the rag on him; the girl knew it, because she had sewed a seam in the middle of it; he said, did I rob you, my girl? she said, you know you did.</p>

             sworn. - I lost a quart pewter pot on Monday, the 23d of January, from the tap-room of my house, from a shelf over the bar; I had lost an ale pint the day before, and suspected the prisoner; I desired the man and the maid servant to take a particular account of what pots were in the house; the next morning, the maid called me down stairs, and told me there was a quart pot missing; I came down and unlocked the bar door, and the prisoner came to the bar for liquor; I asked her if she had taken the pot; she said, she did not; I told her, I really believed she had, and I would send for an officer to take her up; she desired I would not do that, and said, if you will send one of your servants to my house, I will give you the pot back; I asked her how she could do such a thing, to rob the widow and the fatherless; that I thought she would have been the last person.</p>

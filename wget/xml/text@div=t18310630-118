               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I suppose the Penitentiary dress is well known in that neighbourhood? A. Yes - if he had gone out in that dress there is no doubt he would have been known instantly; I heard that after he had got away himself, he came back to assist a friend - there was nothing to prevent his going off when he was out.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. Q. Had he behaved so well that he was made a wardsman and a teacher? A. Yes, he was a well conducted man in every respect.</p>
               <p>THE REV. WHITWORTH RUSSELL. I am chaplain to the Penitentiary. The prisoner had behaved well, and had the good opinion of all the persons in the prison - his full time of imprisonment was but twelve months longer, and if he had behaved well, no doubt it would have been shortened; a little after ten o'clock on the night in question, I was writing in my study, and an alarm was made that some prisoners had escaped from Pentagon 5 - I hastened to the garden, and there joined the patrol, (Young,) and the governor: we went to the outer wall, and there found a piece of linen, used in the prison, placed against the wall as a sort of ladder - it was linen which had been woven in the ward where the prisoner had been; it was then supposed that the prisoners had escaped, and the governor directed search to be made outside, but I suggested they might be in the garden; we proceeded to make search, and against the wall of the prison I found the prisoner and Thompson, who immediately surrendered themselves to us - I saw the clothes taken from the prisoner; they belonged to Mr. Hawthorn.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The prison clothes, I suppose, are decent warm comfortable clothing? Yes, they are partly green and partly brown - it is a uniform that is known, and would have at once advertised to persons outside where they came from; the prisoner had been appointed by myself a monitor of one of the classes in the schools - there was plate and other things of value in the prison, but he could not have access to that.</p>

            . I am assistant task-master in the Penitentiary. On the 8th of April I went out, having locked my door, and deposited the key with the task-master; I returned at ten o'clock, and found my trunk had been broken open, and the lock forced off - I missed a coat and a pair of boots; I afterwards found a skeleton-key in the prisoner's prison clothes which he had left behind; it appeared to be made of mixed metal, such as the cups which the prisoners use - these clothes were taken from the prisoner, and are mine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was that the room you reside in? A. It is the room I sleep in, and the trunk was there - there were other articles in my trunk; I had taken my linen out that evening to wash - there were other things he might have stolen.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. Q. Is it an inconvenient thing for a man who has a wall to climb to have a bundle? A. Yes - the wall, I suppose, is twenty feet high; these are my clothes, and the prisoner had them on.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. They were not stolen with an intent of getting gain by them, but to assist in gaining my liberty - had I had any other means I should not have done it; when I got out I should have got some clothes of my own, and these would have been returned, or full restitution made - there were other articles, which we did not take.</p>

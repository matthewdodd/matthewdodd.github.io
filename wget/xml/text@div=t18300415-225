            . I am patrol of Castle Baynard ward; I have known the deceased and prisoner some time. On Sunday morning, the 7th of March, about eleven o'clock, I heard a disturbance between them; the prisoner was calling her every name he could think of - she said very little to him; I was in the same house - I heard two distinct falls on the floor, as if somebody had fallen down, or been knocked down; I heard words between him and his wife, and just after I heard the falls, she called out for Mrs. Brown, the landlady, to come up to protect her from her husband's violence - I then heard him tell her he would be her b-y butcher, and would be hung for her at the Old Bailey; I have heard him use that expression frequently before - the last time before that, was three or four weeks before; they were so addicted to quarrelling and wrangling, I took no notice of it.</p>

             re-examined. I remember being called up by the deceased on the Sunday morning Foy mentions; the prisoner was on one side of the door and she stood on the landing - she said to me "Pray, come up and take my part, for he is going to ill-use me;" I went up, and told him I must not have that noise on Sunday, and if he could not be at peace he really must go out - he made no answer; I told her if she would come down with me he might get his temper over, and she came down - he said he would serve me the same; I do not know what he had done to her - there were no marks of bleeding or any thing then, but there were after; I was in her room when two doctors were there - I think that was the day before she died; she said she could not live, and appeared to believe she was in a dying state - the prisoner was in the next room near enough to hear what she said; I am quite sure the doors between the rooms were open - they are very small rooms; the bed-curtains were drawn aside; when the doctors came in they asked how she was; she said she had been ill-treated - that Mr. Goulding had been ill-treating her and she certainly must die from it; she said he had beat her, and she could not get over it, she was so bad - the prisoner said he had not done it; he had not beat her at all - she said, "You have knocked me down like a bullock, and if I die my death will lie on your hands;" he again said he had never touched her - she did not seem at all out of temper at this time, but quiet.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you not tell the Coroner she seemed in a passion when she said this? A. Yes, she was, but she was not able to be in a very high passion; she told me before this that she thought she should not recover.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. She said he had knocked her down like a bullock - did you examine her corpse? A. I helped to wash and lay her out; I saw no marks.</p>

            . I am a surgeon - I reside at the General Dispensary, Aldersgate-street. I was called in to attend the deceased; she was an out patient - I was there on the 2nd of April; she had miscarried about four hours when I saw her - I called the prisoner into the room to talk to him about the dangerous situation of his wife; I had been informed that he beat her, and asked him how he could think of beating a woman, particularly in her situation; he denied having beat her at all - I then applied to the women present whether they had not just before told me he had beat her; they made no answer - the deceased after a few seconds said, "Goulding, if I was on my death-bed, you know you are the cause of my illness - you knocked me down like a bullock;" he made no direct reply to her, but denied it to me - I was afraid from his appearance he might behave violent to her in my absence, and told him she was in a very dangerous state, and perhaps his life would depend upon her life, that she must be kept quiet, and if she died he would be hung for it; he said he could not help it, he did not beat her - since her death I have opened her body, and also examined it externally; I discovered no marks of recent injury on the outside - no blackness nor any thing of the kind; on opening her, on the left side of her body I found marks of inflammation on the membrane covering the lungs, and a slight inflammation of the upper orifice of the stomach - these were not solely the cause of her death; it was the combined effects of her miscarriage and the inflammation which produced more fever than is usual in miscarriages - there was more fever attending the inflammation and miscarriage than usual; I cannot state what produced the miscarriage, not from inspection - if I had examined the body without knowing what had been told me, I should have thought it probable that the inflammation had been the cause, but should not have known it to be so; the inflammation might have proceeded from various causes - it must have been recent; I should say within a fortnight, and very probably later than that - if it had proceeded from external violence it would not necessarily produce any external appearance.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to say what in your judgment was the immediate cause of her death? A. Not any one of the symptoms I have mentioned; but the combined effect of the mis-carriage and inflammation; in a healthy person I should say not any one alone would have produced death; I think if kicks or blows had been given to knock her down, would produce inflammation - that might produce miscarriage - and the combined effect, of the two, in a weakly woman might have produced death.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Might not these appearances have presented themselves from natural causes? A. It is possible.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she not been afflicted with siphilis? A. She had marks of having excoriation of the bone of the head, and some marks about the shoulder, but that had been years before; she was more liable to inflammation, and must necessarily have been a bad subject, therefore not able to bear the proper treatment for inflammation - it would probably have been better if I had been called in earlier after the miscarriage; but the principal symptoms she laboured under were not miscarriage, but inflammation; I would not say she had been afflicted with siphilis.</p>

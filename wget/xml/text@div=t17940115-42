            . On the 27th of December, some copper halfpence, and a table cloth were lost. I cannot tell to the amount of how many halfpence, they were in a pickling jar.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you last seen them in the jar? - About half an hour before I went off the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you go out of the bar, what time of the day? - About three o'clock to the best of my knowledge. I keep a public house, the George, in George Yard, Whitechapel.</p>
               <p>Were there a good number of halfpence, or only a few? - Before I went out of the bar the jar was about three parts full, it would hold forty shillings worth.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they wrapped up in any thing, or laid loose in the jar? - Loose in the jar.</p>
               <p>Q. What have you to say with respect to the prisoners? - When I went out of the bar, my husband was called out of it too, and there were seven of them altogether in the bar drinking.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who called him out? I believe it was the distiller's clerk, and when he came in, he missed the jar of halfpence; he called me in, and I missed them, jar and all. I thought my husband had put them up somewhere; and when I could not find them, I charged all with it that were in the bar; the three prisoners and four more were there, when I went out of the bar, they were there, when I went in again, they were in their own house; I charged the officer with them.</p>

               <p>Q. Was she searched in your presence? - Yes, I was present when the halfpence were found in her pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. To what amount, were they found in her pocket? - I cannot tell. After searching their pockets, there were some found on the floor, between the chairs in which they were sitting, and the duplicate of a petticoat which they had pawned that day.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the pawnbroker here? - No, it was not my petticoat, it was her own; after searching them round, we could not find the jar; the two Leary's live at the next door, and the other woman lodges along with them; going to the house, and searching, we searched for the jar, and I did not find the halfpence that were lost.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any quantity of halfpence in the house? - None; the constable stopped down, and under some coals in the coal hole, he took out a table cloth, and I said, it was mine; it was a linen dinner table cloth, it is here. (Produced.)</p>
               <p>Court to officer. Where did you find that? - In the coal-hole under the stairs, by the side of the fire place; it has been in my possession locked up ever since, in the same state and condition in which I found it; it is marked, J. P. No. 3.</p>

In consequence of which, we called two people out of the tap-room, to take care of the bar, while we went and searched the house along with the constable; he searched the lower room, underneath the stairs out of the coal hole, he was taking with a stick, and he raked out a table cloth. Then, when he brought it out, he said to Mrs. Dowling, do you know any thing of this? Mrs. Dowling said immediately, it was her table cloth. I know the table cloth to be the property of Mr. Dowling, and I saw it that day, by seeing of it in the bar, and Mr. Dowling told me, that he had bought it a day or two before, I cannot be positive. I knew it by these marks, J. C. No. 3. and a small cross in the centre. I then returned back to the bar, and walked along with Mrs. Dowling, and the prisoners to the magistrate; during the time we were going to the magistrate, the prisoner, Patrick Leary, said to me, that there was a quantity of halfpence taken by

The girl was attending in the house before me; attending in and out of the house, I supposed, she was to help them; so I came into the bar, and I was for some time there, and this acquaintance of mine that was with me, told me to send for this woman, that he wanted to see her; so she came into the bar, and had some beer, and I paid for my part of it. I never saw any thing of the halfpence, nor don't know any thing about it. After a time, they missed the halfpence, they went to my house to look for them; they told me, they found a table cloth; Madam, said, Ann Donnelly, what need you make a piece of work about that table cloth? I borrowed it of you to-day.</p>

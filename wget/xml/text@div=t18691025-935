                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Newcombe—I was with my daughter in Oxford Street—I had my puree in my hand, which was a very small pocket-book, which closed with a steel clasp, and it had a small piece of elastic round it, and in one side of it was a little case of sticking plaster, and a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I saw a face, and I thought what impertinence for anyone to put his face so close to mine, and while I was looking at the face I felt my purse move; I grasped my hand very tight, and looked at him—he pulled the purse up, and seemed to turn me round, and I was thrown down—Hogan is the man, I have not the slightest doubt of him—I was very much hurt, and confined to my bed for a fortnight afterwards—I have not recovered yet—I pointed Hogan out at the station from a number of persons.</p>

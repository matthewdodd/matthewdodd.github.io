                  </hi>. The prisoner took a front parlour in my house, and on 10th Dec., about a week afterwards, she brought this blind to my house—I asked if she was married and had a family—she said, "No," she was housekeeper to Mr. Ibbetson, and she wished to take a room to put her fur<lb></lb>niture in, as the room she then had was a long way off—I went to inquire why she did not come, and heard she was taken up the day she was to have come to my room—I did not hear Mr. Ibbetson claim anything but this blind.</p>

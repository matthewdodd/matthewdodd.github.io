               <p>I keep carts and horses now; I live in Hartshorn-court, Golden-lane. I was at Mr. Lynch's house when the mob attacked it, on Tuesday night the 6th of June, at about a quarter after ten o'clock, the mob went in at the back door, and threw every thing out of the shop; then they went up stairs and threw out the furniture, and pulled down part of the house; then they took the things into Old-street Road and burnt them. I saw the prisoner several times take the things from the door and carry them to Old-street Road to have them burnt; he helped to throw the goods out at the window before he took them away. The mob went from thence to Mr. Bradbury's; that was after twelve o'clock; I saw the prisoner take a paper out of a chest, which was carried to be burnt; I thought it was a paper of halfpence. I said to him, about half an hour after, you have got a crown-paper of halfpence. He said it was only a paper of buttons.</p>

I went up to them and saw the prisoner come from Golden-lane with some fire in one hand and a bed-tick, or a piece of a bed-tick, in the other; I saw him put the light under it; I heard Mr. Lynch's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178006280276"></xptr> house was pulling down; his goods were bringing up at this time.

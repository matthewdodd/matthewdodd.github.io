On the 29th of December the prisoner came to the shop, and asked my mistress if she had any side-lace boots; she said she had only one pair, which she showed her - the prisoner said they were too small, they would fit her, but she wanted them for a lady, and they must be a large size; my mistress sent me with some others - I took them with the prisoner just round the corner; she went up stairs, at a house, as she said, to tell a person - she then came down, and said she would take two pairs; she took two pairs up, came down, and told me to wait at the door, while she went to get change - I waited about five minutes, when a person came down, and said, "What are you waiting for?" I said I was waiting for a person who had gone to get change, to pay for a pair of boots - she said she had seen the prisoner there, who had inquired for a person, whom she never saw in her life; I was to have had the money or the boots back, but not to leave them without the money - the person who came down, told me I had better run to the pawnbroker's shops: I went to my master, who sent me and my mistress out; I went to Mr. Harrison's, and found one pair pawned there.</p>

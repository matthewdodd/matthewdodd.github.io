                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live in John-street, Limehouse, I had some cotton for sale inside my shop, on the 28th of December—there were twelve or thirteen yards, which I saw safe about five or six o'clock in the afternoon—I did not miss it till the officer called about eight o'clock, and produced a piece cut off the corner of my cotton—I knew it to be mine—this is the piece I lost—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it.</hi>)</p>

I was going through Stepney-churchyard about seven o'clock in the evening, on the 28th of December—I saw the prisoner and two others—the prisoner had something under his arm—I followed them till they came to the Maid and Magpie, where they joined three or four more—I then went and asked the prisoner what he had got—he threw down the bundle, and ran off—I took it up, and followed him, crying "Stop thief"—a young man stopped him, and I went up, and took him to the station-house—this cotton was in a handkerchief, which he said was his neck-handkerchief, and he put it round his neck.</p>

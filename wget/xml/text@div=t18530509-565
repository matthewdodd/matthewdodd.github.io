On the evening of 7th April I was serving, and my servant was there—the prisoner came in between 8 and 9 o'clock; I served him half a pint of tea and some bread and butter—he put a shilling on the table; I took it up, and gave him change; I took the shilling into the kitchen, and put it on the table—I told the servant to take the shilling, and get some beer—I saw her take up the same that I had put down—she went out with it, brought it back, and I gave it to my husband—I saw the prisoner again on Wednesday, the 13th; he came again to the coffee-shop, and had half a pint of tea; he paid for it with a shilling; I saw him give it to Lacey; she put it into her mouth, and bent it; she kept it in her hand till I fetched a constable; she then gave it me, and I gave it to my husband.</p>

I recollect seeing the prisoner there on 7th April, between 8 and 9 o'clock; he came for half a pint of tea and some bread and butter—I saw him give my mistress a shilling; she laid it on the table in the kitchen—not knowing it was bad, I took it to the public house, to get some beer for supper—I offered the shilling there, and the landlord bent it on both sides; he gave it to me, and I took it hack to my mistress, and gave it her—it had not been out of my sight—I was at home on Wednesday, the 13th; the prisoner came in the morning for some tea; I served him; he gave me a shilling; I gave it to my mistress, and she gave it to my master, and she went to fetch a police-man, and the prisoner was taken into custody.</p>

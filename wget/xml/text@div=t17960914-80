               <p>Q. How came that suspicion to arise? - A. I make it a point, whenever I me any spoons, to take string enough to annex the ticket to it; when I came to look at it, I saw the string was not long enough; I went in pursuit of him, and took him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179609140111"></xptr>within I small distance from our house; it was not above a minute or so before I discovered the cheat; I brought him back to the house, and from thence to the watch-house; I searched him, and found upon him my own spoons and two other parcels of pewter spoons tied up in like manner.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say with certainty, whether he might not have changed them the first time he brought them? - A. No; I weighed them when I put them away.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Is there no possibility of their having been changed while they were in your shop? - A. No; there is no body in our shop but my brother, my father, and an apprentice.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of the spoons? - A. I lent him a guinea upon them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I went to the shop and pledged the spoons; I had no intention of taking away any thing; I was out of the shop three or four minutes, and, if I had had an intention of stealing them, I should have run away with them.</p>

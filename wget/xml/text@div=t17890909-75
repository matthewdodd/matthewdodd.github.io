               <p>How did you know it was the prisoner? - I have known him for three years, by passing and repassing that place.</p>
               <p>How came you to know his name? - I know no more of him.</p>
               <p>How did you know his name, by passing and repassing through the turnpike? - I had heard his name mentioned.</p>
               <p>Now, tell us what passed when you met him? - On Saturday night, as I was coming home from pay-table, the prisoner at the bar met me, and asked me how I did? I told him I was hearty, thanked him, and was going on to my lodgings; immediately, he lays hold of me by my left arm.</p>
               <p>Who was with him at this time? - Several more people were with him, all standing together in a croud, about to the number of fifteen; he lays hold of me by the arm, and held me whilst the others picked my pocket of eight shillings and a few halfpence, an handkerchief, and a stock.</p>
               <p>Did you make any resistance at this? - No; I dared not; I was afraid of my life.</p>
               <p>Why did you beg your life? - I was afraid they would murder me, they jostled me in such a manner.</p>
               <p>Had they any arms? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>How long were they in doing this? - About ten minutes, as nigh as I can tell now.</p>
               <p>Did you know any of the others? - No.</p>
               <p>What became of you, after this was over? - I came home to my lodgings.</p>
               <p>Where did they go after? - I know not; I was afraid if I had gone after them, they would have murdered me.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090088"></xptr>How far was this from the Blue-coat ale-house? - About three yards from the door.</p>
               <p>For what length of time had you seen this man occasionally? - For this three or four years.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. This happened after you had been at the pay-table on Saturday night? - Yes.</p>

            ? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was it a dark night, past ten, past eleven o'clock, was it not pitch dark? - No, it was not.</p>
               <p>Now, my good Sir, you swear to this man by his voice? - No, I knew his person.</p>
               <p>Where had you been, in circumstances to become acquainted with his voice? - I never conversed with him.</p>
               <p>Never spoke with him before? - Yes, in Islington.</p>
               <p>On what occasion; only passing by, good morrow, good morrow? - No more.</p>
               <p>Never drank with him, nor in company where he was? - I do not think I ever did.</p>
               <p>You have no doubt about his voice, nor of his person; you was as sure of his person, as you was of his voice; and as sure of his voice, as you was of his person; now, my honest friend, what countryman are you? - An Irishman.</p>
               <p>This man was taken in custody on Monday; and was examined once before the magistrate; and fully committed for trial? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was he committed the first time? - No.</p>
               <p>The second time? - No; I do not understand you.</p>
               <p>Was he not examined the first time, and committed for further examination; examined the second time, and committed for further examination; and at last, examined a third time, and then fully committed? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I find you understand me well enough, if you will. Was you as sure to him the first time, as you was the third? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How comes it to pass, he was not sent the first; who examined him? - Mr. Hyde.</p>
               <p>I believe, before the third examination, a man of the name of Foreside was taken into custody? - I believe he was.</p>
               <p>Do you know any number of the other persons among the fifteen? - No.</p>
               <p>The only thing you can recollect, to know any thing about him, is by his voice? Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he speak out, or talk as you do now, so low, muttering, you can hardly be heard? - He spoke out.</p>
               <p>As you had been to the pay-table, you likely had had a drop? - Yes; I had a drop; I had drank a pot of beer.</p>
               <p>A pot of beer does not hurt you? - No.</p>
               <p>I wish you could help me to a reason, why this man was not fully committed the first time; did you swear positively to him the first time, second time, or the third time? - At each time.</p>
               <p>How near was you robbed from the Blue-coat Boy? - About three or four yards.</p>
               <p>I suppose a place as much frequented as Newgate-street; there is the Angel on one corner, and the Blue-coat Boy on the other, just running down to the turnpike; is it not an immense thoroughfare of a Saturday-night? - There was not many people passing then.</p>
               <p>This happened on the 18th; can you tell me on what day the prisoner was committed upon? - On the 28th.</p>
               <p>It was a fine moon-light night, was it not; was it a rainy night, or a fair one; can you tell us the state of the moon? - No, I cannot.</p>
               <p>You had no assistance whatever from the moon; and the principal thing you swear to the prisoner by, is by his voice? - No, it is not; I can swear to his person.</p>
               <p>You never worked with him; never have been at a publick-house with him; never had any dealings with him; and yet out of fifteen people, it was he that robbed you? - It was he.</p>
               <p>How long were they robbing you? - They were ten minutes robbing me.</p>
               <p>Did any body pass by whilst you was being robbed? - I cannot positively say.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090089"></xptr>Do you believe, there is any one ten minutes, from seven o'clock in the evening, to ten o'clock at night, that less than twenty people do not pass; did you ever know a ten minutes, that a great many were not passing? - I cannot say; there was not many people passing then.</p>
               <p>You first lost your hat, and got it back again; so in the end, you was loser of nothing that had a mark upon it; did you get your stock back again? - I never got any thing back again.</p>
               <p>Perhaps you have been long enough in England, to know there is a reward for a highway robbery? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Consider? - Yes, I did hear there was a reward.</p>
               <p>How much? - That I do not know.</p>
               <p>No! nor never heard! have you never been told there is a reward of forty pounds, on every person convicted, who commits a highway robbery? - What reward I never heard; no, I never heard any more than twenty pounds.</p>
               <p>That there was twenty pounds for the prosecutor, and twenty pounds to be divided among the rest? - No, I did not hear that.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, who told you there was a reward of twenty pounds? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Consider a little? - I heard it in several places.</p>
               <p>I desire you tell then, who it was in any one place, that mentioned it to you, that there was a reward of twenty pounds; did not you hear it at justice Hyde's? - No, that I never did.</p>
               <p>Where then? - I heard people talking about it in the yard.</p>
               <p>What! strangers to you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When did you hear the people in the yard talking of it? - On Saturday and Friday.</p>
               <p>Court. Now mind what I say to you; you say you heard there was a reward for highway robberies, on Saturday and Friday last; then, what is the reason you first of all told us, you had not heard there was any reward; I want to know that; why did you dare to tell this gentleman, you never heard it at all?</p>

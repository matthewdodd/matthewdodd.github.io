               <p>The Case stated by Mr. Knapp.</p>
               <p>JOHN CLARK. Q. What are you. - A. I am a Bow-street patrol. On the day laid in the indictment, at seven in the evening, I apprehended a person of the name of Buckney in Vauxhall Walk; I saw him leaning upon a post, I asked him what he had got, he said it was nothing to me; I found upon him this quantity of beans; I believe there are two pecks (producing them).</p>
               <p>Q. You took him up, did you. - A. Yes, I apprehended the prisoner on the Monday following at the Blue Last, Salisbury-square, I told him what I apprehended him for, he told me he knew the business; Buckney's master had called him up on Saturday evening and told him I had apprehended Buckney with the beans. I took him to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>GEORGE BUCKNEY. - Mr. Knapp. What are you. - A I live in Battersea.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner. - A. Yes. On the 31st of October last, I asked him to give me a few beans upon Dorset's wharf, White Friars, he gave me a few.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he get them from to give to you. - A. That I cannot say, he came up the wharf to give them to me. I took them away. I was apprehended by Clark.</p>
               <p>MR. BROWN. - Mr. Knapp. I believe you are clerk to Messrs. Roberts and Thompson. - A. I am.</p>

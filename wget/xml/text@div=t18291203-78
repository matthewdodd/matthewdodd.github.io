No; this prosecution certainly is not without their knowledge - they are perfectly acquainted with it; they are the purchasers of the stock - the assigners of White and Metcalf are not interested in it - I only known that Sewell and Cross are the proprietors by what they have told me: there is nothing about the shop, nor in the window to denote that it belongs to them; but their names are sometimes used.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Who put you in possession of that property? A.Sewell and Cross, and I receive a salary from them.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182912030033"></xptr>CATHERINE POWELL. I am servant at the house in Lamb's Conduit-street. I am employed by Sewell and Cross. About three weeks ago I was in the carpet-room, and Reid, who was in their employ, gave me a veil; the officers came to the house and took that from me; I was taken into custody, and when we got into the cart I said to Reid, "William, what is all this about? if you know any thing, tell me" - he said, "I am very sorry, Catherine, you should be brought to prison, for you know nothing about it, for while you were out on the Sunday evening, the cook put me into the sitting-room, and took the things, and did not want you to know any thing about it" - I said, "What things?" he mentioned them, and I said, "They are the things I have been asked about;" he said, "You know nothing at all about it" - he said the cook was always teasing him to get her things, and he never had any peace with her - I asked if he had ever taken any thing; he said, Yes, and had given them to a young woman - I said,"What young woman?" - he said, "The Tartan-plaid young woman." Mackay is the cook.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q.Were you taken into custody? A. Yes; I came from the House of Correction to-day.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM TOY. I am assistant to Sewell and Cross. I was desired to watch the movements of Reid - on the 12th of November, at eight o'clock in the morning, I was in Lamb's Conduit-street, and saw Reid talking to Hislop; he left her, went to Sewell and Cross', and in a few minutes returned to Hislop, where he had left her - they walked together down Theobald's-road and Harper-street, went into a public house, came out again in a few minutes, and he gave her a parcel from his pocket; she put it under her cloak, under her left arm - they walked to the bottom of Harper-street, round the corner, returned, and walked to Lamb's Conduit-street - he left her and went to his employers'; I went back and told Watts what I had seen - I did not see where Reid got the parcel from; it was but small.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do you know his age? A. No: I saw him take something from his lefthand coat-pocket - I will not swear it was not a pocket-handkerchief; I cannot say it was tied up - it was not a bunch of keys; I saw a parcel, it might be a little larger or smaller than my wrist - he had a blue coat on; I was on the opposite side of the way in Harper-street, ten or twelve yards from them - that street is darker than Lamb's Conduit-street; the house is called Navarino-house - we deal in perfumery, carpets, silks, woollens, and linen; I will not swear the parcel was not a pair of dirty stockings.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Were you told the reason of being sent to watch? A. I was told there was a suspicion of my employers being robbed; I swear I saw a parcel taken from Reid's left-hand coat-pocket, and given to Hislop - she had nothing before, because I saw her arms swing; her hands were free, and it would have dropped down; I do not know whether her arms were under her cloak - I think they were not; but I know I saw her arms swinging - I think it was a cloak with armholes in it; I think it was not a close cloak with her arms inside - I think they were outside - I think they did not walk arm-in-arm, they walked close by each other's side; I think they had been together ten minutes before any thing passed from him to her - it was a minute or two after they came out of the public-house; they went half way down the street, and then he gave it her - I did not interfere at the time, because I had no strong suspicion before that; I was told to watch them - I thought the transaction would be sufficient to convey to Mr. Watts: they separated in Theobald's-road - I had seen Hislop one morning before, when she came to the door and asked for

            , but he was not within; I think I spoke to her that night, after she separated from Reid, just after she went into an oyster-shop, at the bottom of King's-road - I asked where she was going; I wanted to see what she had got, but I could not see any thing.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you know what the words were you said to her at the oyster-shop? A. I do not know exactly; I do not think they had seen me before, for I turned my face as they came up the street.</p>

            , at their house in Compton-street. About six o'clock in the evening of the 13th of November I saw Reid, and I think Hislop; I had never seen her before - Reid came out of Navarino-house; Hislop joined him in Theobald's-road, and they went to Compton-house together - Reid went in, and Hislop remained outside; he came out in about ten minutes, and they walked back to Navarino-house together.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Do you know of any agreement between Sewell and Cross, and the assignees of White and Metcalf? A. No; I believe White and Metcalf were not indebted to Sewell and Cross.</p>
               <p>THOMAS CLEMENTS. I went with Mr. Cross on Saturday, the 14th of November, to Navarino-house; I took Powell, Reid, and Mackay - I took this vell from Powell's bonnet; I then went with a search-warrant to No. 130, Old-street, and on the second floor I found Hislop; I told her I had a warrant to search the house for the things she had received of William, at Navarino-house - she hesitated, and then said, "I have some things, and I will show them you;" she showed some articles, and I found two duplicates in her pocket; she admitted that these things were given her by William, at Lamb's Conduit-street, and said she had received a great many more - she named shawls and handkerchiefs, satin, and some silk stockings, most of which she had pawned and given the money to William, and said he desired her to destroy the duplicates; she had given him some of them, and he had torn them up in her presence - she said he told her that they had hung one or two persons whom they had prosecuted.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. There was no hesitation? A.There was some slight hesitation; she certainly told me every thing - the articles I found were a cotton gown, a lace collar, a band, and one or two things.</p>

            . I am shopman to a pawnbroker, in Newgate-street. I have two shawls, pawned, I believe, by Hislop, but I am not certain.</p>
               <p>ROBERT BURGOYNE WATTS. I believe these to be the property of Messrs. Sewell and Cross; most of them have marks, and Reid said -</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Before this, had you had any conversation with Sewell and Cross? A.Certainly not; this conversation was not in the presence of Mr. Cross - there was a conversation between Reid, Mr. Cross, and me, up stairs, which was before what I am about to relate - Mr. Cross did not promise him forgiveness if he would tell the truth; he did not say he would be merciful to him - he said, he believed he was led in the first instance into it by the cook, and that he was sorry for him; that is all that I remember - I believe Reid had before told him of the things he had taken, but I cannot tell; Mr. Cross said, he never forgave any one, and he would certainly send him to Newgate - he did not then ask him what he had to say; I think he asked him whether he chose to tell him any thing or not - he did not say he would send him to Newgate if he would not tell him; I believe this conversation was before he asked him if he chose to say any thing.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.What did Reid say? A. He said he was led into it by the cook - that she called him into the kitchen on Sunday morning, and told him he might take her up stairs and kiss her, and do what he desired, if he would allow her to go and take any thing out of the shop; that she went and took some lawn, and two or three other things - and he said he took several things himself, and had given them to a girl, named Hislop, in Old-street; I went to Reid's mother's, saw his box, and found a silk handkerchief, the property of my employers - I then went to Old-street, and saw these other things produced.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Reid. Mr. Cross told me he would not punish me.</p>
               <p>Hislop's Defence. I did not know they were stolen when I received them.</p>
               <p>The prisoners received a good character.</p>

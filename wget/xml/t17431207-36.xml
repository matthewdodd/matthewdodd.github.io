            . On the 18th of September last, as I was going out of Town, the Prisoner came down Stairs, I thought she was not well, and asked her what was the Matter with her, she said she was extremely Ill with the Gravel and Stone; I desired her to send for Mr. Warner, a Surgeon, to come to her, but in talking with her, I thought I observed that she was fallen away, and suspected she had been with Child; I taxed her with having been with Child, she said she had voided a great Quantity of Water, that she was better, and said that she had not been with Child; I talked to her of having the necessary House opened, to search if any Child was there, which she insisted upon in order to clear her Character. On the 9th of November, I received a Letter from Mrs. Porter from Lincoln, where the Prisoner came from, in which she acquainted me, that she was two Months gone with Child before she came from thence; I told her of the Letter, and asked her concerning it; she then owned she had miscarried, and that she was five Months gone with Child when she miscarried; I sent for a Carpenter, and had the Vault opened, and there was a Child found.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the Child?</p>
               <p>Mr. Porter. I saw it, but it was at some Distance, for it was so very nauseous, I did not care to come near it.</p>

             . I am a Surgeon; on the 9th of November I was sent for by Mr. Porter to come to his House immediately; when I came, he said he had found out what he had long suspected; his Maid's being with Child: He had the Vault opened, and a Child was found; he desired me to look at it; I viewed the Child, but it had lain in the Soil some Time, so that the Skull was separated one Bone from another. Mr. Porter asked me, whether I thought there had been any Violence done the Child; I said it had lain there so long, that I could not form a Judgment whether there had or no.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a Male or a Female Child?</p>
               <p>Warner. I took the Child to the best of my Judgment to be a Female Child, though it had lain till I could scarce tell what Sex it was; I was asked what Growth I thought the Child was; I said it was so large, that I believed it might be about nine Months; I could not tell whether the Mother had gone the full Time or not - I cannot tell whether it was born alive, or not.</p>

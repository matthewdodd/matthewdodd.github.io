            . I am in the employ of a pawnbroker. On the 22nd of August, about seven in the evening, I took in a remnant of cotton of the prisoner - I lent 2s. on it, and in about two hours the prosecutor's young man came and asked if I had taken in such an article -I said I had, and described the person - this is the print.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. HEATON. Q. Have you had the cotton in your possession ever since? A. It has been at my employer's, but I have not been there - I left him in November, but it had my duplicate on it; I had not seen the prisoner before, nor did I see her again till she was at the office, on the 17th of December - I swear she is the woman.</p>

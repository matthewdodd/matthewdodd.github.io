                  </hi>. I am a general dealer, and live at Artillery Place—this cap was brought to my place, and I gave it up to the police afterwards—I could not swear to the man who brought it—I heard the prisoner speak, and identified him by his voice—I did not recognize him by his appearance—I heard him speak when the policeman brought him in, and I knew him by his voice—the cap was brought on Tuesday evening, the 20th, and the prisoner was brought to my place on the Thursday morning following—of course I heard him speak when he brought the cap, and judging from his voice, to the best of my belief, the prisoner is the man—I don't say posi<lb></lb>tively he is the man—I gave him 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the cap and sword knot—he said he had some more things to sell, but he did not like to send his servant out with them, that he did not doubt the servant's honesty, but he would rather bring it himself the next day—he did not come the next day.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Sowerby, a pawnbroker, of Brick-lane. On a Wednesday, early in March, the prisoner came and brought a vertical-jack to pawn - I asked if it was his own; he said Yes - I asked where the key of it was; he said at home, and if I did not like it I might send for a Policeman, which I did, and he was taken.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. I take it for granted a great many people attended the sale? A. Yes; this jack was not sold - I am not mistaken in the prisoner's person - I heard a difference in the kitchen between him and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183204050060"></xptr>my servant, and as I was going down he rushed by me and got out.</p>

            . I am cook to the prosecutor. I recollect the sale - I saw the prisoner at the house; we had a vertical jack in the kitchen - I saw it while he was there, and missed it in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after he was gone; it was one like this, and had the name of Evans on it - I believe this is the one; I have no doubt of it - I cannot swear to it - I have another at home; I think this is rather lighter than that - they cost 34s. each.</p>

            , (Police-constable H 26.) I took the prisoner - he said he bought the jack of Mr. Williams, at the corner of Finsbury-square, for 1s.; I went there, but could not find such a person - I found on him a catalogue of the prosecutor's sale.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you give the same evidence before the Magistrate? A. Yes - the prisoner was discharged; I had not then found the prosecutor - the prisoner came the next morning to get the jack, and I took him - he was in liquor when he was first taken.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a good character.</p>

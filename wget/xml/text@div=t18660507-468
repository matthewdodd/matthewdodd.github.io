I am gardener to Mr. Crawshay—on the morning of 17th April, I saw that a work-box had been broken open, and the kitchen window was broken—I went round to the stable-yard and told the groom—he came and looked and then went into the house to tell the servants, who came and looked, and after a bit they came and told me what they lost—I tracked the footmarks down the walk—I met two policemen, and told them that the house had been broken open—they said that they were going there; that they had information on it—and as we were coming along the road we met the prisoner—the policeman let him go by, and then went back and asked him what he had got—he gave a satisfactory answer, and he let him go—when we got a little way, I saw footmarks on the dirt, and they went back and overtook him—the marks in the road were the same as in the garden—when I got to him the bundle was undone, and I told the policeman the things answered the description as the things that were lost—he took him into custody—I went into Mr. Crawshay's garden two or three minutes past six.</p>

About half-past seven on Tuesday morning, 17th April, I received information that a robbery had taken place at Mr. Crawshay's—I went with another constable—about two miles from the station, and three miles from Mr. Crawshay's, I saw the prisoner coming along the road towards Hornsey from Colney Hatch, in a straight line from Mr. Crawshay's—he had a bundle in brown paper, and two straps across it—I put some questions to him; he answered them very satisfactorily, and I allowed him to go—I spoke to the other constable, and then went back after the prisoner, and wanted to know what he had in his bundle—he said, "What do you want to know for?"—I said, "I do want to know"—he then went off—I went after him and took him in custody—I went to Mr. Crawshay's and found a work-box broken open, a pane of glass broken, and the back kitchen window was out, so that the catch could be undone—I went into the house—I found several drawers broken and several articles lying about—that was about half-past seven in the morning—the articles in the bundle were identified at the station—I then proceeded to a wood about half a mile from the house, searched, and found another large bundle of clothing—I conveyed them to the house and they were identified as the other articles missing from the house—I found a knife in the back kitchen.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I have been a traveller for a gentleman in the City. On the morning of 17th April I left him about 7 o'clock; I proceeded along the road and came to a wood. I got over a stile, and saw a man running away; I went into the field and found these things; I had two straps in my pocket; I intended to keep these things in my possession. After I proceeded along the road some distance I met two policemen; one of them asked me some questions, and I gave him straightforward answers. He then left me a second time; I walked along the road about half a mile, and turned round and saw the policemen coming along. Would a man if he had entered this house have fallen into the trap and not make an effort to escape? Do you not think if he could have got away a dozen times be would not avail him-self of the opportunity? The evidence is circumstantial and contradictory; there was no person seen on the premises late at night or early in the morning. <hi rend="smallCaps">

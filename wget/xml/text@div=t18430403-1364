                  </hi>. I live in Bride-lane, Fleet-street. On the 2nd of Feb. the prisoner came to me for a lodging, as I had a bill in my window—in a few minutes the person came in who lives in my first floor, and it was agreed that the prisoner should lodge with her, and pay 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week for board and lodg<lb></lb>ing—she then asked me to recommend a man to fetch her boxes from the Commercial Club-house at the back of the Bank—I called a man—she agreed to give him 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he was to fetch them at six o'clock in the even<lb></lb>ing—he came, and asked if she was ready—she said, "Yes," and she asked me to let my little niece go with her—I said she might, and she did—her name is Mary Matilda Ebdon—she had a cloak, a pinafore, and a handker<lb></lb>chief on, which were her own property—I bought them and gave them to her—her father is dead, and her mother is 160 miles off—I gave her these things for herself—the man came back at eight o'clock and said he could not find them—the child could not find her way back to Bride-lane—she got to her aunt's at Clerkenwell at one o'clock in the morning, and had not these things then.</p>

                  </hi>. I recollect going with the prisoner that day. I am sure she is the person—when she got to the top of the lane she took hold of my arm, and said she wanted to make a call or two before the man came—she took me towards Temple-bar, and to Piccadilly—she took me to five public-houses, and at the last one she forced me to drink—she took me up some court, took off my cloak, pinafore, and handkerchief—she then took me further on to the corner of a street, left me, and said she would re<lb></lb>turn in two or three minutes.</p>

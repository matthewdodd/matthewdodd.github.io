                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JOHN CUDMORE</hi>. I am a labourer, and live at Holloway, over the stables of Mr. Shakespere, of Pleasant-row, in whose service I am; a lad named Thomas Brown, who was also in Mr. Shakespere's service, lodged with me. On Tuesday, 3rd Jan., I missed a pair of boots from under my bed; on the Friday after I went to the prisoner's house with a police—man, and there saw my boots—the prisoner gave a key to his little girl, and told her to go and fetch them from the cupboard.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the policeman ask for any boots? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he inquired for a pair of boots that a lad had sold to him within the last day or two—the prisoner hesitated a minute or two, and then gave the girl the key, and told her where to find them—the boy Brown was then in custody for stealing the boots.</p>

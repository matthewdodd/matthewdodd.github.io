I am a partner in the firm of Ridley &amp; Co., floor cloth makers, of Newgate Street, London—on 26th July, at 7.15 p.m., I was passing along the footpath, near Enfield, by the side of the New river—my attention was attracted to something in the water; I saw a face—I took off my coat, waistcoat, and shoes, and went in and swam to the opposite side and caught hold of the prisoner by the hair and drew her to the bank; while we were struggling together I saw that she had something in her right hand, I grasped her hand and found it was a child, I took hold of the child; and put it on the bank, I held her for sometime struggling to gain</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector Y). On</hi> Wednesday, 26th July, about 8 o'clock p.m., in consequence of information I went to the footpath by the New River, near Enfield—I met the constable with the child in his arms, dead—I afterwards met the prisoner and took her to the station; I recognised her and called her by her name Emma; I knew her before—her husband is a coffee-house keeper, and a house decorator as well, living in Little Torrington Street, Torrington Square—she said "Is that you "Ser<lb></lb>geant Gould"—I said "Yes"—she said "Is the child dead, because I would sooner hear it was dead than alive"—I told her it was dead—she said "Thank God for it, I am happy now"—she produced a card with her address on it, and a letter addressed to her mother living at Southgate, which she opened and handed it to me—this is it. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Little Torrington Street, July 16. My very dear parents do not consider me entirely an undutiful child; although I know you feel that I have been very distant the last few months towards you, but I felt it was for the best to write to you, it may possible be for the last time, I have been several times accused of not keeping my honour before and since marriage, and that has caused an unhappy life, and rather than that it is better to end it by dying; give my best love to all my brothers and sisters, and accept the same from your ever affectionate daughter, E. J. Couchman. For God's sake please never blame my dear husband, but only blame me." I read the charge over to her and she said "It is too true"—the charge was attempting to commit suicide by throwing herself in the New River, also drowning her child, Ellen, in the same river—she afterwards said "I have never been right since the birth of the child."</p>

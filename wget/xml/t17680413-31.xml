            . On the 20th of March I left my service; I happened to come to an acquaintance of mine in Hart-street, I met this young woman at the bar, I desired her to shew me the way there; she said she would, but was going into a house, but would tell me afterwards; I went in with her; she said, will you give me a glass of wine; I said yes; I took out a quarter of a guinea, and gave to the woman to give change; the prisoner laid her hand about my middle, and said, young man, you are a stranger, I think you and I might make a while of pleasure; she got her hand into my pocket, and took my money out; it was all in a purse, five guineas, a 9 s. piece, and a quarter of a guinea; there came a young man into the room, and said, the woman to whom you gave the quarter of a guinea is going out of the house, you had best go and get your money; I missed my money in my purse; I said, young man, do you know the woman; he said no, d - n you and the woman both, I know none of you; then I said, I'll take care of the house; I got a couple of constables, about eleven at night the prisoner was taken and searched; I saw two guineas taken from her.</p>

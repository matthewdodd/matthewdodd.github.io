               <p>I am related by marriage to the husband, Cooper; I married his sister: during the seven years preceding May, 1787, Cooper was sometimes in town, and sometimes in Leicestershire, and used frequently to go to Aldridge's stables, in St. Martin's-lane, who is a brother to the prisoner: I maintained the son of the first marriage for nine years: he very often visited his mother, and continued doing so till May, 1787; he went frequently to the mother and grandmother; the mother lived then at Burrows's, at Plumsted, in Kent: the son knew the father was living; because when the father came to London, he came first to our chambers, in Lincoln's-inn: he knew all the seven years his father was alive; they corresponded together by letter: I never heard of the father's death till after this marriage.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd. Upon your oath can Cooper write? - He used to get a person to write for him; and he used to write to me, to know how his son Cooper was; Cooper himself cannot write.</p>
               <p>Have you any letter now in your possession that ever came from Cooper to his son? - I have none now; but I could produce a great many.</p>
               <p>Where was the father? - With Colonel

            , at Skeffington-hall: I believe he went from Mr. Tattersa's; he lived there about two years: on the twelvemonth before this marriage he lived with Mr. Emmerson, in Piccadilly; he has lived there now about three years.</p>
               <p>When did you first hear of this second marriage? - I will tell you, if I know.</p>
               <p>Recollect yourself? - I think it was the boy himself informed some of my family; and I believe it was my wife.</p>
               <p>When was that? - I suppose about two years ago, or two years and a half; I could not believe it.</p>
               <p>Do not you carry on this prosecution, upon your oath? - I do not, upon my oath.</p>
               <p>You are not the person that carry on this prosecution? - I am not.</p>
               <p>Did you communicate it to Cooper? - He knew of it before I did.</p>
               <p>Why did this Mr. Cooper remain silent for two years and a half? - I fancy he was not silent; I fancy some business was done in it about a twelvemonth ago.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath was it the first active step that was taken, finding a bill the next sessions? - I was out of town.</p>
               <p>Do not you know that was the first step that was taken? - I do not know; I took no step.</p>
               <p>Do you know now of any step that was taken? - No further than I saw the indictment: I remember Mr. Barker of Gray's-inn sent his clerk to me, to know whether any thing could be done for the child, by the first husband, for she had children enough by the second.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath was any steps taken before? - Yes; I believe there was.</p>
               <p>What step before the last session? - Upon my word I cannot tell you any step.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179010270007"></xptr>How many children has this woman had by this unfortunate second husband? - She had one by Mr. Burrows.</p>
               <p>I ask you, Sir, by Mr. Prior? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Do not you know she has had two children while the first husband has been laying by? - I do not know that, upon my oath.</p>
               <p>Did Mr. Cooper and she ever meet to your knowledge? - Not to my knowledge, only hearsay.</p>

               <p>You have had nothing to do with this prosecution? - Nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Did not you go with the constable to take the woman up? - Yes; I went to identify her.</p>
               <p>You knew where she was to be found? - Yes.</p>
               <p>So you did the last two years. - Upon my oath I could not believe, as I told you before, that she was really married.</p>
               <p>Did not you know for two years where she was? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do not you know that a good deal of time was consumed in finding out where the second marriage was had? - Yes; there was.</p>
               <p>You concluded that the connection was the same sort with Prior as with Burrows? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd. If you suspected that she was married a second time, and meant to take any steps, why did not you go and give the second husband notice? - I could not believe she was married.</p>
               <p>Did not you employ Mr. Barker? - I sent to the house, and to Mr. Barker, and went there myself, to know if any thing could be done for the child; that was two years next November.</p>
               <p>Now did you ever take any steps on the subject of a second marriage at all, till after the woman had said, she could not maintain the child? - I went there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd. I have a great many witnesses to call, to shew that she had the strongest reason to believe that the husband was dead; and she is stated as a widow in the second marriage.</p>
               <p>JANE ALDRIDGE sworn.</p>
               <p>I am mother to the prisoner: I remember the circumstance of her being married perfectly well with Cooper: I think the child was but a quarter old when she went away: they did not live above a year and a half together.</p>
               <p>Did they live together after she went to Ireland? - No, Sir; nor she never saw his face, that I know of, but once; that is about eleven years ago; he came into my house; but he did not demand his wife, nor did not say any thing to her, any further than how do you do, and how do you do: she was just come from Ireland; she was there great part of three years; she was there in several families: I can take a safe oath that she never saw him after that time; she has heard of him after she was married to Mr. Prior; she asked my consent; she was in Kent; and he went into Kent: she lived in Kent about three years, with Mr. Burrows: Prior courted her about a twelvemonth; I knew of it.</p>
               <p>What reason had that woman to believe that Cooper, her husband, was dead? - By nothing but her own child; I was present about three years before she married Prior; I cannot; justly say; but it was a considerable time before; the child said, he was dead; says I to him, Jemmy, where is your father, I have not heard nor seen any thing of him a great while? why, says he, my father is dead; says I, do not say that, it is impossible; you are not in mourning; oh, says the child, such a father as I have is not worth mourning for; but my aunt and my uncle are in mourning.</p>
               <p>What did the child say when he communicated his father's death? - He said nothing more than that to me; that his father had been dead some time in the country; and he said, he had his buckles, and his watch, and some things from the country.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether the father had supported this child or not? - That I cannot say; I believe it was not in his power.</p>
               <p>After the child had said that to you, have you any reason to know whether the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179010270008"></xptr>prisoner ever did hear from her husband? - She never did, I am very confident of it; she never heard from him; nor never saw him but that one time.</p>
               <p>Was it among those who knew her, or knew any thing of Cooper, reported among them that he was dead? - Yes; Sir; it became a common talk that he was dead; by that that the child said so.</p>
               <p>Did you believe so? - Why, yes; or else I would not have given my consent to the second marriage.</p>
               <p>How long has she and Prior lived together? - Three years.</p>
               <p>How many children have they? - Two children.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did she ask your consent to live with Mr. Burrows? - That was her father's doing at first; when she went she went as a visitor, and Mr. Burrows wanted a housekeeper, and my husband said, you may as well keep my daughter.</p>
               <p>What age was this boy that was the messenger of his father's death? - He was about fourteen.</p>
               <p>He accompanied the news of the death of your son-in-law, and of his mother's husband, with the observation that he was so worthless that he was not worth going into mourning for? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now was there ever the least pretence for supposing or stating the father to be dead, but that conversation? - I had no other grounds for it.</p>
               <p>You do not know who instructed him to say so: who was this uncle and aunt that were in mourning? - Mr. and Mrs. Williams.</p>
               <p>Did you ever go to enquire where he was buried? - No.</p>
               <p>How far off was it? - In St. Martin's-lane.</p>
               <p>Did not you frequently see Cooper at your son's repository? - No; never since this happened, nor before.</p>
               <p>How lately before this woman married a second time had you seen Cooper? - Never for eleven years.</p>
               <p>What makes you remember it was eleven years? - Because it is true.</p>
               <p>Did you know that Mr. Cooper was an hostler at Skeffington park? - No.</p>
               <p>Did your daughter, or you, or those that advised her to this second marriage, ever make the least enquiry?</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd. Was there any other means of communication at any time between this man and this woman, except by means of the son? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Then he, who had been the only go-between the husband and the wife, was the person that informed you that the husband was dead? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And you believed it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you consent that this woman should live with Mr. Burrows on improper terms, or did you understand that she went as a housekeeper? - I understood that she went as a housekeeper.</p>

               <p>I am sister to the prisoner: I was present at her marriage with Mr. Prior: I cannot say exactly how long she had been separated from Cooper: she had been servant in several families: Prior courted her a twelvemonth: I heard the prisoner's child say his father was dead, and died a great way off in the country; but did not know the place; I believed the report: I approved of the second marriage, which I would not have done but for that report.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did you take the pains to go to Mr. Williams, to enquire the truth of it? - No; because they behaved very abruptly.</p>
               <p>Did you live at Mr. Alderidge's repository during any part of the seven years, preceeding May, 1787? - Yes; I think I did.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, during this seven years, how often did you see Cooper bringing horses to your brother's repository? - Upon my oath I did not see him, nor I do not know when I have seen him; I do not recollect seeing him since he came to see the child, when my sister was in Ireland; I have never seen him since to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>My friend has asked you whether it was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179010270009"></xptr>not generally believed in the family that Cooper was dead; upon your oath was not it stated to you by Alderidge, that he frequently came there? - No, Sir; it was not.</p>
               <p>From the year 1780 to 1787? - No, Sir; I do not remember it.</p>
               <p>Do you know when this boy was the messenger? - I do not know, nor I do not care, and that is more.</p>
               <p>You do not know who told him to say that his father was dead? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Was that before Prior began courting your sister? - Yes; it was.</p>
               <p>Did Mr. Prior court her while she was at Plumsted? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd. At the time of that conversation with the boy did Prior or any body propose to marry her, to your knowledge? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Were you and Williams on good terms? - No; I never had any communication with them.</p>

               <p>I know the prisoner, and her son, by Cooper: I am her sister: I knew of her marriage with Prior, and his courtship: I recollect the boy saying his father was dead, and he pulled out a watch, and said, his father had left him that watch; it was about a twelvemonth before she was married; I believed the report; and I asked him why he did not go into mourning, and he said, he lived with a master that found him in clothes, and he must wear what he gave him.</p>
               <p>Have you ever heard that conversation by other people? - Yes; I have.</p>
               <p>Was it generally understood among them?</p>

               <p>He seems to have taken pains to have told this story? - I lived In Crown-street, Soho; I frequently saw Aldridge.</p>
               <p>Did not Mr. Aldridge tell you it was false, for that the man was coming frequently to his stables? - No, he did not.</p>

               <p>Mr. Shepherd. Did any body else ever come from the man to the woman, but this boy? - No, nobody but him.</p>
               <p>You was not on good terms, I believe, with Mr. Williams? - No.</p>

               <p>How long was it before the marriage? - About four or five years before the marriage: I have heard it doubted long before the marriage, whether he was dead or alive; and then I heard it positively said; and Mrs. Cooper thought herself at liberty.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What are you? - An independent person.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. How do you mean you was consulted? - How it might suit, he having a family before; I had not the least doubt of the death of the husband: I was an acquaintance of Mr. Burrows, and by that means I became acquainted with Mrs. Cooper.</p>
               <p>Mr. Burrows wished to protect his housekeeper, when she was going to change her state? - Yes, and lawfully protect her: Mr. Prior is a tenant of mine, and bears an undeniable character, as any man in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179010270010"></xptr>world, and has it of several people; if he had known she had a husband, he would not have married her.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Devonshire Arras, at Pimlico. The prisoner was in my employ between three and four months, up to the 14th June, as a weekly servant—I let him have a watch to hang up in his bedroom, that he might know the time to get up in the morning—it was one that I had no use for—it laid in my drawer—I gave it into his hand and never saw it afterwards—I gave it him about the beginning of May—there is no pretence for saying that he bought the watch of me—I never did sell it to him.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Policeman</hi>). On 26th September I watched Messrs. Millington &amp; Button's warehouse, in Budge Row—I saw Fuller drive up, about 11 o'clock, to a loophole in Size Lane—I had followed him from Lime Street—he often carries goods for Messrs. Millington—Giles spoke to Fuller there—I next saw Fuller in Queen Victoria Street, where he was joined by Hudd—they then drove to Silver Street, Blackfriars Road, and there delivered some paper—they drove to Surrey Row, under the railway arch—Hudd got out of the van—something was given him from the tail-board, which Hudd took through a court, into Friar Street—Fuller then drove on to Gravel Lane—I followed Hudd into Friar Street, where are the premises of Mrs. Cole—the words "Jane Cole" are over the door, and "Marine Store Dealer," and best price given for different articles, named on the board—I went to Gravel Lane, and saw Fuller's van standing outside the Hope public-house—I had lost sight of Hudd, close to Cole's door, and went after Fuller, who was joined by Hudd at the Hope—they separated on coming out—I saw Fuller again on the 29th, about 9 o'clock, at Milling<lb></lb>ton's, in Budge Row—he left there with his van full—he waited in Victoria Street a few minutes—Hudd spoke to him, and walked on—they joined again in New Street, near Blackfriars Bridge, and walked over the bridge together—the van stopped under the railway arch—Hudd did the same as before, looked up and down, and then went back to the van—Fuller gave Hudd a sack out of the van on to his back—there was a bluish stripe on the sack, which was held upwards—the bottom of the sack had been mended—I saw Hudd carry the sack into Friar Street, to Mrs. Cole's shop, and place it on the scales, which were about a yard inside the door—Mrs. Cole and a boy were in the shop at the time—I was not half a dozen yards away when Hudd was brushing himself down—the boy put the weights on, and Mrs. Cole appeared checking the weights—he was in the shop six or seven minutes, dressed as he is now, except his hat—I then followed Hudd to Southwark Street, and made a communication to Smith, the officer engaged in this matter, and returned to Friar Street, and watched Mrs. Cole's premises till 3.30—I was there when she was appre<lb></lb>hended.</p>

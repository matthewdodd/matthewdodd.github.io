                  </hi>. I am a cheesemonger. I missed two cheeses and one piece on the 22nd of January—I went towards St. John's Rents, and saw the policeman in pursuit of the prisoner—I went round a back way, ex<lb></lb>pecting him to come to the end; and when I got up, I saw this cheese on the ground—the prisoner had gone in that direction—I know the marks on the cheeses.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Fisher. I was at the kitchen window that day, and saw two persons walking backwards and forwards, and looking into the shop—the prisoner was one, I am quite certain—I saw him take two pieces of cheese, and give them to another person—he then took a Cheshire cheese himself, and put it under his left arm—he went down Phipps-street.</p>

Q.</hi> What did you do? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I went up to my master—I had been washing my hands at the kitchen window, which is under the shop—I could see people's faces—I had not seen the prisoner before—there is a show-board, which projects about a foot, I should think, over the area window—it does not shut out the light much—I can see every body that comes to the shop window—I saw the prisoner and the other pass three times, and watched them, thinking they were after no good.</p>

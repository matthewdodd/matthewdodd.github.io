                  </hi>. I live in High-street, Camden-town, and am a grocer. I missed a bag, containing about 17 lbs. weight of coffee, about ten o'clock on Saturday morning, the 23rd of February—I saw it again in possession of the policeman—I know the bag was mine—it was three parts of the way in my shop—there were five bags stood before it—this was the sixth—the prisoner is a stranger.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable</hi> 5156.) I met the prisoner in Great Camden-street, about two hundred yards from the prosecutor's shop, a little after nine o'clock that morning—he had hold of this bag—I saw him talking with two others—I went and stood at the corner—he came past me, I followed him—he turned his head, and saw me—he threw down the bag and tried to make his escape—I took him, and asked what was in the bag—he said he did not know—I asked him what made him throw it down—he said, "I was sure there was stolen property in it, by your following me."</p>

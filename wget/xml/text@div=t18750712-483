I am a gas stoker, of 44, Denmark Terrace, Barking Road—about 8 o'clock on Friday morning, 30th April, my attention was called to something going on outside—I went to the window, which was open, and the deceased lay about 60 yards from my window and the prisoner was leaving him—he was about 40 yards off, coming from him towards my house—I knew the prisoner and went downstairs, went up to him and said "What is the matter, Mike?"—he said "I have killed a boy"—I; said "Nonsense; come back with me and let me see"—he said "it is no use; he is dead"—I asked him to come back, with me, to the boy and he did so—the boy lay in a pool of blood and was covered with blood; he was insensible—tbe sight rather upset me, and when I came to myself I found this hammer in my hand—I had not got it till I saw the deceased—I do not know whether the prisoner picked it up and gave it to me, or whether I picked it up—I gave it to George Banks, the policeman—I took the prisoner to the constable, who was 300 yards off, or a little more, and said "This man has killed a boy up the road"—the prisoner said "I have done it; lock me up"—I had seen the prisoner on the Wednesday previous, and my attention was excited by the way he came in a stooping position along the road and not speaking, and he looked so dull about the eyes and head—he went about in a slouching position—I bade him good night—when I spoke to him he was very strange—I have known him between five and six years he is a scaffolder—I had lost sight of him for two and a half or three years</p>

               <p>April the deceased was brought there quite insensible, and-suffering from sixteen or seventeen wounds on his head; he had borne very severe fractures; the skull was fractured, and one fracture was very large, there was brain protruding and he was paralysed on one side—he continued not quite insenssible, but he was never sensible enough to make a statement—there was laceration of the brain, and an abcess resulted from it—he lingered till 31st May, and then died—the immediate cause of death was the compound fracture and the abcess.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I entered the medical profession—in 1866 and qualified in 1869—I have had persons under my charge suffering under mental disease, I travelled two years with a man who was a ward in Chancery, who was subject to delusions, but at times he was quite sensible—when those delusions were on him he was very violent, but "at other times, he vas sensible and could enter into conversation about anything—the generic term for that form of insanity is "mania"—mania involves delusions at times, decidedly—an attack of sunstroke would render the person who had it a likely person for insanity to take effect upon; it would predispose the soil more readily to the growth of insanity—there is no doubt whatever that a sun-stroke has a strongly mechanical effect upon the brain—a patient is at first insensible from sunstroke, and afterwards there is congestion of the brain very often accompanied by delirium—the after effect of sun stroke are intense headache coming on in an uncontrollable degree and under any exciting cause: drink would bring it on—a person who has had sun-stroke ought to drink nothing—I have been in Court during trial—for the purpose of forming an opinion as to whether a person is or is not of sound mind when he commits an act, the question" of motive is a materal one; if I, as a doctor, were called upon to form an opinion for private pur<lb></lb>poses, the absence of motive would be a most important consideration—it is a well-known characteristic of murderous attacks perperated by insane people, that the attacks are either perpetrated on  a person they do not know or else on a person they are very fond of but I do not say this is always the case—there may be something unusual in the circumstance that  a person, after the attack of mania has passed away, is perfectly calm and collected, but not always; the person would have very uncertain restless eyes, he would not feel after this as he did before—I have often heard such persons say that they have no idea why they have done a thing, and that they were very sorry—another circumstance also which is indicative, is the ferocity with which the attack was made—this was a very ferocious attack and I decidedly consider the ferocity an element in the consideration.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a scaffolder, of 3, Payne, Place, Kentish Town—I, have known Murphy fourteen, or fifteen years, he has always been a very good natured peaceable, fellow—I was working with him at the Becton gas works when he had this attack—it was thought to be sunstroke at the-time—he was very ill and was away from work a fortnight or three weeks—that is five years ago—I do know what month at was in but it was in the summer time, and in hot weather—I was working with him two years ago at. Rottingdean; near Brighton, when he was very strange, and on one occasion he said he did not care whether he lived or died, and walked out of the house—I followed him and he walked up and down the cliff close to the edge—I caught hold of him and said "Look here Mike, come home with me."—he was very strange and would not answer any questions he was sober—when I pulled him back he did not try to resist me, he went quietly with me—I have frequently observed him strange at other times when he has been perfectly sober—I agree in what the last witness said that he could not not drink much, before he was inebriated—I did not see—anything of him about Wednesday, the 28th—I had not seen him for twelve months, till last Saturday in prison.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> After the sunstroke he came back, to his work and con<lb></lb>ducted himself in the usual way—that was not for <hi rend="italic">two</hi> or three years—he was at work at Becton after that about two years, he was not dismissed or anything of that sort, but he behaved himself very extraordinarily, and we thought he was going wrong—he stayed two or three years after the sunstroke, and—I was there all the time—he did not very frequently take too much—I know no reason for his going out on the cliff in that way, he had no misfortune that I am aware of—I was lodging with him at that time—I dodged with him six or seven months, although he was so very strange, because I knew him.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">THE JURY</hi>. I saw him during the three weeks that he was absent from his work from the sunstroke—he was lodging in Denmark Terrace, but he lodged in three or four different places on the Terrace—I did not visit him while he had the sunstroke, but I saw him—he was ill, but was not confined to his bed, he was walking in the street—there were no other instances of sunstroke—I had never seen a case of sunstroke before—he was not tipsy, he had not been drinking at all—I know that because he was working with us—he had no medical attendant I believe.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. STRAIGHT</hi>. He had been at work from 6 o'clook that morning—if he had had anything to drink which made him drunk. I should have observed it—I am perfectly sure—he was sober, as sure as I am standing in this witness-box.</p>

I do not believe he was staying with me at the time he had the sunstroke, he lodged at two or three places on the Terrace, and there are forty-seven houses—I did not hear of the sunstroke at the time, but I heard it since—I did not see much of him when-he-was living at the other places in Denmark Terrace;—I never saw anything the matter with him when he lodged with me—he was a little given to drinking at times, and he was rather strange after drink; for a day or two, from the after effects of it—he seemed very strange in his head.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with Mr. Humphreys, of Weston-street, Battle-bridge. On the 27th of July I missed from my room a hat, a jacket, a waistcoat, and trowsers—they were there at six o'clock in the morning,</p>

               <p>when I went to market—when I went home to dinner, my hat was on the top of the cupboard, and when I went home at night, they were all gone—I met the prisoner next day, and he asked if I had lost any thing—I said, "Yes"—he said it would serve them right if I had them both taken up—I afterwards gave him into custody—he denied the charge, and said he had not sold the hat, but when the young man who bought it came to the station-house, he said he had bought the hat of George Powell.</p>

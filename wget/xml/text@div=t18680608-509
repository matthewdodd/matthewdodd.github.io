On Saturday night, 22nd May, I was in the Oak, when the prisoners came in—I heard a dispute about a bad florin—after they went out, I and another person followed them—when they had got a little way I saw them stoop down near some railings; they then went on again—I went to the place and found a packet of coin; there were three florins wrapped in tissue paper—I gave the prisoners into custody, and went back to the Oak with them and the constable—the prisoners said they knew nothing at all about it—I gave the coins to the constable.</p>

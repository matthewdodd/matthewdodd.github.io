            's in Thieving-lane , (whether it was his wife or no I could not tell) I enquired for him by the name of Probert and described him, and they said there was one Mason lodged there that belonged to the army. I heard he had entered into the Duke's regiment, went to the Corporal of the guard at St. James's, and found he was sick in the Infirmary. I had liberty to go up and found him lying in a miserable state of health. I heard there was a woman came to him who called herself his sister, and she was to be there the next day. I waited to see her, and found she was the Prisoner; I enquired at Lewis White's whether they had seen any calico shirts, and in particular, the counterpane: they informed me where the washerwoman lived, I went to her, and she said she had washed such a thing; 'tis an India Pallampore. Upon this information I got a warrant to search Mr. Smith's a Chandler's shop in opposition [opposite] to the Blue Boar's-head in Denmark-court. I searched the house and found 5 towels and a table cloth. I got a warrant to apprehend the Prisoner; the Wednesday following I saw her at Mr. Townsend's she said there her husband (Mr. Probert) as she called him had sold 2 table cloths, some towels and the counterpane to this Mrs. Smith for 13 s. or 13 s. 6 d and she said she had sold the silver spoons herself.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Pray Sir, did I sell the things?</p>
               <p>Vaughan. There is evidence that you sold them.</p>
               <p>Smith. I bought these things of her and her husband as she calls him, and she said she was offered 11 s. for them at the Star Tavern in the Strand; that her mother bought that counterpane of an upholsterer and gave a guinea for it. I gave them 13 s. for them, and I heard no more of them till Mr. Vaughan came with a warrant.</p>

The Prisoner kept a house in Vine Court, I know she had a great many good things; she offered these things to Mrs. Wood at the Star Tavern , and she would give but 11 s. for them, and Mrs. Smith gave her 13 s. - her husband was with her at that time. I have known Mrs. Mason two years, I lodged in her house, and take her to be a very honest person; they then went as man and wife.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not you give the money into my husband's own hand?</p>

               <p>With whom? - Mr. Thornton.</p>
               <p>Who did you live with on the 15th of June last? - (No answer.)</p>
               <p>Why do not you answer the question, woman; who did you live with on the 15th of June last? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Did you ever rent a house in your life? - No, Sir; I rented a room at Mr. Murphy's, in Blue Anchor-court.</p>
               <p>Did Murphy live in the house? - She did not live in my house.</p>
               <p>Did she live in any other part of that house? - No.</p>
               <p>Where did she live? - She lived in the top of the court.</p>
               <p>What part of the house was your room in: how many rooms did the house consist of? - Only one.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoners Counsel. How long had Mrs. Murphy had you out of service? - I had been out of place about a fortnight.</p>
               <p>She received the money you got, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179007070016"></xptr>furnished you this place to receive men in: we all know Mrs. Murphy very well? - I only paid half-a-crown a week for the room.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you pay her any thing else in the course of the week? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>How many houses were there consisting of one room each only? - It was not only one room.</p>
               <p>Who rented the other? - There was no other room in my part, but my room.</p>
               <p>How many rooms were there in the whole? - It was only one.</p>
               <p>Had you a bed in that room? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you one door or two? - Two doors: there was an entry: my room was on the right hand side, one pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, you are trying these two prisoners for their lives; the consequence of which is, that if they are convicted there will be eighty pounds reward: I cannot make out that she has any thing like a dwelling-house.</p>
               <p>Did you lose any thing? - I lost a pair of stays.</p>
               <p>When? - The 15th of last month, which was Tuesday last.</p>
               <p>Where were they taken from? - Out of my room, off the tea table; between eleven and twelve in the night.</p>
               <p>How do you know they were taken at that time? - Because I went to light my candle.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Here is her own information; she says she rents a room of Mrs. Murphy, in Blue Anchor-yard.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you been abed before that time? - No.</p>
               <p>What time did you come into that house: where had you been? - To see my friends: my stays were on the table: I was back by ten.</p>
               <p>Where were you from ten till eleven? - I sat at the front door, out in the street, at Mrs. Murphy's, at the green stall; that was not in the court.</p>
               <p>Who took your stays away? - I cannot tell who it was; I did not see them; I have seen the stays since; I swore to them at the justice's.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You have been one of Mrs. Murphy's girls about three weeks? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long have you been acquainted with Mr. Dawson, the thief-taker? - I did not know any thing of him; but I tried some how or other.</p>
               <p>When did Dawson tell you to swear that you rented a house? - He did not tell me to swear it.</p>
               <p>Who told you? - Nobody.</p>
               <p>Who told you there would be eighty pounds to be divided among you, if you hanged these girls? - Nobody.</p>
               <p>These girls lived near you? - Yes, in the same court.</p>
               <p>Who was the man that had been in the room with you that evening, that stole the three shillings and six-pence? - There was no man stole three shillings and six-pence.</p>
               <p>Did you never say that a man had lain with you that night, who had robbed you of three shillings and six-pence? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Did you, or did you not? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>You never said so to any body? - No.</p>
               <p>One of these girls was standing with you at the door, when you left your stays on the table? - Yes,

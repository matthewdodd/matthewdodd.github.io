On Friday night the 5th of May, having been taking leave of two or three acquaintances who were going to sea, I was going home to Hayen-street near Burlington-street, at between eleven and twelve o'clock. I met a watchman, I asked him if he could take me to any private lodging where I could lodge for a night, for I knew it was past the hour of my getting in at home? The watchman said he could; he took me to the prisoner at the bar, she lodged in <placeName id="t17800510-38-crimeloc207">Church-alley, between Fetter-lane and Chancery-lane</placeName>

               <p>Did you ask for a lady to lodge with you or only for a lodging? - Only for a lodging for that night.</p>
               <p>Was you drunk or sober? - I was not quite sober; the prisoner was standing a little way from the door without an hat. I found there was a correspondence between the watchman and she by his conversation; his name is Tankard. She lit a candle and took me into an apartment. I thought it was a private house, and that she was the mistress of it; it was a ground floor which has formerly been a kitchen; the watchman desired me to give him something for leading me there. I had four guineas in my pocket. I pulled one out and asked her if I could trust the watchman with that guinea? She said yes, he was a very honest man; he was gone some time to get change, and when he came back he brought, I believe, the quantity of half a pint of rum for him and she to drink together. I asked her to give the watchman sixpence or a shilling; I had not the change till the next morning, and then there were three shillings short.</p>
               <p>And lay alone? - Yes, all night; I had no communication with the woman, nor had I any thoughts of the kind. I awaked between four and five, as near as I could guess, and found I had been robbed. I had not been awake above ten minutes before the mistress of the house came in; she saw me, and saw I was a stranger. She said, where is the lady that brought you in here last night? I said I did not know, I wish I did. She said she hoped nothing was the matter. I said yes, she has taken three guineas out of my pocket and my watch; she pursued her directly into Chancery-lane and there she was taken; She brought her back to me; and I saw the prisoner pull my knee buckles out of her pocket and throw them on the bed; she handed the shoe buckles to another woman and that woman gave them to me. She swore and blasted herself, as<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178005100051"></xptr>much as ever I heard a sailor in my life time, that she had none of my money. I sent for the constable; when he was coming in she desired me to hold fast the door that he might not come in, and she would give me what she had got; she laid the seventeen and sixpence and the halfpence all together upon the table; she then made a pretence to take up the chamber pot from the side of the bed and go to the other side where the curtain was drawn; there I saw her leave a guinea; then I opened the door and let Mr.

               <p>I lodge in the house up one pair of stairs. I got up between five and six o'clock; I went into the room to the prosecutor. He said he had been robbed of his watch and money. I said I was very sorry for it, for though the landlady had unfortunate women in the house she never encouraged thieving. I went by the gentleman's desire to the pawnbroker's, that if she should happen to come there they might stop her. In the interim, the landlady went to Mr. Flemings's the pawnbroker's to stop her; a woman who lives in the court followed her and said, she has dropped a watch. I think she said she picked it up; I did not see the watch but saw the chain, and I saw the prisoner have two guineas and some silver in a nutmeg-grater, which the woman who picked the watch up afterwards shewed me; she had given her the money. I said, she had better give it the gentleman again; when the money was produced from that woman to her again, I saw her put one guinea in her mouth; afterwards<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178005100052"></xptr>she took it out of her mouth and put it up her petticoats.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>This girl is a woman of the town, as well as myself; I went down to buy a gown; this gentleman followed me with his face all over blood; he insisted upon following me home. I ran up different places to drop him, because he was so deep in liquor; he followed me till at last I got to my own door; he insisted upon going with me, and lying with me. I said, I did not choose he should, he being so much in liquor; I said there was the bed, if he chose to lie in it he was welcome; he insisted upon my taking two guineas; he desired me to send a watchman for some liquor; I called Mr. Tankard to the house; he fetched the liquor; he drank the liquor and went into bed; he insisted upon my coming to bed, which I would not do. I did not see the watch. I came back in the morning in half an hour and sat down in a chair till half an hour after five, then I went out to the pawnbroker's, having some little money in my pocket, besides the gentleman's two guineas; I released a jacket and petticoat; when I came in the landlady laid hold of me and said I had robbed the gentleman; as I came along the court it was very full of people; there was a person, who keeps a house in the court, came in and laid a watch in my window and said it was his watch; those two young women who stood in the entry were never in my room; they are very desperate women and well known for false swearing, and Mr. Payne is a very particular acquaintance of their's; the gentleman gave me a couple of guineas; my door was open, so I cannot tell who might come in to rob him, or who might rob him before I came in. My landlady fetched the constable; she called me on one side and side, if I would give her part of the money she would clear me. I said I had not robbed him, therefore I could not give her any; Mr. Payne took me by the neck, after he had almost strangled me he let me loose; he then found a guinea under the paper upon the table; it is very possible that the gentleman might lay it there before he went to bed. I could have some gentlemen here to speak to my character, but I did choose to scandalize my relations.</p>

               <p>I am coachman to Mrs. La Hoope. On Saturday, Monday, and Tuesday, the prisoner at the bar came to me into the stable, and said to me, Mr. Hall is going to send for your horses very early on the Thursday, that they were to go upon a job, which he (the prisoner) was to drive, for a single gentleman who came from the West-Indies, and who had had a job of Mr. Hall three years before he went to the West-Indies; that he was to have 9 s. a week of Mr. Hall, and 10 s. 6 d. a week board-wages; and to have two suits of livery; this passed on the Saturday: on the Monday following he told me Mr. Hall had not taken any stables yet, but he would take some soon; he wanted me to buy him a coach-dog; I really thought he was in Mr. Hall's service; I saw him next morning, about six or seven; he told me Mr. Hall had sent him for those horses; I told him I would give them a feed of corn before they set off; I asked him if he would have a horse-cloth upon each horse; he said no; Mr. Hall lives in Hamilton-street, Piccadilly; I saw him turn up the road to London; I told him I had half a mind to go to town with him; he said there was no occasion for that, Mr. Hall would be sure to send the horses in time; I delivered the horses, but did not receive any in exchange; I should not have delivered them, if I had not thought he had been employed and sent by Mr. Hall.</p>

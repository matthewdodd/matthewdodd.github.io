Mr. Serjeant did some time ago live in the house that I lived in, and he used to come and demand money of me; he said I was indebted to him 48 s. 6 d. I desired to know for what; he said, I knew very well. I desired a bill of him; he said we<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174405100038"></xptr> attornies never make any bills; then said I, how should I know what to pay you?</p>
               <p>Q. Is he a sworn attorney?</p>
               <p>Cooke. I cannot tell that, I asked Summers for the money for the note. He said he had paid money enough already - Summers was prosecuted at my suit upon this note, and the Prisoner was my attorney.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the note delivered back to you?</p>
               <p>Cooke. Yes; and the Prisoner came to me for 48 s. 6 d. I said I had paid a great deal of money upon the prosecution of that note, and that the note was of no signification to me; and Serjeant said it would be of signification to him, and so he arrested me for the note.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he take the note from you?</p>
               <p>Cooke. He took the note off my counter, and arrested me for it again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he take it before your face?</p>
               <p>Cooke. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he arrest you upon this very note?</p>
               <p>Cooke. He arrested me for three guineas, and the man (Summers) had paid him all the money but 8 s. 6 d. - I said the note is of no signification to me as the man who owes the money is come out of goal.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he take the note in your presence?</p>
               <p>Cooke. He took it up off the counter, and carried it away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever deny taking the note?</p>
               <p>Cooke. I cannot say that he did. <rs id="t17440510-33-verdict180" type="verdictDescription">

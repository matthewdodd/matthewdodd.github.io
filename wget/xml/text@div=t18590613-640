                  </hi>. I am managing clerk to Mr. Joseph Lilley, a solicitor in Blackman-street, Southwark—the prisoner had been formerly in Mr. Lilley's employ for two years and a half—he left of his own accord to go to his uncle in the country—he was afterwards received back in a temporary way, and continued about twelve months—he was then discharged by Mr. Lilley—he afterwards obtained a situation in Mr. Pritchard's office, the High Bailiff of Southwark—On the morning of 13th May, I proceeded to my office as usual—there are two entrances to it; one in Blackman-street, and the other in Trinity-street—I was standing at the side entrance in Trinity-street at a quarter before 10 o'clock in the morning—while there, I observed the prisoner turning the corner and coming towards our door, I observed he had something in his right hand wrapped in brown paper—on seeing me he withdrew out of sight—in a minute or two afterwards I rang the bell and went into my office—I had taken my seat about a minute when I heard a ring at the bell, and a clerk who was present opened the door; and within a minute the prisoner entered the room and coming within half a yard of me, he produced a knife which had been wrapped in brown paper—he was endeavouring to get the knife out of the paper—the paper came off and he produced the knife; and he held it up towards me with the blade pointed towards my head—he exclaimed, "You have ruined me, you have been my ruin"—and imagining he was about piercing me with the knife, I withdrew to the other end of the table—he flourished his arm about and appeared to me to be very nervous, and, on observing that, I made towards him and seized his arm and the knife fell to the ground—I picked up the knife and placed it in my drawer—I then asked the prisoner what he meant, and if he intended to murder me—he said, "Yes I did;" and I think he added, "I wish I had had strength to have done it"—I sent for a policeman who took him in custody—he said to the policeman that he wished he had murdered me, that he came there to murder me, and he wished he had done it.</p>

I am in the employ of Mr. Shoesmith, an ironmonger in Great Dover-road—on 13th May the prisoner came to our shop a little before 10 o'clock in the morning—he asked to be served with a knife suitable for killing a pig—I told him I was afraid we had no knife to suit him for that purpose; it was a peculiar kind of cutlery that we did not keep—I showed him several kinds of knives, which did not suit him—I then brought him out some bread knives, one of which he selected; but he said it was not sharp enough, would I sharpen it up for him—I sharpened it, and he took it in his hand and said, "It will do"—I wrapped it in paper and gave it him—this is the knife—I had made it very sharp indeed—it was sharp enough for any purpose—I did not notice anything peculiar in the prisoner's manner, if I had, I should not have served him with a knife of this kind.</p>

                  </hi>. I am surgeon of this gaol—my attention was called to the prisoner when he first came here—I made a careful examina<lb></lb>tion of him—he was suffering under great nervous weakness, which is always attended with a corresponding weakness of mind—it is always associated more or less with mental weakness—I observed his walking, and had conver<lb></lb>sation with him—I consider him a person of unsound mind.</p>

Q.</hi> How long have you observed him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> From Tues<lb></lb>day week—I saw him every day for perhaps a quarter of an hour, and had conversation with him—I have formed my judgment from what I have seen myself—supposing he was suffering from disease, I should think that would affect the sensual nerves of the brain—I have had some experience with per<lb></lb>sons of unsound mind.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and reside at Peckham—the prisoner consulted me occasionally for about nine months for debility of body and extreme irritability of the nervous system—his health appeared to me to be in a shaking state, and his nervous system was irritative and imaginative—the history he gave me led me to imagine that he had brought it on himself by his own misconduct—during the time that I had any com<lb></lb>munication with him I did not perceive any want of reason—I saw him about once in a fortnight—I don't think his intellect was at all affected—he judged correctly from wrong premises—in my judgment he knew right from wrong perfectly—it appeared to me that the nervous system was affected.</p>

               <p>I am a waterman belonging to the Custom-house, to the inspectors on that day, on Saturday evening I locked the door, and made it fast, it was last Saturday was four weeks, it might be the 17th of September; it was about eight when I left the skiff, on the Monday following I found that some oars had been lost between ten and eleven.</p>
               <p>What oars were missing? - Oars marked one and two; on Monday morning I missed the oars, and I enquired at several pair of stairs for them; they were fastened to the boat by a chain, and I pulled at the lock to see if it was fast.</p>
               <p>Whose boat was this? - Mr. Roberts's.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. And if you lose any, you are answerable to Mr. Roberts for his oars? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Do you know the young man? - I do not.</p>

               <p>I am a constable; about three weeks ago I went to the prisoner's, there I found a pair of oars.</p>
               <p>Did you go to search for these oars? - Not particularly for them.</p>
               <p>How came you to take them? - I had them described; I found them in the prisoner's yard; there is a sort of pent-house goes over them; the house is in a place called Brewer's Yard, Shadwell, about forty yards off the river; these are the oars that I found there; they were at the top of the pent-house; they were put over the necessary, the broad arrow is plain upon them; they laid as all watermen lay their oars; not covered at all; I found them on the 4th of October; but I had information from Mr. Wall three or four days before.</p>
               <p>You went there and he was sent for? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was he sent for or not? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Who came back with him? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Did not you see the little girl that assists in the family come back with him? - I do not recollect it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Roberts's name I see now is upon these cars, burnt in? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He is one of the greatest boat builders in town? - I believe he is.</p>
               <p>To Selby. Are these the oars that you left in the house that night? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Jury. Were they in the same state when they were lost as they now are? - There was none of this plaining then.</p>
               <p>Is the plaining over the name? - Yes.</p>
               <p>(The oars deposed to by Mr. Roberts.)</p>
               <p>Mr Garrow. Now as to that mark at the further end of the oars may it not have been worked out? - No Sir, it is plained out.</p>
               <p>Cole. He said he found these oars in the river, and brought them home.</p>
               <p>Did he not say he expected them to be advertised? - No.</p>
               <p>Did not the prisoner say at the Justice's that he had a witness that saw him pick them up? - I did not hear that, I heard the Justice say, if he had any witnesses for his defence they were to come for that to another court, but I did not see any witness there.</p>

               <p>I had a fare about five at King James's Stairs up to Billingsgate, I went over to Horsleydown, and between Wapping Old Stairs and Union-stairs, a man called sculler, and these oars lay, I picked them up and carried them home; at my third hearing I found this man who was then just going to the West Indies, and I told the Justice so.</p>
               <p>What is the man's name that saw you pick them up? - He is a foreigner and belongs to Norway, I do not know his name, it was a very odd name, he is gone to the West Indies in a ship named the Hope;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178510190045"></xptr> when the girl came and fetched me, she said that four runners wanted me, I came home directly, they asked me whose these oars were, I told them they were mine till I got an owner, says he, I have got an owner, and I will send you away for this.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

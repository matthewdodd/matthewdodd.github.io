                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176302230020"></xptr>Q. How do you know what was done when you was asleep?</p>
               <p>Benn. I have a witness here that saw her take it out.</p>
               <p>Q. What had she to do in your bed room?</p>
               <p>Benn. It was not in my room, it was done in the taphouse, in the house where I lodge.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you into her company?</p>
               <p>Benn. I happened to be a little in liquor; she kept company along with me, as a company keeper.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you kept company together?</p>
               <p>Benn. To the best of my knowledge 9 or 10 weeks; we lived together in the same manner as man and wife.</p>
               <p>Court. Now you find her expensive you are tired of her.</p>
               <p>Benn. If she had not ran away from me I would not have prosecuted her.</p>
               <p>Court. Then it is not for the sake of the 16 guineas that you prosecute, but because she ran away from you.</p>
               <p>Benn. Sixteen guineas is a good deal of money too, I should like to have the spending of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who would you spend it upon?</p>
               <p>Benn. I do not believe I should spend it all on her.</p>
               <p>Q. Who bought the provision, you or she?</p>
               <p>Benn. I always paid for provision; I would not have trusted her if I had not been in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of her after she got it?</p>
               <p>Benn. She went out of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she return again?</p>
               <p>Benn. Yes, she came in again, and lay with me that night, and in the morning she went out, and I did not see her again till Tuesday.</p>

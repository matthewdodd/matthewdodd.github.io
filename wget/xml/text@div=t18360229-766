                  </hi>. I keep a masquerade-warehouse, and am a tailor in holywell-street, Strand. On the 23rd of last month, I was engaged with a lady and gentleman in my shop, about six o'clock in the evening, a little did named Davess ran in and said a man had taken a cloak off my door, and</p>

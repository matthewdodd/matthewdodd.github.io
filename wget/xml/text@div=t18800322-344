                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector M</hi>). I went to 19, Bermondsey Street, about 7.30 on the 24th February in consequence of information I received—it is a beerhouse—Mulcahey is the landlady—I said to her, "I have come to see you about some silver"—she said, "Yes"—I said, "I should like to see it," and she produced from a cupboard in the bar all these articles, except this spoon, tied up in a handkerchief—I said, "How did you come by them?"—she pointed to Hannen, who was sitting in the bar, and said, "He brought them here this afternoon, and said he found them; I let him have 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of beer on them; I went to a watch-maker's down the street to sell them"—Hennen could not hear the conversation—I called him into the room and said, "How do you account for the possession of these things?"—he said, "I was in the Strand this afternoon, or about the middle of the day, at the corner of a court where they are pulling down some buildings; there was some strew; I went to wipe my boots, and these things lay underneath; I brought them home, thinking that a reward might be offered for them"—I asked Mulcahey if she had any more—she went into the bar, and said "Yes, I have one more spoon," and produced the other spoon—she said, "He gave me that for my own use," meaning Hannen—I took them into custody—the things were afterwards identified.</p>

On Wednesday, the 23rd of December, about twenty minutes past seven o'clock, Burgess, my lodger, went out, and in three or four minutes I heard the shop door unlocked, and saw the reflection of a light through the bottom of the door of my bed-room, which is next the shop - I immediately got up, opened the bedroom window, and saw the prisoner running away from the door with a whip in his hand; he was just shutting the shop door too at the time - I did not call to him; as soon as I found out where he lived I went, and found the whip on his premises - that was on the same day; as soon as my lodger came home I went and inquired after him, and went with one McKenzie to his lodgings, about half-past nine o'clock in the morning; he was in bed there -I did not see him, but an old lady gave up the whip; I knew it to be the one I had seen in his hand by a particular mark - I had very few of them at that time; it was not my make - it was delivered to McKenzie, who gave it to Hughes; I did not see the prisoner in the house at that time - I inquired of the neighbours for his house; the whip is worth 4s. 6d.; I got a warrant, and searched his house - there was another charge against him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you mean to swear you have any other charge against him? A. No- I never had any quarrel with him.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, did you never ask him not to take notice if you moved any goods out in the night? A. Never - that I swear; I did not call after him, as I did not know but my lodger might have let him have a whip from the shop, as he has done so to other people, and told me afterwards; I have been threatened with an execution for rent - the prisoner came to me tipsy in the evening; I had been to his house then, and got the whip.</p>
               <p>Q. If he was in bed, why not take him? A. I had never been in such a case before, and did not know any thing about it; his wife called at my house in the evening when I was out - when he came he said, "This is a strange thing your accusing me with the whip;" I told him the Watch Committee wished me to prosecute him - they had been to me about it; I did not then give him in charge, as I knew nothing about it - he was taken very soon after; a constable was sent for - I did not send for one; he was allowed to go from my house - I went to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183001140012"></xptr>the office with him and the officer; he went willingly - the office was shut, and he returned home; I believe he was on duty next night - I went to the office next day, and saw him and Hughes together on the road going to the office; I swear I found the same whip as I saw him with - I saw the top of it; any one seeing it would know it again - there is a button on the bottom of it; I could not see that as he carried it - I swear it is mine; I cannot say I could identify it when I saw it out of window, but he brought it out of my shop.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you seen that whip the night before? A. Yes, and missed it directly I came down stairs; I swear it is the one I lost.</p>

             HUGHES I am a constable of St. Luke, Chelsea. I went by desire of the Watch Committee with the prosecutor to the house of McKenzie, who gave me this whip; we then went to the prisoner's house, in Frances-street, Chelsea, with the whip - his wife called him in out of the yard; I told him I had come to inquire about this whip - that there were strong suspicions about it; he replied, "I found it near the saddler's door" - I said it was necessary we should go before a Magistrate to inquire into it; he said he was very willing to do so, and said it was necessary the ostler of the public-house should be with him, to whom he had made a communication respecting two whips and some reins standing up on the mail-coach as it passed in the morning - I sent for the ostler, and we proceeded for an officer to Queen-square, Westminster; we were too late, and next morning we went to Marlborough-street - I told the prisoner to bring the ostler there with the reins, but he said it was of no consequence; he was examined and remanded for a week.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Finding the office shut, you let him go for the night? A. Yes; he went on his duty as usual, and next day came to my house by appointment, about ten o'clock; I was not ready - he went away, and came again; he knew he was charged with stealing a whip - I went to the prosecutor's, and found the prisoner waiting for me to go to the office.</p>
               <p>JOHN BURGESS. I am a labourer, and lodge at Briant's. On Wednesday, the 23rd of December, I went out at twenty minutes past seven o'clock; I shut the door - I opened it with a key, and left it on the spring lock; I drew it after me - I always try it, and am sure it was fast.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you any thing to do with the whip trade? A. No; I never sold whips out of the prosecutor's shop - I have given out harness which has been repaired; I never gave out whips - I have been there when his child has given out an old whip which has been repaired.</p>
               <p>JURY to WILLIAM BRIANT. Q. How could you see him to know him; could you see his face? A. Yes, and he had his lantern.</p>
               <p>Two witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

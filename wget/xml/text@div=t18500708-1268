I am partner with Mr. Picard; the prisoner was in our employ the last thirteen months—it was his duty to collect money and pay it daily to me—he did not pay me 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on 25th May, or the other sum—I recollect Mr. Wilson coming to our place—my partner was there—he said there was an account owing—Mr. Wilson said he had paid it—he came up to the prisoner and accused him of having had the money—the prisoner denied it, and said he had called repeatedly and Mr. Wilson was out, which was the answer he had brought to me before—Mr. Picard went with Mr. Wilson, and I asked the prisoner if there was not something wrong about it—he said yes there was—that was all that passed on that occasion—he came afterwards and said he hoped we would excuse him; he had been sorely pressed by a tailor, and had used the money, but he never intended to defraud us.</p>

He lay upon the floor without any thing under him or upon him, afterwards he had straw: he was removed up stairs the Friday before he died; I never heard him ask his master for a bed; when he was moved up stairs, he was moved into a back room, and there was a little grate and a fire-place there, and the same bag of straw that he had had for the last part of his time below stairs, was carried up stairs for him to lie upon, and a great coat to cover him; when he first got up stairs, he sat himself down in a chair by the fire, and then crawled into the bed; I carried him water-gruel and broth, and the day before he died, I carried him a bit of backed veal, which he ate; he had frequently tea and bread and butter; he groaned almost continually, till he died; my master locked him in: about three in the morning, on the Saturday before he died, he called for water, my master got up and gave him some; Mr. Day called my master up; he was locked in, and my master always locked the door and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177602210034"></xptr> kept the key; I believe it was that no body should go in to give him any thing, when he came down he told my mistress, he had given the nasty dog a good kick.</p>

The Sunday night before he died, he was brought down into the shop again by Mr. Griffiths, who is brother to the prisoner's wife, and by the prisoner himself; he brought down the bag and straw too, because he groaned so much that he disturbed a woman who was lying-in in the next chamber; when Griffiths and my master brought him down, my master scolded him for groaning: there was a little fire in the shop when he was brought down; there always was in the day-time a fire, it was not a cold place; the deceased lay in the shop till Monday morning nine o'clock, and then Griffiths and my master carried him up stairs again: I got up about four in the morning, in order to let my master and Mr. Griffiths out, for Mr. Griffiths was going in the coach to Wells; when they came to the in the coach was gone, and my master and Mr. Griffiths came back again: about nine in the morning when the deceased was sent up stairs again, I was ordered to bring the bag and straw up again in order to lay him above stairs in the manner before: I made a fire for him, and gave him some tea and bread and butter, but he could not eat it: this was the Monday morning before he died: I was sent then to the hospital with a galley-pot, when I returned the deceased was dead.</p>

I came in and found the boy was dead; my master said, he would have a jovial burying of it, and would get drunk upon it; there was no body by when these words were spoke, but my master and Mr. Griffiths, and he said he would buy a coffin and bury him on Tuesday night; then Mr. Fryer rushed in, and insisted upon seeing the body of the deceased, and said, if any body touched him, he would put them all in Newgate. Mr. Evans laid him out: my master knew of his sore legs as soon as he came from Bridewell. Upon Monday the 15th of January there were some plaisters put on his legs, which Mr. Fryer had got from a surgeon: on Sunday the 14th of January my master sent him up into a back garrett, there he cried for cold, and then Mr. Fryer took him into his garret, made fire, and Mrs. Fryer made him some tea and toast; he staid there till the evening, then my master was angry, and sent me and the man to fetch him down; we fetched him down and he was laid in the shop; my master went about to several people to get letters to get him into the hospital; the deceased could not walk at all when he came from Bridewell; he had some meat two or three times; one time he asked for some supper and my master gave him some bread and cheese; he had his cloaths on when he died: it was a warmish shop, but when the boy lay there he had nothing to lay over him; as for myself I had a blanket, a sheet, and a little mattrass.</p>

               <p>I am the wife of the last witness. We lie in a two pair of stairs room, and we have a sore-garret in the prisoner's house. While I was a-bed, on the 14th January, I heard somebody go up stairs about seven in the morning, and come down again: I cannot tell who it was; but I thought I heard Self's voice in the back garret. I heard the boy crying, and I thought I heard Self say, you shall not lie down, for I shall find it out, and will lick you. My husband got up first; for we were both in bed at that time; we heard people going up and coming down stairs. I went up and saw the deceased sitting by the fire in my garret; I asked, how his stockings came to be wet? he said he had been out into the yard in the snow, and his feet got wet: I carried him some tea and bread and butter, which he eat and drank heartily. He asked for some meat: he said his master had never given him any meat since he came from Bridewell, but only water gruel and broth. I carried him some pork and some two-penny. He said, he had had nothing but bread and water in Bridewell, and had lain upon the boards there, and since he came home he had never had his cloaths off, and had no bed to lie upon in the shop. Mr. Park the apothecary's man came to visit me that day; I desired him to send him some plaisters, which he did the same evening. I looked upon his legs; there was a little blister upon one knee, and upon his other leg a large blister, and in pulling down his stockings the stockings had eat in and they tore his flesh away. Self came up in the afternoon and brought him some broth. I said, that was not a time to bring the boy his dinner, for he was very ill, and I had taken care he should have his belly full before that time. His master said, I don't know, I believe he is lazy, though, I dare say, he will eat every drop; and he did eat up all. I told Self of the boy's blisters, and shewed them to him, and I bid him put him into a bed, or he would die. Self said he could not do that, for the boy was lousy; but he would endeavour to get him into the hospital as soon as possible. I told Self I had sent for plaisters to a doctor, and if he would leave the boy with me, I would put him into bed, and dress his legs. He seemed very angry at that, and went down stairs; the deceased begged of me that he might not go down stairs; but after Self and Griffiths were gone down, the journeyman and the apprentice were sent up for him; this was about half after five. I carried the plaisters that night to Self, and desired they might be applied to his legs. I heard him groan upon Sunday the 21st, but never saw him after this Sunday till he died.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a surgeon. I opened the body of the deceased: his principal disorder was in his heels occasioned by the kibes, and the severity of the weather, which numbers of his age were at that time and are still subject to; there are numbers that are not yet well. His feet were quite ulcerated, and the toes quite mortified.</p>
               <p>What do you think these ulcers in the ancles proceeded from? - I am persuaded from the severity of the weather, what is commonly called kibes and chillblains.</p>
               <p>From chillblains ill managed? - Yes, or more likely not managed at all.</p>
               <p>Were there any sores upon his shoulders? - There was a slight bruise.</p>
               <p>What did that proceed from? - It might be from lying hard, or any accident; but the bruise upon his shoulder did not appear to me to be the least dangerous, or any thing connected with his death. Upon opening him I found nourishment in his stomach and bowels near as much as I should have expected in one in his condition. When a mortification begins we generally suppose it prevents people from eating. I don't think he was starved to death; his flesh was much emaciated, but that must be the case from the mortification.</p>
               <p>You have heard the whole evidence that has been given; now taking this lad in the condition<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177602210036"></xptr> he is proved to have been in when he came home from Bridewell, supposing due and proper care had been taken of him, and proper food had been given him, Do you believe, from the judgment that you form upon the whole of the evidence, that he might have been recovered? - Most probably; but there is no certainty, for it depends upon how far the disease was gone before he came from Bridewell. Upon the whole, it appears to me to have begun in Bridewell; it would increase faster in Bridewell than it would after he came home, because his food at Bridewell was bread and water, which would greatly emaciate his blood, and he lay in a room upon the floor where there had been no fire, whereas after he came home, though he had no bed to lie upon, yet he lay in what the apprentice calls a warmish room, in which there was always a fire kept in the day-time, and after he came home he certainly had a better diet than he had in Bridewell; suffering him to keep his worsted stockings on must have contributed very much to the increase of his disorder; I think his death was occasioned probably by his ill treatment both in Bridewell and after he came home. This disorder has been very frequent upon account of the hard weather; I have had a number of patients under my care, and not one who has been properly treated has died; but if any one of those I attended had lain but a single night in a garret or Bridewell, they might have been frost bitten, which might have brought on a mortification, and they might have died. I think the whole blood of this boy might be emaciated; the blood might have been made so thin by feeding upon bread and water, and lying in Bridewell, that he never could recover afterwards. Mr. Self was so solicitous for the preservation of this boy, that he did not only come once, but a week before the boy died, and desired I would get a letter to get the boy into the Middlesex hospital. I said I could not get him an in-patient, because I reserved my letter of recommendation for some body else; but could get him admitted an out-patient. He said the boy could not walk; when he said the boy was lame, I did not tell him that there was any danger in the disorder; he did not ask me to come and see the boy.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Park the apothecary. I was present at the opening of the body; I agree with Mr. Spence as to every thing relating to the appearance of the body of the boy. I was with Mrs. Fryer on the 14th of January; she asked me to go up to the garret and see the deceased; he was then sitting before her fire; he pulled down each stocking, and there was a large blister upon each of his legs. I did not pull off his stockings, for his feet smelt very offensively, and his legs were much swelled; there was no care taken of him, so that his stocking struck to his skin, and the stockings were eat into his legs. Mrs. Fryer desired me to send him some plaisters, which I did. After he was laid out there were no appearance of plaisters having been put on his legs.</p>

             M'CONNELLY sworn. I am servant to Mr. Self; I came there three days before the boy returned from Bridewell. He was very bad, he had water-gruel and bread twice that day, and mutton broth once or twice. It was Mrs. Self gave the orders to fetch the boy down upon the 14th of January. Mrs. Fryer asked me to help him down; I said he had gone up, and could come down.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>The boy had been very bad and wicked: I thought I had a right to break him of these tricks, which were robbing me and several other people; I never struck him all the time he was with me. I sent him of an errand on Tuesday, and he ran away, and did not return till Saturday. When he came from Bridewell he was very bad, I gave him necessaries; I thought he had got the goal distemper, that was the reason I did not let him go to bed; I had no design to hurt him; I tried all I could to get him into the hospital. Moss had the itch when he came to me first, he gave us the itch, which with difficulty we were cured of; I was afraid I should get some bad distemper from the deceased, as I had before done.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called several witnesses, who said they never saw him behave ill to his apprentices, and that he always bore a good character.</p>

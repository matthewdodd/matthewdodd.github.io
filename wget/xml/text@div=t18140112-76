On the 3rd of December, the prisoner brought to me the four glasses, he asked me if I knew any body that bought coach-glasses; I asked how he came by them; he said, he found them. I took the glasses to Mr. Gladman, a frame-maker, in Drury-lane; I asked him fifty shillings for them; he bid me two pounds four shillings; I agreed to let him have them, and while he got the change he sent me over to a public-house, in the mean time he got two officers, and had me taken up to Bow-street office. The prisoner was waiting for me at the Queen's Head in Holly-street.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live in Wych-street. On Monday, the 11th of July, about ten minutes before five o'clock, in the afternoon, I was coming from Silver-street, Golden-square into Berwick-street, Soho—I came through Maidenhead-passage, which was my nearest way—I had a bundle containing these articles—I was seized by Mary</p>

               <p>Fleming by my right arm, forcibly dragged into a house, knocked down, and held in the passage, while Reddy stamped on my stomach, and she kept her foot in that position till I was robbed—they treated me very ill—I have been under the doctor's hands ever since—Foy took the bun<lb></lb>dle from me, and handed it across my head to Fleming, who took it into a back room—I saw no more of her till I was allowed to leave the house—they then gave me my empty handkerchief, containing nothing but a bone or so—it had contained 2oz. of tea, and 4 1/2 lbs. of lamb—they gave me my empty handkerchief back and used very bad language, and said, "Now do not go and say we have robbed you"—I said, "Pray let me go, I will not say a word about it," and after using a great deal of bad language, they let me go—this all occurred in the passage—I went to St. Ann's station-house, and gave information—a policeman was sent with me immediately, and within a quarter of an hour after I was released from the house, two of the prisoners were taken, but Fleming, who had my property, was not taken till the Thursday following—I never got my things again.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the day in question, I was applied to by the prosecutrix, at the station—I immediately went with her—she pointed out Foy and Reddy, standing at the door of a bread-shop opposite—she gave them in charge for robbing her, and I took them to the station-house—they said, in going along, that they had nothing to do with it, and that it was another who was concerned in it—I believe it was Reddy who said so—Foy said she would not go, but I said she must go, and she went with me quietly—I took Fleming in Adam and Eve-court, on the Thursday morning—she had deserted our division—she said she was sorry she was in the concern.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carrier, of 3, Tudor-street, Blackfriars. On the afternoon of 12th Nov. I was going out—the wheel of a coal-wagon had come off about ten yards from my door, and there were forty or fifty people there—I could not get past—I stood for a minute—there were two persons behind me, and one in front—I felt something, as if my chain was being put into my waistcoat pocket—I pulled it, and found my watch was gone—I gave an alarm, and a man, who has since been summarily con<lb></lb>victed, started off—I tried to follow—the prisoner caught hold of my collar, and said, "What is the matter?"—I got away, and followed the other—I was sent for to Guildhall on the Wednesday week following, and picked out the prisoner from a number of others in the dock—nobody pointed him out to me.</p>

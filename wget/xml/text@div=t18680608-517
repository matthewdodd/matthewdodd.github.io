                  </hi>. I live at 13, Doris Street, Lambeth, and am a porter out of employ—on 29th May, about 9.20 a. m., I was at the foot of West-minster Bridge by the House of Lords, and saw the prisoner pull off his coat, throw it on the pavement and instantly jump over the parapet into the water—the tide was running out and was very low—I ran to the other side of the arch and gave an alarm, someone in a steam boat threw out a life buoy to him—I hailed a boat, he was picked up, and I walked to the hospital with him and a Thames Policeman, where he remained till the following Tuesday—I told the policeman what I had seen, but the prisoner said nothing that I heard—he was able to walk.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Thames Policeman</hi> 83.) I was near Westminster Bridge in a steam boat, and saw a man in the water, I ran for the life buoy and threw it to him—he just touched it with his fingers; I slipped the boat, got a hitcher and got hold of him with it—the whirl of the arch caused him to be straight up in the water—I got him on board the steamer, he appeared very weak and exhausted—I asked him where he belonged to—he said, after a few minutes'rest, "Covent Garden"—he sat on the deck of the steamer to rest; I blew a whistle for the police galley, and we rowed the prisoner to Westminster Pier, and he walked to Westminster Hospital about 10 minutes afterwards—I said nothing to him or he to me about why he had thrown himself into the water.</p>

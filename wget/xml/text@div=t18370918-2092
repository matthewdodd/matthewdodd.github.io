                  </hi>. I am a watch-maker and jeweller, and live at No. 110, High-street, Whitechapel—I am journeyman to Campbell and Beaton. On Thursday night, the 17th of August, about a quarter after ten o'clock I fastened the door and put out two gas lights—I left the third partly burning—I lighted the candle from the third gas light, and then went into the kitchen and placed the candle on the shelf—I tucked up my sleeves to do a little job, and somebody rung the shop-door bell—I went to answer the door, and the prisoner gave a note into my hand for Mr. Beaton—he came inside and closed the door after him—I looked at the note and observed the writing to be written very badly—the prisoner took from under his right arm a bag, as if to take out some articles, but the bag being so deep he did not succeed the first time—he gathered the bag up into his left hand, and then I asked him "What is it? can't you find it?"—he let go of the part he had gathered up, and stooped himself to the ground—he then drew himself up, and struck me two blows on my head—before the second blow was inflicted, I saw the weapon in his hand over his head—I could not tell what it was, whether it was iron or wood—on receiving the blows I closed on him—he thrust me backwards, with the idea I suppose of getting into the inner part of the shop I swung him half round and threw him on his back—he then seized hold of my stock, either with the idea of strangling me or of raising himself from the floor—he did not raise himself from the floor—I knelt over him, and struck him two or three blows with my fist either on the head, face, or shoulder—I got on my feet and stamped upon him, while he was on the ground—I then fled to the door to open it, but he being so close after my heels I had not time to open it—he secured his bludgeon before that—I did not see it, but I saw him pick up something from the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183709180047"></xptr>
               <p>floor—I could not tell what sort of an instrument it was, it appeared to be taper, thinner at one end than the other—I think it was about twelve inches long—I cannot tell the thickness, the blows were struck so quick—when I got to the door, he attacked me behind the door—I got him down in a <hi rend="italic">two double</hi> position—he tried to inflict a blow on my head—he had still the instrument in his hand—I opened the door with my right hand, and held him tight by his coat or jacket with my left—I got outside and cried "Murder" once—the prisoner wished to make his escape, but I threw him on his back in front of the window, and called for assistance twice, but nobody seemed inclined to rescue him from me—somebody took him from me, but who I cannot tell—I was insensible at the time—how I got on my feet I cannot tell—when I came to myself, I held him by his coat or jacket with others, and drew him into the shop and he was secured—a woman interfered and wished to get him away from us—I did not know the woman—I said to her, no, he should not, he should come in with me—my head bled profusely—I was struck on the crown and back part—a surgeon looked at my head afterwards—I had never seen the prisoner before, to my knowledge—not a word had passed between either of us—there was jewellery and other property in the shop—altogether I received from him three blows on the head, two on the left arm, one on the right arm and three on my left leg—they must have been from the weapon—I bled profusely from the wounds on the head, and I saw the instrument before the second blow was inflicted.</p>

I was standing by the door for an answer, and somebody <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> me in—he was standing inside, and I at the door—the note was given to me to take to Mr. Beaton, by a gentleman a little way from the house—I did not know him—he said, "That is the house," and I rang the bell, and when the prosecutor opened the door, somebody <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> me in—the young man collared me, and put the note down—I picked it up again, as he said he would give me in charge—I had no instrument—he said I gave the instrument to some woman. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>, I am positive he had an instrument; before the second blow was inflicted. I saw it over his head.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>.

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter. I happened to be passing Mr. Beaton's shop soon after ten o'clock on the night in question—as I passed by the door, the witness had got the prisoner, holding him, and calling out for help—there were a great many people about the door—he had hold of him by the skirt of his jacket, and called out for assistance, saying the prisoner wanted to get away from him—I went into the crowd, they were scuffling together at the door—I collared the prisoner and <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> him into the shop with the young man—there was a woman standing by the door and two men—they said it was only two boys fighting—I did not know the women or the men—I pushed the prisoner into the shop—a City patrol was coming by, and we secured him—I observed the prosecutor was bleeding very much at the time, and very much exhausted, he was bleeding very</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183709180048"></xptr>
               <p>much from the wounds in his head—I looked at his head, it was bleeding in three places—somebody tried to pull me back and prevent my assisting him, but I cannot say whether it was a man or the woman—there was something handed over to the woman by the prisoner—it appeared to me about twelve or fourteen inches long—he made a little resistance till he was got into the shop, and then he was very quiet—I could not tell whether the weapon was wood or iron.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. There was no woman, nor any man, before you and the officer laid hold of me. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>, Yes, I saw the woman there at the time, and there were a great many people round the door.</p>

I passed the shop on the night in question about a quarter after ten o'clock—there was a quantity of people round the door—I went into the shop, and saw the prisoner standing there—the prosecutor was in a fainting state apparently from the loss of blood—he seemed to have lost a deal of blood—I looked at his wounds, but there was so much hair I could not see them—he was bleeding from the back and side of his head—I did not see any weapon—I looked about the shop, but could not find any—I took possession of the prisoner, and searched him in the shop—I found a note, addressed to Mr. Beaton, in his right hand trowsers pocket, a small pocket-knife in his waistcoat-pocket, and a bag lying at his feet, which he said was his, and he used it to put apples in—he did not give any account of his way of life, and would not state where he lived at the station-house.</p>

I was passing by the house on the 17th of August, between ten and eleven o'clock, and saw several people collected round Mr. Beaton's door—I observed the prisoner and prosecutor struggling together on the ground opposite the shop door—the prosecutor was calling out for assistance—I looked round to see for a policeman, but could not see one—I said I was an officer and would take the prisoner in charge myself—the prosecutor said he wished I would—I got past the crowd and got to the prisoner—I took him into the shop, shut the door, and kept him till two policemen arrived, and then delivered him over to the—the other man (Blorie) might have got hold of him at the moment I did—he assisted me—the prosecutor stated in the prisoner's presence, that he came with a note, and presented it—that he came into the shop, closed the door, and said he had some articles to leave for Mr. Beaton, and began to feel in the bag for the articles, that in rising he had some sort of instrument, and struck him over the head—the prisoner said nothing in his defence, but that Mr. Beaton's young man struck him first.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live at No. 12, Mount-place, White chapel-road. I was called to see the prosecutor—he came down to me about eleven o'clock the same night—I examined his head, and found three wounds in the head—they appeared contused wounds, as if done with a blunt instrument, not with a sharp cutting instrument—they appeared rather severe blows; one in particular, on the front part of the head—it appeared to be deep, but I could not probe it—he appeared to have lost a good deal of blood, and was very faint when he came to me—that might</p>

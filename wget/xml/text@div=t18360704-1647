On the morning of the 25th of June, two young women came into the shop—the prisoner showed them some shawls and ribbons—I observed they had a parcel in their hand folded in paper, as a parcel would be made up in the shop—I followed them out and spoke to them, and about half an hour after the prisoner was called in, and Mr. Bosle charged him with not accounting for the money he had taken</p>

                  </hi>. I am a City policeman. The prisoner was given into my charge by Mr. Boyle, about half-past ten o'clock, for having sold a shawl and not accounted for the money—a parcel of shawls were taken down in my presence and the moment they were taken off the shelf, I heard something jink inside it—I opened it, and took out half-a-crown and two shillings—I went back and showed them to Mr. Boyle—it was inside the wrapper of the shawls, on the second shelf from the counter—it seemed to he placed in carelessly—it fell the moment it moved—the shawls were not tied up as they generally are, but the string merely thrown across—there was</p>

               <p>nothing to prevent a person slipping the money into the wrapper without taking the shawls down, for it was not tied up tight—any body might have slipped the money within the wrapper.</p>

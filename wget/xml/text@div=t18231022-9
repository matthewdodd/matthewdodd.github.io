On Sunday, the 1st of September, I saw my husband lock his watch up in a chest of drawers in the front kitchen; it was a gold hunter. The prisoner left next day, and on Wednesday, about four o'clock, I missed the watch; she had called on Tuesday for her clothes, and was there on Wednesday, and said she had heard of a situation in Montague-square. I had left the keys in the drawers for three hours on Monday. She called again on Saturday, and was detained.</p>

            , a pawnbroker, of Tottenham Court-road. On Thursday, the 25th of September, about half-past one o'clock, the prisoner pawned this watch - she said it was for Mrs. Harrison, No. 49, Upper Thornaugh-street; she formerly lived servant with her. She asked 4 l. on it, which I gave her, and would have advanced 8 l., for it is worth 10 l. I am sure she is the woman.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I unfortuneately engaged in this situation. The witness had a good character of me, from Bury-street, St. James. I found this a house of ill-fame, and told her I would have her severly punished for hiring me - she and three women came down and ill-treated me. I was obliged to lock myself up in my room all night, and left them next morning, called afterwards for my clothes, and on Wednesday called for 3 s. they owed me, and was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>A letter was here read, which the prisoner had addressed to the prosecutrix - it contained the most revolting expressions, and desired her to produce four women upon the trial, who were in the house at the time the prisoner left.</p>

             re-examined. I have lived in the house eleven years, and pay 55 l. a year, rent - it is not a bad house. I am above fifty years old, and live with my husband. The prisoner's account is very false - I do not keep a bad house. Nobody lives there but a gentleman and lady, who I believe to be married; they are quite respectable people. I received a letter like the one read, about a week ago; I owed her nothing - I paid her on Monday. The persons named in the letter formerly lived with me; they are all quite respectable, and had nothing to do with this matter.</p>

               <p>Mr. Sylvester. It has not been very usual to object to questions before they are heard; all I desired was, that the witness for the Crown, who is now sworn, might tell her own story, without being interrupted by me or that gentleman.</p>

            . I do not see myself the impropriety of that question, because what that gentleman alledged last night in the case of Mrs. Rudd, with respect to the evidence of Mrs. Perreau, the Court refused to receive her evidence, because she thought the consequence would be, that her husband would receive mercy; and if this woman had now said, that the consequence of this man's conviction would be that her husband would receive mercy, it would have been material.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. I believe the law is, that it cannot go to the competency of a witness; nor do I believe in that case that the Court refused Mrs. Perreau on that; I believe it was put to Mr. Bearcroft, whether he chose to examine her upon it or not.</p>
               <p>Court. If it went to her credit, the question was proper.</p>

            , because he was under an honorary consideration to pay costs, not a compulsory one.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Was you never in the custody of an officer before this time? - No.</p>
               <p>Never for receiving stolen goods? - I never did receive any stolen goods; there is several of the name.</p>
               <p>And you neither had paid for these things, nor had the three guineas to pay for them? - No, not quite.</p>
               <p>Pray Mrs. Levy, I am desired to ask you another question, give a serious answer upon your oath; has not your husband very recently been in custody for putting off bad guineas? - No, not bad guineas.</p>
               <p>For some offence about coining? - No, Sir, I will tell you; this was the second time that this man came; the first of this man's coming to me, he came with half a guinea, my husband was not at home, nor knew nothing at all about it; I told him when he came home, and I looked at it; says I, it is bad, and I would not have any thing at all to do with any bad money; he went away and came on the Monday; he asked me if my husband was at home, and I told him he was not; he bade me keep it, and he begged me to tell my husband to see if he could get any customers; on the Thursday, my husband took the half guinea, and went into that gentleman's shop to buy some tea and sugar, and that gentleman said it was bad.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Your husband then was in custody, on a charge of having put off a bad half guinea? - He was in custody for having this half guinea.</p>
               <p>Your husband being in custody on this subject, you then laid this scheme to bring the prisoner to your house? - I could not, I did not know where he lived, he frequently came and brought me silver after he knew this.</p>
               <p>When was your husband discharged? - He was not discharged, he was bailed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. And he is now to be tried? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Now, my Lord, I ask her the question in Mrs. Rudd's case; I ask you, upon your oath, whether you have not laid this scheme to bring that man here, for the purpose of bringing off your husband? - Upon my oath I have not.</p>
               <p>Do not you expect that the conviction of that man at the bar will prevent the prosecution of your husband? - I do not expect it.</p>
               <p>Do not you hope it? - I do not hope to convict any body.</p>
               <p>Do not you hope your husband will be discharged? - I do not suppose he will be discharged.</p>
               <p>Did you never say so to that gentleman? - I never said any thing to that gentleman.</p>

               <p>Did you never promise that gentleman to take the prisoner? - I never promised any body, I did not promise any such a thing, you want to persuade me that I told him things; there is as much honesty in me as there is in you.</p>
               <p>Have not you been told that your husband will be discharged? - I have told you several times that nobody has told me so.</p>
               <p>Have you, then I did not understand you. - Then I tell you so now.</p>
               <p>Do not you expect it will be better for your husband, if that man is convicted? - I do not expect any thing about it.</p>
               <p>Do you believe it? - I believe very little about it, indeed.</p>
               <p>You are an unbeliever, is that the case? - Like yourself.</p>
               <p>I do not believe what you say, if you you mean that; where is your husband? - I must be a witch or a wizard to know where he is now, I have been here since nine this morning, he was in bed when I came out this morning; if you was on the bench, I am sure you would cast him right or wrong.</p>
               <p>Did not you lay this scheme to bring the prisoner to your house, that your husband might be discharged? - You could not blame me if I did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. This man came to you with half a guinea? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did he offer half a guinea for? - Eight shillings and sixpence, I paid him for that.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250178"></xptr>After that he came several times to offer you silver? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You did not know where the prisoner lived? - No.</p>
               <p>But you gave information that the prisoner had been with you? - Yes, I did not know his name, I had several times seen him with this silver; I had agreed for the payment of the money, and had received it from him.</p>

            . If you cannot carry this matter any further than the evidence that is now adduced, I am of opinion it is not sufficient evidence, therefore it is the business of the Court to decide on that question, and if my brother Gould is of the same opinion with me, I shall not reserve this case.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. It is your Lordship's wish as well as mine, that the determinations of the Court should be consistent, and that one day we should not reject evidence, which another we received; I do not believe there is an objection that can be stated by the ingenuity of man, but what has been taken, and has been considered; I defy the ingenuity of this gentleman to find a new objection; I remember this objection being taken, and taken by myself, and over-ruled; the answer to me has been this, the offence is compleat on the prisoner if he puts it off to you, and gives you the possession of it, he has done as much as in him lays; to do the subsequent part lays in the witness, to give the money; no one of the Gentlemen of the Jury would have have paid the money, but the moment he had possession of these counterfeit shillings, he would immediately have taken the prisoner up: I only wish we may know how far it is or is not evidence.</p>

            . If my brother Gould concurs with me, the man must be acquitted; but if he thinks it such a case as is proper for the consideration of all the Judges, it shall be reserved for their opinion.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Gould. I concur that nothing can be more clear, than that the act must be done according to the terms of the act of Parliament, and whatever progress it may have made towards it, if it is not finally compleated and finished, it does not reach that crime: however it may be right to take every possible method to repress such pernicious practices as these, the Judges are bound not to stretch laws that are to affect the lives of their fellow subjects: I remember a case I tried at York, and I reserved it; it was an indictment for coining a guinea and a half-guinea; the guinea was struck between two dies, with the head and with the reverse compleat; it was then delivered by the coiner, (for there was actual proof of the fact itself, of its being delivered) to a person standing by, and the purpose of it was manifestly and unquestionably to go and get it changed; but in the state that it was delivered out, the edges were rough, and it would not pass; nobody would take it; nothing could be proved of what became of this piece of counterfeit money: the objection as it has struck my brother now occurred to me, that it was treason brought very near to completion, but not quite completed: I let the trial go on, I acquainted the late Mr. Wallace, a man very eminent and particularly so in the laws of this country; I said, I did not chuse to let this pass publicly in the hearing of this whole county, for Yorkshire was then very famed for this, and I reserved the case: the opinion of the Judges was, that I was right in my conception, that the piece not being compleatly finished, it did not amount to high treason. The act of Parliament in this case says, shall take, receive, pay, or put off: now take the common idea of that; a man comes to a tradesman to pay for a piece of goods, that he is buying in his shop, before the tradesman has delivered his goods he discovers this counterfeit<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250179"></xptr> money, the man intended and meant, if you please, to put off that money, but it had not its effect, it was stopped before it reached the goal; the legislature in my opinion upon the act of Parliament that occurred to me, have themselves decided this matter, in the act of the fifteenth and sixteenth of his late Majesty, there the offence, which I apprehend this amounts to is provided for; if any person after such a day shall offer or tender in payment any false or counterferfeit money, he shall be liable to be imprisoned for six months: this was offering and tendering this false money, and it would clearly come within that act of Parliament, but within the term pay or put off as it strikes my idea, it falls short of the import conveyed by those words, therefore I do concur in opinion with my brother Perryn; altho' it is said here at the bar, that this matter has passed several times here, and then we are told that all the ingenuity of council cannot invent a new objection, that there is no objection that could occur to the ingenuity of man, but has been started here and thoroughly discussed; I confess, I never heard a question of this kind before, therefore it comes to me purely and simply upon the terms of this act of Parliament, and if we are to understand these words not with a legal acceptation, but a vulgar acceptation, what does a man mean when he says I put off such a half-guinea? why, I have got rid of it; therefore we ought to refer to the natural acceptation of the term, and this evidence does not reach it: therefore I am of opinion that in point of law the offence is not proved.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. My Lord, that act of Parliament your Lordship mentions is for offering, or tendering in payment, as and for a good piece of legal coin, false money as good money; the objection would be, it cannot come within that act of Parliament, he does not utter it, or pay it as good money, he pays it as bad money.</p>

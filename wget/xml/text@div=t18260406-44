On the 16th of March, about half-past six o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to the shop, and asked to look at some mourning rings, which were in a tray in the window, with others; I took the tray out, and put it on the counter, for him to examine; he tried several on - they were too small for his finger. I put the tray behind the counter: he pointed to another tray - I told him they were ladies' rings; he then asked to see the first tray again; I put it on the counter; he immediately snatched it up, and ran out of the shop with it - it contained between six and seven dozens of dif<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182604060024"></xptr>ferent kinds of rings - they were worth about 120l. I immediately followed; he went down Pope's Head-alley; our shop is at the corner of the alley: I pursued him across Lombard-street into Sherborne-lane - he was stopped near the bottom; he had not got the tray then; some person, whom I did not know, handed it to me; I had not seen him part with it. There were mourning rings in it then. I recovered about two dozen, which were worth about 16l., not more. He was a perfect stranger - he spoke pretty good English.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. LAW. Q. What distance is the shop from Sherborne-lane? A. Two hundred yards or more; it was darkish - we had just lighted the gas. He made three turnings before he was stopped; two or three boys collected; there was not a great crowd. The people appeared to me to be more stooping down than running, as the rings dropped from him as he ran. I have a pretty good recollection of persons; I am certain of him - I cannot be mistaken.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you ever lose sight of him? A. Only as he turned the corner of Sherborne-lane, but I saw him in the middle of the road. He was in the shop nearly ten minutes; there were other persons in the shop; he is a very tall man - I cannot be mistaken in him.</p>
               <p>MR. JOHN GEORGE FEARN. My house is in the parish of St. Michael, Cornhill. The rings were worth more than 120l.; those recovered are worth about 18l. or 20l.</p>

            . I am a coal-dealer, and live at No. 12, Sherborne-lane. I was in my own room, and heard a cry of Stop thief! I went to the door, and saw the prisoner running, pursued with a cry of Stop thief! by full twenty persons; when he came nearly opposite my door I crossed over and collared him - another man came up - we took him back; he was charged with stealing Mr. Fearn's rings, and made no answer. I gave him to the patrol.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you not in too much confusion to know whether he gave an answer? A. No. When I took him the people had not come up; they were ten or twelve yards behind him.</p>

            . Here are two chased rings - I have seven more, which were delivered to me; I know them by a private mark scratched inside - we do not take the marks off when we sell them; I know the pattern - they are new, and have never been worn. I swear I never sold these. The porter was in the shop when I ran out - he is not here; he was at the back of the shop; Mr. Fearn's son was in the shop, but no strangers.</p>

               <p>The prisoner came to my bar with an elderly woman along with her, and they had two glasses of liquor poured out to them; the prisoner at the bar offered a six-pence.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was it called for the glass of gin? - The prisoner at the bar; my son said he believed it was a bad sixpence, I looked at it and I said, this is a bad one.</p>
               <p>Q. How did that six-pence come into your possession? - I took it from the woman, and afterwards gave it her back again; she had not drank any liquor, and I did not care if she went about her business; they did not drink the two glasses of gin till they see whether the six-pence would be taken or not.</p>
               <p>Court. Who asked for this gin? - I cannot be positive.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the gin paid for or no? - It was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it offered to be paid for? - It was, with this six-pence, this woman offered the six-pence, I gave it her back again and told her it was a bad one, and I did not chuse to take it, she said she had taken it of a baker in change of a shilling where she had bought the two-penny loaf which she had in her hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she tell you the baker's name? - No, I asked her what she had done with the remainder of the change, she said she had laid it out in necessary articles as she was coming along.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that she said that she had parted with the change as she was coming along? - Positively.</p>
               <p>Q Out of that change from the shilling she must have received ten-pence, would that have paid for the gin that she asked for? - It was only two-pence for her to pay. I told her that I believed that she was a very bad kind of woman, and that she was putting off this money; she said it was no such thing, and was rather pert; I told somebody to tell Jostling to step in; he was in the house, and Jostling stept in, and said he thought he had some knowledge of her face, Jostling said, I will search her, I said do as you please about that, the other woman she got off, Jostling laid hold of this woman first and searched her.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179310300131"></xptr>Q. Was she asked any questions about money before Jostling searched her? - Jostling said he knew her face very well, and she was a putter off of bad money. She said she had no more money about her.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure of that? - I am positive, she said so before Jostling came in, and after too; when Jostling came to search her he found the four pennyworth of halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Jostling search her? - Yes, I was on one side of the counter and Jostling the other, he took first out of her pocket four-pennyworth of halfpence loose which would more than have paid for the gin; Jostling says, what is in this purse? she did not seem to know what was in it, a purse? she said, she did not know any thing about it, I believe she said so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Jostling draw the purse from her pocket? - Yes, and he opened the purse before her, and there was in it six six-pences of the same sort that she had produced.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the first six-pence she tendered to you? - I took it out of her hand myself, and have kept it ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the other sixpences that were taken from her? - Jostling has them and the purse.</p>
               <p>- JOSTLING sworn.</p>
               <p>I am constable; I took this woman in Towers's house, I happened to be in Mr. Towers's tap room, and I heard of some women offering a bad six-pence; directly I came into the bar and I thought I knew this woman, when I went into the bar Mr. Towers asked her whether she had got any more money about her? she said no, the prisoner is the woman, I searched her, and found a purse with six bad six-pences, that was all I found in the purse; there were four-pennyworth of halfpence loose; then I took her into custody, and had her before a magistrate.</p>

               <p>I am the person employed in the mint prosecutions, for the purpose of ascertaining whether money is good or bad; this six-pence is a bad one, it has been rubbed, it never has been in circulation before since it was coloured; these six six-pences are every one bad, they do not appear to have been in circulation, they appear to be all of one make.</p>
               <p>Court. In what line are you employed in the mint? - To prove the money in mint prosecutions.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you think they have not been in circulation? - Because they are capitally finished, and if they had been in circulation they would have been rubbed.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was going through Clare-market and coming back again I picked up the purse with this money in it, and I changed a shilling for a loaf, and I took that six-pence in exchange, my mother-in-law was with me, and asked me to lend her a few halfpence till next day, and I said yes, I was going to give my mother-in-law the four-pennyworth of halfpence.</p>

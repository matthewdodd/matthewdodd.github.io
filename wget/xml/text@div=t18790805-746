                  </hi>. I am tne wife of Richard Donovan of 3, Little Place, St. George's Road, Newington—Small is my brother—he called on me on Sunday 20th. about 8.30, with his wife, and left in a few minutes—I saw them again about 10.40 or 10.45 the same night, the "houses" were open—I went home with them—I cannot give you their address, but it 16 at the bottom of the street—I stopped with them about 10 minutes, because they went up stairs—I just tasted some supper there—he had dark clothes on. but he took off his coat and waistcoat to have his supper—the "houses" were closed when I left, they close at 11 on Sundays—he had *a dark round hat, not a billy cock—he was not wearing light clothes or a light hat—he only wears light clothes occasionally, just for races; that is his living.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I do not know the name of Dicky Sprike, or that my brother or my husband ever went by it—my husband's name is not Habbitt, it is Donovan—my brother goes by no name but Small—I don't know whether he ever lived in London Street—I cannot tell whether he was ever in Newcastle, or whether he ever went by the name of Stanley—he gets his living by backing horses only—I have seen him wear a hat like this.

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Kelling, of 22, Longue<lb></lb>ville Eoad, Newington Butts—Small and his wife live in my house, and occupy the first-floor front room, which is opposite my bedroom—on 20th July I saw Small in his room about 8 o'clock when I went out for a walk with my husband—I returned at 10.55—the public-houses were not closed—I went up stairs and saw Small sitting at the supper-table in his shirt sleeves with his slippers on—I saw him during the day wear<lb></lb>ing a black coat and hat.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It rained just a little when I returned—I have seen him go out repeatedly, and never saw him wear a hat of this description—I never saw Mrs. Donovan at the house—I heard laughing and talking on this night but did not see any one—I did not go into the room where he was sitting in his shirt sleeves—I could not see all through the room—he nodded to me and I returned it—the door opens inwards, and I could only see half the room—I heard Mrs. Small talking but oould not see her.</p>

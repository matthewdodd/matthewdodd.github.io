                  </hi>. I am a painter, of 12, Holland Street, Westminster—on the evening of 3rd June I went with a friend named Day into the George and Bull public-house, Orchard Street, Westminster, where I saw the four prisoners—soon after we got in our pot of beer was taken off the barrel on which it stood in the bar and I saw it in one of the prisoners' hands—I said,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187906300010"></xptr>
               <p>"That is my beer," and the answer was made, "It was quite a mistake"—the one who took the beer said that; I cannot say which—soon after that the prisoners got close round the entrance to the door, and we got up to leave—the soldier was first, and I was second, and Campbell pushed him back on my toes—I said, "That is my toe," in a joking sort of way—Campbell said, "You can get by as well as anybody else," and said something about throwing me out—Day turned round and said, "If you were outside you might not be so fast talking about throwing people out"—instantly there was a rush made by the four prisoners, and I received a blow from Campbell—I defended myself as well as I could—I found myself seized round the legs by a man who was on his knees, and I was thrown to the ground over the man's back and shoulders who was on the ground—I instantly felt hands feeling my pockets, and I said, "You won't find much there"—I scrambled to my feet in the best manner I could—when I got about 20 yards off I received a blow in the back of the neck, which felled me to the ground—I received a kick or two on the head and face, and became insensible; I also received kicks on the ribs, especially the right side—when I came to my senses I found myself at the hospital, where I remained from the Tuesday night till Saturday at dinner-time—I suffered much pain for the first three or four days—I had 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. taken from me—I can only swear to Campbell, but I swear they were all in the public-house and rushed out.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not say before the Magistrate that I wished to withdraw the change of robbery, as I was not sure that I had lost anything—I said, "I wish to withdraw the charge of robbery; the money might have dropped out, considering the open state of my pockets"—it was about 8.30 p.m. that I went to the public-house, and this happened three-quarters of an hour after—we only had two pots of beer—there were three or four soldiers there, not eight or ten—there was only one soldier with me—I did not see him take his belt off; I have not heard that he did—I said at the police-court, "The soldier did not ask me to fight; I do not know whether he took off his belt; the soldier ran off; I do not know who ran after him"—Day was the only soldier with me—he ran away, no doubt—I could not say whether he struck any one—I do not know that Finch was lying in the gutter insensible for some time—I believe he asked me that at the police-station, and I said, "I cannot say whether you were knocked down by the soldier"—I don't know who kicked me—I was too busily engaged to count the men about me—I kicked nobody—Day went on recruiting service the next day—he was before the Magistrate—I was seized by the legs—what they call a cross-buttock, I believe.</p>

I am a mason, of West Court Cottages, Hammersmith—I was in Orchard Street at about 9.30 on the night in question, when I saw the prisoner Grimshaw knock the prosecutor down, 20 or 30 yards from the public-house—he took his feet away from him, and hit him at the same time, and he fell very heavily on his head—Grimshaw and Coombs kicked him on the right side; Campbell came up and said "What the b——are you looking at"—I said "Not very much," and he said "If you don't be off you will get the same"—I made no reply, but went round the corner—the prosecutor was lying on the ground—I was obliged to run for myself.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I saw one soldier; I did not see Grimshaw and Finch do anything—I swore "I did not see Campbell do anything;" he was there—I did not know one from the other—when they put their hats on I knew them—I can swear that Campbell kicked him; I saw the soldier take off his belt, and knock Finch down in the gutter insensible—the soldier ran away, and three men ran after him—Finch did not remain in the gutter long—I did not see any one help him up—there was a general row amongst them all—I did not see the prosecutor strike anybody—he was lying on the ground—he got up, and Campbell knocked him down again—I was not in the public-house—we were playing over by the stonemason's—I saw the rush of people out of the public-house—it was after they came out that Finch was knocked down.</p>

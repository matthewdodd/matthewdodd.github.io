               <p>Q. Were you quite sure then that he was the same person that brought the mare and the cart to the stable to you - A. Yes; the officer brought him down to me; he owned to me that he was the same man.</p>

            . I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner in George-street, St. Giles's. I told him for what I had taking him; I asked him what he had done with the horse and cart; he said he did not know where it was; the man that he had with him had drove it away. I asked him how he came to drive the man's cart and horse away; he said he was afraid he had made a bad job of it; he had taken it, and he did it through distress. I asked him if he had any friends; he said he had, but they all turned their backs upon him, and he did not care how soon he was hung.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner did he say this to you, did he appear to be perfect in his senses - A. He did; he appeared to be perfectly in his right senses when he was apprehended, but when he came before the magistrate he acted as he does here. The magistrates were loath to commit him until they had seen his brother, and had an interview with his wife.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. I suppose you have kept your mare and cart ever since it was restored to you - A. Yes; I have not brought it here. The same cart and mare was restored to me that was taken away; I took it to the office in Whitechapel.</p>
               <p>Q. to Skinner. Was the mare and cart that you saw at the office the same that was brought to your yard by the prisoner - A. Yes, the same.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence, nor called any witnesses to his character.</p>

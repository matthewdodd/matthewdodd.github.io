               <p>called by one of Mrs. Tomlin's children, between four and five years old—I went into Mrs. Tomlin's at a few minutes before 2 o'clock—I found Mary Ann Tomlin bleeding from a wound in the forehead—she was standing, with the blood running into a tub which was standing on the table in the kitchen—I would not be positive whether she was standing or sitting—the prisoner was bathing the child's forehead—I did not notice whether the little children were in the room, they might have been—I called in a person who was passing; she lives in Plaistow, but I do not know her—we took the child from the prisoner, and took her to Dr. Beale, the surgeon—the prisoner did not wish me to take the child; she laid hold of the child, and held her very tight—she resisted my taking her, and said the child should not go—I told her I wanted to take the child to the doctor; it must go to the doctor; and it was after that she laid hold of the child, and resisted very much.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live at Plaistow. Mary Ann Tomlin was brought to me about 2 o'clock on the 13th Aug.—I examined her—she had a severe incised wound on her forehead, apparently made with a sharp instrument—it was a long wound, with a flap to it, which I placed in its position, put a few stitches in it, and bound it round with a strap—it was a circular wound, in the centre of the forehead—I do not think there was any particular danger about it—it was a severe wound—I attended her till the wound got well—it got well in about a fortnight—she was not confined to the bed or the house—I desired her to be brought to my house to have it dressed—she could go about when the wound was bound up—she was brought to my house some of the times by Mrs. Humm—her mother never brought her—she lived at her mother's, but she was kept for the day at a neighbour's opposite my house—her forehead was cut to the bone—there is very little intervening there between the skin and the bone—the prisoner was brought to my house about two hours afterwards in a state of intoxicaton—I was before the Magistrate on 31st Aug.—the child was there, and was ex<lb></lb>amined in my presence—I was before the Magistrate before that, but I had been very ill, and was forced to go away—I waited about two hours.</p>

The prisoner came on the 10th of last month; I was confined to my bed by a pain in my bowels. The prisoner came in, and asked for a lodging, and I told him he would get one. The woman here made answer, and said to him, that he should have a lodging for a week, for two shillings a week. The watch at that time, was under my head, between the pillow and bolster. I pulled it out in the prisoner's presence, to tell the woman what o'clock it was. I then fell asleep. I wakened again; in a few minutes the prisoner went out of the room; I then missed it, and went after him; I never saw him afterwards until I saw him at Greenwich. He had informed us that he was a <rs id="t18151025-21-deflabel115" type="occupation">Greenwich pensioner</rs>

               <p>Q. Then he admitted that he took it - A. He did. He said he was sorry for it; he said he pawned the seal and key for twenty shillings, and afterwards sold the duplicate for ten shillings.</p>

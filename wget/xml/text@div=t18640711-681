                  <hi rend="smallCaps">LADWIGE MARY LAZOUSKI</hi>. I am barmaid at the Victoria refreshment-room—early in June, the prisoner came there, with three others—one of the others called for a pot of sixpenny ale, or half-and-half, which came to sixpence—he tendered a shilling—I said, "This is a bad one; and if you do not give me a better one, I shall lock you up"—he said, "Give me that one back"—I said, "Oh, no, I am sure I shall not"—he took out a good one, and said, "See that this is a good one; that is one I made myself"—I gave him sixpence change—they all four drank the liquor, and left together—I afterwards gave the bad shilling to a policeman—on 24th June, the prisoner came alone—I knew him the moment he came—he asked for a glass of pale ale, and gave me a half-crown—I said, "This is a bad half-crown"—he said, "Well, give it me back"—then I said, "Where did you get it?"—he said, "I took it in change somewhere in Westminster"—I refused to give it back—he would not pay me, and I said that I would lock him up if he did not—he then gave me twopence for the ale—I advised him to go—he refused, and I said that if he would not, I would lock him up—he dared me to do so, used very foul language, and declared that I was drunk—I said, "As you have dared me to do it, I will do it;" and one of the Brighton Railway policemen took him into Mr. Harrison's office—I gave the half-crown to Joyce, having first shown it to Inspector Harris, who gave it back to me—it was not out of my sight till I gave it to the policeman.</p>

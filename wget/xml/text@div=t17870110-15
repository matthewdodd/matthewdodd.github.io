               <p>My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, I certainly gave this note to Mr. Ball, but as for forging of it, or knowing it to be false, I totally deny; and there is no writing belonging to me but what is on the back; I was appointed <rs id="t17870110-15-deflabel85" type="occupation">surgeon</rs>

               <p>Who is the man that brought you the bill? - He sailed for Jamaica the day after Christmas day.</p>
               <p>Then you have no witnesses here to prove that, have you any body to give you a character? - Mr. Ball frequently repeated that he would not hurt me; there was a Mr. Robinson, an apothecary, present at the time.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Is this true? - I said, I would shew him as much lenity as possibly I could.</p>
               <p>Was that before he had confessed he had written the bill? - No, after he confessed.</p>
               <p>Are you positive of that? - I think it was after he confessed.</p>
               <p>Court. The constable ought to have been here who was present.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I expected that apothecary here by eleven, and a Mr. Cockburn, surgeon in Grafton-street, and a Captain Cockburn.</p>

               <p>What day of the month was it? - I think it was on the 7th day.</p>
               <p>Tell us the conversation that passed between Ball and the prisoner in your hearing? - When we came into the room, the prisoner was at dinner; Mr. Ball said, Mr. Moffart, you have served me pretty well, to give me such a note as this, I had like to have been taken into custody upon it myself; the prisoner said to him, aye, aye! I am sorry for that; I think Ball mentioned the name of Mr. Peters, that he had been to him, and he denied knowing any thing of the note, and said, that it was a forged note; well, says the prisoner, if it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178701100031"></xptr>is so, then I must pay you your money again; says Ball, says he, I would not wish to hurt you, but I cannot lose my money; and be like to come to trouble into the bargain; so that you must not be out of custody till it is decided some way; with that the prosecutor gave me charge of the prisoner; this was all that passed at that time; then I took the prisoner with me and Ball to St. Ann's watch-house; and in the way as we went along, Ball says to the prisoner, who wrote the indorsement on the back of the note? to let him know who was the man, and whether he could not be found; the prisoner said, it was no matter, he could not blame any body for it, but himself; that he wrote it himself.</p>
               <p>That was in answer to the question who wrote the indorsement? - Yes, as we went along a little further, he said, he had done it through want of money; and that he should have money in a few days to pay it.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you sure it was the indorsement that Ball asked him who wrote? - Yes, he asked him that question going along from the prisoner's lodgings.</p>


               <p>The question was not who wrote the note, or who wrote the acceptance; but who wrote the indorsement? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you hear the prisoner at any time say any more about who wrote the rest of the note? - I understood him by what he said, that he meant it was himself wrote it, but he did not say so downright.</p>
               <p>His answer, whatever it was, was in answer to the question who wrote the indorsement? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had the prosecutor promised him any favour in your hearing? - He said, he wanted nothing but his own, and to get rid of it; and he wanted to get no disgrace about it; and that he thought it was a good note when he gave it him.</p>
               <p>Did he make any other promise? - He said, he did not want to hurt him, if he could but get at his own; with that the prisoner gave the prosecutor directions to go to his brother that lived down in Westminster, I forget the street; this conversation was at the watch-house, and the other was going to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. Are your witnesses here now? - Yes, my Lord, all that I expected to come are here.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Will you give me leave to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178701100032"></xptr>look at the note again; I did not know it till Mr. Fletcher told me, that the stamp was not a legal stamp; it is upon a twopenny stamp.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Did the prisoner ever at any time tell you how he had got this bill, or what it was for? - No he did not; he told me he got it from his agent; that he got it for his pay.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. I can read in the note two pence for receipt.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shelton informed the Court that there was a case at the assizes, in which the Judges had determined that in cases of forgery, it was not necessary that the note should be on a stamp; and that the objection taken on the trial of Lee was overruled.</p>

             was tried for forging a bill of exchange, thirty days after date, also for forging two indorsements; there was no doubt on the evidence, as to the fact of forging, but Mr. Baldwin objected that the instrument was not a bill of exchange, because there was no stamp upon it, for want of which it would be waste paper, by the late stamp act: it was argued that the stamp act was merely a revenue law, and did not purport in any way to alter the crime of forgery; that the instrument was a false one, and had the semblance of a good bill of exchange; the objection was over-ruled; but as this was a new case, the Court yielded to the request of the prisoner's counsel, and left it to the Judges: on the 1st day of Easter Term, 1783, the objection was over-ruled by all the Judges.</p>
               <p>Court. We are certainly bound by this opinion to over rule the objection taken by the prisoner; but there is a question may arise, whether it can be a forgery upon a note on the face of it void? I shall therefore take the verdict of the Jury; if they are of opinion that he is guilty, subject to the opinion of the Judges, and shall consequently respite judgment.</p>

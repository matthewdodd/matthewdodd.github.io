                  </hi>, (<hi rend="italic">Through an interpreter</hi>.) I came to this country on 1st June in the present year—I was accompanied by Bayer—I went to the Terminus hotel, London-bridge—I stopped there seven or eight days—Bayer left one or two days before I saw Berrens—I think the second day after my arrival I saw Braun in front of the hotel at the railway-station—Bayer was with me—when we were together the talk was about the forged bank-notes, and an appointment was made for the next day to meet, and we did meet at a cafe the next day, not far from the hotel—there were present Berrens, Lon<lb></lb>dinski, I, and Bayer—Berrens introduced himself there as the owner of the manufactory of the notes—I asked him to show me the place of manufactory—he said he could not do so, and he asked me to give him some money for the purpose of procuring some new paper; some better ones—then we separ<lb></lb>ated—I said I should consider about it—the conversation was in German—Berrens is a Russian—he does not speak German fluently—next I saw Blum or Braun, in Spencer's hotel—that was perhaps six or eight days after the interview with Berrens; Londinski, Berrens, Bayer, and I were present—after Berrens would not show me the place of manufacture Braun was introduced to me, and represented to me as one who would establish for me such a manu<lb></lb>facture—Berrens recommended him to me, saying that he was an excellent engraver, that he had already made some plates of forged notes at Riga—and that also in London he had taken part, in making some plates, and that lat<lb></lb>terly he had imitated sixpenny-pieces here—Berrens and Braun told me that they had made these things in partnership with a man named Jaffer—I in<lb></lb>vited him to call on me to show me a sample, and he promised he would call and furnish me with such a sample—he came, not the next day but I think the second or third day afterwards—at that interview only indifferent things were spoken about—about the forged bank notes it was said, that a house</p>

               <p>should be taken if the samples should turn out well, and then the manufactory should be established—we all spoke about it—I cannot recollect that anything more was said about the house at that time—the next person I saw was Holchester—I saw him at my lodging, No. 1, Brunswick-terrace—that was perhaps six or ten days after the interview with Braun—he came with Londinski—Holchester told me that he had 20,000 five-rouble notes ready, and offered them to me for sale—he told me he generally sold them at 20 or 25 per cent, but if I took all he produced he should give them to me at 10 per cent—I told him that I had not the intention of buying his papers, as the paper was so very bad, but if he would receive me as co-partner, and introduce me into his manufactory, I was ready to give him some money—he would not consent to that—no more was said about it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> At any time after that did Braun show you a plate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He had made the eagle of a Russian 25-rouble note—it was shown to me at Bayer's lodging; 75, Camberwell-road—after that Bayer, Braun, and I went to Pinner.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came you to go to Pinner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We were about to hire a house, as the eagle had been recognised as being considered a good one—Braun sug<lb></lb>gested Pinner—he brought me a newspaper, the <hi rend="italic">Telegraph</hi>, or some other in which places of abode were advertised, and so we immediately went there—we went in a private carriage, a fly I think—it was hired from a place close to my lodging, the second or third house from it—we went to Pinner, and found that the house had been taken that very day—after that a house was taken at 11, Russell-street, Camberwell—Londinski found that house out, and agreed as to the price—I took the house—the second day I went there—Londinski had come to me about it before I took it, and after it was taken—Bayer went into the occupation of it—the first of the prisoners I saw at that house was Barrens—that was on the same day as Bayer went into it—I saw the prisoners there every day—I can't recollect whom I saw—Davis and Silberman I only saw at a later period—I saw Holchester at that house a few days after it was taken; very little time after—we were every day speaking about my wanting to have the factory, and he persisted on it that he would sell me papers—I did not agree to take the papers—I always refused to—at that time, I was in communication with Inspector Thompson—I afterwards went to Paris.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came you to go to Paris? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Towards the end of June, Holchester told me that he would perhaps enter with me into this business, as soon as I should be recommended to him by somebody—I asked him from whom he wished to have the recommendation, and he said from De Lipeou in Paris—I went to Paris to De Lipeou for three days for the purpose of being recommended by him, and about two days after my return to London, Holchester and Londinski told, me that De Lipeou had written to them, and that he was ready or willing to take me as a co-partner into this factory, and asked for this 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. sterling—at that time only I ascertained his name; I did not know it before—we then separated again, and these negotiations were repeated daily—once at my place; once at a public house near Holchester's lodging—in the month of July, Holchester showed me some forged notes—I can't say on what day—it was at my lodging—there were 500 forged five-rouble notes—200 of them Bayer bought—I gave the money for them—I saw Holchester on many occasions between that time and the time when he was taken into custody—every time we met he spoke about his factory—he wanted 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I would not give him—I first saw Davis, about the</p>

               <p>middle of July, at the London-bridge railway—Berrens and Bayer were present—Davis warned me and Berrens not to throw away uselessly the money at Brussels—I had not been to Brussels at that time—I went after<lb></lb>wards with Berrens—I wanted to discover there the factory of Crawcaur—nothing further of importance passed at that interview, only indifferent subjects—it was after I returned that I saw Silberman—I saw him at Davis's—he told me he had served in the insurrection, and showed me a certificate—nothing more passed of importance then; only indifferent subjects were spoken about—we then separated, and I saw him once more at Davis's; and there I asked Davis and Berrens what sort of a man he was; how he came into it—and they told me that he was a very clever man for the uttering of forged bank-notes—they also told me, at the same time, that he had brought some watches from Holland, for forged notes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you see Holchester at any time when he mentioned to you a person of the name of Spretchnecover, or was the name mentioned by any of the prisoners? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We spoke every day of the name of Spretchnecover, after she had been arrested in Paris—Holchester told me that he had not sold to Spretchnecover, and he had not sold direct to Bluckler—he always told me that he took from 20 to 25 per cent. for small quantities of the forged rouble notes—about the end of July an arrangement was made between me and Inspector Thompson—I can't recollect if it was on the 29th—I can't recollect what happened on that day—I remember a day upon which several of the prisoners came to Russell-street—when they assembled together there, it was always talked about of the factory and of the future arrangements—on 29th August, Holchester brought to Bayer 500 forged five-rouble notes, at 11, Russell-street—I saw Holchester arrive there—he had with him a parcel with 500 bank notes—it was wrapped up in a thin, fine paper—I can't say the colour of the paper; I can't recollect—Bayer was also there, and later Davis, Silberman, and Berrens came—we separated because Holchester was in a hurry to go away—nothing was done—I can't exactly recollect what was said—we spoke every day of the factory, of notes, of our business—Bayer received the packet of notes that Holchester brought—he took it down to the kitchen, to be kept—I then went away—they went away with the understanding that the next day, the 30th, I should go to Ramsgate with Bayer—Holchester was to accompany us—that was the day they were taken into custody—we did not go to Ramsgate—I had no intention of going.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came you and Holchester, and the others, to be in the house at the time they were arrested? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had then to assemble there—I com<lb></lb>municated that to Inspector Thompson—I gave a signal to Thompson to come and arrest them—the signal was unbuttoning my coat—I did that at the first-floor window—that was not the room in which the prisoners were; they were on the ground floor—just before I went up stairs, I asked Bayer to show me the bank notes which Holchester brought yesterday—Bayer then fetched them—we looked at them, Holchester, I, and Bayer—Bayer fetched the notes from the kitchen—they were wrapped up in that paper; but I cannot recollect what sort of paper—I saw a carpet bag at that time in the place—I saw Holchester had a bag—Bayer had a bag—while Holchester, I, and Bayer were looking at the notes, Berrens, Davis, and Silberman came in, and at that moment I went up stairs, to give the signal—I cannot recollect what was going on at the time they came in—the notes were there—I can't say if they were just at that time on the table, or if somebody had taken them and put them somewhere else—I had them on the table—I cannot</p>

               <p>recollect whether anything was being said when Silberman, Davis, and Berrens came in—I did not remain up stairs while the prisoners were being arrested—I went down stairs into the kitchen—I first went into the room where they were, and looked out, and, when I saw Mr. Thompson coming, I went down stairs—I was not in the same room that the prisoners were after Thompson came in.</p>

               <p>lived in St. John's Wood—you always refused to give me your address—we had a conversation, the end of which was that you agreed to engrave plates for me of twenty-five rouble notes—you asked me for a new genuine twenty-five rouble note—I wanted to see a proof of your work, but did not say that I should like to see the eagle best—I understood very little of such works at that time—you told me that you had done this before, and it was only wasting time to see a proof, as you had done them in Riga and here—it was agreed that you should make the sample at Bayer's—I wanted to see the proof done in Bayer's and my presence, and you agreed that the sample should be made under our eye—I gave the money to Londinski to buy a genuine twenty-five rouble note—it was bought by Barrens—I do not recollect whether it was brought to Bayer's lodgings—it is possible that I went there to look at it—I do not know whether the good note was put in paper and handed over to you—I know you received it—it is possible that we then went away, and spent the night at the London Pavilion—I do not know whether you wrote to Bayer saying you would come on the next Saturday—I do not recollect Bayer showing me that letter—I cannot recollect whether you went to Bayer's on the next Monday and took some tools—that was Bayer's business—I saw a piece of steel there, which you brought to do this proof on—I do not know it—you showed it to me at my house, or at Bayer's house—I cannot recollect whether you and Bayer came next morning to No. 1, Brunswick-terrace—it is possible—I know the sample was made at Bayer's house, but I do not know if they went there from my house or not—I went over, talking to the landlord till it was done—they told me that it took two hours to draw the eagle and outline it—I I do not know if it was two, I was not present—I went up stairs and saw the proof—I would not be satisfied, or dissatisfied, as I did not understand that sort of thing—I asked Bayer if it was good—you told me that in three or four months you would have finished the whole engraving—you and Bayer came down stairs and found me talking to the landlord—I then went up and saw a proof—if we went up together, I do not know—I sent Londinski to look for a house, and it is very possible that I was in a very bad temper about his not having a house—you did not propose the news<lb></lb>paper, but you brought one to me—I think it was the Telegraph—I cannot read English, therefore I cannot have picked out the house at Pinner—you found it in the paper and read it, and told me there was a house there—I do not recollect your writing it on a card and showing it to the landlady—it is possible—this was at my lodging, 1, Brunswick-terrace—the landlady, I think, sent the servant to the railway-station—I do not know whether she found that there was no line to Pinner, but we took a private carriage, and you and I and Bayer went there in it—when we came to the house, you left Bayer and I in the carriage, and you came back and said, "You cannot get that house"—I think that it was already let—I do not know that you told me they would not let it to foreigners—we then went to the tavern and had dinner—Londinski came back the same night from Pinner—I do not know whether he found a house the next day or the day after—I do not recollect whether he had written down in his pocket-book the name of the landlord and of the agent, "11, Russell-street, "and "Johnson"—I can<lb></lb>not recollect that you took that paper out of the pocket-book, it is possible, or if you asked me to go and see the landlord—it is possible that I sent Lon<lb></lb>dinski for a cab, and that you and I and Londinski went there and saw George Johnson, but I do not know—I cannot recollect whether I saw a</p>

I live at 73, Devonshire-street, Kennington-cross—I work for Mr. Barwick, a fly proprietor, of Camberwell-gate—I remember in June last taking some foreigners from 1, Brunswick-terrace, Camberwell-road, to Pinner, to a house that was to let, or was let just previous to our ar<lb></lb>riving there—I think I should know the persons again that went with me—that gentleman at the further end went with me (<hi rend="italic">Holchester</hi>)—one had red whiskers and a moustache—I do not recognise another of them—they remained at Pinner perhaps an hour—they went to the Queen's Head there—I believe I afterwards saw one of the men in Newgate—I do not know who was present when I identified him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of the detective force—on Thursday, the 15th June, I received instructions from Sir Richard Mayne, and sub<lb></lb>sequently the witness Liban made a communication to me—he was brought to my private house on the 19th June by arrangement—on Thursday, the 29th June, in company with Sergeant Clarke, I went to No. 1, Brunswick-terrace, Camberwell-road, where Liban lodged—I saw the prisoner Berrens go to that house that day; I also saw Bayer, and likewise Liban—Bayer went in first, and Berrens afterwards—Bayer and Liban came out together, and went to a public-house in the Camberwell-road—they returned to the lodging, and after they went in Berrens came to the house, knocked, and was admitted—a week or ten days afterwards, about the 5th or 6th July, I went to the same neighbourhood, and kept watch on the same house, in company with Sergeant Mulvaney—I saw the prisoners Holchester, Bayer, and Barrens go into the house—they remained a short time, it might have been half an hour or an hour—I walked by the house—the window was open, and they were seated by the window, smoking—I saw one or two of them leave, but I cannot say which—Liban was in the room when I looked in—he remained in the house when the others went away—a day or two afterwards I again watched the house, and saw Holchester, Bayer, Berrens, and Braun go there—I also saw a man named Londinski there on two or three occasions—on this occasion they remained about an hour or so, and then went away—I had no oppor<lb></lb>tunity of seeing into the house on that occasion—from that time until the 20th of August I only saw the four prisoners I have mentioned, together with Liban—I did not see the other two prisoners during that period—on the evening of the 24th or 25th of August, I was in the neighbourhood of Russell-street, Camberwell—other officers were there—I know the house No, 11, Russell street—I got an opportunity of looking into that house from the outside, and saw Holchester, Bayer, Berrens, Davis, Silberman, and Braun; they were seated at the parlour window, which was open, and were smoking—I saw each one distinctly as I passed by—they remained there u ntil about half-past 8, and then went away—they were seated round the window, smoking and talking—I heard their voices—I did not see anything beyond that—I did not observe anything beyond glasses and bottles on the table—from that day, the 24th, until the 29th, I took a room opposite 11, Russell-street, in order to have the means of very accurate observation, and was there daily from 9 in the morning till 9 at night—during that time I saw the whole of the prisoners there; sometimes together, at other times singly—about a quarter-past 10 on Friday morning, the 25th, I saw Bayer leave the house, 11, Russell-street—at half-past 10 Holchester came to the house; he had a light coat on his left arm, a small white packet in his left hand, and a courier bag slung across his shoulder—he tried to look in at the window, ran up the steps, and knocked, but there was no answer; he waited about half a minute, came down the steps, again looked in the window, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186512180086"></xptr>
               <p>went away, apparently in a great hurry—at about a quarter to 11, Bayer returned—shortly before 11, Liban and Braun came to the house together, and I saw Liban, Holchester, and Braun seated at the window smoking, and in conversation—shortly afterwards I heard them speaking very violently, as if there was an altercation going on, and at 12 o'clock Holchester came out, slammed the door, and went away in a great hurry—he had the same coat and parcel on his left arm as he had when he went in—shortly after<lb></lb>wards, Davis and Berrens came to the house, and about 1 o'clock Berrens, Davis, Silberman, and Bayer went away together—I did not follow them, but I directed Mulvaney to do so—on the night of Monday, the 28th, I was in Holborn, opposite the Dancing-rooms, at midnight, and saw Davis, Berrens, and Liban, come out together—on the following day, Tuesday, the 29th, I was again in Russell-street, in the evening—I had an opportunity of looking in at the window—I was in a room immediately facing the house, and could see anything that went on—I saw the whole of the prisoners come there that evening, with the exception of Braun—they remained there until about half-past 9, and then went away in different directions—I did not see anything take place that day—previous to Wednesday, the 30th, Liban made some communication to me as to what was to take place on the 30th, in consequence of which, on the 30th, I, accompanied by other officers, went to Russell-street about 6 in the evening—I first saw Bayer and Holchester come to the house about half-past 5 in a hansom cab, and, a few minutes afterwards, came up a four-wheeled cab, out of which Berrens, Davis, and Silberman got, and went into the house—previous to this, about noon, I had seen Holchester go to the house and go away with Bayer—within about ten minutes afterwards I received an intimation which had been pre<lb></lb>arranged with Liban, and entered the house, accompanied by other officers—I first went into the parlour, which consists of two rooms, with folding doors, thrown into one—I there found Holchester, Bayer, Berrens, and Silberman seated round a table, drinking wine—I said, addressing the prisoners generally, "I am an inspector of police, and I have received information that there is in this place a large quantity of forged Russian notes"—several of the prisoners said, "We know nothing about it"—I could not individualise those who spoke—I said, "Very well, I shall search the house"—Holchester got up and said, "Look here, Mr. Inspector, I demand to see your warrant"—I said, "I have not got one, but I shall search the house, nevertheless"—I then directed the police who were with me, each to take charge of a prisoner—I then told Mulvaney to look round the room and see if there were any notes about; I did the same—Mulvaney went direct to the fireplace in the back portion of the room; there were several pieces of paper lying loose in the grate—Mulvaney examined them, there was no fire there—I then told Mulvany to come with me, he was still engaged in searching the fireplace, he left off doing so and went up with me, and we proceeded to search the upper part of the house—I there found some engraver's tools, which I pro<lb></lb>duce, in a drawer in a small table in the back room—I then went downstairs in to the kitchen and searched the ground floor, and then I entered the room with Mulvaney in which the prisoners were—I told Mulvaney to search the room thoroughly, and I commenced doing the same—I saw him go to the fireplace, and whilst I was examining a bed he exclaimed, "Here is some<lb></lb>thing, sir,"and he brought out the papers I now produce—he took them from the fireplace in the parlour where the prisoners were; I am told they are Russian notes, but I do not know Russian and cannot say—they were precisely in the same state as they are now when he handed them to me—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186512180087"></xptr>
               <p>when he produced them I said, "Very well,"and continued searching the room—no conversation passed that I noticed—I have omitted to state that when I re-entered the room with Mulvaney, I said, "I wish to see the occupier of the house"—Bayer stood forward, he did not appear to understand me, and I repeated the same to him in French, and he answered, "I occupy the house"—I said, "Very well, come with me a moment,"and I asked him to come out of the room—he came out of the room; Mulvaney also left the room—what Bayer said was not within hearing of the other prisoners—after some communication had taken place between Bayer and myself I went back into the room and closely searched it, and under a small table I found a carpet-bag; it was a small table near the window in the back portion of the room—this is the bag—it is a small six-roomed house—the bag was not under the table at which the prisoners were sitting—I felt the bag and found that it contained something like a book loose—I placed it on the table around which the prisoners were seated, and asked each one if he had the key of it; they each said "No" I took out my keys but none of them would fit the lock—I then cut open the side of the bag with a pen-knife, took out a small packet from the bag, opened it in the presence of the pri<lb></lb>soners, and found it to contain the notes I now produce—I placed the parcel of notes on the table and showed it to the prisoners—I said, "You see here is a bundle of what I think are forged Russian notes"—Holchester jumped up and appeared greatly excited, he said, "I do not speak Russian, and never saw a Russian note in my life"—I then ordered each of the prisoners to be searched—I saw Mulvaney take a key from the pocket of Bayer which fitted the lock of the bag—the prisoners were then given in custody to the station, I went with them—I afterwards went to the house of Holchester and searched it—I found there a duplicate relating to a ring pawned by a man named Berrens of Houudsditch.</p>

               <p>straight there as if attracted by the papers there, and I left him rummaging there when I called him away, and we both went upstairs—upstairs and down I should say—I was about twenty minutes—I searched the rooms thoroughly—when we came back Mulvaney did not go direct to the fireplace again—he began I believe with the mantel-shelf—he went towards the fire-place—the prisoners were in the same position as I left them, seated round a table in the front part of the room—I had seen Liban below stairs, not above, and Mulvaney went to the fireplace almost as soon as he entered the room—I saw him in a stoopiug position, and I saw him rise; he called out and I saw these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they were folded, not open—not much crumpled—much the same as they are now—Mulvaney may have said that when he found them they were crumpled up as if squeezed up in the hand—I do not know that I have heard him say so—at the Police-court one of the solicitors of the prisoners asked to have them preserved precisely in the same state as they were then—they were just the same as they are now—I have heard that Mr. Lewis made an observation to the effect that they were just as smooth as when they were first made, and I was requested to keep them precisely in the same state—I have had them in the strong room at the office since—they were not smoother then than they are now—much about the same—I have been particularly careful with them—it might have been ten minutes after returning to the room before the carpet bag was found—there were five policemen in the room—the table under which it was found was a small deal table—there was no cloth on it—the prisoners were committed in September—I was examined before the Magistrate, and so was Liban, Mulvaney, and Holmes—I took possession of what I found on Holchester's person, and of one or two letters, I think, relat<lb></lb>ing to the case which I found at his house—it was on Friday, the 25th, that I saw Holchester go into the house in Russell-street with a parcel—he came twice—I was then on the first floor of the house immediately opposite—the window was open, and there was nothing to obstruct my view—this was the only carpet bag I found in the house—I did not search Holchester's house before I arrested him.</p>

               <p>—I took it out, opened it, and there were five notes of five roubles each of the Bank of Russia—I am positive those notes were not in the grate when I searched it before—I said, "Here is something,"and handed it to Thompson; that was in the presence of all the prisoners—Holchester was at that time seated on a chair in the front parlour close to the window—he did not make any remark when I produced these notes, or did any of the other prisoners that I heard—I afterwards saw the carpet-bag produced, and heard Thompson ask if anybody had the key of that bag; and the prisoners who spoke English answered "No"—they expressed no surprise at seeing the bag there—they said they knew nothing about it; they had no key—it was then cut open by Thompson, and these notes found in it—he put them on the table, and cut the string, and said, "You see here is a good bundle of notes;"and Holchester said, "I don't know Russian; I never saw a Russian note in my life"—I don't remember whether Thompson said "Russian notes;"he said, "Here is a good bundle of notes."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">alluded to the recent Act (28 Vic. c. 18), in the following terms</hi>;—</p>
               <p>"<hi rend="italic">There is one question which, although, perhaps, it will not bear much on this particular case, is realty of great general importance. I allude to the effect of the new Act of Parliament which has been recently passed at the instance of Mr. George Denman, as to the summing up of the evidence by Counsel in criminal cases, because it really seems to me from my brother Ballantine's address, and from what I am given to understand has been the course of proceeding at this Court, that the object of that Act has been quite misunderstood, and if it is continued to be acted upon as it has been, it will be absolutely necessary that it should be repealed, or the course of criminal justice in this country will be seriously injured. Hitherto it has been the supposition that the Prosecuting Counsel was to consider himself in a hind of quasi-judicial position. Of course he has to conduct the case for the prosecution, and to bring forward these parts of the evidence bearing upon the prisoner's guilt, but he does that with a feeling of responsibility that he is not to be a mere Counsel to try to get a verdict, but an assistant to help the Judge, by fairly bringing forward that which is the case of the prosecution, and nothing more. At Nisi Prius, where the causes are between party and party, the position of counsel is different. There he is employed by a particular party to get a particular verdict, and, of course, he must use all fair means, and none other, to get that verdict. In Courts of Criminal Justice, Counsel is in a very different situation; the tendency of which should be to try to avoid technical objections and Nisi Prius tricks, so that the case may be tried upon its merits. The Act was passed, not as my brother Ballantine has said, making it the duty of the Prosecuting Counsel to sum up in all cases, but giving him the right and the power to do so in exceptional cases where it is necessary in order to set right something that has occurred in the course of the case different to what was expected. If that is followed out as was intended by the Legislature, fairly and candidly—namely, the Counsel to state the case before he calls his evidence—then, when the evidence is over, to say simply, 'I say nothing,' or 'I have already told you what would be the effect of the evidence, and there it is, you see the evidence is right; 'or in exceptional cases to say,' Something is proved different to what I expected,' and merely to give such an explanation of it as is required, and to confine himself simply to those excep<lb></lb>tional cases, then the administration of Criminal Justice will go on as it has hitherto done in this country, and as I hope it always will, fairly and properly, the Prosecuting Counsel being really apart of the Court, a minister of justice, filling a quasi-judicial position; but if Counsel are to think it a matter of duty in every case to sum up the evidence and to introduce into criminal cases the course pursued at Nisi Prius; if we once get criminal prosecutions con<lb></lb>ducted, not by a gentleman feeling himself to be a minister of justice, but by a person who is to open his case slightly, then call the evidence and then trust to an eloquent speech at the end, so as to have the last word with the jury, and thus make himself a partisan, it will be utterly impossible to conduct Criminal</hi>
               </p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186512180094"></xptr>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Justice as it has hitherto been conducted; it will become the positive duty and necessity of the Judge, instead of trusting the Counsel for the Prosecution, to assist him in considering what are the real points of the case, and in helping the Jury with regard to them, to have his attention distracted by watching and seeing that no unnecessary Nisi Prius advantage is taken by him in order to catch a verdict upon something not substantially on the merits of the case itself. I do not say that anything of the sort has been done in the present case. I quite agree with my brother Ballantine that it is in the discretion of Counsel whether he shall sum up his case or not, but I think that discretion should only be exercised in particular cases. If it is to be done in all cases I think the Act will become, instead of a boon, a great curse, and must be repealed. If it is carried out as it has hitherto been carried out on the Circuits, that is to say, if the summing up of Counsel is a privilege only to be exercised in exceptional cases where it is really wanted, and if the Counsel, exercising their discretion, will use the privilege sparingly, then, no doubt, it will do, as it was intended to do, a great deal of good.</hi>"</p>

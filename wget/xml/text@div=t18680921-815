I am a printer, at 48, Seward Street, Goswell Road—on Saturday, the 5th September, about 12 o'clock, I was going home—when I was about twenty yards from my door, I received a violent blow on the head, which knocked me down, and rendered me insensible—when I came to myself, I found I was in my own house—the prisoner was brought there—I did not see the person who struck the blow—I had 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in one pocket; that was turned completely out—I was very badly hurt, and have been attended by a surgeon.</p>

About 12.30, on the 5th Sep<lb></lb>tember, I heard cries of "Stop thief!" come from the direction of Seward Street—I saw the prisoner and another man come running towards me from Seward Street, followed by fifteen or twenty persons—I seized them—the prisoner threw himself down, and pulled me on the top of him, and I was obliged to let the other one go—a man came up and said, "He is one of the two who ran from where Mr. Gee was knocked down"—the prisoner said nothing—I took him to the station.</p>

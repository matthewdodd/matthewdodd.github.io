                  </hi>. I am the son of Richard Hint, who keeps a house, No. 13, in Wharton-street, in the hamlet of Ratcliff. On Saturday, the 3rd of Dec., I went to bed, leaving my clothes on a sideboard in a room on the ground-floor—my mother was the last person in that room—when I was there were window was down, and the shutters, which are outside, fastened for the night—the window was not fastened, but was down—it is a sash window—I went to bed about half-past eleven or a quarter to twelve o'clock, and these were the clothes I took off—I got up next morning about half-past nine or ten—the shutters had been then opened, and I missed a coat, waistcoat, and trowsers.</p>

                  </hi>. I am fourteen years old, and live in Wharton-place. I have known the prisoner about two years—I saw him on this Saturday night between half-past one and two o'clock—I have a place at a public-house, and when it closes on Saturday night I am obliged to do the tap-room up and other jobs, which keeps me there—I saw the prisoner at the corner of Whar<lb></lb>ton-place—he said, "Have you seen a man named Jop?"—I said, "No, I have not"—I do not know Jop—he then proceeded across the road to his companions, and said, "It is all right"—I saw three persons with him at the corner of Dunstan-place—I then went towards home, and going by the pro<lb></lb>secutor's house I saw a man at the shutters of the front room ground-floor—the shutters were partly open—the man had his hand up to the shutters, and something white across his arm—when I came up he put his hat across his eyes, crossed over, and be and another went up School-house-lane—I cannot say that was the prisoner, it was so foggy—it was about five minutes after I had seen the prisoner—I went home to bed.</p>

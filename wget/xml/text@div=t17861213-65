               <p>Was Fox in hearing? - I do not know; he was two or three yards distance; Elliot said, they took the veal to the King's-head, Monmouth-street, and sold it to his own father; and he said, his father gave him eighteen pence for it; and that it was up in his father's room; I went there to the Fountain in King-street, where Elliott's father lodges; I knocked at the door; I asked the father if Frank had sold a loin of veal to him; and he said, yes; I asked him where it was, and he said, in the closet; and at one end of the closet I found nine pounds of it; and Mr. Dort found another piece hanging upon a string; we took it down stairs, and brought the father with us; I took it over to my shop and weighed it; it weighed fifteen pounds and upwards; it was then worth five pence a pound; the two pieces fitted exactly.</p>

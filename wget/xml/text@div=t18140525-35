I took the box down, and served him; before I had done serving him, Robinson went out; the small one went out of the shop before I had served the tall one. After I had served the tall one he went out of the shop. I served him twopennyworth of ribbon. In about three minutes after, the person that left the ribbon with me came for the ribbon. It was gone. A gentleman left the ribbon. It was not my property; it was left with me by a gentleman. It is the order ribbon; it is the property of the Duke of Clarence; it is the ribbon for the sashes the Royal Dukes wear. There was about thirty-four yards of the ribbon. I missed the ribbon in about three minutes after the prisoners were gone out. I laid it on the window before they came in. From the time that I laid it in the window to the time we missed it did not exceed a quarter of an hour. The door had not been opened only by the prisoners. Nobody had been in the shop but the prisoners. The ribbon was the property of the Duke of Clarence. The ribbon was rolled up in paper; I put it in the window. A Mr. Jemmet had left it for me to make an order ribbon.</p>
               <p>Q. Has the ribbon been found - A. No, it has not, Nobody had been in the shop but the prisoners; the prisoners passed the window to go out of the door; it was inside the shop, by the window; it lay on the raised part of the window; they were quite near enough to take it away; they might if they had been so disposed.</p>

            . I was in the shop on the 13th of this month; Robinson came for a pennyworth of white ribbon to make a bow for a child's cap. I took the box down; I found there was none that would do. I said I had not any. He said he would call again, and went out. The other came in before he went out. He wanted a yard of black ribbon. He had a yard of two-penny black ribbon, and went away. We did not miss the ribbon until three minutes after they were gone. The gentleman came in for it that had left it, and then we missed it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had it been put - A. On the shew-board, in the window. Mrs. Rowley put it there. I saw it there before the prisoners came in.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any other person come in the shop - A. The door had not been opened, nor had any person been there until the prisoners came in. No one else had been in the shop except us two. There are two counters in the shop. The door opened by the window where the ribbons lay. There were two candles on the counter where they were served; there were none on the other. The prisoners were within half a yard of it when they went out.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Turner. When I was in the shop there were two other women in the shop.</p>
               <p>Miss Morse. There was a friend sitting by the side of me, by the counter, and another young person sitting upon a chair, talking; she was not a customer. That person is a woman we frequently employ; the other was a friend. They staid there until the ribbon was lost; they never moved from their seats. After the ribbon was put in the window they never arose from their chairs until the ribbon was lost. They could not have taken it, because it laid on the other window, the other side of the shop. One of them was sitting behind the counter, and the other was sitting on a chair by the side of me, where I was serving.</p>

            . I was informed of the robbery; I went to the house. Mrs. Rowley gave me the description of the prisoners. The next morning I took Miss Morse to the Park; I expected to meet the prisoners there; there a number of thieves attend on the parade every morning. On Sunday morning, I took the two prisoners in the Park; they were both together. The robbery was done on Friday evening. She pointed out the prisoners, both of them. I took Robinson; he was going to run away as soon as he saw the lady; I ran after him, and catched him. He denied being in the shop when I told him what I took him for. The other did not attempt to run away. They both said they lived in Drury-lane; there was no number to the house. In the evening, at the watchhouse, Robinson told me they both lodged together in Parker's-lane. I went there on Monday morning; I found they both lodged there. I could not find the ribbon. When I searched them I found five shillings and sixpence upon the person of each of them, in their pocket.

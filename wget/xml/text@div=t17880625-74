It is worth about 10 s. there is no mark upon it, but it was never off the premises; I suppose there may be about five ounces; he had worked in my shop about four or five months; we never put any marks, except upon the larger bobbins; he was a weaver, he wove livery and coach-laces, and worsted, or such as we wanted.</p>

I always bore an undeniable character; I leave myself to the clemency of the Court and Jury, hoping they will bring me through as well as they can.</p>

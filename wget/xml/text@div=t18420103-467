She was never called any thing but Cooper in her life—my name was Cooper before I was married, and I had her before I was married—the prisoner is my nephew—I was present when my daughter Rebecca was married to him, at St. Luke's, Chelsea, eleven years ago on the 13th of September last—the banns had been published—I was not present when they were asked.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, living at Wingfield, in Berkshire. I saw the prisoner at St. George's Church, Hanover-square—I did not know him before—he found me in Mill-street, close by the church of St. George's, Hanover-square—he asked me if I would go to church with him, as he was going to be married, and he had been disappointed of a young man coming to meet him—I went into the church, and saw him married—I do not know who he was married to—there was the bride-maid and me to witness the marriage—I never saw the prisoner before nor since, to my knowledge, till I saw him at the police-court—I knew him again, as T had taken particular notice of him—I was very busy when he came to me, and he was in a great hurry, for fear he should be too late—he gate me half-a-crown.</p>

I produce the copies of two registers of marriage, one at St. Luke's, Chelsea, and the other at St. George's, Hanover-square—I have examined them with the originals—they are true copies—I apprehended the prisoner on the 16th of December—I had known him before, and had been in the habit of seeing him—in Sep<lb></lb>tember last there was a dispute with him and some persons in Battersea-fields, who had knocked at his door—he came and asked me my name, and said he was going to indict the party at the Sessions for knocking at his door and assaulting him—he said afterwards, "They think I am afraid to do it, they think they have got a <hi rend="italic">pull</hi> on me for my first wife, but she was married before, and I don't care nothing for her."</p>

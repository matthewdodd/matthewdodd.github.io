            . - Q. How old are you? - A. Going on eleven.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the nature of an oath? - A. No; I never took an oath in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever learned your catechism? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether it is a good thing or a bad thing to tell a lie? - A. It is a bad thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where wicked boys that tell lies go to? - A. To the wicked man. (He is sworn.) On the 3d of December last I went to Mr. Deering's, about four o'clock in the afternoon; the prisoner sent me for half a quartern of rum, and gave me a shilling; she said she would wait at the corner of Wood-street till I came back with it; I left her at the corner of Wood-street, in Cheapside; I went to the Cross Keys, and saw Mr. Deering; she told me to go down that street, and turn up the yard; there is a yard goes up to the house; she stood at the corner of the street, and pointed out to me the yard; I asked the gentleman for half a quartern of rum, and he asked me who I came from; I told him I was come from a woman waiting at the bottom of the street; I paid him a shilling that I had received from the prisoner, I had no other shilling, and then he sent for a constable; the constable asked me where I lived, and where I came from, and I told him; then he brought me into the street to look for the woman, but the woman was not there; then the constable took me to the Poultry Compter; I afterwards went with the constable to Cock-court, Snow-hill, No. 12, the prisoner lodged there; I told the constable that that was the woman; then I saw her put three bad sixpences under a black silk cloak that laid upon a trunk in the room where she lodged.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell Fenner that you had seen her put three sixpences under the cloak? - A. I did; Fenner shook the trunk that was in the room, and afterwards opened it, and there was bad halfpence in it; she and I were both taken before the Aldenman; I was admitted an evidence, and she was committed.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was it not your own mother that sent you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Upon your oath, was it that woman or your mother that sent you? - A. That woman.</p>

               <p>Q. Did they not bind you out as an apprentice? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How came that? - A. I was not old enough, and my friends took me out.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, do you mean to say that your friends took you out? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who are your friends that took you out - are they able to support you? - A. They were when they took me out, but they are not now.</p>
               <p>Q. Who are those friends? - A. Mrs. Nevin and

               <p>Q. Did you not run away? - A. I did all the same, because my friends took me away along with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the Society know of your coming away - had you their consent? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did run away? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Your mother is dead now, is not she? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure of that? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not said to any body that she is? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Have not you told any body so within these few days? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. It is your mother-in-law that is now dying? A. No, my own mother.</p>
               <p>Q. I have been told that your mother has been<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180101140105"></xptr>dead some time, and that your mother-in-law is now dying? - A. No, it is my own mother; she married again after my father was dead.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you get your livelihood now? - A. My friends support me as well as they can, and I work at a letter founder's.</p>
               <p>Deering. When this boy first came to me, he said it was his mother that sent him.</p>
               <p>Court. After that I think Mr. Knapp will not press it, after this boy has laid it upon the prisoner to screen his mother: you see all the circumstances that he states would be right beyond the possibility of detection; and if it had not been for this declaration of his, what in justice might have been done. <rs id="t18010114-115-verdict651" type="verdictDescription">

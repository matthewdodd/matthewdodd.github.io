               <p>WILLIAM WYBROW. I live with my parents, in Morning-lane, Hackney. I kept fowls - they were all safe on Saturday, the 10th of November, at six o'clock in the evening, in a yard, which is enclosed with a fence; the next morning twelve of them were missing - I have seen eleven of them since, which were found at Mr. Bailey's, in Shoreditch, on the Tuesday following - these are them.</p>

            . I live in High-street, Shoreditch, and deal in poultry. These eleven fowls were brought to me by the prisoner, about half-past nine o'clock at night, on the 10th of November, for sale; I said I had as many as I knew what to do with - he was very desirous to sell them, and at last I told him I would lend him 9s. on them, on condition that he would fetch them away the beginning of the week, as I did not want them.</p>

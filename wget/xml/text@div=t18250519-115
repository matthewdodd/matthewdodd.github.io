            . I am an officer. On Thursday, the 14th of April, the prosecutrix applied at the office, and I went to Chequer-alley, Whitecross-street, and found the three prisoners there; I charged them with this - they denied all knowledge of it; I believe Glanfield keeps the house, and the others lodge there. I saw a trunk there, and after I had threatened to break it open Glanfield gave me the key; I opened it, and found the greater part of the property, and some duplicates; the prosecutrix found two caps of her's in the yard: she said they were her's, and Hickey and Orrigan abused her very much - I thought they were going to lay violent hands on her; but before the Magistrate Hickey stated that she had a pair of stockings on, and a shift, which were her's. I went again next day, and found this basket; and on Sunday morning I found these shoes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Do you know that Glanfield lives there? A. I believe so; but I was never there before.</p>

            . I went with Handley to the house in Chequer-alley; I do not know who lives in it: I had seen Glanfield about the neighbourhood. I saw the prosecutrix find the two caps, wet, on the line, and the other articles now found. On the Friday morning, when I went to take the prisoners to the Police Office, I said there was shift, a pair of shoes, and pattens, which had not been found - Hickey said she had got the shift on; she took it off; I then asked where the pattens and shoes were, and Glanfield said if I went to the house and searched a coal cupboard I should find them - I went and found the pattens; the shoes were found on the Sunday morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you hear Hickey say it was her box? A. Not that I know of.</p>

            . My husband is a coal-dealer, and lives in Princes-street, Westminster. Hickey and the prosecutrix came to my house on the 12th of April; Hickey said she had come from Ireland, and asked me to let her leave the prosecutrix there for a quarter of an hour or half an hour - she did not come back.</p>
               <p>HICKEY'S Defence. We were in the habit of wearing each others things - she gave me the bundle to mind for her; I told her she would find me at Glanfield's, in Chequer-alley, Whitecross-street; we got a little drop of liquor, and I came home, and did not go back to where I left her. Glanfield did not know any thing about what was in the box, but I took liberty to pawn 5 s. worth of them.</p>

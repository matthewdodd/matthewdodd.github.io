               <p>GEORGE EDMONDS. I live at Stepney. On the 28th of February I was going home, and got to <placeName id="t18310407-205-crimeloc1106">Stepney-green</placeName>

I said, "Yes, after a woman who has taken my watch;" he said, "She is gone up here, and can't make her escape - if you will stop here I will fetch a Policeman." which he did in two or three minutes - I went up with the Policeman, and found the prisoner in some rains; he said to her, "What have you done with the watch?""Watch! (says she,) I know nothing of any watch - you may search me if you like;" he looked about, and picked up the watch within a yard of her.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. I was called, and took the prisoner - she denied all knowledge of the watch; when I first saw her she was on her hands and knees, behind a heap of rubbish, covering something- I looked, and found this watch.</p>

               <p>the other man went away with Simpson, for him to show them the places which he said he knew they could rob—the boot place was one of them—I have been married to my husband about thirteen years, and had children—I have never been indicted in any way, except for this offence upon which I was acquitted.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's sister, and live at 16, Alpha-place, Cambridge-heath-road—I have lived there about six months—in August last, we lived at 8, Gardener-row, Twig-folly-bridge, Victoria-park—the prisoner lived there too—I remember the 21st of August, 1862, my brother was with us on that day—he was taken very poorly—he is in very weak health—he is never very strong—he was taken very bad with dysentery—I am quite sure about that—I have a reason for remembering the day—we were very badly situated; we had been in business and were very un<lb></lb>fortunate—I went round to my sister-in-law, and got a powder for my brother; he remained ill some days—the 21st August is my sister's child's birthday, and she was making a little cake when I went down—I am quite sure my brother was at home on that day, and that I am giving a correct account of the matter.</p>

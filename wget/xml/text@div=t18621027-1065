                  </hi>. I keep the Newmarket Arms, North-road, Camden-town, three or four hundred yards from Mr. Wood's—on 9th October, about 5 o'clock, the prisoner came with another man, and called for a pint of half-and-half, which came to 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.,—he gave me a half-crown—I was just going to look at it, when his companion said, "This is not the best half-and-half; let us have a pint of old ale; you paid for the last, allow me to pay for this"—then he said, "Go on, take it out of the half-crown"—I drew the ale, and he said, "I mean a pennyworth," and threw down a penny—that was not the price of it; that was done to confuse me—I threw the half-crown in the till—there was no other half-crown there—I gave the prisoner 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., in copper—Voke, I believe, came in, and spoke to me, in consequence of which I went to the till, took out the half-crown, and found it was bad—I tried it with my teeth—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I put it down on the counter, and the prisoner took it up, saying, "A bad one?" and put it in his pocket—he then gave me 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I gave him 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., out—a constable came in, and said to the prisoner, "Where is the half-crown?"—the prisoner said that he had not got it, and that I did not give it to him—I said that I had—his companion went away, and I went to the station with the prisoner, and as we went there, he threw away this half-crown—I picked it up, and gave it to the constable.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I am very cautious in taking money, but my eyes must have deceived me. I cannot tell how long I had had the half-crown. The woman I was speaking to asked me the way to King's-cross, and I told her, and the young man who spoke to me was a picture dealer who I know. I certainly did go into the first public-house, and have a glass of ale, and I called for a pint of half-and-half in the second. I paid with the first coin that came up in my pocket, and did not know it was bad. I was in deep conversation concerning business, and put it down carelessly.</p>

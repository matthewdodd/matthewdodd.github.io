                  </hi>. I live with my father, who deals in boots and shoes, About ten o'clock on Friday morning the prisoner came to my father's shop, and offered a pair of boots for sale—one of them was cut down—I had teea them at the prosecutor's shop on Monday morning, and they were not cut down—I am sure they were the same boots—in consequence of what I heard, I ran and informed Sumshon—he came back with me, owned the boots, and the prisoner was given into custody.</p>

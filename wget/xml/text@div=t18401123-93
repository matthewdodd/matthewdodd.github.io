                  </hi>. I am constable of the East and West India Docks—James was wharfinger foreman there. About nine o'clock on the morning of the 31st of October he came to me, and said there was a cart coming up loaded with wood, that he had got a pass for it, and, it was all right—he then went away—the cart came up, and Dawes presented the pass to me—I read it—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>—"Allow the bearer of this to pass the gate with some old wood from the yacht <hi rend="italic">Zariffa.</hi>

On Friday, the 30th of October, I was going up Poplar, and met Wade—he said he had some old wood in the Dock, would I buy it—I said, "What does it consist of?"—he said, "Chiefly of fire wood"—I said, "Is there about as much as is now on the cart?"—he said, "No, about the body of the cart full"—I said it would not be worth more than 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to me—when I got home I found James standing at my door—he said he had some wood given to him in the Dock, would I buy it—I said, "What is it?"—he said, "Chiefly fire wood"—I said I had been spoken to by a person in Poplar—he said it was the same thing—I said I could give him 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—I went to the Docks the next morning at half-past eight o'clock—I saw James, and Wade a little distance from him—James said, "Hoy! go round to the other side of the Dock, I will come to you"—there was a pile of wood near the barque <hi rend="italic">Zariffa,</hi> and the way James sent me was away from that pile—I went round, and waited till James came—he unlocked the door of a shed, went through, and told me to back the cart up to the door at the other end of the shed—when I did so I saw Wade coming up the shed—there was some wood in the shed, and a truck with one or two lumps of iron cantlins on it—James took hold of the handle of the truck—I said, "Are they going in the cart?"—James said, "Yes, I have had them given me"—I got into the cart, and the iron was handed in to me by both the prisoners, and then they handed up the wood to me—I deal in iron as well as wood—the wood was taken from the shed, not from the <hi rend="italic">Zariffa</hi>—I did not notice the lifting-jack being put in the cart—Wade gave me this pass—I paid James 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the wood—Wade then said, "Now about the iron; these two pieces weigh 3cwt.;</p>

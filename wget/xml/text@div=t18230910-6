On the 24th of August, about half-past four o'clock in the morning, I was awoke by a ring at the bell. I looked out of window, and saw a man, who said my property was being taken from my yard. I went down to the yard, in Angel-alley, where I saw three deals against the wall, about twenty yards from my yard; and further down the alley I found the table; my yard is walled round; they were there over night.</p>

            . I am a labourer, and live about two hundred<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182309100005"></xptr>yards from the prosecutors'. I am no relation of the prisoner, but have known him about three weeks. On the morning of the 24th of August, I was awoke by the noise of some dogs; I got up, saw two men on Mr. Heath's wall, and two deals against the wall. The prisoner was lowering down a table from the wall. The watchman was calling four o'clock, and they ran into a house opposite to my window. I saw them take something out of the drawer of the table. This was in Angel-alley. While I was dressing myself the prisoner took a bundle under his arm, and the other took the table. I went down to find the watchman, but could not. I called up Mr. Heath, and took him to the place; they had left the deals and taken the table, which was found up the court where the prisoner lived, and about one hundred yards from the deals. I described the prisoner, and he was taken that afternoon, and am certain of him - I had seen him in company with the other man before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not shew me 3 s., saying Mr. Heath gave it you, and you would stick to it that it was me - A. Heath gave me 3 s. for my trouble. I went up stairs directly, and did not see the prisoner again till he was apprehended.</p>

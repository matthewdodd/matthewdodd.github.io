                  </hi> I was co-assignce with the prisoner to the estate of a person named Bond; in the course of that business I became acquainted with his hand-writing—I believe this paper produced by Strickland to be his hand-writing.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The paper was here read as follows</hi>)—"Mr. Dawson has the painting of Jarius's daughter in security of the money I had on loan from him, which I wish to be settled, and intend doing so as soon as I get settled with Dr. Walker; but Mr. Sheard says he will try and claim the Statute of Limitation. This will show that he is a villain at heart, if he does so, and ought to be exposed to the world at large. See to this particularly. There are debts owing to me much greater than I owe, which can be collected, and every one paid that I justly owe, and there will be a surplus that will belong to you both, Mary and Beatrice. The disgrace which has been brought upon me by that villain, Crawley, is from my not consenting with him and Cremer to get possession of the Bull Inn, which I could not do; and I saw there was something underhand going on between them and Bond. When Cremer re<lb></lb>quested me to let him send in some articles to the Bull Inn he said that it might come to about 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but him and Crawley have made a different affair of it; but it will end in no good to either of them—one must go for an example to deter other such wretches from doing the like. I cannot help saying that my solicitor ought to have looked into this matter of Bond's before he advised me to be an assignee in his bankruptcy, and which, had he done so, would have prevented all that has now occurred; death is far more preferable than the disgraceful situation this villain Crawley has placed me in, and driven me to do that which I never would have contemplated. This action will, no doubt, cause a very great deal of grief to you all, but you must forgive it, as you can never expect that I can know happiness again in this world, after this villain Crawley's conduct towards me, and to see me pine away after day, I know would break your hearts; therefore console yourselves, in the best manner you can, and I trust you will meet with kind-hearted friends who will assist you and condole with you in your affliction, and time will wear smooth that which may now appear so rough and rugged to your views and feelings. Remember me to poor old Mr. Jacobs. I hope that Mrs. Drummond will keep her promise, and get your nephew, Johnny, into Christ's Hospital; I know if she can get a presents<lb></lb>tion that she will do it.—To Mrs. Mary Dixon and Beatrice Jenkinson Ovenstone. 46, Upper Charlotte-street, Fitzroy-square.

                  </hi> I am a surgeon, in Fenchurch-street. On the 14th of Aug. Mr. Crawley was brought to my surgery a little after four o'clock—I examined him superficially, and saw that the hemorrhage had stopped—he had a bullet wound over the right upper jaw—he expressed a wish to go to the hospital—I told him he could go with safety, and I left him for that purpose—I then went down to Mr. Crawley's office, and found the prisoner in the position the other witnesses have described, sitting in a chair, with his head on his hands—I found that the ball had taken a superficial course, and lodged under the integuments of the scalp—the hemorrhage had ceased—the ball had taken a course under the left cheek, but I did not examine it, my attention was principally directed to the hemorrhage—I felt the ball with my head under the skin—he asked me, "How is poor Crawley?"—I told him I thought he would do well—he appeared dejected—he made no observation—I asked him what had taken place, or whether he had shot himself—I did not know ex<lb></lb>actly then what had taken place, and he intimated to me that he was exceed<lb></lb>ingly sorry that the ball had not gone into his brain, meaning his own brain—I cannot remember the exact expression he used, but it was to that effect—Mr. Crawley's wound was likely to be a dangerous one.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi> I am surgeon to the Gaol of Newgate, and also surgeon to Sr. Thomas's Hospital. I saw the prisoner directly he was brought to Newgate—he had been previously under my care at the other pri<lb></lb>son—he</p>

               <p>was under my care from the time he was first remanded—I forgot the exact date, I think it was about the 18th or 28th of Aug.—he was taken to Guy's Hospital, and from there sent to us—he has been under my care ever since, either there or at Newgate, up to the present time—I have seen him constantly, and have, during the whole time, taken notice of his conduct, appearance, and demeanour—I have not observed anything to lead me to be<lb></lb>lieve that he is of unsound mind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Have you had conversations with him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—more lengthened of late than at first—I should say he was a reserved man—he was very much depressed when he came in—my evidence as to the state of his mind applies only to the time during which I have seen him—I have not been acquainted with his former habits of life, or the circumstances that surrounded him, shortly before this time, until the last day or two, I have heard a little, that is merely hearsay—I have known the desperate state of a man's pecuniary affairs to be a very frequent incident to partial derangement of intellect—great losses, or any great distress, will at times produce it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will it not very frequently be found that immediately before an attack of this kind, a man has suffered from some severe vexation or disappointment, from family troubles or pecuniary embarrassment? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It has been believed that those circumstances have caused such excitement at different time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I do not mean to produce a wild madness and madness of that descrip<lb></lb>tion to continue, but I mean that partial derangement which will account for a man on a sudden doing a violent act—do you understand the distinction? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I understand the distinction, but it is a very difficult question for me to answer—as far as I can answer it, I should expect that if a man's mind was upset by such circumstances, that it would remain so upset for a consider<lb></lb>able time—if I saw the person soon afterwards apparently sane, I should not be disposed to consider that he had been insane at that moment, for a short period, any more than I should if a man was put into a passion, which may be called madness—I know the senior physician at Hanwell, he is a man who is looked upon in the profession in every way as a man highly gifted, he has had very large opportunities of judging of this question, and of course his opinion would be worth more on such subjects than that of a person like myself.</p>

               <p>months previous to this event, I calculate, approach to about 2000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and most of them with intimate friends—that is quite independent of Mr. Bond's transaction, and the others to which I have alluded—the total loss was not so much as 5000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 6000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi> I am an accountant, and live at No. 26, Rodney-street, Pentonville. I have known the prisoner for twenty-two years—I have had opportunities of seeing him very generally during the last four years—I have latterly noticed a decided difference in his conduct and manner, an excitement brought on by his troubles—I never noticed conduct equal to that previously—it has displayed itself in various ways—latterly he could not have cast up three lines of figures—before that he was a moderately good accountant, not first-rate—he was able to cast up his books and balance them—he was not able to do that latterly—a lady, a friend of his, committed suicide this time twelvemonths—he had frequently alluded to that lately—it appeared to me to prey upon his mind very much—he has made very frequent allusions to it—I have frequently upon such occasions heard him give orders to his men, sometimes quite the reverse of reasonable—that has been latterly—he would arrange a thing overnight, and net morning not enter upon it, or entertain it, that was quite at variance with his former conduct—he has latterly spoken to me of apprehensions of a conspiracy—his pecuniary losses since 1844 have been about 3800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and since May last about 1100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>; three actions at law, one pending now, which will not realize a penny—he very recently gave a person named Johns, of Newman-street, credit to a great extent for goods—sufficient inquiries were not made as to the stability of that person—I and other friends urged him not go on with it, till he had made inquiry, but he would not—knowing his habits of business, I certainly think he would not have given credit upon a former occasion—he would have been more cautious—some person who owed him money pleaded the Statute of Limitations, upon which Mr. Ovenstone engaged himself in writhing large placards—I did not see where he stuck them—I heard him threaten what he would do—he has been for many years living with two unmarried sisters—one of these sisters has recently married—that came suddenly upon him—he felt that he was taken by surprise, and he said, in a desponding state, that all the world was going to leave him and abandon him—he was very desponding—his sister had formerly taken care of the household, and he regretted her goingaway from him—this is one of the sort of placards he wrote—(<hi rend="italic">looking at one headed "Statute of Limitation Act"</hi>)—I observed the effect that the actions and proceedings had upon him latterly, before the 14th of Aug.—he was very he de<lb></lb>pressed indeed, sometimes highly excited, did not know what he was doing, running about wild telling his troubles, them sitting down, going to settle his affairs, then leaving for hours together, I have come back, and found it in the same state, and found nothing done—he has been laboring under very strong excitement—every little thing that happened appeared to affect him latterly—I saw him on the 12th of Aug.—he was very much excited then, raving against parties that had put an execution into his house—his conduct was not at all national or reasonable, running out of the house, and running from one house to another—I was with him in St. Paul's Churchyard on the 12th—he</p>

                  </hi> I am a member of the College of Surgeons, and a licentiate of the Apothecaries' Company—my attention has been generally directed to the brain and its diseases, suicide, and insanity—I knew nothing of the prisoner before this offence was committed—I have been called upon simply to express my opinion as to his state of mind when the act was done—having reference to the depositions taken against him, and the evidence pro<lb></lb>duced, it is my opinion that he is not of unsound mind at the present moment—I have heard the evidence given by Dr. Conolly—I am entirely of opinion with Dr. Conolly that he was not aware of the moral nature of the act, that it was an uncontrollable impulse—I concur in the reasons given by Dr. Conolly for the conclusion to which he has come—I think that he was ignorant that he was doing wrong, that his mind was obscured with reference to the moral nature of the act, that he did not know it was wrong.</p>

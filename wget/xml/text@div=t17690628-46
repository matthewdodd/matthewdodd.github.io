I think one of them was in a waistcoat. I went home as well as I could, but cannot tell which way they went. I was very sore and ill. This was on a Saturday night. I went and advertised it on the Monday. The watchmaker that made my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176906280039"></xptr> watch, drew up the advertisement.

             took his watch. We went all to Billingsgate and spent the remainder of the night there. In the afternoon we took a walk to Stepney with a couple of girls; there I saw Patchett. I had never been in his company before. ( The rest as Patchett had deposed.)</p>

               <p>I never was in Howard's company but once in my life, that was about ten days before I was taken. He was drinking a pint of beer with two girls. He struck one of them. I said, that was not a manly action. He said. You dog, I'll strike you. I pulled off my clothes, but he ran away. I never saw him after till the 29th of May, when he asked me to take a walk to Stepney. Then he offered me half a crown if I could help him to a person to buy a watch; then Patchett came there. Afterwards they went to agree for it.</p>

            . I am a clothes-salesman. On the 11th of December, I was at <placeName id="t18230115-58-crimeloc336">the Vine, public-house, Bishopsgate-street</placeName>

M'Naughton was rather tipsy, and went to sleep in the house; the prosecutor came in with Newman - he ordered a pot of beer, and paid for it; they sat there for half an hour, and the prisoner offered to bet the prosecutor a shilling, that he had no money; the prosecutor then pulled out his pocket-book, and shewed him two sovereigns in a piece of paper, and returned it to his pocket. In a few minutes the prisoner swore he would have something to drink, he took the prosecutor's pocketbook out, and took out a sovereign; the prosecutor struggled to get it from him; he did not know that he had taken anything out; the prisoner gave it him, and went to the bar and got the sovereign changed - I fetched a constable. The landlord was busy and did not know it, he gave no reason for taking the money. I told him it was a shame, and he said I only wanted part of it, and abused me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I say anything about a 5 l. note - A. He told the officer afterwards, that the prosecutor had left a 5 l. note at some house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the landlord give the change to me or M'Naughton - A. He might have laid it on the table, but you took it.</p>

            . I was fetched to the Vine, and found the prosecutor there, neither drunk or sober. The people said the prisoner had taken a sovereign out of his pocket book - I asked the prisoner if he knew him; he said, Yes, he was an old master of his, the prosecutor said he did not know him. The prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"He is my old captain, come and go on board captain;" M'Naughton said he was not a seafaring man. I desired the prisoner to return the sovereign, he said nobody should have it, and that there was a 5 l. note in pledge for 2 s., and he should not have it unless he went with him. He took him out, up the Minories, and into George-street, then said</p>
               <p>"This is not the place;" he returned back to Aldgate, and said,</p>
               <p>"We will go no further to night, we will go to-morrow." He took 6 d. from his pocket, and said to me, here is 6 d. for you. The prosecutor said he was robbed, and he should not leave him - I then took him in charge, and found 12 s. in his mouth, and 4 s. 6 d. in his pocket.</p>

            . I found the silver on the prisoner.</p>
               <p>GEORGE M'NAUGHTON. I do not know how I got into the prisoner's company; whether I went in with him or he came in after me, I never saw him before; I was a little in liquor. I lost a 5 l. note - he was an entire stranger to me; I had been to different house. I did not see him till I got to the Vine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, I fell in with him; a parcel of boys were hooting him, as he was in liquor; I drove them away - he said I should have a glass for it. We went to several public-houses, where there was a parcel of girls. He said he would pay me for a day's work if I stopped with him. We went into this house - he was so much in liquor that he could not get a sovereign out of his pocket, so I did it for him.</p>

I live at 60, Webber Row—I am occasionally em<lb></lb>ployed at the West Kent Wharf—on the 7th December I was found, by a policeman, carrying a bag of corn—I was taken into custody, and then before the Magistrate—I received that bag of corn from the potman at the Yorkshire Grey public-house—the prisoner sent me for it—he said "You are done an hour or two before me, go to the Yorkshire Grey and get a bundle for me, and take it home"—that was about 5.30 on the Thurs<lb></lb>day evening, down in the stokehole, at the wharf—Thomas Norman, the stoker, was there—up to that time I did not know anything about a bundle being at the Yorkshire Grey—when I was taken by the policeman I gave him the name of the prisoner, and when I was taken before the Magistrate he was sent for—he was put into the witness-box and gave evidence—(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Officer M</hi>). On the 7th December, I and Kimber met the last witness carrying a bag containing corn, in the Borough Market—I called upon him to give me an account of it, which he did—in consequence of what he told me, I went to Wolsey's house—I saw him, and told him I was a police officer, and that I had come to ask him whether he had left any corn, or had sent anyone for any corn, or anything, to the Yorkshire Grey, in the Borough Market—he said no, he had not—I do not remember that I mentioned to him about having stopped Holmes—next morning Holmes was taken before the Magistrate, charged with having a bushel and a half of corn in his possession—I have the charge sheet here—he was charged with unlawful possession—the case was remanded for a few hours, to bring up Wolsey—when he came I saw him sworn—the Magistrate asked him if he had left any corn at the Yorkshire Grey, or if he had sent anyone, or Holmes, to the Yorkshire Grey, for corn or anything else—that was the question, as near as I can say—he denied it—the Magistrate asked him repeatedly if he had sent anyone, and he said no, he had not, on each occasion—ultimately the Magistrate dismissed the case against Holmes, and ordered Wolsey into custody.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. I am quite sure he told him to fetch something from the Yorkshire Grey, and I am quite sure I said that before the Magistrate—I said It the second time—I did not say it the first time—I was friendly with the prisoner, and worked for him—he keeps poultry.</p>

I am the overseer of the newspaper branch of the south-eastern division in the General Post Office—on the evening of 31st March, my attention was drawn to the prisoner—he was collecting newspapers and packets for the south-eastern division—when I saw him first he held an armful of papers in his left arm, and a packet in his right—after carrying it some little distance in his right hand, I saw him place it in his right hand coat pocket—he went to the south-eastern division table and placed the papers there—when he placed the packet in his pocket, he withdrew his hand at the same time, used it, and placed it back again—I reported the matter to Mr. Capstick, a brother officer—I went with the prisoner and Mr. Capstick into the inspector's room—the inspector ques<lb></lb>tioned him with regard to his having anything in his pocket that did not belong to him—he said, "No"—he pressed the question—he then said he believed he had taken a packet from the table, and at the same moment he produced it, and put it on the desk, from his pocket—this is the packet.</p>

I am acting inspector at the General Post Office—the prisoner was brought into my room about 6.30, on the evening of 31st March—in consequence of what I asked him, if he had anything on his person that did not belong to him, he said, "No"—I said, "Are you quite sure?"—he said, "Quite sure, sir"—I then said, "Now be very careful what you say; did you take anything off the table, and place it in your pocket, that does not belong to you?"—he said, "No, sir"—I said again, "Be very careful what you say"—then there was a pause, and then he said, "Well, I think I did, sir," and he produced this from his pocket—he first pulled out his handkerchief, and then he pulled out the packet—he said, "I put it in my pocket, but I had no felonious intent"—I think he said he pulled out his handkerchief with the intention of using it—the prisoner was collecting from the table—he ought to have left this packet at the south-eastern table, and not to have brought it back again—it was his duty to collect parcels of every description sorted to that particular division—he should have put it down with the other things he collected.</p>

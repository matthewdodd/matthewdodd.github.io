                  </hi>. I am a police surveyor. On the 20th of December last, about five o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner in High-street, Wapping, close to the London Dock—he had something con<lb></lb>cealed under a great coat, which he had under his arm—I stopped him in Church-street, and he then dropped a bag from under his great coat, which I found contained copper—I attempted to take him into custody—he made some resistance, but I succeeded in taking him, and asked him where he got the bag, but he would not answer till I got him to the office—I then cautioned him that what he said would be given in evidence, and asked him where he brought it from—he said, "Out of the London Dock"—I asked whether he worked there, and he said, "Yes."</p>

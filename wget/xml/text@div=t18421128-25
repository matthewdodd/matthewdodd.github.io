                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Cowell, green-grocer, Eagle-street, City-road. On Monday morning, the 31st of Oct., from a quarter past eleven to twelve o'clock, I saw the prisoner Carney go out of our door—I had not seen him come in—I thought he had taken something from the window; but not missing any thing, I directly went to the parlour, behind the shop, and the watch was gone from the mantel-piece—I then followed, but could not over<lb></lb>take him—I saw him, to recognize him, in Westmoieland-place—I had seen the watch not three minutes before—there was nobody with him.</p>

               <p>eleven o'clock—he asked me to go and pledge a watch—I took it to the pawnbroker's—they stopped it, and sent for an officer, who returned with me to the shop—I found Goodenough, and Carney with him—they were taken in charge—Goodenough said Carney had picked it up in his presence, that he saw him pick it up in Smithfield, or something to that effect—Carney was present, but said nothing.</p>

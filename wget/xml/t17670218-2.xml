Last Wednesday I went to London, about seven in the morning, and left my maid at home alone; I had a person came, and told me my house was broke open; I then came home directly; I found three chests and a chest of drawers broke open; I missed three gold rings, a girdle, a handkerchief, a new pair of shoes, a pair of worsted stockings and a shirt; I lost some money, but cannot swear to the quantity. The prisoner came begging in the hard weather, and I employed him, and he lay in the barn; I was going to clothe him, intending to make a good boy of him; here are the evidences that took him, can give an account of what things they found upon him.</p>

            . I am a plumber, and live at Hampstead. On Wednesday last, I and my friend went in at the Black Lion at West-end, there we heard people talking of this robbery; the man of the house described the boy to us, which Mr. Grove had a suspicion of; they said the boy went up a bye lane; we went up to a barn in the lane to search, and in searching about, trod upon the boy's feet, he was covered in the hay; we found his cloaths answered to the description; we charged him with this robbery; he confessed he had done it, and said he was very sorry, and delivered these things to us in the barn, (producing three gold rings, a silk handkerchief, a crape hat-band, and silk girdle; deposed to by the prosecutor, as part of the goods he lost at that time;) we asked how he got in; he said, the maid was gone up into the town, and there were some tiles broke, and he took off a few more, and got in, and took the things; we took him before the justice, and he was committed.</p>

               <p>THOMAS WILLIAM PERRY. I live in Playhouse-yard, Whitecross-street. On the 21st of January, between eight and nine o'clock in the evening, I went to the <placeName id="t18280221-21-crimeloc106">Lion and Lamb public-house, Golden-lane, Barbican</placeName>

I was knocked down; directly I got up some of those men knocked me down - I was kicked outside the door, into the kennel. Costar was served in the same way, I believe - I was taken home. I could not go home without assistance. I was kicked when on the ground - there were six or seven,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182802210031"></xptr>all on me at once. I was bruised about the body, and struck on my nose, which bled. I have not seen my handkerchief since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. By whom were you taken home? A. My wife, and two or three men; an officer took my companion home; we did not go home together; I saw no officer. I was never at this public-house, above twice in my life. The landlord said, "D-n the window! never mind the window; I have got plenty of money to pay for more." I am sure two panes of glass were broken; I had no hat on. The prisoner was not very sober, nor very drunk - I never spoke to him before, but I had seen him going backward and forward to the Lion and Lamb - he was taken in Playhouse-yard. I had no doctor, but was obliged to stop at home two days from work - I had no money about me - the prisoner was not so drunk as not to know what he was about; he was very violent - I made no resistance. I did not see Costar interfere - I did not fight at all. I would give 6d. for the handkerchief. The landlord is not here; he was in the bar when I was knocked against the window.</p>

            . I lodge with Perry. I went with him to the Lion and Lamb, and called for a quartern of gin; the prisoner was at the bar; and while I was drinking, he threw his bag in Perry's face, and struck him with it in the face. Perry said, "Don't do that, Bill, for I know you." He then struck him a violent blow with his fist; his head went through one square of glass, and his elbow through another - he fell, and the prisoner took the handkerchief off his neck; he whistled, and five or six came came out; we were both knocked down, and kicked about - I got up and was knocked down again. I was hustled and dragged out into Golden-lane; then some of them got round me, and some round Perry; they knocked us down, and kicked us while we were down. I saw the prisoner take Perry's handkerchief off; but could not see who he gave it to - it was passed to some of the men: the landlord was present - he is not here.</p>
               <p>Q. No money was taken from the prosecutor? A. He lost some money; he could not say who took it; and I lost 3s. from my right-hand trousers' pocket; but whether I was robbed of it, or lost it in the fall, I cannot say. I did not see any attempt to rifle Perry's pockets, or to rob either of us of money; the prisoner took Perry's handkerchief off directly he fell. I swear I saw him give it to some one; but who, I cannot say; and within three or four minutes, we were hustled into the street; they moved Perry down a court. I was beat so, the officer was obliged to take me away; I could not get on my legs.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did the prisoner live in Playhouse-yard? A. He lived at the back of a house, right opposite Perry's, on the second floor; but he was not to be found in the neighbourhood, till the night he was taken. I have not indicted the prisoner. I attempted to lift Perry up, but these men came out of the room, and knocked me down; the landlord came, and opened the door, while they dragged us out.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Did the landlord interfere to prevent this? A. Oh, no; I consider him as bad as the prisoner - he stood there and saw it.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you tell the officer who took you home, what had happened? A. Yes; I told him I lost 3s., but could not say I was robbed of it - I don't say I was robbed.</p>

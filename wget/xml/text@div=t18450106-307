                  </hi>. I live in Finsbury-terrace, St. Luke's. The prisoner was in my service—I lost a silver tea-spoon on the loth of May, and asked her for it—she said she did not know anything about it—on the 30th of Dec. I determined to part with her—Sergeant Brannan was present—I called her into the room to settle with her—I knew she had taken to herself a smelling-bottle, which was kept on my bed-room drawer, and! other things—I wished to get information from her, and the first thing I asked about was the silver spoon—she said if I would go with her into another room she would tell me all about it—Brannan said he did not come there for us to have any private intercourse, what she had to say she mast mention there, and said, "Where is the duplicate, for I dare say you have pawned it, have not you?"—she said, yes she had, and she went to get the duplicate—he asked her if she had not several others—she said she had—she got them, and produced thirteen duplicates—she said, all the articles mentioned on them were mine, except a shawl and gown which belonged to herself, but were pledged with a petticoat belonging to me—they were for the articles stated—they are all mine.</p>

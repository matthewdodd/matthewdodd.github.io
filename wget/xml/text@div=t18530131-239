                  </hi>. I am an oil and hop merchant in Aldersgate-street.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On 31st Dec., did you receive a letter from his attorney, asking you to pay him his wages? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There were no wages due to him—I took no notice of it—there was a letter to that effect written—there was an application made by the prisoner's attorney for his wages in that letter, but there were no wages due—there were two days and a half, I think, which my daughter can speak to—I took no notice of that application at all—I did not give him into custody till 11th Jan.—I had to make inquiries—I beard that he had taken a house, No. 124, in Aldersgate-street, to set up in business for himself—I never counted how many doors that is from my premises—one is on one side, the other the other—it may be 100 yards—he had to make disbursements, and to pay little money accounts over the counter, or little accounts, such as <hi rend="italic">empties</hi>, coming in, and so on—if he had not the money for them, he would come to the counting house for it—if he had any money of mine he would pay it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing he happened to have some money of yours in his possession might he have paid that money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, not for any of the accounts I charge him with—he would pay for anything that came in out of money he had in his possession, of course—my daughter kept my books—she used to settle with him every Saturday night—she never kept the petty cash book, I believe—she has it now, I believe—I believe she had it in her hands on the 13th of December.</p>

Q.</hi> Was it you that broke open the desk in the prisoner's absence? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was broken open in presence of my sister—it has never happened that the prisoner has paid the other men their wages out of his own wages—he has not paid Joseph Smith—I have not always furnished him with money to do it on the Saturday night, but I have on the Monday or Tuesday afterwards—I have not always given him sufficient on Saturday night, but I have made it up on the Monday or Tuesday—that has occurred once or twice—he has never advanced money for the business.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not give him another I O U? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was one in April, 1851, that was for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I believe—I have no entry in the book of that—we never enter these sums—I have not my books here—I have his little book that he always had—this was taken out of the desk on the Saturday night, and locked up till the Monday morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant at Park-lodge, Sydenham—on Thursday, 13th March, about half-past 12 in the day, I was sitting at the kitchen window in front of the house at work—the prisoner came up the garden to the window—she had a basket with some small mats in it, which she asked me to buy—I said, "No"—she stopped at the window for some time, and said, "Will you have your fortune told I"—I said, "No"—she said she would tell me a great many things—I asked her how much it was, and she said sixpence—I opened the window—she asked if I had a sixpence—I took out of my pocket three half-crowns—she said, "I can give you change, but hold that in your hand"—she then said, "Allow me to cross your hand with this silver," and she took up the three half-crowns and crossed my hand with them, and then commenced saying some words—she mentioned four letters, a "J," a "W," an "L," and an S, "I think, and asked which would I have?—I said I would have a "J"—she asked if it was for James or John—I said, "For John"—she said, "Well, that is true"—she put the silver in my hand, and then took it out a second time, and said, "You must lend me this for half an hour"—I said I would do no such thing—she said, "You must for a quarter of an hour"—I said I would not—she said, "You must for ten minutes, or what you propose will not come true"—she then hastened away from the window—I got up and went through the house into the garden, but she was gone—I saw no more of her till she was brought back by the policeman, in about half an hour—I am sure she is the same woman—I had plenty of time to see her features—I identified her at once—there was a little child selling mats next door when I went out to look after her, and she was kept till the policeman came.</p>

I received information from the last witness, in consequence of which I went in pursuit and met the prisoner at Sydenham-park, nearly half a mile from the house—I told her that I believed, by a description that I had received from a servant-girl, that she was the person who had been telling a fortune to her, and had taken three half-crowns from her, and she must go back to the girl to see if she was the person—she denied being the person, and went back with me—she had a basket in her hand with three mats in it, and some food—she was searched,</p>

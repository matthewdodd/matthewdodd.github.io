                  </hi>. I am landlord of the Golden Lion, at Fulham. The prisoner was my pot-boy. On the 9th of June, on coming down stairs in the morning, I missed some halfpence from the till—I searched the hay-loft—I found a lot of coppers done up in a large piece of paper, with some tobacco—I took them into the bar—the prisoner came in soon after and I called a policeman—I then took the coppers into the tap-room, and asked the prisoner if he knew anything about them—he said, "No"—there was a little tract amongst them—I said, "We will look at this book"—the prisoner then said, "That is mine"—he snatched it out of my hand, and I gave him in charge.</p>

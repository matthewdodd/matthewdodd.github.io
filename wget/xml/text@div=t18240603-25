               <p>"Let me have the key for my fellow-lodger is coming, and I want to get a fire" - my wife gave him the key, and he came down for a knife and fork - I know no more of the business.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long was it before you saw either of the men again - A. Not for four years; I described the prisoner to the officer on the night he was taken - I did fix upon a young man in Court as the person as well as the prisoner, and directed him to be taken into custody, thinking he was Harper - when he said his name was not Tubbs nor Harper, I let him go - I said he was the man till then, and that he was one of the two - I had never seen him before - I had seen Tubbs four or five times while he lodged with me; it might be ten times; he was always at home - I should not have known him in the street so well as in a house; he had not the same general appearance as when at home; the prisoner might have slept in my house or not; I don't know who enters my house or who goes out; they can go in and out without a key - I saw Harper go out on the night of the robbery; he gave my wife the key, and said</p>
               <p>"We shall be back presently."</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Does this man answer the description you gave to the officer - A. Yes; I described as him about my height, and from twenty-five to twenty-seven years of age; he had carried on the business of a working smith; he had a sailor's jacket on the last time I saw him; I described him to the officer in going along the street from Bow-street; I had not seen him before I described him to the officer; but I described him according to the recollection I had of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give the officer any other date - A. Yes; I did say 1821, from memory only - I had the account of it on slate; it was legible to myself; I had kept it against the wall, but I did not look at it till I took it to the Magistrates.</p>

I am the wife of the prosecutor - I know the prisoner; he lodged at our house; he came with Harper, on a Saturday evening; they lodged there for a fortnight; I saw him three or four times a day - on the day they left he came in, and asked for the key, and said he must get a fire for his bed-fellow; he had something in his apron, and said he should want a knife and fork and plate - I took them up in a little time; he had then got a fire; the beds were then made; as I left Harper came in, and came down soon after for a towel;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182406030013"></xptr>he said</p>
               <p>"I shall come down and settle with you;" he came down again with the towel; I did not see Tubbs at all then. I went up-stairs in about an hour after they were gone; the door was then locked - my husband came home about nine o'clock; we opened the door, and the bed was then stripped of every thing - I missed the articles stated in the indictment, which I let with the room - I went to the office, and there saw this young man, but I did not charge him with being the person; he is very much like Harper - I never said this robbery was committed in 1821; I told my husband he was wrong; he then went home and took the slate to the Magistrates.</p>

            . I am an officer. The prosecutor described the prisoner to me early in March, and said he was a short young man, with a smooth face, and that he had been robbed in 1821 - I went with them to a public-house on this side of Berners-street - I directed him to go into the Ship, public-house, and inquire if he worked near them; the prosecutor came out of the public-house, and said they did not know such a person - we all went into the house; Mr. Mallin's son was there; both the prosecutor and prosecutrix pointed him out as the person - the prosecutor said, as we went along, that his wife would know him better than he did, as she had seen him oftener, and she pointed Mallin out as the prisoner - when Tubbs came in they both turned round, and said</p>
               <p>"That is the man."</p>

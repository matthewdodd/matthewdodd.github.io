                  </hi>. I reside at Gothic Villa, West Green Road, and am nurse to an invalid lady—my husband is a shoemaker—I had occasion to go to the Duke of Cambridge, between 10 and 11 o'clock one evening, I don't remember the date, and I saw a lot of men and women there, quarrelling—I looked inside to sec if my husband was there, but he was not—I saw the prisoner standing at the bar with others—they were all quarrelling and jangling together, and they came out and had a fight in the road—there were three <hi rend="italic">navvies</hi>, the prisoner, and his wife—the <hi rend="italic">navvies</hi> knocked his wife down, and she cried "Murder!" as loud as she could, and Mr. Seddon went out to her assistance—she was lying in the road—he tried to lift her up, and the prisoner came up and pushed him away, and hit him in the mouth, and knocked him down; and as he was getting up he kicked him three or four times behind in the lower part of his body—I said, "You vagabond, what did you kick the man like that for"—he made use of very bad language, and said he would serve me the same if I did not go about my business—he was in a dreadful passion—Mr. Seddon got up and went into the bar, and the prisoner ran after him—I did not go in, I stood at the door and saw Mr. Seddon go into the parlour—I heard Mrs. Seddon say, "You vagabond, what are you hitting him for, you shall not hit him, you shall hit me"—I saw no more.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">DR. GREENWOOD</hi>. I reside at Canonbury Square, Islington—I knew the deceased about twelve years, and attended him professionally, previous to 14th July his general health was very good—six months ago Dr. Gibbon examined him with reference to a life assurance, and he was accepted as a first class life—I was called in to sec him on 28th July, a few weeks after this occurrence; he was then suffering from exhaustion and collapse, in consequence of a largo abscess; he complained of pain, it was a peroneal abscess, it was situated at the end of the spine, about an inch from the anus—there was a great deal of sloughing, the abscess had been opened by another doctor—it must have been caused by a good deal of violence—there was a great deal of bruising—the prostration was caused by the abscess, that would be the natural effect of it—he gradually sank, and died on 12th August, early in the morning—I attribute his death to the exhaustion consequent on the abscess.</p>

               <p>Q. In consequence of the production of that certificate, supposing it was good, would he be entitled to receive wages? - A. There may have been instances in which seamen may have received them upon such a certificate, but it is usual always to have an unserviceable ticket, which he stated he had lost; I looked at the certificate, and he immediately, of his own accord, produced another certificate, saying, that he had wages due, likewise, from the Medusa; I read the certificate.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the certificate that he produced when he said that? - A. It is; I read the certificate, and observed, therein stated, that his name was Henry Grote; I asked him, why he was called Henry Grote in the Medusa, and Henry Smith in the Mars; the reason which he assigned was, that when he went into the Medusa, that was his first ship, and at that time he spoke very bad English, and he supposed the clerk had made a mistake, and put him down Henry Grote, when he meant to say Henry Smith; I examined the books, and found that there was a Henry Grote in the Medusa, and that he was discharged to the Mars; his name then stood, in the muster-book of the Mars, entered from the Medusa, in a very regular manner; and there was, likewise, a man of the name of Henry Smith, regularly entered as a sailor there.</p>
               <p>Q. Open your book, and see whether you are correct in what you say? -

Plymouth Hospital.</p>
               <p>Q. Does the number, in this certificate, agree with the number in the book as attached to Henry Smith? - A. Yes; I paid Henry Smith his wages on the 22d of June last.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of this, what did you do? - A. I clearly perceived that he was personating Henry Smith; I took him to one of the superior clerks, who told me to let him go about his business, as a vagaboud and deserer, and telling him that it was a capital offence, however, the chief<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179812050053"></xptr>clerk happened to come in, and was of opinion that it was necessary he should be apprehended, and he was apprehended.

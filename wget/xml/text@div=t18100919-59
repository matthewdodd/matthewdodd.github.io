                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181009190036"></xptr>Q.Was there any trunk or box in his room - A. That trunk I have every reason to believe is the same, it has the letters I. T. upon it; the trunk I found there had those initials. I found in the trunk this small box, he opened the trunk himself with this key which he produced.</p>
               <p>Q. That box that you hold in your hand was found in the trunk - A. Yes; in this drawer I found nine five-pound bank-notes, them are the notes that I found accompanied with four one's, these are the four one's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask the prisoner what he had done with the Stratford-notes - A. He acknowledged that he had taken the letter, that he went to Sir

            's the morning that letter arrived or the morning following. I believe it was the day the letter arrived, and these banknotes I found in the trunk were part of the produce. He stated that he had bought clothes for which he had paid near ten pound, that he had changed some of the other notes, but he did not go into particulars as to whom he had paid them.</p>
               <p>Court. Where was this letter - A. In his coat pocket that he was wearing.</p>
               <p>Q. The letter was not concealed then - A. No certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say from what part of the office he stole it A. No not as I know of.</p>
               <p>- JOYCE. Q. Did you go with Mr. Sparkes, to the prisoner's lodgings on the morning of the 27th of July - A. Yes I did; not finding him at home, I went again at eight o'clock in the evening he was not at home; I went again about ten minutes to nine, he was then come in; I asked him how he did, he said he was much better he had been ill some time; I told him I was glad of it, I sat down, I told him he was wanted at Mr. Parkins's that evening he wished to know what was the matter; I told him I did not know, he wanted to know if it would do in the morning, I told him no, I must go myself if he did not go with me, he directly said, if I would stop a bit he would go with me, he walked directly out of the room into the passage, and I got up from my seat to the door in the passage, he had slippers or shoes on at that time, he put on his boots and returned to me in the room, I suppose it was not two minutes at least; I asked him if he was ready, he told me he was, he came out and immediately laid hold of my arm, and walked with me to Mr. Parkins's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you in the course of your way acquaint him with the business - A. That would have been impossible, I did not know it myself; I asked him questions deviating from what I thought it was. When he was brought to Mr. Parkins, he was not at home; Mr. Sparkes came in. In a few minutes I saw a letter taken out of his coat pocket, my initials are to it, I have no doubt that is the letter. Mr. Sparkes asked the prisoner where he got that letter, to the best of my recollection he said, he did not know how he came by it. After Mr. Parkins came home, I heard him acknowledge that he had stolen it; I remember hearing him say he was there; I do not remember any more he said, he acknowledged that he had been guilty of stealing it; he acknowledged his guilt, what words he made use of I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. I take it for granted as you walked together to Mr. Parkins, you told him he had better tell you all he knew, and you would endeavour to serve him - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then when he came to Mr. Parkins's office, the clerk was to take in writing what he said, the same as if he was a Justice of Peace; was there any Justice of the Peace present - A. Not as I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. So then there was no friend of the prisoner there; an examination of the prisoner takes place and it is taken down in writing, both the interrogatories and answers, did you attend to take in writing what the prisoner said - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Sparkes did - A. I believe so, I expected so.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of that writing - A. I know not.</p>
               <p>Q. All that you have been stating against the prisoner was taken down by Mr. Parkins or by Mr. Sparkes - A. I suppose so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he at first deny all knowledge of the letter when Mr. Sparkes was interrogating him - A. He certainly did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you or any body else say any thing to get him to alter the declaration that he first made - A. Nothing was said to him whatever to induce him to make a different declaration.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH BONNER. Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. Yes, he lodged with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever accompany him to buy any linen - A. Yes; on the day after he left the office to the best of my recollection he laid out five-pound, and some odd money, he paid it in a note and some odd shillings, he brought a trunk home in a coach, I think that is the trunk.</p>

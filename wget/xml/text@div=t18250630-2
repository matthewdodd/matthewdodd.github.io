On the 30th of May, about half-past twelve o'clock, I went up to her room, every thing was safe then - I locked the door, brought the key down, and about a quarter past two I went up and found the door closed, but unlocked; the drawers open, and things taken from there, and different parts of the room. The lock was not injured at all. I knew the prisoner - she lived near us, with Mr. Tottenham; I had not seen her that day: she came to our house at times, but was never up stairs to my knowledge.</p>

            . I lodge in the same house as the prisoner - she lived with a man named Tottenham. On Whitsunday, between six and seven o'clock, Tottenham came home, and struck her, and hurt her very much - she took to her bed, and was a bed on Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday, and went to the hospital on Friday; she could not go up and down stairs without help; she could not go out without my knowledge.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What became of the man who beat her? A. He went out - he came home that evening, and went to bed with her, and remained at home. I was at home when she was apprehended; I cannot say whether it was on Wednesday or Thursday.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in the course of the same week in which he beat her? A. Yes, I am sure of that.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there had not been another Sunday? A. No, I am quite sure of that; she was only a quarter of an hour gone to the hospital.</p>
               <p>Q. If she was taken before another Sunday came round, and went to the hospital on Friday, she must have been taken on Saturday? A. I rather suppose it was Saturday; I am sure another Sunday had not come. I believe Tottenham has lived with her for twelve years - he is a horse-dealer, buying and selling them for gentlemen. I saw him this morning at the house - he still lives there.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. At what time did you come home on Sunday? A. About four o'clock in the afternoon. I found her in bed; Tottenham came in and slept there that night - he is a horse-dealer at Smithfield, I believe; he left the house when she was taken up, and has not been near the house since - I live there now. She was taken up on the Tuesday fortnight after the Whitsunday, as well as I can recollect. Two Sundays had passed before she was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she been out of doors before she was taken up? A. She went to the hospital on Friday; she got rather worse after that, and did not go out again till she was taken. I saw Tottenham an hour ago.</p>

            . I am a journeyman tailor, and husband of the last witness. The prisoner and Tottenham co-habited together, on the same floor as I live. On the evening of Monday, the 22d of May, I was in my room, which is divided from their's by a wainscoat - my wife had gone down stairs; something passed between them about liquor: I heard her give him a blow, and he knocked her down, and kicked her; she came to me in about ten minutes, and said he had nearly killed her - that he was gone out. I work at home. Tottenham was absent two days; she was in bed, or sitting in my room, and did not go down stairs till Thursday, when my wife helped her down; she went to the hospital on Friday: she returned, and I told my wife I thought she would never get over it. When she was taken she came into my room, and said,</p>
               <p>"They have taken me for Beal's robbery."</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long did Tottenham absent himself? A. Two days, but he slept there every night.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she able to go out after Friday? A. She was in and out as well as she was able. I think she was taken up on the Tuesday fortnight. Tottenham is now outside the Court.</p>

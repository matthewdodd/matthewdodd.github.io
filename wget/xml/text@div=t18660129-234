                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry Mould, 8, Clarence-place, Dept-ford, a greengrocer—I know the prisoner by sight—she came through my shop into my private room, and asked permission to go to the closet—she has been a customer several times—she had been drinking—she was not carrying a child—when she came from the yard, I noticed something very bulky under her shawl—she walked quickly out of the house—I called after her, but she would not stop—she seemed to know what she was about quite well—I went after her, stopped her forty or fifty yards from my house, told her she had got my boiler, and asked what she was doing with it—she began to abuse me—I insisted on her giving me the boiler and coming back to my shop—the boiler holds nearly a pail of water—she threw the boiler down in my shop—I asked her for the lid, and she told me to look for it till I could find it, and was very abusive—I afterwards found it amongst some sacks in the shop—I had not seen her put it there, but I saw her throw the boiler down when she came back—I saw the lid in her hand as she passed through my room projecting from her shawl—I gave her into custody.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I went into Mrs. Mould's to ask her to lend me six-pence, and then I asked her if I might go into her back premises, and she said "Yes; "when I came out I bid her "Good night," and went to the butcher's, four or five doors up; she came after me and said, "You have got my copper boiler." I said, "I have not." I never went inside the shop again—I had my little boy with me.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, R</hi> 294). I was called in by the prosecutor, and the prisoner was given into my charge—she was drunk—I told her I should take her in charge for stealing a pot—she became very outrageous, threw herself on the ground, and tore my face—she said she did not steal it—when locked up, she said she could do six months on her head for that thing.<hi rend="smallCaps">

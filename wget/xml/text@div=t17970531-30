             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Raine. I am a cheesemonger, in Honey-lane-market: the prisoner came to our house a little time back, I cannot say when, I think within these three weeks; he said he had got a book of wastepaper to sell, and asked what I gave a pound; I said, two-pence a pound was the price of waste-paper.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know it again if you saw it? - A. I do not know that I should; I think I gave him fourteen pence for it; soon after, I cannot say whether it was a week or ten days, Mr. Bolland's servant came for some butter, and I tore half a sheet of to put the butter in, and sent it to Mr. Bolland's, by his servant.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Raine. I am clerk to Mr. Bolland: I received a book from the last witness, which Dickinson, the officer, has; it was delivered to him. (Dickinson produces the book).</p>
               <p>Heptinstall. This is the book.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when any thing was said to the prisoner about the book? - A. Yes; I told him the leaf had come home on a lump of butter, and that had led to the discovery; I asked him if he had ever sold waste-paper or taken any books away.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you told him it would be better to confess? - A I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure of that? - A. Yes; he denied it; he then left our house and went to breakfast; I saw him again between nine and ten o'clock; the maid-servant went and fetched the book, and I did not say any thing upon the subject, to him, till one or two o'clock; he persisted in denying that he had taken it, and I insisted upon his going to Mr. Thomas's with me; when he found that we had got the book in our possession, he said he had taken it away, and sold it to Mr. Thomas, for fourteen pence, and there the matter rested till Monday, to look over our books, to see if any thing more was missing.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the book that he said he had sold to Mr. Thomas? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Dawson). Is that the book you gave to Mr. Heptinstall? - A. Yes; it is the same that I had of Mr. Thomas.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Heptinstall). Do you know that to be Mr. Bolland's book? - A. I do, by the hand-writing, it is a day-book.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. (To Thomas). Is that the book you bought of the prisoner? - A. I cannot swear that it is, I believe it to be his.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I have lived with this gentleman seven or eight years, and have been entrusted with cash and goods; I never defrauded him of a single shilling; Mr. Heptinstall has known me ever since I have lived with Mr. Bolland.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Heptinstall). Has this man had a good character with you as to honesty? - A. Yes; prior to the present time.</p>
               <p>Q. What date is this book; is it a book in constant use? - A. No; it is a book from 1781 to 1783.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it kept? - A. Amongst the other books below that were out of use.</p>

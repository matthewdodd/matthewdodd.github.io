                  </hi> I live in Queen-street, Brompton. The prisoner was in my service six or eight months, to carry out milk, and receive money from customers—he left on 13th Nov.—when he got money he ought to account to me for it the same evening, get the bill receipted, and take it back again—if I was not there he should give it to my wife, but to no one else—Mrs. Scaton, of Lowndes-street, is a customer of mine, and pays monthly—he has never accounted to me fot 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. received from her at any time.</p>

               <p>money from very few—he used to bring the books to me—he made no me<lb></lb>morandum himself—it was sometimes six weeks before Mrs. Seaton paid—this is the only charge against him, but I let him off once before.</p>

                  </hi> I am in the employ of Ellen Seaton, of Lowndes-street—I used to pay the prisoner money—there was a book kept—it is not here. On 18th or 19th Oct. I paid him 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I gave him the book, and did not get it again for a fortnight—I have paid him other sums besides.</p>

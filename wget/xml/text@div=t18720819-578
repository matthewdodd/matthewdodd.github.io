                  </hi>. I am a labourer, living at 28, London Terrace, Commercial Road East—on Friday evening, the 21st June last, I was near Spitalfields Church at about 7.30, when I saw the prisoner strike a woman in the face with his first—he struck her four or five times—I went up to him, and, taking him by the collar, said that if he struck her again I should strike him—he said "You would, would you?" and, at the same time, he put his hand into his right trousers pocket and withdrew something—he then made a blow at me with a knife, and as he did so, I turned on one side, and, instead of the knife catching me in the stomach, it caught me in the groin—he then ran away, and I called out "Police! stop him!"—I caught hold of the wound to keep it together and stop the bleeding, and some time afterwards I was placed in a milk-cart and taken to a hospital.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had a stick in my hand at the time, of about 1 1/2, in. in thickness—it was a roller, such as is commonly used in drapers' shops for ribbons—I might have struck the prisoner with my fist at I <hi rend="italic">grabbed</hi> him by the collar—I said when before the Magistrates that the prisoner struck the woman three or four times—I can't say whether my evidence was correctly given in the depositions—I don't understand their writing—after I saw him strike the woman, in the first instance, I followed him, and when he struck her again, I interfered—I believe he would have struck her more, and he might have used the knife if I had not gone to him—when he struck at me I felt myself hurt.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman H</hi> 242). I was on duty in Commercial Street, and saw the prisoner about 8.30, having some words with a woman; his wife, I believe—I afterwards saw him strike her, and almost immediately the prosecutor went to him, and took hold of his collar—the prisoner then went backwards, and drew something from his pocket; then he rushed at the prosecutor, and struck him an upward blow, and the man fell back—the prisoner ran away, and was stopped by another constable—on the way to the police-station, he took a knife from his pocket and tried to drop it behind him, but I took it, however, from his hand, and I now produce it—it was wet with blood—I saw the prisoner strike the woman but once only.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not see Leary strike the prisoner, but I saw him take the man by the collar as if to prevent him striking the woman again—he might have struck a blow when he caught hold of the collar—it might have been a blow and a catch at the same time—Leary had a small roller in his left hand—the prisoner appeared to be drunk, and very much excited.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">DR. S. A. GILL</hi>. I was house surgeon at the London Hospital when the prosecutor was brought in on 21st June—he was suffering from a wound in his left groin, two inches deep and an inch long—it was a cleanly cut wound, and an artery was bleeding very much—it is a severe wound, and dangerous—a great deal of force must have been used to cause it, as the knife went through the trousers and shirt and two inches into the thigh—he was in danger for several days.</p>

I was in the Commercial Street on the evening in question, and saw the prosecutor fall back and the prisoner run away—I picked the man up, put him into a cart, and took him to the hos<lb></lb>pital—at the station the prisoner said that the prosecutor had interfered between himself and his wife.</p>

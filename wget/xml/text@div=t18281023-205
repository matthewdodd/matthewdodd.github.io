               <p>WILLIAM ISHERWOOD. On the 18th of September, I was coming down Regent-street, and stopped to see some young men behind me; they charged the watchman with me - I was taken to the <placeName id="t18281023-205-crimeloc1198">watch-house</placeName>

I said the prisoner - he then went and searched the prisoner's coat, which he was mending - but he could not find any money; he then searched him, and pulled the money out of his watch-pocket - I had told the officer what money it was.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. He first said it was in a steel purse? A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You said, "I had a sovereign in a purse, in one of my breeches pockets?" A. No - I did not say it was in the purse; the purse was in the same pocket - I said a sovereign and a purse.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Let the money be brought forward, and if there is any mark on it, let it be his; I know it is mine- I got 25s. from my master, and put it into my fob pocket; I had 4s. 6d. before, and that they found on me - he said he had his money when he was standing by a lamppost in Bond-street; he charged the two watchmen first about it. Witness. No, I did not; I asked them about it - I am certain I had it when I went to the watch-house; the prisoner said he had no money but 2s., and he told the Magistrate he sold a hat the night before for the money; I had no mark on my money.</p>

            . I am gaoler at Marlborough-street. The witness and prisoner came to the office, and the charge was heard; the witness then had to pay 1s. for his discharge - he had not got it, and I was ordered to detain him; in going down he said, "It is very hard I should have to pay 1s. for my discharge, when I have been robbed of a sovereign, two half-crowns, two shillings and a sixpence;" I said, "Did you tell the people at the watch-house?" he said Yes, and they had searched every body, and could not find it; he then said he suspected the Irishman I had just locked up; I called the prisoner and said, "This young man says you have robbed him; Do you know any thing about it?" he said No; I said,"I will search you;" he began to pinch my toes - I said,"That won't do - I shall search you;" I took this money out of his fob-pocket - it corresponds with what the prosecutor says; the prisoner said he received it from his master a fortnight before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had but 4s. 6d. that night, and I had paid 6d. for my breakfast; I then had two shillings, two sixpences, and some halfpence in my pocket; my sister came to the place where I was, and I told her to go to my master, who would come and speak for me - he could not come, but he sent 25s., which I put into my pocket; my master has been here, but he was obliged to go - his name is Benman, and there is a young man in Court who he accused before me; the watch-house-keeper could not find any thing on me.</p>

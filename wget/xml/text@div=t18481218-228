                  </hi>. I live in Red Lion-square, and am a wholesale perfumer—the prisoner was in my service—I deal for tin-foil with Hemsley and Simpson—I allow the cuttings of the tin-foil as perquisites to Charters and Swan, who are in my employ—they collect the waste till it accumulates, and then sell it—I have seen the tin-foil produced—it is not such as goes by the way of waste or cuttings—this has been cut out of sheets—it has not been used—there is no mark on it, but we have put the pieces together, and they make a sheet of the same size as we are in the habit of having from Hemsley and Simpson—it is just the same as we use—the prisoner has worked for me three years—it is no part of his business to cut up tin-foil—he had no business with it at all—I went to Hemsley and Simpson and saw the prisoner there—I asked him who was connected with him—I did not tell him he had better tell all that he knew; that was a subse<lb></lb>quent remark—I gave him no promise till he told me what he did—I asked him how many times he had brought tin-foil there for sale—he said, "Once or twice"—I then appealed to those present, and the reply from them was, "Upwards of a dozen times"—the prisoner replied he did not think it was so many times as that—I then asked him what room he took it from—he said, "From James's room"—I asked him if he took it out of the cupboard—he said he did not, he took it from off the top of the cupboard, and off the counter—I asked him what he cut it with—he said, "A pair of scissors."</p>

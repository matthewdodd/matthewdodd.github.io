                  </hi>. I am waiter to Henry Thomas Bromley, of the Brecknock Arms, Camden-road. About eleven o'clock, on the 13th of Nov., I hung two dead pheasants in the passage leading from the front door to the garden—I missed them between eight and nine—I had seen them safe at six—I gave in<lb></lb>formation—I</p>

               <p>Court to Mitchell. Was you drunk or sober? - Why, Sir, I had been drinking a little, but I was not drunk at that time.</p>
               <p>You said, you came into that house by yourself? - I did.</p>
               <p>Had you been at any other house? - I was in the Hope, by Cheapside, I was not at the King's-head, I was not in company with Margaret but in that house.</p>
               <p>Did you come into that house with her? - No.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. The circumstance of privacy seems to be personal, to the person that commits the fact, and that of the person who is present, aiding, and assisting, is guilty of the felony, yet as it depends very often upon the personal dexterity, it might not be fit perhaps to punish the person who means to be aiding and assisting in the general offence of stealing, with the same severity therefore the rule has been, to confine it to the individual hand tha t commits the fact; therefore, if it cannot be said, that both the prisoners were guilty of the private stealing, it is the safest way to acquit them altogether of the criminal charge.</p>

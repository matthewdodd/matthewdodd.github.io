               <p>Court. Is there any other name to the place? - Not as I know off; I was riding down the lane, and I saw two people walking before me, one on one side, and the other on the other.</p>
               <p>Was you on horseback? - Yes; as soon as I rode up betwixt the two they laid hold of my mare's bridle, and presented a brace of pistols to my breast, and demanded my money; the prisoners are the two men.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen them before? - I cannot say I did, but I then knew their faces.</p>
               <p>Was it light or dark? - It was not dark, it was getting dusk; they declared if I would not give up my money directly, they would blow my brains out; and they searched me: one of them put his hand into my pocket, and took from my pocket two guineas, and a sixpence, and a silk handkerchief; and the other took five penny worth of halfpence: I am sure the prisoners are the men.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did they oblige you to dismount from your horse? - No, they would not let me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Fletcher. Who took the halfpence? - The man in the light hair (Fletcher); I knew their faces; I knew them to be natives of the place.</p>

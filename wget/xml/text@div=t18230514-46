            . I live in Bell-lane, Spitalfields. On the 1st of May, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I had my purse containing this money in my basket - I had been to a shop in <placeName id="t18230514-46-crimeloc254">Aldgate</placeName>

I stood looking in at the window; the prisoner stood at my side - I felt something touch me; I looked down, and saw him take his hand out of my basket, with my purse in his hand - he ran off; I pursued, calling Stop thief! he was stopped before I lost sight of him. Three boys were standing by him when he took it. The purse was not found - I am certain I saw him with it.</p>

            . I am a corn-dealer, and live in Chichester-place, St. Pancras. On the Monday before the 10th of December, Smith the prisoner, called to inquire the price of malt between eleven and one o'clock; he went away - Hare then came to ask if I was a buyer of malt; Smith then came and brought a sack of malt which they both said they had found by the coach rank at Islington; I saw on the sack "Henry Hole, Edmonton," marked in red letters - I told them they had better go to the person whose name it bore, and tell him they had found it; they said they thought they should not get paid if they went, and asked me to pay their expences; I said, "Then write, or I will write for you, to save all trouble;" I took a piece of paper and wrote in their presence, and gave the letter to a man who came in on business - they saw what I did, and said they thought it was the best thing that could be done; they left the malt with me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You wrote by their desire? A. Yes, and Mr. Jones came to town; the prisoners called frequently after I had written, to know if I had had an answer - and when Mr. Jones did come, I sent to the White Hart and one of the prisoners was there - he came directly, and the other soon after; I know the prisoners to be hackney coachmen - there was nothing to prevent their cutting the name out of the sack</p>

Three days ago Hunt came to drink at the bar, and spent some shillings or 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. there each day.

I lent him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he gave me this I O U," producing it from his pocket to me—he said "It was arranged between us that I should present the bill, and Hunt would come to the Coach and Horses at 7 o'clock for the balance"—I asked him Hunt's address—he said that he did not know beyond "Leeds," but that Hunt would come that evening for the balance—I asked him if he knew no other address—he said no, but he had been drinking there two or three days—I asked him if he could find him—he said he did not know, but he would be at the Coach and Horses that evening at 7 o'clock—on that he was given in custody—I saw him searched and 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and some duplicates found on him.</p>

I rent a room at the Coach and Horses, 81, High Holborn, which I use as a dining-room—on Saturday morning, 12th October, about 9 o'clock, Donald came there and said, "I should like to lie down on the stairs until Horton comes, with whom I have an appointment at 10 o'clock, as I particularly wish to see him, he has to do a job for us in the City, and they will have plenty of <hi rend="italic">quids</hi> in the evening"—I knew Horton there by sight, and I might have seen Ming—I allowed him to rest in my room, and about a quarter to 11 I saw Horton and Ming in the bar together—I said to Horton, "Donald is resting, and he wishes to see you as the appointment is for 10 o'clock"—they went up to the room where Donald was lying, which is separate from my dining-room, and at 11.15 I went into my dining-room and saw Horton and Ming sitting together—Donald was not there, I saw him in another part of the house getting himself ready to go out—I asked Horton and Ming to leave at 11.45 and they left together—Horton came back into my dining-room about 1.30 Ming was not there—Horton asked me if I could give him and a friend credit for dinner, till Donald came back—I said if it was on Donald's credit I could not, as I knew he had no money, and I did not consider his credit good—he said that it did not depend upon Horton's credit at all, as he had gone to do a job for him in the City, and when he returned he would have plenty of money, and he would be back soon—upon that I agreed to give him credit for two dinners—he then went down and came back with Ming and dined, and left without paying, and they never have paid.</p>

Morris; if you put Emile and A. Morris, I dare say that will do"—Ming said "Had not we better each of us sign a portion of it?" and he mentioned the letters, but I cannot swear to them; Horton said "No, that might be detected"—Horton then said to me "Have you got any money?"—I said "No"—Horton then gave the cheque to Ming, who crossed the road and went into a stationer's shop—he came out in three or four minutes, came across to us with the cheque open in his hand and gave it to Horton; it was then endorsed "Emile and A, Morris"—Horton then took it back to the baker's shop and came back without it—he said nothing to ma except "We will go and have a drink"—we did so, and they very soon left me, and I went to the baker's shop, Mr. Reichter's; and there saw this cheque—from there I went to Miss Morris's school, and then went with Mrs. Reichter to the police-station—I saw a report of this case at Guildhall and communica ed with Serjeant Spittle.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 27, Red Lion Square, and have for a great many years made handwriting a study—I have a great many times given evidence in various Courts—in my judgment this pencil writing, "I O U Mr. Donald 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., Charles Hunt," and the cheque of 15th October in favour of Miss Morris, signed Walter Hutchinson, are in the same handwriting—the "f" in "five" and the "p" in "pounds" correspond in each—looking at this</p>

               <p>agreement proved to be Ming's writing, this warrant endorsed "Ming and Co.," this wharfinger's note endorsed "Thomas Ming and Co.," and these other documents, are all in Ming's writing, except one, which is Horton's, but the signature to that is Ming's—the signature on the back of this warrant and the signature to this agreement are in the same writing, and I have no doubt that the cheque payable to Miss Morris and the I 0 U are also in Ming's writing—also the cheque of 18th April signed Walter Hammond—I cannot give an opinion upon the cheque found on Horton in favour of Miss Morris—I have carefully examined this bill of exchange, the signature of the drawer, "Whatley, Rimmer, and Co.," and the endorsement; they are all Ming's writing, but I cannot prove the acceptance; I doubt it being Horton's writing, and I believe it is Ming's—I find more of Horton's writing on the bill—I have seen the letter which Mr. Powell saw him write, and have com<lb></lb>pared it carefully with that view.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi>. Juries sometimes follow my lead, and sometimes they do not—I find it far more difficult to speak to pencil writing—when writing is disguised it is more difficult to detect, and it requires more attention on my part—it is much more difficult to speak to mercantile free hands until you come to study them, and then the more you study them the more similarity you find; I should be perhaps three months comparing 100 of them, and I might make a mistake in some of them or I might not—I began to study these papers last night at 6 o'clock, and was studying them for an hour and three-quarters—I studied them again this morning—I knew that the prisoners were in custody, and that the bill I was seeking to father upon one of them was the one in the indictment—I do not care whether I know the charge or not—I have said that I prefer not to know from which side my instructions come.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. There are cases in which the writing is very obscure and difficult, but I found no difficulty whatever in this case—there are peculiari<lb></lb>ties which satisfy me.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Horton, in his defence, contended that, as it was seven years since he was at Messrs. Harvest's, it was not likely that he should remember their signature for so long a time; he denied telling West that he expected some money by Donald, and stated that the cheques found at his lodging did not belong to him, that he believed the cheque to be genuine which, he cashed at Messrs. Reichter's, that he gave his real name to Mr. Fortescue, who knew him to be the manager of the dining hall, and could easily find him not 100 yards off, that he went to Leeds to buy an estate, negotiations for which were still going on, and that he had acted innocently throughout</hi>.</p>

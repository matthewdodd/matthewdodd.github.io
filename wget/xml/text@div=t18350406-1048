                  </hi>. I am a bookbinder, and live in Ivy-lane. I missed some milled boards, about two o'clock on the 27th of March—I detected Wood as the thief, and he pointed out the prisoner's shop—I went with an officer to his premises in Bear-street, Covent-garden—the prisoner came out of the back room—the officer said he had a warrant to search his premises for stolen property—he said, "You have, have you? what may it be?"—he then asked if he had lately bought any milled boards—he said he had the day before, and had sold them again the same morning—Kentish asked him if he had sold them with the Government wrapper on them—he said no, he had no Government wrapper on them—Kentish then inquired who he sold them to—he hesitated some time, and said they were not far off, they were in the neighbourhood—Kentish looked behind the counter, and found a piece of the wrapper which had been on the boards—he showed it to him—I said, "This is what I want, find as much of this as you can"—he searched further, and found part of the duty stamp which corresponded with the part he had found—I then asked the prisoner what he had given for them—he said, "I sup<lb></lb>pose you know I gave 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that is 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per pound"—I told him he was aware they could not be got honestly for that—they would cost me 5 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—they had not been used—they were just as I received them from the sta<lb></lb>tioner's shop the day before—they had not been in my house half an hoar before they were stolen—the prisoner said he thought it was a fair price, and admitted he had sold them to Mr. Roe, a few doors lower down—I went with the officer to Mr. Roe's—I then went back with Mr. Roe and the officer to the prisoner's—Mr. Roe said to him, "This is a bad job, Denny, for if I had paid you for them I should have been in a nice mess"—the prisoner said, "These are the boards I purchased yesterday; at they are your property, you are welcome to take them away "—I said I must take him, I was very sorry, but I was compelled to do it—we took him to Bow-street, and Wood was there—the moment the prisoner saw him he said, "God bless me, that's the man I bought them off"—the Magistrate then referred the case to Guildhall.</p>

               <p>MARY BROWN sworn. - Treadway came to my lodgings, and found some things; I was out, and when I came home I found the things in the room; I don't know who brought them; when the prisoner came home, he told me he found them somewhere near Fleet-market; I pawned some of the things by his orders.(The things were produced and identified by Mr. Merrick.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. As I was returning from the City, I came and stood by the pitching-block talking to a porter, and three porters came up with a load, and knocked this parcel off the block, and abused me for not taking them away, and I took them to my lodgings. <rs id="t18030525-11-verdict55" type="verdictDescription">

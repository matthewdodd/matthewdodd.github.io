On the 8th of October, about eleven o'clock in the morning, I saw these stockings in the shop window, and did not miss them till about six, when the Policeman secured the prisoner, and brought him in; I took these four pairs of stockings out of his hat - I had not seen him in the shop.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.Was not half of your window out? A. A small hole was broken in a pane of glass before; the stockings were tied together, and could not be pulled through that hole - a single pair might he drawn through, as the hole was certainly larger afterwards.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. About six o'clock on Saturday evening, the 8th of October, I saw the prisoner standing in a doorway, by the side of the window; I turned round when I got about twenty yards, and seeing him watching me I turned back; he walked round the corner - I went and looked at the window, and saw a pair of stockings hanging nearly down through the glass; I called to the people in the shop, ran round the corner, met the prisoner coming back, and secured him- he denied having been in the doorway; I took him into the shop, and in the doorway found four pairs of stockings; they had been tied in bundles of a dozen each, and the strings were cut - I found a knife on him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I resist? A. Not in the least.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. As I came by the shop it rained very hard; the stockings laid at my feet - I took them up, and put them into my hat; I then thought I would take them to the shop, and as I turned back the Policeman took me.</p>

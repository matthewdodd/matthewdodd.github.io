            . I am the officer who took the prisoner, at Hackney, on the 11th of August; I asked him how he came to rob a poor person of such a sum of money - he made no answer; I afterwards said, "I understand by Shaw that there were two more with you, Martin and Mason, you shared it among you, I suppose?" he said Martin was innocent of it, but Mason had part, and, to the best of my knowledge, he said, "as well as myself" - I was present at the examination at Worship-street, and as we came down stairs he said, "Mrs. Collins, I hope you will have mercy, I will make it amends to you;" she said, "The same mercy as you shewed to me when you took my money, I will show to you;" I received this caddy from Mrs. Collins.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not deny the robbery directly you took me into custody? A. No, you did not say a single word - I meant to take him to Collins; he said,"Don't take me to Mr. Collins, as I am well known in the neighbourhood, take me to the watch-house."</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not come home to your house directly I was discharged from Worship-street? A. Yes - I said I hoped he would be a better boy, I did not say I was glad he was come home.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell the Magistrate you could not see what I had, for my jacket was over it? A. No, I said he had the caddy - he was apprehended again just after the last Session.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written.) My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, - In last June I was apprehended, with one other man, on suspicion of the robbery, and, on our examination, the Magistrate thought proper to discharge the other man - I was remanded for five examinations; the Magistrates, finding nothing tending a committal, discharged me also - I returned home to my father, and kept to my work, during which time I was frequently accused of the robbery by the parties stating this to my father; he threatened them with prosecution for their unjust assertions, which is the only cause of the parties for the prosecution acting so unjustly, and bringing me to trial after so long an elapse of time - conscious of my innocence as to any part of the felony of which I now stand charged with at this bar, with fortitude and resignation I await the issue of a grand Jury of my country.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. William Fitzroy Scudamore, he lives in Bow-street. On the 25th of July I got into a cab - I cannot say who drove it, but I told the driver to drive to <placeName id="t18330905-81-crimeloc465">Devonshire-street</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. Had you not had something to drink that night? A. Yes; I did not drink with the prisoner - I had drank before - I was capable of knowing what I was about, but I forgot this bag; I don't recollect the prisoner asking me the colour of this coat, he appeared to be cautious of giving it up, and said he was not certain whether I was the person; he went with me to his sister's.</p>

            . I am married; I am the prisoner's sister; he came to me in liquor that evening, and said,"I will give you this bag to take to the office; I will come back and give you a direction," the policeman afterwards came with him, and I gave up the bag.</p>

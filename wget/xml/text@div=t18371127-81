                  </hi>. I keep Mr. William Essenhigh Hammond's shop, at Brentford—he is a chemist and druggist. On the 27th of November the prisoner came to the shop, and asked to look at some small teeth-combs—he was quite a stranger—I showed him some—he had three in his hand, and asked what they were—I said 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each—he asked what a dozen—I said 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he looked at them, and said he would have a dozen, and call in the morning—he put down two, and the other he put up his sleeve, and in going out of the shop he put his hand into his pocket—I ran after him—he went a few steps, and joined another man, to whom he shortly after gave the comb—the man held it up to the gas-light, so that I could distinctly see it—it was about ten o'clock in the evening—they went to a linen-draper's shop, and while they were in there I went and looked for a policeman—I directed him to the shop where the prisoner was, and went to look for another policeman to take the other man; and while looking for the police<lb></lb>man I saw the other man standing, looking for the prisoner—I went to tell the policeman, but that man got away, and we took the prisoner—the other man had got the comb.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I gave that man a half-crown piece—I came into your shop, and asked you the price of the combs—you said 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and a dozen was 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> You said at the Police-office that you had not been in our shop at all.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> Why did you not stop me in the shop?—you put them down, and said they were 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each, and I said, "Is that the lowest?" and you said 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen; I said I had not got money enough; and then, when I came to the man, I gave him the half-crown, and he said, "Why did you not bring half-a-dozen?.</p>

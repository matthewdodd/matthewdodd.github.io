             was trying to get some of them; he was knocked down in the crowd, just as the prisoner crossed the road with a gun under his arm; Allen was getting up suddenly - he hit his head against the muzzle of the gun; it went off, and he was shot - he fell dead on the ground; the prisoner was taken into custody - he told the officer he was the man who did it, he was carrying his gun under his arm, with the muzzle pointed to the ground; I had seen him fire the gun in the course of the evening, but upon those occasions he raised the muzzle so that the contents went into the air - he dropped down immediately, and never moved afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you not been holding a stick, with a catherine-wheel upon it? A. Yes - it fell off, and that occasioned the scramble among the little boys; it appeared to me to be quite an accident: the prisoner called out immediately, "Oh, my G-d! the child is killed!"</p>

             CUMMING. I am a surgeon. I was applied to to examine the child's head, in his father's presence; there were several causes which were sufficient to produce death - the carotid artery and the nerves were divided, and a great quantity of blood effused; that would have occasioned death - I saw him in about a quarter of an hour after the accident, but did not examine his head that night; in my judgment, the division of the carotid artery and the nerves was the immediate cause of his death; the explosion of gunpowder would have occasioned it; but I also found some wadding in the bottom of the wound, which was from one inch and a half to two inches deep.</p>

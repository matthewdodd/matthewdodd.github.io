            . I am a master-builder. Cooper, Cutler, and Green were in my employ - I had to take down and rebuild those premises, using the old materials as well as I could; the men are not to cut up the materials, but to use them again - this piece is an architrave, that goes round a door or a window, and being cut, it is now useless; when I went to Snelling's, he said he considered he had given the value for it - that he had given 3l. or 4l. in liquor or beer - it was brought in in the day time, and he thought it was all right; he showed it very readily, and in a yard I saw my own baskets, with wood in them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Mr. Snelling went to the Police-office, I believe, expecting to be called as a witness? A. I did not tell him to go - I gave the others in charge, but not him; when I saw he was to be committed I asked the Magistrate if he might be admitted to bail, as I felt for him.</p>
               <p>Cooper's Defence. It is impossible that three loads of wood could go from there; I am compelled to use an axe and a saw, as a carpenter.</p>
               <p>Cutler's Defence. The time that the officer saw me look out was when some carts came to take away some rubbish, and I called two or three of the men to load them.</p>
               <p>The prisoners all received a good character.</p>

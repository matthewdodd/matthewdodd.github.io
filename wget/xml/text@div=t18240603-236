            . I am a watchman of Clerkenwell. On the 19th of May, about half-past four o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner with something in a bag under his arm, in Arlington-street - I spoke to him - he threw it down and ran off. I turned my rattle, and my brother watchman brought him back in about five minutes. A dead fowl was in the bag; he had another fowl in his hat, and had dropped one.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Clerkenwell. I was with Davis, and pursued the prisoner, and overtook him about one hundred yards from Davis - he dropped a dead fowl from under his coat in coming back. I have shown the fowls to the prosecutor, who claims them as his.</p>

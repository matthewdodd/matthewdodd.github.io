               <p>Q. Was it light or dark? - A. It was dark.</p>
               <p>Q. How were they taken? - A. By a piece of glass being taken out of the window; I had been in the parlour about a quarter of an hour, and upon my return into the shop, I perceived a vacancy in the window, and missed two shoes, and part of the square of glass; I went down the street, and saw two men waiting against the church rails; I waited a bit, and then they crossed over towards me; then I saw that the prisoner, who was one of them, had two shoes in his hand; I brought him back, and he said, he did not take them out of my shop; he dropped one in going along, this is the other, (producing it); I know it to be mine, I have the fellow of it at home, and I know my own work; I had seen them in the window when I lit up the candles; I am sure the glass was then found.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the shop a part of your dwelling-house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He said at Bow-street, that the window was broke before.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I had had my window cut about two years ago, and some shoes stolen, and this was the same square of glass; a piece had been puttied in as tight as ever it was, and that same piece was taken out.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I never had that shoe in my hand, I know nothing of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live in Charles-street, Lambeth; the prisoner is my niece. On 30th Nov. she came to my house, and told me she had left her place a few days before—she knew she was welcome, and she came to stay while she was out of place—she stopped all night, and on the Tuesday she told me she went down to Bayswater to look for a place, and she went and was not suited, and she went round the City and got a place at Finsbury-square, I think—on the Tuesday night she stopped and slept at my house with my children—she slept in the room with me and my wife—I went to bed about half-past 10 o'clock—my wife brought me my watch when I was in bed, at a quarter to 11 o'clock—I wound it up, and gave it to my wife, and she put it on an arm chair, by the side of the bed—I was not disturbed in the night—I heard nothing at all till I struck a light in the morning, and my watch was gone—I then looked, and the prisoner was gone—she had left some of her things behind—I have not seen the watch since.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of the last witness—it was gone 12 o'clock that night when I went to bed—the prisoner went to bed at the same time—I was not disturbed in the night at all till my husband gave the alarm that the watch was gone—I locked the room door before I went to bed; I left the key inside in the door—my husband got up at about a quarter to 3 o'clock in the morning—there was no one in the room but my husband and me and my children—my eldest child is getting on for eight years.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, practising at 5, Fen-church Buildings, City, and am solicitor to Messrs. Odlum &amp; Co., the petitioning creditors in this bankruptcy—the adjudication was signed in my presence by the Commissioner—I did not attend a meeting on 7th Sep tember, at Mr. Martin's office—I produce a statement of account bearing date 1st September—I received it from the creditors' assignee, in the presence of the defendant, at the Southwark Police Court—I don't know whose handwriting it is—the defendant filed his accounts at the early part of the proceedings, on 3rd December, 1868—the property in the hands of the creditors is 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; debts above 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; by debts below 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; making a total of 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; and his deficiencies, 447<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—on the other side, the creditors unsecured, 465<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; creditors holding security, 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which is the entry corresponding to that on the other side—the 465<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. seems to be for goods—there is, medical attendance, 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—in the next sheet there are persons holding security, E.

Odlum and Podger—I do not wish to touch her house, but I will be content if she will give up the furniture—it is my duty to get in the bankrupt's estate, together with the assignee—I told the prisoner I should take criminal proceedings—that was after the examination on the 4th February—it was after I knew that his mother was in possession of all the furniture—I knew he had executed a bill of sale, that was the object of my asking for the account—I daresay I threatened him again on 15th February, and on the 15th April, I have no doubt—I was hoping the mother would give up to the creditors.</p>

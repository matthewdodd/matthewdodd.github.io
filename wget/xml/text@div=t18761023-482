                  </hi>. I am a cigar merchant, formerly of 1, West Street, Moorgate—I reside at Islington—in June last the prisoner was in my service at a salary of 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week and 5 per cent. on all sales—I used to send out with him goods to various customers—on 12th May I purchased ten boxes of cigars of Mr. Cowen, with the brand Enchantre", and paid for them—I went with the prisoner expressly to get those boxes, and sent him with them to Mr. Glancey's—he returned at night very much the worse for drink—he said the ten boxes had been stolen out of the trap, and he was not able to go to Mr. Glancey's, and that he ought to have had some<lb></lb>body with him—on 9th June I went with the prisoner to Mr. Hewitt's, who keeps the Red House Tavern, St. John's Wood, and purchased two cases of cigars, and in driving through the cattle market afterwards with Mr. Hewitt he bought four geese and I bought three—when I got home there were only two, and the two boxes of cigars were gone—I said "How. is this?"—he said "I don't know"—I said "You have been robbing me for a long time"—I went to the boot of the trap, where I keep the nosebag, and there was the missing goose, killed, and the two boxes of cigars, wrapped up together in a newspaper, all over blood—I said. "What is the meaning of this?"—he said "I don't know anything about it"—I said "Well, I will. let you know something about it directly"—I took the goose into my garden, and when I came out the prisoner was running down the street, and I never saw him any more till he was taken into custody—I had occa<lb></lb>sion to go that day to Mr. Lewin, a customer of mine, and he gave me a box of cigars to look at—they had the Enchantre brand—Mr. Lewin also produced this invoice; it is the prisoner's writing. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "May 15,1876.

               <p>I had sold belonging to the partnership; I can't say I did not—I sold some wine warrants and something was said about what was to be done with the money—he asked me when I was going to pay the money—I don't think he said anything about paying it into the bank, because the money was bespoke—he wanted me to give him part of the money for his own use, and I paid every shilling of it away, and can produce the receipts for it; it was 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. went for rent out of it—I did not ask him who gave him the information about the warrants, nor did he say he would not tell me—I did not say it was the prisoner—he asked me to let him have half the money, he was going to the races next day; that is how he gets his living—I would not give him any; the prisoner's name was not mentioned—I. did not say "I will make Barron so as his own mother won't know him"—I know Mr. Lloyd is here; he was five times at the police-court and never opened his mouth—I never had a penny for the ten boxes of cigars—I called at Barron's house on Monday, loth May, to see what had become of my samples—I saw him rolling about at 10 o'clock at night, and he had not returned with his samples—I did not receive 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on account of the sale of these very cigars, in the presence of his son William, his daughter Ellen, and Miss Manham, his housekeeper; that I swear—I did not have the ten boxes of Enchantres home on the Saturday evening—he sent me a note on the Sunday night—I have not saved it, it was merely a little scrap of paper; I can tell you what was on it—it was not "Dear Nicholls,—Please give my son the ten boxes of cigars for Parish, also my samples, as I want to get round early in the morning to catch him"—the note was to send for the samples, four boxes in one parcel and three in the other, and I thought it was very much out of order sending for them on a Sunday night—the samples were not taken out of the trap the day before; when I got home—he returned home by himself drunk—they were taken out on the Friday at my house; that was the usual course—he did not go out on the Saturday—he had the ten boxes to deliver to Mr. Glancey on Friday—I was at Mr. Cohen's about 11 o'clock that morning—the prisoner said that Mr. Glancey had ordered the ten boxes of him, he had not ordered them of me—I went to Mr. Glancey next morning to see if he had ordered them, and he said "No"—I am not in partnership with Mr. Lloyd now—I had to dissolve partnership in consequence of my private insolvency—I did not give my son a character in the name of Franks—the prisoner accepted a bill for 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for me, and I lent him 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. afterwards in gold; that was for a debt that he had to pay—it was an accommodation bill on his part—I have lent him plenty of money out of my own bank, which I can prove.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a licensed victualler in Montague Street, Spital<lb></lb>fields—in May I had two boxes of cigars of the prisoner as samples, and I ordered ten more to make up the dozen—he brought them on Saturday morning and when they were opened I disapproved of them—I said they would not suit my customers, and were not like the sample—he showed me the invoice and asked for pen and ink and said, "I can make more money of them, I am going to Wood Green to a gentleman I can sell them to."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had the two boxes eight or nine days before, I did not notice the brand—I had a receipt for what I paid, I believe the officer has it.</p>

                  </hi>. I pass under the name of Lloyd—I was trading with Mr. Nicholls under the firm of Nicholls, Lloyd, &amp; Co., in West Street, Finsbury—I did not give my consent to this prosecution, I don't believe in it in any way—I would not believe Mr. Nicholls on his oath—we engaged Barron to travelforus, Mr. Nichollf introduced him as a highly respectable man—in June I saw Nicholls outside the Nag's Head, in the Holloway Road, and had a conversation with him about some wine warrants—he asked me from whom I had the information, I refused to answer him—he said "I know who told you about selling those cigars, it was Barron and I will make him so that his mother shan't know him"—I prosecuted Nicholls at the Guildhall police-court for robbing me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prosecution was withdrawn, they referred it to arbitration, he apologised next day.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi>). It was not two months before the ten boxes came that I bought the two boxes, I am not particular to a day, being no scholar—I always allow the <hi rend="italic">Missus</hi> to pay the bills—I think it was. on 12th or 13th May that the ten boxes were offered to me, I can't say for certain—it was on a Saturday, morning from 10 o'clock to 10.30, I said at the police-court it was on Monday—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the invoice that was shown to me, this is dated the 12th—it might have been on the Monday I could not say for a day, it might have been on the 15th.</p>

               <p>I am watch-house keeper of St. Ann's, Soho. Mr. Butler brought the two prisoners the 27th of February, on Saturday, about nine; they were put backwards in the lock-up place; and between one and two the same night, I went backwards; and behind some pewter chamber pots in the lock-up place, I found a clasp knife and a pen-knife; the clasp-knife was stamped in Butler: I sent to Mr. Butler, and gave them him; he said they were his; when the two boys came in, there were three men from a lottery-office; they were in the lock-up place about a quarter of an hour; and then they were put into a little place adjoining; I found the knives about four hours after.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am nothing in particular; I live on what I can get to do. I did not know the prisoner before the robbery.</p>
               <p>Where did you live last in place? - In the Hay-market, with Mr. M'Allen, belonging to the Opera-house. On the 27th<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179002240192"></xptr>of February, about seven, or half past, I was going along the Hay-market; and I stopped, as I thought I might as well as any body else; and the prisoner Smith came up to me, and told me if I did not go along, he would make me; I did not go just then, and he came again and said so: I went on, and came down the other side of the way, and saw Smith's hand in the window; but what he took out, I do not know.</p>
               <p>Are you sure, at the distance of the other side of the way, in the Hay-market, a pretty wide street, you could see what passed? - Yes, you can.</p>
               <p>Were there any lights? - Yes, two candles on each side the window: the prisoner Berry was leaning against the post the corner of Panton-street.</p>
               <p>Did you see Berry as soon as you saw Smith? - No, I did not; I first observed him in crossing over the way, leaning against the post; I saw Smith come over to

            , and they both went off together.</p>
               <p>Did you hear any window break? - No.</p>
               <p>Could you, at the distance you was, see whether the pane of glass was broke? - It was broke when I came by; I observed it when Smith first spoke to me; I never saw Smith before; but I am sure it was him; I passed Berry two or three times that evening, at the post; I am sure of him also: I went home and told my mistress; I came out for some candles about half an hour after, about eight, and I saw Smith and Berry walking up the Hay-market; and I told Mr. Butler, and we both went after them; and Mr. Butler took them to St. Ann's watch-house; it was about seven, or half after seven, when I first saw them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Smith. Did you see me put my hand in the window? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Berry. Did you see me break this man's window? - No; I saw you do nothing but lean against the post.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. How did you fasten the door; I pulled it too; it was a common latch; the glass was very badly cracked; but there was no hole.</p>
               <p>What time did you take the prisoners? Just when the watch was going nine; there were several together: (the knives deposed to:) I can very safely swear to them, particularly that one that is stamped with my own name; I missed all the things in the indictment; but I recovered nothing but these two knives.</p>
               <p>Were these knives in each of the windows? - Yes; they were tied up in small parcels; one is a clasp-knife, with a horn handle; the other is a pen-knife.</p>
               <p>Court. Here is never a clasp-knife with a horn handle, in the indictment; what is the other knife? - This is what we call a penknife.</p>
               <p>Is that with a bone handle? - No, it is with a horn handle.</p>
               <p>Is that a tortoiseshell handle? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shelton. There are no horn handles in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Court. Then, gentlemen, we are in another difficulty: but the only articles which are traced in the possession of the prisoners, are not in this indictment; and it certainly is material; for though the man was seen at the distance across the street, to put his hand in the shop, he does not know what he took out.</p>

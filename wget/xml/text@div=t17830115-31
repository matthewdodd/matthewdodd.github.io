               <p>I am a bricklayer, I had information brought to my house that one of my men was in custody for stealing lead: the prisoner worked for me; I went to Guildhall on the Wednesday the 18th, where the lead was and measured it, and desired my foreman to examine at the places where I am doing business to see if there was any lead missing; he found some was missing from a building at <placeName id="t17830115-31-crimeloc195">Lincoln's Inn</placeName>

I attended the examination at Guildhall, and Mr. Alderman Sainsbury desired I would compare the lead with the premises to see if it was the same, and I found it corresponded exactly; there was a place where it was taken from bare, it had been lately taken out; it was one entire piece when laid on, and it had been cut in two.</p>
               <p>Was the shape of the place where it was taken from so particular, that another piece like that would not fit it? - It fitted exactly.</p>
               <p>But would not any other piece of lead of the same measurement have fitted the place? - It might.</p>
               <p>Was there any thing indented? - There was a nail hole where it had been fastened; they corresponded exactly, it was certainly taken from there.</p>
               <p>You have no doubt of it as a workman? None at all; it joins as near as can be to the scaffold.</p>
               <p>Does it adjoin any of the buildings? - No, it does not.</p>

               <p>I am one of the patrols; on the 16th at night about 11, I received information of three people having something very heavy,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178301150052"></xptr> and having gone into this house; at a quarter past three, I saw the prisoner on a landing place up one pair of stairs, with a candle in his hand, I said, my friend, are you going to set the house on fire, he said, yes, what is that to you: I drew my cutlass and called the constable, and we went up stairs, and the prisoner was sitting on the side of the bed, and a basket stood close to the bed, and the constable asked him, what he had there, and he said luggage.</p>
               <p>Did you see him have any thing on the stairs, when you first saw him? - Only the candle.</p>
               <p>Court to Clarke. Whose possession has the lead been in since? - The constable's.</p>
               <p>To Taylor. Has the lead been in your possession ever since? - I left it at Guildhall in a closet in the magistrates room: it is the same, I marked it.</p>
               <p>Court to Clarke. How long have you known the prisoner? - He has worked for me about a twelvemonth.</p>
               <p>Has he any hurt in his head? - I have heard him mention it.</p>
               <p>Has he ever been indisposed or disordered with it? - Not to my knowledge.</p>

               <p>I have nothing to say, only I served my king and country in America for seven years, and I got this shot in my head; a woman got the lead at Cheapside; I have lodged with her this year and half: this gentleman came in, in the morning, and I being in bed, I whipped out of bed, that made the gentleman see me on the landing place. I have no witnesses, only my discharge can prove my honesty, if I was a rogue or a robber, I should not be recommended to the board; I am willing to serve my king and country again, I am sure I am innocent of this affair; the woman that had the lead is my father's own sister, she is in Newgate; they can prove nothing of my bringing the lead to this house; she is not indicted yet.</p>

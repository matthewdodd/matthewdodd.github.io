                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Lowe. We live in Sutton-gardens, Chalk-road, Islington. On the 10th of Sept., I missed part of a clock movement—when I heard the policeman had got it, I looked and found it was gone—the kitchen window was open, and it was taken out there—this is it.</p>

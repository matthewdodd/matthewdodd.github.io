            , ESQ. On the 4th of February, I went to Drury-lane Theatre, with three friends, for a private box, and was directed to the Princes' side of the house, where I saw the prisoner; he said he had some disengaged up stairs, which I declined, as I wanted one below - he then said he could put me into the Duke of Gloster's box - I asked the expence; he said I might give him what I pleased. He wished me not to bring my party through the body of the house, but to go to the door in Vinegar-yard, which I did, and he was waiting to receive us, shewed us into the box, and I gave him two sovereigns and two shillings.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did not you understand he was letting you into the Duke's box, as a favour, and you were to give him what you pleased - A. It did not strike me at the time. I said in order to get a lower box, that I would go to Covent Garden; he then said he would let me into the Duke's box - he did not say that if the Duke came we must turn out.</p>

            . I am box-keeper to Mr. R. W. Elliston, the proprietor of the Theatre. The prisoner was private box-keeper on the Princes' side - the Duke of York's box is under his care; his Highness has it on alternate weeks, not by the year; this was a week in which it belonged to his Highness, and was entirely at his disposal. Mr. Elliston had no liberty to let it. If the prisoner had brought me the money I could not have received it.</p>
               <p>COURT. This is no embezzlement.</p>

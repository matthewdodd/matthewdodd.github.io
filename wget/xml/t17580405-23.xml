               <p>Q. What had he done?</p>
               <p>Cooper. I saw him commit a robbery, and detected him myself before he got off the premises in May 1756.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you see him doing?</p>
               <p>Cooper. I saw him break a kitchen window in Arundel-street in the Strand, with a stick, in with a hook to the end of it, he pulled out some linen, but I have forgot what it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you at his trial?</p>
               <p>Cooper. I was: he was tried at Hickes's-hall; as I took him I was bound over to prosecute; and was the principal evidence against him; he was convicted for it.</p>

               <p>Cooper. It will be two years ago the beginning of next May.</p>

               <p>Emms. He was committed on suspicion of breaking a house; and as soon as he saw me, he ran and hid himself, because he knew that I knew him.</p>

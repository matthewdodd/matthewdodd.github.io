            . I am an officer. I was in the parlour at the time Smith complained of money being taken. I searched the prisoner, but found nothing. Smith said if she gave up the money, he would forgive her, but as she did not do so, the bar-maid said she had a box; she was asked about it, and said she had given it to a young girl; the girl denied it; she fell down and said,</p>
               <p>"What shall I do?" I said, tell where the property is, and your master will forgive you. She said, it was in the sawdust box, and produced it from there.</p>

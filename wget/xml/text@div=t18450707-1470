The prisoner is my husband—we have been married five years next Sept.—we lived at No. 5, Nottingham-street, Waterloo-town—he is a shoemaker—we lived on pretty comfortable terms up to the time this happened—on the 18th of June, between eleven and twelre o'clock in the day, my husband was at work, and we had some words con<lb></lb>cerning wearing apparel—I had on a brass ring at the time, as my wedding ring was in pledge—I threw it off, and said I would not wear it any longer unless I had my wedding ring—I do not recollect my husband saying any<lb></lb>thing, but I said I would leave him—I did not give any reason, no farther than concerning the wearing apparel—he asked me if I intended taking the children—I said yes—I had one baby in the front parlour at that time—it was not in my arms—he asked me not to go—I said I would, and would take the children—he jumped up and pulled my head back—I thought at first that he was going to play with me, but he cut my throat—he had the knife in his hand cutting some leather—it was done so mo<lb></lb>mentary that I did not feel the knife cut my throat—I jumped up from the chair, and fell down—I got up again—he seemed very much excited—I screamed once after I felt that I was cut—I tried to prevent him from cutting his own throat, but he seemed so excited that I could not—he cut himself in the throat—I saw some persons in the back yard—they opened</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the house in which the prisoner and his wife lived, for upwards of six months before this happened. On the 18th of June I was in my kitchen, adjoining their room—I heard a loud scream, and heard the pri<lb></lb>soner say, "I have done it, I have done it"—I ran and knocked at the door, and said, "What is the matter, Mrs. Warren? let me in, open the door," but I got oo answer—I heard the prisoner say, "This is all your fault"—she said, "It is not my fault"—I ran to the yard door, and called my husband, who came, and one or other of us opened the door—I told my husband to go and get further assistance—I ran to the street door, and called "Police I" my husband ran out into the street—I had not seen either of the parties at that time—I stood at the street door a little time, and while standing there Mrs. Warren came running out, holding some of her clothes up to her throat, ran past me, and along the street to a doctor's—I observed her clothes were very much covered with blood—I spoke to her, but she made no answer—I did not follow her—as I was standing at the door the pri<lb></lb>soner came staggering out of the room—he fell in the passage, and blood was issuing from his throat as he lay there, dribbling down on the floor—I said, "Oh you wicked man, why have you committed such a rash deed?"—he said, "I am not wicked; you would pity me if you knew all"—I said, "I considered you a very happy couple, and most affectionate"—he aid, "This day she was going away with another man"—I said I con<lb></lb>sidered them such a happy couple that I could not think it, for I bad never heard anything amiss in the house, and never saw any one go in bat his brothers—he said there was another man always about the house, but I never saw him—he was lying bleeding in the passage when this con<lb></lb>versation took place—I took a handkerchief, and one of the neighbours hound it round his throat, and he was conveyed away on a shutter to the hospital—I should suppose he was badly cut—Mrs. Warren was shortly after brought back by some policemen—she staid in the house a short time, and was then conveyed to the hospital.</p>

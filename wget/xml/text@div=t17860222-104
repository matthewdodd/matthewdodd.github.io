               <p>I live at the house where the prisoner lodges; on the 21st of February, the prisoner slept out all night, and on the 22d, between seven and eight he came home, and he brought home a flat of butter with him, and set it on the table, he asked me for a knife, I lent it him, he then cut the parcel open, he carried the parcel up stairs and went to bed; I went up stairs, and in the parcel I saw a note, the 19th of February, sent to Mr. Davis, three dozen and eight pounds of butter; and in the evening I heard a basket rattle, it was taken out of the back part of the house.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I heard no more of my butter, the next evening the prisoner sent to me, and asked if I would mitigate matters if he paid for it, he said, to be sure it was a very foolish thing.</p>
               <p>Had any thing been said to lead him to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178602220155"></xptr> any expectations of favour? - Not one syllable, he said that another man had desired him to carry the butter home; and he took the butter up at my door, and they took it to my house, and went to bed together, he said the other man had the property and not him, he acknowledged the taking of it, and offered to pay for it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Whether I did not say the basket was in the room where I lay, which is a common lodging room.</p>

               <p>I am door keeper to the Rotation-office, in Litchfield-street; I had this man in custody, he was brought to the Rotation-office and examined, and stood committed; he asked me to look to see whether Mr. Davis was gone, I did, I asked him what he wanted with him, he said I should be glad to see him to try if we could settle matters, for although I took the butter as the man desired me, I did not know whose butter it was; I went to Mr. Davis, no promises were made to him.</p>
               <p>Court to Downe. When he came home that morning, was any body with him? - Yes, there was the other man had a pint of beer in the tap room, the other man did not go up stairs at first, but he went up afterwards.</p>

               <p>I had got out, and was coming to my lodgings, a man called out, that I had been drinking with at the Coach and Horses in Welbeck-street, he had a basket on his head, he asked me where I was going; I told him I lodged at that house, he called for a pint of beer, he staid, I was sleepy and went to bed; he slept in the bed the boy slept in, with another man, there were three men in the room, the man got up and brought up the basket, they had been playing at Justice Jarvis or shove-halfpenny, he played for some hours, and lost several pots of beer, he had no money to pay for it, he went out and brought in some money, where he got it I do not know, he went away, I never appeared before a Court of Justice before; I leave it to the Court and Gentlemen of the Jury, for upon my honor I am innocent of the affair.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness to his character, who said, he was a stay-maker, but could not work on account of his eyes, and that he maintained himself by writing letters and petitions.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. His own account that he gave of himself at the Magistrates, was that he played the Clown at the pantomime at Mr. Astley's, and was articled to Mr. Astley for three years.</p>

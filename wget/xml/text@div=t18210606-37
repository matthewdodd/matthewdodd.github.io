            . I am midwife of Marylebone, Infirmary. On the 16th of November, about three o'clock in the morning, I was first sent for to the deceased; she had then been moved from the sick house to the laying-in ward. I found her in labour - her pains had come on; she did not say she was in labour - she was delivered of a still-born child about a quarter after four o'clock. I left her about six o'clock, she was then perfectly safe with respect to her delivery - I had no apprehension at all of her life. I saw her again about four o'clock that afternoon, and found her much in pain, which is not unusual - I thought them after-pains. I had no apprehension of her being in imminent danger, and did not remain above ten minutes with her - it was only a visit. I saw her again next day, (Friday) between three and four o'clock, and found her very bad, apparently in violent pain; I remained about ten minutes with her - it was only a visit as before. I thought her in danger then, if she was in as much pain as she appeared to be - I did not tell her so, but told the nurse to fetch Mr. Goodyear, a surgeon of the establishment. I did not see her again alive; she died on Sunday morning early. I do not imagine that she thought herself likely soon to die.</p>

            , before she went to the workhouse. About three days before she went there, (I think it was in the early part of November) I saw her; she was then walking about, and appeared as usual. I saw her one day after - she was in the workhouse, she came to our house - I had known her a year and a half. The last time I saw her, was, I think, a fortnight before her death - she came into our house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the circumstances of her death, or are you only come to say what you heard - A. Just before the Friday evening that I saw her, she ran out of doors - I stood at the window and saw her; this was on the Friday, as she went to the workhouse on the Monday following. I was listening at our window, and heard her crying very much, and heard the sound of a stick, as if it was striking on a person; she was saying,</p>
               <p>"Pray, Sir, don't." I did not see who she was speaking to, but I heard Mr. Disney's voice, very plain. I heard her say, do not, and he said,</p>
               <p>"I'll get a stick and knock you to the ground, if you don't open the door in the manner I tell you" - he was before slapping her with his hand, as I thought.</p>
               <p>Q. How could you know his voice - A. I have heard him speak many times, and know his voice very well - this continued about three quarters of an hour. He stood scolding and beating her before she ran out - I heard him go from the door; then she ran out, and ran down the street - he went out after her. I did not see him take her, but saw him bring her back - his arms were round her waist, and she was holding to the railings; several people ran after her, and she turned round to them and said,</p>
               <p>"Pray don't let me go in with him, for if you do he will kill me" - her nose was bleeding; he said,</p>
               <p>"Ann, my dear girl, come in and I will not beat you again, nor hurt you;" he took her in, and then came to our door. I told him I had heard him beat her three nights very shamefully, he said, I was mistaken, for he never touched her, and that her nose bled from her wanting to get away, when he wanted her to go in. I saw her next morning - she shewed me her bruises; she was very much bruised on the temple, and her arms, where he had beat her with a stick. I saw her on Monday before she was taken away by the officers; she then shewed me the marks on her shoulders, neck, and ear; they were very black, and appeared to have been beaten with a whip, and she shewed me the whip.</p>

            . I am apothecary at the Marylebone Infirmary, and am a surgeon. I admitted<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182106060020"></xptr>the deceased into the Infirmary, on the 4th of November, as a fit patient; she appeared to be labouring under a common cold - she was brought from the Workhouse; I had no idea of her labouring under any thing else. I directed for her as for a common cold - I did not then know she was pregnant. I saw her regularly twice a day, with the rest of the patients, but apprehended nothing particular. On the 16th, I was called up about half-past two o'clock, and found her in labour - I told her of it; she denied positively any knowledge of it, and gave me, as she thought, a sufficient reason. I do not think she would have denied there being a chance of it, but gave me a reason, by which she judged she was not in labour. I sent her over to the laying-in ward - the midwife delivered her that morning, of a still-born child. I saw her in the morning, she was then vomiting, and had a constipated state of bowels, and some degree of fever.</p>
               <p>Q. That is not unusual after delivery - A. Yes, but not an unusual state preceeding the disease with which she was afterwards visited. I ordered accordingly for her - she appeared relieved, but afterwards got considerably worse, and next day (Friday) it was discovered, that it had brought on St. Anthony's fire in her left thigh, and the lower part of her belly; this made rapid progress, and towards Saturday evening, it formed several blotches of mortification, and on Sunday she died. I attended her diligently three times a day, and examined her after death with the other surgeons, Messrs. C. and J. Phillips, and Platt, who are eminent men in the profession.</p>
               <p>Q. From all you observed during the disease, and after death, what in your opinion was the cause of her death - A. That she died of St. Anthony's fire - it was at that period, an epedemic; we had three or four cases in the house, two of which died - in those cases the patients were not pregnant. I have not the least reason to suppose her death was occasioned by external violence; when I first saw her, she had marks on her posteriors, as if she had been flogged by a birch rod, but that did not appear at all serious - it disappeared; there was an interval of fourteen days, in which she was employed in the needle-room of the workhouse - from the 3d to the 14th she was in the workhouse. When I saw her in the workhouse, she was in an apparent degree of health, but afterwards appeared to have a cold, and was brought into the Infirmary.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, do you believe the deceased died from natural causes - A. Yes, from St. Anthony's fire. It is possible labour might have aggravated the effect, but I have no reason to attribute her death to external violence, all that dispersed when she had the cold - I believe all the medical gentlemen agreed with me.</p>

            . I am a surgeon. I examined the desceased after her death, with Mr. Goodyear, Mr. Platt, and my son. My opinion is, that her death was caused by the inflammation which seized her legs, and extended to her thigh; there were symptoms of gangreen on her thighs and legs, and mortification, the common process of it, had taken place - that certainly produced her death. I have no reason to attribute it to external violence, or injury to her person.</p>

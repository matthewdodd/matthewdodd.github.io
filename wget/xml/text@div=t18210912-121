On the 15th of August, about twelve o'clock, the prisoner came in, sat in the tap-room and had some beer; she went backwards three or four times in the course of half an hour, which rose my suspicion - these things were in a tub wet. I went backward and saw her standing by the tub, taking a wet stocking to wipe her face - she had no business there. I went to call my wife to see if any thing was missing, she followed me out and sat in the tap-room - my wife missed the things and sent for an officer, who came; she then confessed to taking them, and begged for mercy. She did not hear me speak to my wife.</p>

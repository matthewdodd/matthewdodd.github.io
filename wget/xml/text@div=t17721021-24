            . The two prisoners and I set out together from St. Giles's on a Sunday; I don't know the day of the month, about nine in the morning; we lay together in Westminster; the night before we agreed to go to Richmond, in order to rob; we met Mr. Heley in the way, near Hammersmith; we dined at Brentford; about four o'clock, after dinner, we crossed in the ferry to Richmond; we walked round the Green, but there were so many watch boxes and lamps, we thought that place would not do for us; we crossed Kew Bridge: we drank at an alehouse or two, in order to make us almost drunk to raise our spirits; then we went to a place which I have since heard is called Shepherd's Bush. A post chaise came up; it was not quite dark but I thought it was dark enough that we could not be seen; we could hardly see one another; we all cried out to the driver of the chaise, stop! There were two Gentlemen in the chaise; I took a watch and some money from one gentleman, and some money from the other, and both their hats; after I got their money, I demanded their watches; the gentlemen said they had but one, and one of them gave me a watch; there was a person behind the chaise.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Forbes. Was there any person be-behind the chaise?</p>
               <p>Forbes. Yes, there was.</p>
               <p>Evans. After I had got the watch and the money, Wiggins said give me me your hats; we took them, and went away across the fields, we went, I believe, two miles out of the way; we cut the hats to pieces in the first field, because they were fantail hats; that was not the sort we wanted. I was with the two prisoners when Mr. Bond came up; I made off; Wiggins had the watch from me, what he did with it I can't say; I had the silver to divide when we came to town.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Forbes. Do you know who demanded your hat?</p>
               <p>Forbes. I remember that after the money was given, a different voice from that which demanded our money, said give me your hats.</p>

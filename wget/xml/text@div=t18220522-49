            . I am a surveyor of the Thames Police. On the 20th of April, I apprehended Edwards at Mr. Matthews's house, about some plates, and on the 21st, Mr. Matthews made a communication to me, in consequence of which, I went to Edwards on board the Police ship; I told him Mr. Matthews had missed more plates, and asked if he knew any thing about them; he voluntarily said,</p>
               <p>"I do, I in company with another boy, took a quantity of plates from Mr. Matthew's house at different times - the first plate we took, we employed a boy named Gagger, who took the plate to a house up a court in Drury-lane, and there sold it, and brought us part of the money - we afterwards took a quantity more, which were carried by myself and another boy to the same place." In consequence of this I searched the house of the prisoner Hammerton, but found nothing there relating to the plates. I took Hammerton on board the ship to Edwards, who said,</p>

               <p>"That is the man I sold the plates to," Hammerton said,</p>
               <p>"You scoundrel, you know nothing of me;" Edwards said,</p>

I apprehended Flawn in George-street, St. Giles's, on the 22d of April, and asked him if he knew what I wanted him for, he said he did not; I said I wanted him for stealing copper plates; he immediately asked if Edwards was in custody, I said he was; he said Edwards and another boy knew all about them - I asked if he ever carried any plates along with the other boy, he said he lid, to an old iron shop under an archway in Drury-lane; that he should know the man by sight, but did not know his name - I asked if he meant Shorts gardens, he said he did - I asked if he took the plates into the house; he said No, but that Edwards carried them in, as the person would only admit one person into the house at a time - that he had taken some plates on the Saturday week previous, and on that day Edwards brought one half-crown from the man, and on the Monday following he received 14 s., which they shared among them; but Edwards had the best share. I took him to the office, and he pointed out Hammerton from among six or seven other people, as the man who received them; he denied it. Flawn said the plates came from Hunt's-court, Castle-street; that he was not in the house on any occasion, but waited outside in the street.</p>

            . I am a manufacturer of copper plates for engravers, and live in Lisle-street, Soho. I think I have seen Hammerton before; I have a very strong suspicion on my mind that he is the man who called on me about the beginning of April to ask what I would give for old copper plates; it was about a fortnight before Mr. Matthews called on me; I told him the price, but he never brought any. The impression is so strong on my mind that if your Lordship said I must swear either that he is or is not the man, I should rather swear that he is.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you with him - A. About two minutes. I described him to Mr. Matthews before he was apprehended.</p>
               <p>MR. MATTHEWS. I have recovered none of this property: the value of one plate is from 8 l. to 10 l.; they were Ward's Sketchings, and some engravings; they were as good as new - the lowest value of any one of them could not be less than 8 l.; they would not sell for less than 5 l. at an auction of the trade, if fair notice was given - old plates always have the engravings erased.</p>

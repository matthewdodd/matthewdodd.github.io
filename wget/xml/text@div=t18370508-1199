                  </hi>. I live in Clare-street, Clare-market, and am the wife of Benjamin Sayer. The prisoner was in my service, and left in No<lb></lb>vember—I missed a diamond ring—this is it.</p>

PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long ago is this? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In 1834—she lived with me about two months—I did not miss it till she had left—I saw it about a fortnight before—I saw it again in the following December—I have had it ever since, till within these two or three days—it was about two months ago that I was first called to appear as a witness—there is a discoloured pearl in it—my husband keeps the Sun public-house.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant A</hi> 10.) On the 22nd of November, 1834, I saw the prisoner in the shop of Mr. Baker, a jeweller—I followed her out, and found this ring on her—I took her to Bow Street, and she was remanded for a week—no owner was found for the ring—it was de<lb></lb>tained for a month—Mrs. Sayer came to the station-house—I next saw the prisoner on the 11th of March last, at the Palace, at the time of re<lb></lb>lieving guard—I am sure she is the person.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you keep the ring? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—it was kept at the Magistrate's office—I am sure it is the same—I put a little scratch upon it—it was given up at the office—I had not seen the prisoner before she was at Baker's shop, to ray recollection—I did not see her for two years after she was released.</p>

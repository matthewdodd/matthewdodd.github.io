            . I live at Lowton in Essex, near Epping forest. On Easter-Monday I came to town, and went into a public-house, the <placeName id="t17690906-2-crimeloc10">sign of the Feathers at Charing-Cross</placeName>

I called for a pint of beer; after that I had another; after that I had a gill of wine. Then I changed a guinea to pay. I then sat a little while, and walked out at the door into a little yard. Before I could get up into the street, a man came out of that house, and knocked me down by a blow with his hand on the left side my face. Who he was I do not know. Then two women came, one held me down, while the prisoner took my money out of my pocket, it was in a bag, 6 l. and upwards of it. I had seen her in the house: she was in the box where I had been drinking. After she had taken my money, she took my watch. D - n him, said she, he has got more money about him. Then she searched my coat and waistcoat pockets, and took some halfpence out of my waistcoat pocket, and my handkerchief. This was about nine at night, just at the dawning of the evening. I was knocked down within about three yards of the house door, in the passage that leads to the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not call out?</p>
               <p>Chappel. I begged my life. I did not call out, fearing they would cut my throat.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober?</p>
               <p>Chappel. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not return into the house after this, or alarm people in the street?</p>
               <p>Chappel. No. I went to my lodgings as fast as I could.</p>


               <p>Q. How long is that passage?</p>
               <p>Chappel. It is twenty yards, or thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did the people, that used you thus ill, go afterwards?</p>
               <p>Chappel. They went into the house again.</p>

            's, and gave an account that he had been robbed in a court that comes down from the Sun Fire-Office, that is, the court in which the Feathers is. There is no thoroughfare. The house is about fifty yards backwards. He said he should know the woman that robbed him, could he see her. He mentioned two women and a man. I went to that public-house on the Tuesday, the day after. I told the landlord's son, he not being at home, if he did not let me know where the woman was, I would speak to have his licence taken away, as many robberies had been committed in his house. Upon that he went and shewed me where the prisoner lodged in the Almonry: there I found the prisoner. I charged her with taking the prosecutor's watch and money. She denied it. I told her Mr. Chappel was come to that conclusion, that if she would own what she had done with the watch, if pawned, he would redeem it, and say no more about the affair.</p>

               <p>I am a girl of the town. I was going along with another girl. We met this gentleman: he asked us to go in and drink. He took us into the Gentleman and Porter at Charing-Cross, and called for rum and water. He wanted connections with me. I asked him for something: he said he would pay me after I had done. After that I asked him for his present. He said, How can you ask me for any money, when I have been robbed already? He threw down a penny for the servant, and paid his reckoning, and we came out all of us together.</p>

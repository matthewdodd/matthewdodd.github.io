I certainly gave the cheque in as already proved. I saw a man at the corner, and he asked me if I was a painter, and I said yes; and he said 'How long have you been off?' I said 'five weeks.' He said 'I am only off last night.' So then he pulled the voucher out of his pocket and said 'Will you take this in, I had a row with them.' So I had no sus<lb></lb>picion of anything being wrong, and I took the cheque in and presented to Mr. Hex.</p>

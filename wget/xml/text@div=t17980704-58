             sworn. - I am a constable of Broad-street Ward, (produces a muslin apron); the pawnbroker is not here; the prisoner went with me to the pawnbroker's, and I found it there, it was pawned for two shillings.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Eldrid. This is my apron, I think two of them cost me twelve shillings, I had not wore this.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think it would sell for four shilling? - A. I cannot say, but I think it would.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it worth more than four-pence? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I have sat at the corner of Bedlam three and twenty years, I never was before a Justice in my life till now; the girl told me she was a nursery-maid, and her mistress had given her that, and she wanted to sell it; she asked me two shillings for it, I had but a groat in the world, I gave her that, and she was to come in the evening for the rest, but I never saw her afterwards, till the gentleman came with her; I told him directly that I had got it, I pledged the apron to give her the rest of the money.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Gover.) Remember that you tell the truth, did she give you but four-pence? - A.No more, and there was not a word about two shillings mentioned.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

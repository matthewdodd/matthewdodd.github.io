At 2 o'clock in the morning of the 2nd June I was on duty near Mr. Wilford's premises in Copperfield Road, Bow—I heard the forcing of a warehouse door, I went towards the factory and saw a light in the office; I looked through the window—it was a common candle burning—I stayed looking in at the window from one to two minutes—I saw the prisoner and another man inside—I had seen the, prisoner before.</p>

After I had looked through the window I went round the back on to the towing path of the Regent's Canal, and saw that they had forced the wicket gate open—I went through the gate and went into the factory—the light had then been blown out—when looking through the window I noticed that the prisoner was wearing a cheese-cutter cap, the other man was wearing a billy-cock—I went right through the full length of the factory into the office where the two men were—a scuffle ensued between me and the prisoner, I got hold of him, I could see him by the daylight through the window, it was getting towards daylight; he tried to get away from me—I struck him across the left arm with my truncheon and my truncheon broke in two—as soon as it was broken the prisoner said to the other man, "His truncheon is broken, land him one, settle the b----, and leave him to it"—I was instantly struck on the head with the <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> that I produce, and was knocked down insensible—when I recovered the men were gone—I then made a search in the office and over the factory, I found this cheese-cutter cap on the floor just inside the office door, also the <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi>,—it was left just by my side—I then went and called up Mr. Smith the foreman, he lives at 49, Copperfield Road, not many doors from the factory—I then examined the place to see how it had been entered; it was done by forcing the bottom part of the wicket door at the back of the factory—I compared the <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> with the marks and they corresponded; there were two marks—on 4th June, I went with Howlett to the ware-house about 10 a.m., and saw the prisoner there among several other men—I pointed him out as the man I had struck across the left arm with my truncheon on the Wednesday morning—he said, "You are mistaken, I have got the rheumatics in my arm"—he was wearing a cheese-cutter cap, which I produce, it is a newer one of the same sort as the other—he took off his coat, and he had a blister on his arm, in about that part where I had struck him—I struck him above the elbow on the fleshy part—he was taken into custody—from something I was told, I afterwards went to the saw mills next door to the factory, I saw a man there, but I would not be positive that he really was the other man, I had a doubt.</p>

               <p>—as soon as we entered the factory Clapp pointed out the prisoner, saying, "That is the man I struck on Wednesday morning"—I said, "Are you sure?"—he said, "I am positive"—the prisoner heard it, we were both standing close in front of him—I then told him that I should take him into custody—he said, "I suppose he has identified me because I wear a cheese-cutter cap," adding, "you are mistaken"—Clapp said, "I am posi<lb></lb>tive you are. the man"—I then took him to the station—he was wearing this cheese-cutter cap—on that same day he was in the passage of the police-court, and he said to me, "If you go to the saw mills, next door to the factory, you will find some iron corresponding with that"—I had this <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> in my hand at the time—I said, "How do you know that?"—he said, "I believe that was made there, and if you take that constable there he might see some one that he knows, but I suppose I am to suffer for all"—I went to the saw mills and saw some pieces of iron there, but nothing corresponding with this—there was a smith's shop there—Clapp went with me—the prisoner was at work at the factory, not at the saw mills.</p>

I am a M.R.C.S. at Kent House, Bow, and am divisional surgeon to the police—on the morning of 2nd June, about 3 o'clock, I examined Clapp—I found a contused and punctured wound on the forehead, about mid-way between the temporal bone and the middle of the skull—this <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> would be a most likely instrument to have-caused it; it was cut to the bone—it was a blow that would be likely to produce insensibility for a time—he is still under my care—On 11th June I examined the prisoner's left arm at the Magistrate's request—I found a sur<lb></lb>face that had evidently been previously a blister; it was above the elbow, about the size of a crown piece—it had been produced by some irritating substance, such as strong ammonia or cantharides—repeated applications of iodine would in my opinion produce suoh an appearance, repeated at short intervals—previous to a blister forming there would be a yellow stain; the blister would take away the yellow—I have heard the blow described by Clapp—my impression is that a bruise would not exist; the staff having broken, would break the force of the blow on the arm, and I should not expect, under those circumstances, to find a bruise, however hard the blow—I did not find any bruise on the arm.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I saw him come in' on the Tuesday morning—I opened the door for him and let him in; he had then got on a cheese-cutter cap; he also had a cheese-cutter cap that he worked in in the engine room; he had two caps, a better one that he kept at home and an old one that he kept in the engine room—I showed that to the policeman Clapp that morning, I don't know what became of it, after the prisoner was locked up it was gone, it was the same sort of cap as this with a cheese-cutter peak and a brass button at the side—I showed the prisoner the various places that had been broken open when he came in the morning—I showed them to the other men when they came—I also showed them the cap—I did not tell Clapp when I showed him the cap that all the men were at work but one, I did not say there was one man away; he asked me for the men on Thursday and he comes in and says "That is the man"—I had not before that told him that all the men were there, except one; I never told him that—before the prisoner made the observation about dreaming, he had seen that the office was broken open.</p>

I live at 15, Nelson Street, City Road—I have lived with the prisoner as his wife for six years—all that time he has been a hard working, industrious man—I remember his being taken into custody on this charge on the Friday morning—on the Monday before that he was at work and came home that night at 8 o'clock—he and I slept in the same bed and</p>

               <p>two children—he went to bed between 9 and 10 that Monday night—he did not get up or go out at any time during the night; I am quite sure of that—six weeks before this occurred he had been complaining of rheumatics in the arm—I know Mrs. Stent—I saw the prisoner in possession of this bottle on the Wednesday night before he was taken when he came home, I used some of it on the muscle of his left arm on the Wednesday night, I put it on with my finger and rubbed it in, I had no brush to put it on with; he had been using it before this occurred, Mrs. Stent had given it to him—he complained to me on the Wednesday night of his arm being worse, he said he had had to fetch a piece of lead from Bishopsgate Church and he had got to Whitechapel Church before he could get any conveyance and that had caused a sprain or made his arm worse—there was a stain on his arm a fortnight before that where he first used the iodine down at the factory, it was a yellow mark—I used the iodine again on the Thursday morning and on Thursday night I gave him some horse oil to rub in; I don't know what was in it, but it caused the blisters—that was on the Thursday before the robbery; no, the Thursday after the robbery, the 3rd of June—I used the iodine first on Wednesday, the 2nd—I know that he had been using it some time before; I had not seen it, he used it at the factory; I had seen the mark on his arm, the yellow—he was in great pain on the Thursday, and it was then that the horse oil was used—I slept with him on the Monday night, I did not miss him from the bed at any time during the night; if he had got out of bed I certainly must have missed him—he slept at home on the Tuesday night, he went to bed between 9 and 10 o'clock and he never went out from the time he came home till he went to work on the Wednes<lb></lb>day morning.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The first time I actually saw the iodine used was on the Wednesday night after the robbery, I used it myself on his arm; he complained of very great pain; I only used it twice, once on the Wednes<lb></lb>day night, and once on the Thursday morning—I used a good deal on the Wednesday night—I did not use it anywhere but on the arm—on the Thursday morning I used it again slightly, at the same place—he did not go to his work on the Thursday—on the Thursday night I put on the horse oil; it still pained him very much—I rubbed it in well, and wrapped it up in flannel; exactly in the same place, and nowhere else—I had not seen any stuff in his possession before the Wednesday night; but when he came here a fortnight before, his arm was coloured, and he said he had used some stuff at the factory—I went to bed between 11 and 12 o'clock on the Tues<lb></lb>day night—I work in the same line as the prisoner, the card-board line; he is the engineer at the cardboard factory; I dont work there, I work in Thames Street, my hours are from 9 o'clock sometimes till 6 o'clock at night—I attend to my household duties, and the children—I go to bed very tired—the prisoner went to bed before me that night—he usually went to bed at the same time; he went to bed between 9 and 10 o'clock that night—I said before the Magistrate that I saw him get out of bed between 5 and 6 o'clock on the Wednesday morning, he was walking about the room because of his arm being so bad—I did not get any rest at all on account of his arm—he got out of bed between 5 and 6 o'clock to go to his work on the Wednesday—I had been asleep all night.</p>

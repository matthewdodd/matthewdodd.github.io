                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JOHN PEEK</hi>. I am a sailor, and live in Leeds-passage, Greenwich. On the 27th of July, I went to the Wheat Sheaf, Greenwich—there I had some gin and water, for which I changed half-a-crown—I had a half-crown and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. about me—I drank all my gin and water—I fell asleep—I was sober—I was asleep about half an hour, and the prisoner awoke me, by pulling me into her lap under the table—my money was in my breeches pocket—I felt her hand in that pocket—I found all my money was gone—the half-crown I can swear to, but the two shillings I cannot—I had been robbed once before, and I had marked my money after that—the half-crown was marked—I had seen the prisoner before I went to sleep, and had spoken to her—I had not given her any money—I had nothing to do with her.</p>

I happened to be in the Wheat Sheaf between nine and ten o'clock that morning, when this happened—I saw the prisoner come in and sit down by the side of the sailor—I saw her pull her hand out of his pocket, but I cannot swear that she took any thing out—she put 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. into my hand, and I suspected she had done something wrong—I <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> it under the form, and awoke the sailor, and told him to get an officer.</p>

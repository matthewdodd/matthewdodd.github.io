                  </hi>. I reside at 39, Saville Street, Great Portland Street, Fitzroy Square—I was acquainted with the deceased—on Sunday evening, 6th November, at 8 o'clock, I was in Saville Lane, Saville Street, with Mr. and Mrs. McGill, a cousin of Mrs. McGill, the prisoner, and the deceased—after supper we went to convey the young woman, Miss Maitland, to a 'bus, and on returning we had some drink at a public-house in Cirencester Place—after leaving there the prisoner and I went to a public-house in Carburton Street, and had a pint of beer, and were standing there when the deceased came in—the prisoner insulted the deceased; the words tire too indistinct in my recollection to use them under oath—the deceased challenged him to repeat the insult, which he did—the deceased then struck the prisoner, and they fought several rounds; at the last knock<lb></lb>down the prisoner would not rise—the deceased then left the bar—the prisoner and I finished our pint, and left to go home—we had not gone very far down the street when the deceased came up, seized the prisoner by the shoulder, and asked him if he had had enough, or did he wish for any more—they then stripped, and fought in the street; it ended in the prisoner being several times thrown, and the arrival of the police, when he was taken to the hospital to be dressed—after being dressed, we left the hospital and went home—immediately after coming out of the hospital the deceased disappeared—the prisoner, I, and the witness Euston went home; we got home about 11.15, and went to bed—the prisoner and I slept in the same bed, and Euston in a bed near us, with the deceased—the deceased came in and went to bed about half-an-hour after us—all was quiet until about 4 o'clock, when the prisoner got out of bed and examined the bed the deceased was in—I was awake, and saw him—after having examined the bed, he exclaimed "Are you there, you b——?"—he then left the bed<lb></lb>room, and went into the workshop, the next room—he then returned, and requested the deceased to get up out of bed—he did not get out—the witness Euston, having seen the prisoner strike a blow at the deceased, sprang out of bed over the deceased, and took the prisoner out of the bed-room into the workshop—the deceased then got up and bolted the door, and commenced to dress himself—Euston then requested to be let in, he being undressed; the dececased let him in, and again bolted the door—the prisoner then came to the door, and requested to be let in, saying he would show who was the cur now (the deceased had called the prisoner a our in the beer-shop)—he was not let in, but the landlord appeared on the scene, and requested the deceased to open the door to allow the prisoner to go to bed, and, at</p>

               <p>his request, the door was opened, and the prisoner was admitted—the deceased charged him with striking him on the arm with a file, while in bed, when the prisoner said "Me strike you with a file? I could have dashed your brains out with it if I had liked"—thus provoked the deceased struck the prisoner in the face; they exchanged blows rapidly, when the deceased called out "He's got a knife! he's got a knife! I am stabbed! I am stabbed in the guts!"—McGill and Euston then hurried the deceased away to the hospital, and I and Seary were left alone in the room—he commenced to dress himself to go out, and was just on the landing when the police and McGill returned from the hospital, and took him into custody—the deceased's name was James Gordon Kennock—I saw his dead body the day after his death.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CHESTER</hi>. I was one of the supper party at 39, Saville Street—we had the usual glass of beer there, that was all, just one glass at supper—after seeing Miss Maitland to the omnibus, Mr. and Mrs. McGill, the deceased, the prisoner, and myself went to the public-house in Cirencester Place—we had some brandy there, as near as I can recollect five quarterns—we were all friendly, drinking each other's health—McGill and the deceased then went home, and the prisoner and I went to a beer-shop at the corner of Carburton Street, and had a pint of beer, and when the deceased came in he had a share of it, a glass; the prisoner treated him—there was only one pint—at that time the prisoner was a little under the influence of liquor; he was easier affected than the rest of us—I say that from my previous knowledge of him—he was not very much affected—when he has taken a considerable amount he is very much affected by it—I have seen him drunk several times—he is very noisy then, knocking about, and seems not to know what he is doing; he tumbles about greatly—I can't remember the nature of the prisoner's insult to the deceased in die beer-shop; I was so completely upset with the fight: this was before the fight—I remember well enough that it was an insult, because the deceased challenged him to repeat it, and he did; but I cannot recollect the words—he called him a name, something of that—it was a slight insult—Kennock struck Seary first, he struck him in the face—the struggle lasted about a minute—they both struck—Kennock struck him generally about the head and face; I can't say how many blows were struck; it being so short, I should not expect more than a dozen blows passed between them—Seary was knocked down more than once at that scuffle, and in the second fight, in the street, he fell several times—he got the worst of it; the deceased fell as well—I should think the prisoner fell two or three times—I can't say where he was hit—no doubt he was hit on the head as well as other parts of the body—his head was cut by falling on the kerbstone, at the last fall—he appeared to be pretty well sobered after the fight—nothing was said about giving the deceased into custody for the assault—the police accompanied us to the hospital, in case there should be such a thing—I ac-companied the prisoner home from the hospital, and put him to bed—he did not behave very quietly on the way home, he used threatening language—I don't think he was awake when the deceased came to bed—when the prisoner arose, about 4 o'clock, he was partly dressed—he slept in his trowsers; he was just as he had laid down—he went and examined the deceased's bed—he did not look under the bed, that I am aware of; I did not notice that—there was a small gaslight in the room—we had utensils in the room for the purposes of nature—there was one under the deceased's</p>

               <p>bed—I am inclined to think that the prisoner went there and used it, and after accomplishing that he examined the bed; he looked to see if the deceased was in bed—I was about eight yards from that bed; the prisoner was leaning over the bed, looking into the faces—he could have seen from our bed if he had liked; but, being two in a bed, I expect he wanted to be minute—he exclaimed "Are you there, you b——"—the deceased did not make any reply, that I recollect—the prisoner was about a minute in the workshop; when he came back he went to the bed and challenged the deceased to get up now—he did not call roe any name, that I recollect; he struck him with the file—Euston put him out of the room—there was no difficulty in doing it—he did not say anything, that I recollect—he asked to be let in again—he did not try to break open the door—I noticed nothing particular about him when he came in again—I noticed nothing in his hand—he could have concealed anything if he had liked—the knife is much smaller than the file—they struck each other about a dozen times in that fight; the blows were mostly about the head and face—I saw no knife in the prisoner's hand during the scuffle—I had not seen a knife in that room in the course of that day or evening—we have the usual shoe-maker's implements in the workshop; everything we use in the trade—the prisoner did not seem excited when Euston was putting him out of the room; there was nothing particular about him; when he said he could have knocked the deceased's brains out, he said it in a determined manner—the deceased had been living there since March last; I have known him from boyhood, sixteen or eighteen years—he was quiet and peaceable, very in<lb></lb>dustrious, and steady—I have known the prisoner about fifteen months, since he came to Saville Street—he is quiet and inoffensive when sober; not so very industrious—I was alone with him in the room after the deceased was taken to the hospital—he was siting on a box, by the side of my bed, until they left; after that he searched for his boots, and was in the workshop searching there to get ready to go out; he was just on the landing, going out, when the policeman came—he asked me which public-house it was that was open in Portland Street, and I had just said it was the one below the church, when I heard the footsteps of the policeman—that may have been seven or ten minutes after the deceased was taken to the hospital—when McGill asked the prisoner what he had done it for he seemed rather nasty, and said "Away with your Scotch sympathies, does any more of you want any of it?"—he did not appear to be excited, he quietly sat down.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> He used threatening language on returning from the hospital—he said "Oh, I will be a Traupman, I will do for him before to-morrow night"—it could not exceed a minute after the deceased struck him before he called out that he was stabbed—I never saw the knife at all—McGill had his hands round the prisoner, attempting to get the knife from him when ho said "Away with your Scotch sympathies."</p>

I am house surgeon at the Middlesex Hospital—on the evening of the 6th November the prisoner was brought there—he had a con<lb></lb>tused wound on the forehead, with the surface broken—it was partly lacerated and partly contused—it was bleeding slightly—it penetrated the whole depth of the soft parts over the forehead down to the bone—it was not a long wound, speaking roughly, about an inch—the prisoner was intoxicated—I did not see him when he was brought in—he was sitting in a chair when I saw him—he was incapable of controlling his muscles—he could not hold up his head, he let it drop down while his wound was being dressed—he was very much affected by drink—such a blow as I have heard described inflicted on a drunken man I should say would not be liable to bring on mania—possibly it might produce compression of the brain—I mean it would not produce mania for any considerable length of time, it might happen after some length of time—the effect of compression would be to deprive a person of control over their actions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There was not anything like compression—I found no symptom of it, if there had been any such thing it would have manifested itself Afterwards, next day in all likelihood.</p>

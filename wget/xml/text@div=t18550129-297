                  </hi>. I am a linendraper, in Richard-street, Woolwich. I remember the prisoner coming to the shop on 6th Jan.—she asked to look at a bonnet—I showed her some—she selected one, and purchased it—there was another person with her—one of them paid for it—the prisoner then asked for some ribbon—there was one yard of ribbon purchased, which was also paid for, I believe by the other party; I will not be quite positive—the prisoner then asked for some stockings; but after having shown her the ribbons, I missed one piece—I showed her the stockings; but previous to showing her them, I marked how many there were—she did not like them, and I showed her some more; and on putting them away, I found there was one pair gone from each paper, and she had only paid for one pair—I directed one of my young men to get an officer, and I went on showing her some belts and other things—they then wanted ribbons again—I showed them one drawer, and they did not like that—I showed them another, and I missed one piece of ribbon from that drawer—I missed, in all, two pieces of ribbon and one pair of stockings—I was positive about the stockings, because I marked them.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police sergeant, R</hi> 12). I was called into Mr. Stone's, and the prisoner was given into my custody—I found a pair of stockings on the ground, between the prisoner and the counter, and one roll of ribbon partly attached to her dress, and partly on the ground—the roll was on the ground, and the ribbon attached to her; whether in her pocket or the folds of her dress, I cannot tell—this other ribbon I found</p>

               <p>on the top of this basket, which the prisoner said belonged to her—I asked her if she had anything else belonging to Mr. Stone; she said, "No"—I felt outside her dress, and felt something in her pocket—I put my hand in, and found this belt—she had a baby sitting on the counter.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable attached to the General Post Office—on 21st January, I received instructions, and placed myself near the post-office, in Fleet Street, kept by Mr. Smith, in such a position as to see everyone passing in and out—it is a shop—about 2.30 in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner go in; he had two letters and a packet in one hand—he walked up to the counter, put them down and took the packet to some scales on the counter, he then went to the desk again, took up some other papers; and walked to a bag hanging there and put some in, but I saw that he took one away—I followed him up Fleet Street, and found him tearing the cover off a parcel—I took it from him, and said "You must go back with me to the post office," and when we got there I asked him what letters he had to post—he said one for Mr. Hamilton, of Paternoster Row, and one to Wick, and the packet he had was addressed to Leeds—a piece of the paper was gone—any one would see that it was a newspaper—a halfpenny stamp is on it now—I asked him the address on the paper I had taken from him—he said that he did not know—I said "Did you take it from the post-office," and he said "I did; it is no use denying it "—he is employed at a newsagent's, at 29, Bouverie Street—the bag into which he put the letters was for newspapers.</p>

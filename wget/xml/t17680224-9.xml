               <p>Q. Did you know him before?</p>
               <p>Solomon. No, I had never seen him before to my knowledge, but I know him well; I walked two miles with him; he was taken about ten or eleven days after, and I picked him out from among the rest of the prisoners.</p>

               <p>Turner. I advertised the watch twice, the prosecutor came and owned it; here is also a pistol, a powder-horn with gunpowder in it, a bag with several slugs in it, which were taken from the prisoner there (produced in court.)</p>

            . I am coachman to Mr. James; we were going from London on the 24th of January to my master's house, and were stopped about a quarter after ten by the prisoner in Islington back road; he presented a pistol first to me, and said, stop, which I did; then he went to the chariot, and presented his pistol, but I cannot be sure what he said; I saw my master deliver him some money; after he was gone, my master stept out of the chariot and ran after him; I went on to our country-house with the chariot; I looked at the prisoner when he was at the chariot, and know him to be the man.</p>

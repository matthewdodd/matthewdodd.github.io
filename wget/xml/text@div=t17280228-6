            , Constable, depos'd, That Mr. Betty sent for him, and said, he had a Thief in his House, meaning the Prisoner, and desired this Deponent to take him to the Watch-house and run him to Charges; but this Deponent not being actually charg'd, and the Prisoner appearing to be an inoffensive Person, he could not comply with the malicious Desires of Mr. Betty. This Deponent further said, that in Consequence of Mr. Betty's Actions, the Prisoner had put him in the Crown, and that he heard Mr. Betty say, he was obliged to swear the Robbery upon him in order to secure himself, and to intimidate the Prisoner. The Prisoner said in his Defence, That his Brother was indebred to Mr. Betty, and not being in a Capacity to pay, this Prosecution was carried on in order to make him discharge his Brother's Debts, and that Mr. Betty, by Menaces and Threatnings, had extorted several promissory Notes from his Brother, which he was under no Obligation to pay. This being confirm'd by a Cloud of Witnesses, and the Prisoner's good Character being indisputable, he was <rs id="t17280228-6-verdict29" type="verdictDescription">

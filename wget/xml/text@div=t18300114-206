               <p>EDWIN BATCHELOR. I live next door to Mr. William McBean. On the evening of the 4th of December I was standing at my door at nine o'clock, and saw Hobson at the rails; in a few minutes Creed came out of the prosecutor's house with a white bag, which he gave to Hobson, who put it under his coat, and they both ran down the street together - Mrs. McBean came to the door, and I told her - I knew Creed before and had seen Hobson.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Were you at the Police-office? A. Yes; I said I thought they were the men - I did not like to say before their face that they were the men, but when they were away I said I was sure they were; I am thirteen years of age - I had not known Hobson long; I did not say I was afraid the officer would beat me if I did not say they were the men.</p>

            . I am the wife of William McBean; he keeps a pie-shop. On the day in question, a little before nine o'clock, we had a bag in our shop which contained about five quarterns of flour, and by the side of it about six pounds of meat; I was in the back parlour, and heard a noise - I went out and missed them; I have never seen them since.</p>

I was going round about nine o'clock; the witness called me and said she had lost the flour; I ran down two or three streets, but could see nothing of it - I told another Policeman, came back, and this boy gave me a description of them; I took the prisoners about ten o'clock - there was a mark of flour on Hobson's waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know Hobson? A. Yes; when I lived in Chelsea he was waiter at the Woodman and had a good character - this lad did not like to say any thing because he knew Creed.</p>
               <p>Creed's Defence. I had carried a box to Baker-street and met Hobson as I returned; we were coming up Chapel-street, and the officer said to him, "I want you;" and he said to me, "You may as well come" - he took us to the shop, and the little boy said he did not think we were the persons.</p>

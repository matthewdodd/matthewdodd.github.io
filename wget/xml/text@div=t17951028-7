               <p>Q. Did you lose any bank notes from your house? - Yes, a ten pound and a fifteen pound notes; they were in my fob pocket on the 23d of September, in the morning, I lost them out of my fob pocket; the prisoner lived servant along with me about five or six weeks; I am not positive he took them out; I took them the night before, one of Captain Edwin and the other of Mr. Wallis. I have not seen them since.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to lose them out of your fob? - It was very early in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you up or in bed? - Up. I got up very early in the morning to do my business, and while I was up the button came off my small clothes, so I went up stairs and changed them, and took them down stairs to the servant maid to put a button on them; and I called her before she put the button on, and she left them by the fire screen while she came up to me. I don't know that of my own knowledge.</p>

How soon was it afterwards that you missed your notes? - About a couple of hours, the same morning; I put the breeches on, and went to feel for the notes, and found the fob sewed up, by sewing the button on, and I cut it open, and found the notes gone. I have a very good opinion of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never knew any thing of them. I was only taking down a pair of shoes from the shelf to clean, for Mr. Fox's son, which he asked me for, and I took the breeches in my hand, and I said, master Tom, I will ask your dadda for these breeches, he will hardly wear them again, they are all broke at the knee; and somebody called for a pint of beer, and I went down to draw it.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. When had you last seen your notes? - I put them in my pocket the night before, and found them in my pocket when I got up.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any other paper in your breeches? - None. I have enquired into his character, and I find he has a very excellent one.</p>

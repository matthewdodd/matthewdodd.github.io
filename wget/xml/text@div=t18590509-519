                  </hi>. I live in Nottingham-street—I am bell-toller in the Church of St. Mary-le-bonne—this picture was fixed up in that church over the altar—I was there on 31st March at the evening service—the church was closed after the service—I believe I was the last person in the Church—it was near 9 o'clock—Ship, the pew-opener, was there—we left together—this picture was safe at that time—this prayer-book was kept on the altar on the reading cushion, within the altar rails—I can't say whether the book was open—this letter was left on the vestry table—I left it there myself—it was as it is now, with the exception of one line in it; it is a begging letter—the next morning the pew-opener came for me—I went to the Church and found this picture, precisely in the state in which it is now—I found this Prayer-Book open, and written in in the way it is now—I then saw this letter—the inscription on this picture is, "Learn to worship God and destroy rubbish"—it is scratched on the varnish of the picture—the vestry door was forced open, the cords of the window were cut and tied down, and, I should say, the window was open two feet or more—there were several monuments in the church defaced, and a great deal of writing on them—on Worms' monument was written, "No business in a church"—Lord Teign<lb></lb>mouth's monument had an arm defaced, and was written upon, "Not wanted here"—on Colonel Fitzgerald's monument the face is nearly lost, and the words written, "Learn your horses to smoke; you have made asses of your<lb></lb>selves"—there was a horses head on it, and a pipe in the horse's mouth—on Mr. Corbyn's monument the words were written, "What an old guy"—on Mr. Fairlam's monument the bearings were defaced, and the head destroyed, and on it was written, "Your herald's college in the college-room"—on another monument was a drawing of a monkey with a pipe in its mouth—there were several other inscriptions on different parts—none of them were there on the previous evening.</p>

I live at 18, Nottingham-street, and I am one of the pew-opener at Mary-le-bonne Church—on 31st March I locked up the church in the evening, and left everything safe—none of this damage was done at that time—on the following morning I went to the church at 8 o'clock—after I had seen some of this damage I called the last witness—this Prayer Book was lying open on the kneeling cushion, outside the communion rails—all the damage spoken to was done when I first went—there are two gal<lb></lb>leries in the church, and stairs leading up to them—a person, if so disposed, might conceal himself in the gallery or anywhere in the church.</p>

               <p>he was working in the workshop, under my superintendence, but not always—he worked out sometimes—he was very much in the habit of writing while he was there—he wrote on his work and about the walls—he was making benches and rails—he wrote with pencils—I have had opportunities of seeing his writing, and judging of it—the writing on the cover of this Prayer Book I believe to be his—the writing in this other book I believe to be his—in page 426, here is something which I believe is his writing—in page 430, here is written, "London is the place for rubbish," which I believe is his writing—I saw him write on the wall, "Rubbish"—"Old Guy," and a pipe in his mouth—he was very much against smoking—I have heard him make a great many remarks against it—in the asylum, books are lent to patients, and he used to write in them—in this picture there is a pipe in the mouth, and "Rubbish" written under it—I believe that to be his writ<lb></lb>ing—in different parts of the asylum there is written, with a black lead pencil, "Marlborough; thy name shall never die though fools forget thee. In a noble house like this, not envied is a fool's condition; for, when he gets cured of disease, he dies of inanition". "Lunatic doctors of lunacy—the lawyer's slaves"—What is a comet? the answer is in Psalm 115, verse 16, 'The working man's stumbling block'"—and a great many other things, which I believe to be his writing—I can't say whether he had a Bible there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the Physician of the Hanwell Lunatic Asylum—the prisoner was admitted a patient there in March, 1857, and was there till November, 1858—there was a great deal of violence and destructiveness about him—he broke windows, and I believe he broke some statues, but I am not quite certain—he was very difficult to discover—he was very coherent in his conversation, and was constantly writing letters to the committee and others—he was discharged because the committee thought him sane, and wished him to be discharged; but I could not make up my mind that he was sane—I called in my colleague, and he thought it would be advisable to discharge him conditionally, for a month or two; and, if during the period of probation any violence occurred, he might be brought back without any certificate—his father refused to do anything with him—and his brother they said he was a most violent character—they referred me to Mr. Talkin's, a baker—he gave a very kind description of him—from what I have seen of him, and what I heard previously, I have no doubt he is of unsound mind—I consider that that unsoundness of mind would pro<lb></lb>duce the effects we have heard of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You were not satisfied with his being discharged? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was very doubtful about it—he was there eighteen months, and for the last few months his conduct was greatly improved—I understand he had formerly an injury in his head, and was in the Middlesex Hospital.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did a Catholic priest tell you that I broke your images? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; my servant said she saw you there—I did not say, "breaking images,"—I said "statues."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> You are demented; if not, you would not have put a formid<lb></lb>able weapon in the hand of Roberts to go and kill Brady—I have seen Catholic priests there—you had better go back to your native Ireland; you are no use here—the doctor who recommended you came and looked in my eye, and said he could tell a lunatic by looking in his eye—what a precious fool he must be.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's father—I remember his being in the Middlesex Hospital for six weeks—it was when he was in his apprenticeship, twenty years ago—he was treated for brain fever; and from that time to the present there have been symptoms of the same affliction—I believe they exist to the present time.</p>

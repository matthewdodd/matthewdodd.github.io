On the 23d of July, having missed articles, I got an officer to watch, and in half an hour he called me; I found the prisoner in his custody, and saw him find 2 lbs. of jalap in his hat. He begged forgiveness, and said he was starving - he was about three years in my employ, at 16 s. a-week.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you think he took it for his own use - A. I cannot tell. He behaved well in my employ, and I had a good character with him. I swear that it is jalap. He is married, and has four children.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was concealed in the prosecutor's premises, and about three o'clock I heard Mr. Andrews call to the prisoner to stir up the jalap, which he did - he then went to the door, looked about, and then pulled off his hat; he took up this jalap, and put it into it, and went into the stable. I followed, took his hat off, and found it there. I found more at his lodgings.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 11, Turville-street, Church-street, Bethnal-green. The prisoner occupied a room in the same house—I have been there between five and six months, and she was there before me—on the 4th of September, I was sitting in my room smoking my pipe by the fire-side after having tea, talking to my wife—the prisoner opened the door and came in—she said, "You b—vagabond, what did you say to my husband the other day when you came from the Docks with him?"—I told her to go out of my room, for I did not want to have any words with her at all—she went out in a few minutes and stood on the stairs—she still kept abusing me, the door being open—my wife said, "This is the way she has been using me all the day"—I then asked her what she meant by ill using my wife all the afternoon—I went onto the stairs to ask her for an explanation, and she struck me over the head with the staircase broom—it was a half-round broom—my wife stood at the foot of the stairs—the blood flowed in torrents down my head, and I said, "See, she has done for me"—she was above me at the time up three or four stairs—I turned round and said to my wife, "Can I put up with this?" and walked up two or three more stairs within three stairs of the top—the prisoner had re<lb></lb>treated up stairs—she then <hi rend="italic">chopped</hi> me on the head with a knife, within an inch of where it was cut in the first instance—I reeled and fell against the wainscot—two young men caught me in their arms and took me to the surgeon—I know nothing more till I found myself in the London Hos<lb></lb>pital next morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's wife. On the 4th of September the prisoner came into our room, opened the door, and began to blackguard my husband, and abuse him in a very scandalous manner—she then went on to the stairs, and kept on abusing him—he went out and asked her what she meant by ill-treating and abusing his family all the morning—(I had told him what had happened in the morning)—I was behind him, begging of him to come down and say nothing to her—he was within about three stairs of the top, and she struck him a violent blow with a short-handed broom—he turned down stairs, pouring with blood—I ran down for assistance, and brought up two young men—he had then fallen against the wainscot at the bottom of the stairs, and was bleeding more than when I went down—I did not see the second blow given, only the first—the young men are not here—they were in the habit of using the beer-shop below.</p>

Q.</hi> Did you see your husband go any higher than within three stairs of the top? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—it was the broom she used to sweep her place that she struck him with—she had been quarrelling with me in the course of the morning, for three or four hours—I had given her no cause—she wanted me to drink with her, and I refused, and she wanted to put her mother, who was in liquor and all over mud, into my bed, but I would not let her—I did partake of a little sip of drink with her, merely to save words, as I was out on an errand, and met her and a lodger, they asked me to come with them, I said I would not have any more words about it, and I did take a little drop—we had a quartern of gin between four of us, at a gin-palace at the corner of Brick-lane—that was between two and three o'clock in the afternoon—I never partook of any thing after that, nor before—I was getting my dinner ready when she and her mother came in—my husband and I were taking tea when she came in, and he was smoking his pipe—she opened the door, and said, "You b vagabond, what did you say to my husband when you came with him from the Docks?"—he said, "You drunken, stinking beast, get out of my room, or I will make you"—on that he got up and went towards the door—I told her not to annoy him as</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, in Shoreditch.

                  </hi>. I was a policeman at the time in question.

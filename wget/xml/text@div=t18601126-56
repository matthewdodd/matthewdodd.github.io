                  </hi>. I carry on business as a saddler's ironmonger, at 21, Fore-street, and have an extensive business there—Barnard was in my employ as a warehouseman, up to 2d November, and had been so about seven or eight years; I cannot state it exactly—I know Mulley—I have seen him occasionally at my warehouse—he has been coming backwards and forwards for purposes of business there, I should think, about twelve months—he was a customer of mine for ready money—I had no account with him—I have seen the articles that Hubble has brought here to-day—they are the same that were shown to me at the station-house—he showed me some property that was found in the prisoner's room up stairs; consisting of various kinds, the same sorts as we sell—I identify the goods produced by Hubble to-day; they are part of what was in our warehouse—the brushes have our name on them—the goods that were taken from our premises have our private mark upon them—on the afternoon of 2d November, I saw Mulley in our shop—Barnard was serving him—after Mulley had left, I went to Moor-lane police-station—I saw Mulley in custody there—I asked him how he accounted for having so many more goods in the parcel, than he had paid for at our warehouse—he said he did not know that there were any more than he had paid for; that he did not see what was packed up in his parcel—I asked him where he got the two brushes from, and some other articles also which were taken out of his pockets; some mane combs, and polishing-paste—he said he brought them from home with him; that he expected to meet with a customer, and, not meeting with one, he was taking them back again—I had given the officer previous instructions—I can hardly tell you the value of the goods in the parcel which Mulley put into the cart, without including the brushes and things taken from his person; but the skins and buckles and things in the parcel, would be worth considerably more than 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; about 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.

                  </hi>. I am a warehouseman in the employ of Mr. Eldred, of Fore-street—I have been in his service eleven years—I have been in the habit of seeing Mulley come to my employer's—I made a communication to the cashier—on 2d November, I saw Mulley in my master's shop—I saw him when he first came in—Barnard was not there then—I heard Mulley spoken to by Mr. Eldred—Mr. Eldred said Barnard would be in shortly, and would serve him—Mulley said very well, he would wait—I have, on more than one former occasion, known that to take place, that Barnard was out—Mulley has always expressed a wish to wait—on the 2d, he waited—I saw Barnard come in—we sell at the counter—if the quantity of goods bought is very small indeed, we pack them up as we sell them—a package like this one (<hi rend="italic">pointing one out</hi>), would be supposed to be packed by ourselves—a large parcel, we should be supposed to take to the packer—at the time Mr. Eldred told him that Barnard was absent, the other men were doing their ordinary work—he was served by Barnard on that afternoon, with the goods which are now in Court, I believe—the invoice was written by Barnard, who packed the goods himself—it is our custom, when the invoice is made, to get somebody to check it—on this occasion, it was given to Mr. Taylor, the cashier, and he checked it—if we draw an invoice ourselves, it is checked by another to see if the amounts are carried out correctly, and the addition is correct also—the articles ought to have been called over, but on this occasion, it is evident, they were not—that is done by the cashier—he has a desk in the centre of the warehouse, where he is able to see all that is going on—our ordinary course of business, in checking the articles in the parcel, was departed from in this instance—while Mulley was purchasing these goods, Barnard went up stairs, and Mulley with him—we keep brushes up stairs, and goods of other kind; saddlery—while they were up stairs, I examined the parcel that had been left on the counter—I found in it, two curry-combs, a remnant of cloth, or serge you might term it, and these two pieces of leather; the buckles were not there—that was before the invoice was made—I saw Mulley leave the shop with that parcel—Barnard made it up.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">the Prisoner</hi>). I have been in the employ of Mr. Eldred for sometime past—I first became acquainted with Mulley about a twelve month ago, I think—I believe he was then a customer's journeyman. He used to come backwards and forwards to the shop—I have changed him lower generally for my master's goods than I have charged the generality of customers; I do not think my master, or any one else in the place, knew of that. It has been for perhaps the last two months that I have charged him lower—I did not supply him on 2d November with these two skins; he brought them to the warehouse with him tied up, and asked me to enclose them in his parcel—I had a conversation with Mr. Eldred about those skins at the station. I let him have those covered buckles; I could not exactly enumerate the things I let him have on that occasion, but I know there were several little things put in the parcel which Mr. Mulley did not</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Thames Police Inspector</hi>). On Saturday evening, 12th December, about 8.30, I was on duty in the Police Galley, in the Thames, off Pickle Herring Stairs, and saw the two prisoners in a small tug-boat going up the river—Clark stepped out and made the tug-boat fast to a barge—I went alongside, and said to Peek, "What have you in the tug?"—he said, "Wheat!"—I said, "Where have you brought it from?"—he said, "From Mr. Matthews' place; we are going to load upon Monday"—I said, u Have you any notes for this wheat?"—he said, "No,"—I said to Clark, "Do you belong to this tug-boat?"—he said, "No; I have only come to help him up; I know nothing about it"—I said, "I shall detain you"—Peek said, "It is all right, you can see the governor"—I said, "Who do you work for?"—he said, "For Mr. Matthews, and have for three years"—I took the prisoners into custody—I found in the boat ten sacks of grain, bearing the mark of "J. F. Cohen."</p>

                  </hi> I am a granary keeper and lighterman, at Rother<lb></lb>hithe—I do lighterage for Messrs. Cohen—Peek was in my service—Clark did not work for me—he may have done a little job some months ago—I sent Peek to Bow Creek to work 202 quarters, four bushels of wheat from the Eastern Counties Railway—that would amount to 405 sacks—on Friday he took it, and on Friday night we sent a load down to East Ham, and he was to bring up the wheat to Messrs. Cohen's mill, and deliver it there—I sent him with a barge to fetch it—I did not authorize him to take out any of the sacks from the bulk—I know nothing of Clark being with him.</p>

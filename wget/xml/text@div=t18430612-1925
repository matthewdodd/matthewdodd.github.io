                  </hi>. I live in High Holborn, and am a tobacconist; Hen<lb></lb>rietta Haywood lived with me for two months as servant of all work; the other prisoner is her father. On the 3rd of June she had the charge of my house—I went out, and came home about a quarter before seven o'clock—the door of my parlour, in my passage, was open—I had left it locked—I found the drawer open in which I kept my cash-box—I had left that drawer locked—I did not look into my cash-box at that time, but on going to the drawer some time afterwards, (after having gone out in the mean time)—I missed all the money from the cash-box except a fourpenny-piece—I had lost about 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold and silver—there were sovereigns, half-sove<lb></lb>reigns, half-crowns, and a great many fourpenny-pieces—I got an officer, and found Henrietta Haywood at her father's at Holloway—I saw her give the officer a reticule with a portion of the money in it, saying, "There is part of your property"—when we took her to the station we went back to her father's house, and there we found these ten cigars, three tobacco pipes, and the rest of the things that are mentioned in the indictment.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">William Haywood.</hi> They were of things that my daughter had pawned above twelve months; the box was locked; I had got nothing in it; my daughter had free access to it, and had a key of it; I had no knowledge of these things being there; I had some gunpowder in it, and locked it, or my children would have got at it. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> There was some gunpowder; almost all the articles in the box were mine, except the gunpowder; there were some glasses for watches which were not mine; there was an umbrella stand<lb></lb>ing up in the room, belonging to me; some of the duplicates related to cane and two snuff boxes.</p>

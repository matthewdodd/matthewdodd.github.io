               <p>Q. Can you say whether the Dartford bag arrived in its usual course on that morning - A. It did. The prisoner was on duty that morning; it was his duty to open it; in point of fact, he did open it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he employed in any other duty besides opening the bag that morning - A. Yes; he was clerk at the table; he had to sort his portion of letters at the table.</p>

               <p>Q. You assisted in sorting Country letters - A. Yes; I threw out those which were for the Two-penny Post.</p>
               <p>Q. A Wandsworth letter would be separated from the London letters - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. In the first instance, you separate all the London delivery from the Country delivery, and then you have them in two separations, those which are for the Two-penny Post; a Wandsworth letter would be delivered by the Two-penny Post - A. Yes. It was the prisoner's duty and mine, to tell the charge of the Two-penny Post.</p>

               <p>Mr. Attorney General. For instance, suppose a hundred letters to be sent by the Two-penny Post, that hundred letters would be charged two-pence each, and a hundred two-pences would be the charge of that quantity of letters, that would be handed over - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you upon that day secrete any letter that passed through your hands - A. The whole of the letters that came into my hands, I gave regularly over. We finished our duty by eight o'clock in the morning.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you on the 20th of July, receive any letter from Dartford - A. I did not; I expected one; it did not come. I expected a remittance of money; it never came.</p>
               <p>Q. Has a bank note 5325 come to your hands for ten-pound - A. It never did. No letter came to my hands on that day. I received a letter on the 22nd, but not on the 20th.</p>

               <p>Q. Where was it when you saw him again - A. At Giltspur-street Compter, about a week or a fortnight ago; I knew him as soon as I saw him; he was with several others. I have not the least doubt he is the person that came to our shop on that day.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. You had seen the prisoner on the day before - A. No. I had seen him a dozen times before.</p>
               <p>Q. You are speaking to the identity of a person that you saw in July - A. Yes. The ten-pound note drew my attention to him; from that circumstance, I have not the least doubt he is the person that gave me the note.</p>

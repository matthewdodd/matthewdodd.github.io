                  </hi>. I am an apprentice to Mr. Brown and William Crush, Pawnbrokers, they live in Museum-street, Bloomsbury. On the 16th of February, I lost a shawl from the shop—this is it—the two prisoners came there about four o'clock in the afternoon, under pretence of asking the price of a gown—they looked at one, and asked the price of it, both of them—one of them asked the price of a shawl—then the other asked the price of another gown, and then remarked how dear I was—there were several shawls hanging up—they left the shop, and did not buy any thing—there were no other persons in the shop, not any other shopman—I hung this shawl up myself—I missed it directly they were gone—they ran away from the door, that gave me suspicion—I pursued them, and overtook them in Tottenham-court-road coming out of a pawnbroker's of the name of Franklin—I do not know which of them had the shawl—I said I wanted them, and took them into the passage of the pawnbroker's, and asked the young man to mind them while I got a policeman—this is the shawl I found on one of them—one said that the other gave it to her to pledge, and the other said she met a woman, who asked her to go and pledge it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cain</hi>. He had not shown the shawl to either of us—I went in to buy a dark gown—I never noticed the shawl, till this young woman gave it me in the pawnbroker's to pledge—he never showed me any shawl—we did not run from the door—and if we had, he could have followed us, without going to inquire for us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Sarah Darnley</hi>. There were three people waiting for us, and we priced two articles, and I said they were very door, and I came along, and gave her the shawl to pledge—he did not follow us.</p>

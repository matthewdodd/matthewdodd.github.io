            . I am a silversmith. About seven o'clock in the evening of the 10th of February, the prisoner brought these spoons to me, and asked what I would give for them - I think he was about half-and-half; I asked him what he wanted for them - he said 1l., and I took him to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What are they worth? A. I suppose they cost about 8l.; I would have given 6l. for them.</p>

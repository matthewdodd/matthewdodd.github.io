            . I am a labouring man; I live at No. 9, and Mrs. Price lives at No. 7. On the 16th of November, Mrs. Price came into my room; she said she had been robbed since she had been out to work in the morning, and asked me to lend her a light to go down in this cellar; she took the light and went down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go with her - A. No; she went by herself; in about five minutes she cried out stop thief; I went to her assistance; I found her extended upon her back in the entry; the prisoner was making his escape out of the entry; I laid hold of him; he punched his head in my breast and shoved me across the channel; I held him and called for a light; when the light came I saw he had a coat on that belonged to Mr. Price, and a waistcoat under his arm, and a pair of Mr. Price's breeches on him likewise. The neighbours in the court came round; he seemed rather shy, because living in the neighbourhood some time back; he wished me to go into the house; I did; he asked me then to go down in the cellar to shew me where the stolen property was concealed; after I got this bundle I asked him if there was any more; he said yes; he took me to another part of the cellar; under the cellar stairs there was another bundle, and a coat lying on the top of the bundle; I took the two bundles and the coat and gave them to a neighbour, and desired her to keep them till Price came home, to know whether they were his or not. Some time after he gave me these small clothes off him, and said they belonged to Price. Price came home in about a quarter of an hour; he said they were his small clothes. I gave them up to the officer.</p>

There was a lattice over the door; this pair of stockings and handkerchief were tied together to assist him getting up,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180811300021"></xptr>and through the means of a chair, he got again through the window over the door.

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Harper, a shipwright, and live at No. 4, Gill-street, Limehouse. The prisoner lived three months in my service—I missed a great many articles—I found fault with her, and she quitted on the 11th of April, during my absence from home—I missed a pair of shoes the next day, of my son's, who is seventeen years of age—she came again on the Thursday—I asked her about the shoes and a petticoat I had missed—she left again during my absence—I did not know where she lived, but my little girl did, and she pointed out the house to me—I wanted her to come to my house to sleep, but she said if she gave up her lodging, she should not get it again, and she was at no ex<lb></lb>pense—I paid her a half-a-crown a week—she had told me she had lodged in St. Ann's-street, but I did not know the number.</p>

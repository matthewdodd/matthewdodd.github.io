I am landlord of the " Royal Oak " tavern, Battersea Park—on the 6th of August, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner was in the bar and taproom, and I served him with beer—there were five or six men in the taproom with him—I cannot say who called for it, but the prisoner gave me a bad florin—I said, "This is another one," and put it in my pocket—he said nothing, but some time afterwards he came out and asked for his change—I said that there was no change from me, and asked where he got it—he said that his master gave it him—I told him to go and fetich his master, and then followed him—he jumped into a gravel pit when he saw me—I gave him in custody five or ten minutes afterwards, with the florins—he appeared sober—he said that his master was Mr. Norris, who is here—I found four other bad florins in my till.</p>

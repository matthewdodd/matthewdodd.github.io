                  </hi>. I am in the service of John Beck, who lives in King-street, Holborn, in the parish of St. George, Bloomsbury—it is his dwelling-house. On the night of the 13th of Oct., when I went to bed I left my coat on—there was a key of the safe in the pocket, in which safe were two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank-notes, one 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. country-note, four sovereigns and a half, and twenty-four door plicates in a bag—the prisoner was in my master's employ, and slept in the same room—I called him at seven o'clock next morning, and he got upland went down to help the apprentice take the shop shutters down—I went down half-past seven, and found the safe-door closed—I did not miss the key from my pocket till I put my hand on the safe—I found the prisoner had gone when I came down—he had no business out—I pulled the safe door</p>

               <p>open by placing my hand on it—I pulled the drawer of the safe out, and the money and note were gone—the notes had been in a canvas bag, and the duplicates in another bag—both bags were gone—I afterwards received infor<lb></lb>mation, and went to Yeovil, in Somersetshire, and traced the prisoner from there—he was apprehended on Monday, the 19th, by the Yeovil police—he had 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 6 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in his possession—the officer asked how he accounted (or that money—he said he received it from his master—he had no wages—he lived in the house—he had been in master's service about six months.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in Mr. Beck's employment. The prisoner got up a few minutes before me this morning—the safe is on the ground floor, at the end of the shop, in the counting-house, in the front shop—there is a shop at the top of the house for the men to work in—it was the prisoner's business to attend to the top shop, and mine to attend to the one below—I got the keys from Boustead that morning, and the prisoner and I went up stairs to the top of the house to dress ourselves—the prisoner took the keys from a chair I had laid them on—he came down stairs, and took on himself my duty, by unlocking the outer shop first—he went down before me—when I came down he was at the. end of the shop, near the safe—I missed him about ten minutes after—the keys would enable him to go to the place where the counting-house is—the door was not above half a yard from the safe—he unlocked that first—his sole business was in the upper shop—he had to help me to take the shutters down into the area, but not belonging to the shop.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Would it not be his duty to come down stairs? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, but not to unlock the shop—my master was in the country on business at this time—he has been gone about three months, or rather more—I slept along with the prisoner in one bed, and the foreman slept in another bed in the same room—I got up two or three minutes after the prisoner—he got up directly after he was called, at seven o'clock—I got from Boustead the keys to unlock the shop—they were two tied by a string to a piece of wood.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman on the South Western Railway, at the Nine Elms station—the prisoner was in the employ of Mr. Sayers, the railway carrier—on 4th Dec, between eight and nine o'clock in evening, I saw the prisoner and another man with a horse and cart at the station—they unloaded it, and the other man, Pigden, drove it away out of the warehouse—the prisoner walked by the side of it, and I saw the prisoner come from the corner of the warehouse with a box which he put in the cart; it was nearly dark—I saw him come from where the boxes are kept—he got in the cart when it was going on, and proceeded on his way home—I followed him to the outer gate—no one can pass without a pass, which they get in the warehouse—I saw the prisoner deliver the pass—Pigden was in the cart and another young man, who had got in after the boxes were put in—I after<lb></lb>wards saw the pass, and I have it here—it is a pass for Sayers' van, empty; but the man who wrote the pass, has put "van" instead of "cart"—I followed the cart into the road, and said to the prisoner, "Cherry, you haw a pass for an empty cart"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "You have a box in it"—he said he knew that, it was all right—I do not believe the persons at the gate could see the box, I could hardly see it myself, it was placed under the seat—Cherry said the box belonged to them, and he would go</p>

               <p>and get a pass for it, and he got out of the cart—I afterwards looked at the address on the box, and I said to him, "You know Cherry this box does not belong to you"—he said, "It does not, but do not say anything about it, I do not mind what I give you to let me go"—I took him to the superin<lb></lb>tendent, and he said I had better see the day superintendent—there was a card on the box—I took it off and gave it to Mr. Newman, the day super<lb></lb>intendent of the goods department—I have known the prisoner there more than two years—he would know the rules and regulations there, one of which is, that a person must not take anything out without a pass, and they must not take it without a porter gives it to them—there was no porter where the prisoner took this box—there were two boxes, one inside the other.</p>

I am superintendent of the goods depart<lb></lb>ment at Nine Elms—we have boxes to be called for from the London carriers—they are placed on the carriers' side, outside the warehouse—on that Wednesday morning I received information from Charles Squires, and he gave me this card; here is on it, "William Keats, wholesale confectioner, Borough-market, Southwark"—the box was to go there—I produce the way-bill—it was sent from Portsmouth on the 3d Dec., and came to our warehouse—it was in the custody of the Railway Company—the prisoner's master is not a carrier to Portsmouth.</p>

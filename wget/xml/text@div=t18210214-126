               <p>Q. You first complained of the prisoner when she found fault with you for frequenting the free-and-easy club - A. I never did; I believe she said so. I went once as I knew a person there. She never fetched me from the public-house - I seldom go there. I do not live with my father; I am in business for myself. I left because she and I could never agree, and my father said I should be there no longer.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence written. About twenty years ago, I married my first husband; all the time I lived with him, I experienced nothing but distress, trouble, and misery. In 1817, he left me. I was obliged to apply to the parish for relief, they issued a warrant against him; both the officers and I, used all diligence to find him, but could not. During the two years of his absence, it was reported that he was dead, which I believed, and in 1820, an altrecation took place between me and my second husband's son; I fetched him from the public-house, and told him of the impropriety of his conduct, in going to a free-and-easy club, and beating his father. It was then I became the victim of his vengeance; he got his father served with the copy of a writ, and then caused me to be prosecuted.</p>

            . I am one of the beadle's of St. Leonard, Shoreditch. The prisoner was relieved by me, in July, 1818, and a warrant issued against her husband. for deserting her. I exerted myself to find him, but without effect. I went to where he had worked, they said, he had left some time, and might be dead.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODERICK. - Q. Was there not a warrant in 1817. - A. Yes, I took him then, and he was sent to prison; he afterwards disappeared, but I found him in November, 1819, as a pauper in the work-house. Staines is fellow beadle with me. I have had no conversation with him about this affair.</p>

            . I have lived all my life with my mother, except a short time. I now live in the Curtain-road. I have not seen my father for about two years and a half. He left my mother in 1817; he was released from prison on promising to allow her 4 s. 6 d. a week, which he never did, I heard in June, 1819, that he was dead; my mother and Staines also heard it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. - Q. Did you hear any one tell them so. - A. Yes. One Steadman, who is now dead, made a collection to pay for my father's funeral. My mother first went to Staines as his housekeeper.</p>

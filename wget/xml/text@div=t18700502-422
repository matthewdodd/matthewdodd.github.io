                  </hi>. I am a commercial traveller—I know the prisoners—their real names are John Joseph Solomon, and Charles Ward—in February, 1869, I was engaged by Solomon as managing clerk—he said he was doing a very extensive business and he wanted a person like myself to conduct it for him, and he would guarantee me 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week, and perhaps it might be 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the office was at 90, Lower Thames Street, and consisted of two rooms on the third floor—the name of Dickson, Wilson &amp; Co., was painted on the tablets at the door, and also on the staircase—I understood Solomon to represent Dickson, Wilson &amp; Co.—I never saw anyone else to represent them—about the end of March, or the beginning of April, 1869, Solomon told me to engage a painter and have the name of Dickson, Wilson &amp; Co., painted out, and substitute D. McFarlane &amp; Co., which was done—"Donald McFarlane &amp; Co." was put on the door, and also on the staircase, and "D. McFarlane &amp; Co., Melbourne," on the tablets at the hall door—in May, 1869, Solomon told me he had given Mr. March an order for some wheels for shipping, and that Mr. March was the agent for the Wheel and Waggon and Coker Canvas Company, of Somerset—I recollect a letter coming from Mr. March, and subsequently I wrote this letter at Solomon's dictation—(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi>

Cubitt &amp; Colin, 36, Parliament Street, and Ward &amp; Co., 247, High Street, Borough. D. McFarlane &amp; Co.")—Properly speaking, there was no such firm as Cubitt &amp; Colin—Solomon was Cubitt, and Wilson was Colin—Colin was one of the Christian names of Wilson, his name was Robert Colin Wilson—this letter signed "Cubitt, Colin &amp; Co." purports to be written from 36, Parliament Street—I saw that letter written at Solomon's office, 90, Lower Thames Street, by a person named Flatteau—it was written in draft by Solomon, and copied by Flatteas—he was employed at 36, Parliament Street—(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "18th May, 1869, Mr. March, Sir,—We must apologize for not replying to yours of the 12th instant, ere this, the same having been mislaid; in reply, we beg to say that the firm in question had been established for some years in the Austra<lb></lb>lian trade, and is generally considered to be respectable and of good standing.

We are, sir, yours respectfully, Ward &amp; Co.")—No trade was ever done between Ward &amp; Co. and McFarlane &amp; Co., while I was there—Mr. March called it 90, Lower Thames Street, about the latter part of July, after the wheels had been supplied—he said he had called for the settlement of his account—Solomon said that in consequence of the delay in the execution of the order he had missed shipping them in time, and asked him if he would draw a bill on the firm—Mr. March objected at first—Solomon said he ought not to object to draw a bill when the references had been so satisfactory, and he consented to do so—I recollect this bill coming to the office, drawn upon McFarlane &amp; Co., by the West of England Engineering and Coker Canvas Company, to whom Mr. March was the London agent—(<hi rend="italic">This was a bill of exchange for</hi> 217<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., <hi rend="italic">dated July</hi> 29<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, 1869, <hi rend="italic">at four months' date, and accepted by D. McFarlane &amp; Co.</hi>)—I accepted the bill and wrote D. McFarlane &amp; Co., by the direction of Solomon—I objected to do it as I did not want to have anything to do with accepting the bill, but Solomon said it did not make any difference, he did not want his name to be seen, he would pay it when it became due, and he was the party that was liable and not me—I never saw Mr. D. McFarlane, there was no such person, and Solomon told me so—he tried to get advances on the bills of lading for the wheels in London, after they were shipped.</p>

                  </hi>.

                  </hi>. I am housekeeper at 90, Lower Thames Street—I have known Solomon five or six years—I let the rooms originally, on the third floor, to a person named Kennard, about five years ago—he remained some few months, and then the name of Donald McFarlane was put up—I saw Solomon there then—I don't remember anyone else—the name was afterwards altered to Dickson, Wilson &amp; Co.—a Mr. Wilson was there and Solomon—I never saw a Mr. Dickson—they occupied the same rooms—after that "Donald McFarlane, of Melbourne" was painted on the tablet outside the office, and "D. McFarlane &amp; Co." on the door—I never saw any person named McFarlane—I knew the prisoner as Solomon—he paid me.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 247, High Street Borough, and am clerk to Messrs Pattenden &amp; Smith—in April, 1869, I let the ground floor to the prisoner Ward at 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—the reference he gave was Charles Hall, colonial broker—I don't know the name of the street, but it was leading out of Thames Street—he occupied the place till 7th August, 1869—the name of Ward &amp; Co. was painted over the door—I distrained for rent and got nothing—there were no goods of any kind there—I did not see Mr. Ward again till I saw him at the Mansion House.</p>

I took Solomon on 5th April—I told him I held a warrant for his apprehension—he said "I expected something of that sort"—I read it to him, and took him to the station—I searched him, and found 7 1/2 a bunch of keys, eleven duplicates, and the writ which bad been left for him to serve on Butler, and two copies of letters addressed to Dickson, Wilson &amp; Co., some letters addressed to D. McFarlane &amp; Co., and business cards of McFarlane &amp; Co.—in an iron safe at 90, Lower Thames Street, I found about 174 foreign bills—some of them are signed—they are in different languages and different countries—I found no trade books, ledgers, or anything of that kind—I have some letters of Cubitt &amp; Colin, and also some referring to Ward &amp; Co., litho<lb></lb>graphed forms—I found press copies of letters—there is a copy of Cubitt &amp; Colin's letter addressed to Mr. March.</p>

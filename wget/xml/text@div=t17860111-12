               <p>I am servant to Mr. Emmerton, he keeps livery stables, I saw the prisoner with the saddle, I did not know him before, I saw him on Monday the 9th of December last, he was coming along a passage that led from the stable, and as soon as he saw me he threw down the saddle, I took the saddle up and followed him, and he was taken in five minutes after; I lost sight of him going through a public house, about two minutes.</p>

               <p>Are you sure it is the same man that you saw drop the saddle in the passage? I am quite clear of it, as soon as ever he got by me he ran; the saddle belongs to Mr. Rodham, there is no mark upon it, it was left there in the master's name along with his horses, I had the care of it.</p>

               <p>I saw the prisoner run, and they cried stop thief! I did not see the saddle in the passage, I pursued and took him in the passage, not a hundred yards off; he run through the public house, he made a resistance and said I had no business to stop him, the man carried the saddle back again, he has had the care of it ever since it was stolen, I can swear it is the same.</p>

                  </hi>. I lived in Doughty-street, St. Pancras, on the 1st of October; I have moved since. On the night of the 1st of Octo<lb></lb>ber I was standing within the door of Mr. Birch's shop, in Great Russell-street, in conversation with the shopman—I heard a square of glass crack—I turned round, and saw a person in the act of drawing a piece of dowlas through the broken pane—about two feet of it had got outside—the whole bulk must have changed its place in the act of pulling at it, no part remained where it originally stood—Garrard seized hold of the prisoner, and I went for a policeman.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Edward James Birch, an Irish linen-dealer, in Great Russell-street, in the parish of St. George, Blooms<lb></lb>bury. I was talking to Phillips, and, on turning my head, saw the prisoner come, with her hands clenched together, through the square of glass, and seize hold of the dowlas—I opened the door and seized her, when she had got it about two-thirds out—it had been placed in an upright position, about two inches off the glass—when I secured her, it rested on the broken square of glass, and was quite off the spot it had been on before—she had hold of it at the time I took her—the constable came and secured her—her hand was bleeding—it could not have fallen against the window and broken it—she had hold of the bottom of it.</p>

I produce the dowlas which I got from Garrard—the prisoner appeared in great distress, and said, if I would let her go she would go and do the same again—that her husband had deserted her, and all her friends, and she had no where to lay her head—the shopman had hold of her when I came up.</p>

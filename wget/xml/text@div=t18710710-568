                  </hi>. I lived at 58, Newington Butts, at the time of this occurrence—I am a dealer in jewellery—on 4th of April, 1870, the prisoner came into my service as a general servant, to look after my children—I had three children, Arthur Samuel, aged six years; Alfred James, three years, and the deceased, fifteen months the day she was buried—the prisoner was in my service one week—on 7th April I and my wife went out at about 2.45 in the afternoon, leaving the prisoner in charge of my children—she was the only servant—they were in perfect good health, the deceased as well—she never had any illness in her life—we returned at 11.45 at night—we went together into the sitting-room, where the prisoner was apparently asleep—there was a very large fire—she sat close to the fire, in the arm chair—she woke up by our entering the room—none of the children were in the room with her—I believe my wife spoke to her about the children—she said they were quite well—after I had been in the room a few minutes I heard a screaming from one of my children up stairs—it was usual for the children's bedroom to be locked after they had gone to bed—I had several lodgers in the house—the key was kept in the sitting-room—the bedroom was over the sitting-room—we occupied the shop, sitting-room, and bedroom over it—the bed-room was five or six steps from the ground—the sitting-room and shop were on the ground-floor—my wife, I, and the children occupy the bedroom—the servant had another—I got the key; I don't know who handed it to me—I went up to the bedroom, and found the door locked—my lodgers have nothing to do with my apartments—when I got in I found my boy, Alfred James, lying on the floor; he had fallen out of bed—I picked him up, and placed him in bed with his brother, in the bed from which he had fallen—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187107100161"></xptr>
               <p>they had their bed together in my room—there was no light in the room, but a lamp outside gave a glimmering light, sufficient to see anyone in the room—I turned round to see the deceased, wondering she had not woke up by the noise—she was in the bed I and my wife occupy—I found her close to the wall, lying on her back, with her clothes thrown off her—the bed was close to the wall—her head was near the pillow—I reached over and caught hold of her legs—her head was about three inches from the wall—it did not touch it—the bed was on the mattress, it was narrower, and did not completely cover the mattress—her head was a little higher than the remainder of her body—the mattress was nearly touching the wall—there was not room for her head to get between—the bed sloped off—there was no crevice in which her head could get fixed—she had her night-gown on—the bed-clothes looked as if they had been kicked off—she was in the habit of kicking off the bed-clothes—she was very strong in her limbs and her bodily powers, and able to deal with any complication of the bed-clothes over her—I caught hold of her by the leg, and pulled her towards me, and said, "My poor child is dead;" she was perfectly cold—I could tell by the dead weight that she was dead—my wife came up, and took her down stairs, from my arm into the sitting-room—I followed her; the prisoner came down, and stood very unconcerned, as if nothing had occurred—I sent, and Dr. Williams came—he pronounced her dead—I asked the prisoner when she last saw it alive; she said "Half-past ten, in the middle of the bed;" I said "I don't believe it;" she made no reply—there was an Inquest on 13th April—the bed-clothes consisted of a sheet, a single blanket, and a Macella counterpane, very light—the child was never subject to fits—it had recovered about six weeks from a slight hooping cough—Mr. Cottrell, his wife, and one child, and Mrs. Brands were my lodgers—Mr. Cottrelf's child was six or seven years old—they occupied a first floor above my room—Mr. Broster, his wife, and three grown-up daughters occupied the second floor—the third floor was occupied by Mr. and Mrs. Grains, and a grown-up daughter—their occupations were distinct from each other, and my part of the house—six steps led up to my bedroom, and were part of the general flight up stairs—everybody would have to pass my bedroom—there is only one key to my bedroom—I always desired to have the door looked, and the key brought down after the children went to bed.</p>

Before Good Friday, the day this happened, the prisoner had been with me three days—her wages were 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., a week, and food, and lodging—when we left home the children were in her sole charge for nine hours—she is as much a woman as my wife—I can't say she was feigning sleep when we went in—she got up about 8.30 in the morning—I remember saying before the Coroner, in speaking of how I found the deceased: "I cannot say positively, not having a light, her actual position; as I raised her, she appeared to be on her back or body on the bed, with her head between that and the wall"—it was a full-sized iron bedstead—the mattress touched the wall, the bed did not—there was a space between the bed and the wall, of three or four inches, making a slight hollow space—her head was lying partly on the bed and partly on the mattress—the iron part of the bedstead would be uncovered near the wall—her head was lower than her legs—the verdict before the Coroner was "Accidental Death"—I said at the Inquest "I have not seen any want of feeling on Norman's part towards the deceased or any other of the children"—I never did see any, and should probably say so now—Dr. Williams said</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of the last witness—the prisoner entered my service on 4th April—a person next door, Rosina Lloyd, recommended her to me—the prisoner said she had been in Mrs. Gardner's service, Stock-well Park Road, twelve months ago, and since then she had been working at Army work—she said Mrs. Gardner had gone to Scotland—I thought it no use applying for a character—I was rather prepossessed with the prisoner, she seemed so very clean and respectable—I had three children, all well—the deceased never had any illness; only slight hooping cough—I wanted no doctor for that—she at this time had been well six, seven, or eight weeks—she was a lively child—on Good Friday, at 2 o'clock, she was playing with the kitten—she did not eat her dinner—it was salt fish, and she gave it to the kitten, and fell over the plate, but did not hurt herself—we went out about 2.45—I said "Be sure and take charge of the children," and she asked if she might have needlework, and I said "Yes, I don't want you to do any work, but take care of the children"—we returned about 11.45 or 11.50—we went into the sitting-room—the prisoner was there, in front of the fire; she appeared to be dozing—my going into the room probably roused her—I said "How are the children, Agnes?"—she said "Oh, very well, ma'am, Jessy was rather cross in the park, and I could not keep her from going to sleep"—I had told her never to let them sleep out of doors, in case of accidents—I said "Perhaps she is not very well," but I knew nothing serious could be the matter with her—she said "The man has not brought the beer"—I said "You had better make me some tea, I am so thirsty"—while she was making tea, we heard the second little boy scream out—I said to ray husband, "Run up stairs, there's one of the children fallen out"—he got the key, and went up stairs—she was getting a light when he called out "My girl is dead"—I rushed up, and he had her quite dead in his arms—the child was brought down stairs, and I put her feet in hot water, and went for a doctor—the prisoner seemed reluctant to go up stairs with the light—she went up when she heard that the child was dead—she passed no remarks whatever—she was not agitated, she never offered to look at the child afterwards—she said she last saw it alive at 10.30, lying on its left side, the same as when she put it to bed—Dr. Williams showed me marks on the lower part of the child's lower lip, about the width of two or three teeth—the gums were perfectly white, as if blood<lb></lb>less—the child had all its front teeth—there were teeth top and bottom, opposite the mark on the lip—the castor would prevent the bedstead coming close to the wall—she was a big girl—there was not sufficient room for her head to have got between the bed and the wall—her feet were towards the middle of the bed—a quantity of wet had run down on to the palliasse and then on to the floor—it was not dry by the morning—it had come from the child's mouth—it made a pool about 6 in. on the surface of the floor—this was between 2 and 3 o'clock the same morning—the child was never subject to fits.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a demonstrator of anatomy, at St. Thomas's Hospital—I made the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination of the deceased—I saw her a week after Good Friday—the cause of death was suffocation—it was a well formed child—there were morbid appearances indicative of suffocation—on the inner space of the lower lip were two white marks, corresponding in shape and size with the two upper front teeth—they might be caused by the child pressing against some hard substance—the mere pressure of the child's head on the bed-clothes would not account for those marks—the nose would protect the child's mouth, a little—I should think the pressure of the lips against the iron band of the—bedstead would cause those marks on the lip—I think they were made during life—I think the pressure against the teeth was continued until shortly before death—I could not say within a minute or two—if the child had got its head down upon the bed-clothes, so as to interfere with its breathing, and afterwards it had sufficient strength to raise itself by getting on its back, in my opinion it would revive if it had strength sufficient to draw its head out, and to turn on to its back—if it had died from suffocation by the head being down, caused by the pillow being found over it, it would have been found in that state—if it had got down between the bed and the wall, its head would have remained there, and it would have been found dead in that position—it is not unusual after death to throw up mucous, especially after the head is turned down—it is impossible to say the quantity—it would come from the air passages of the lungs and throat—a very small quantity would have made a stain enough to cover a shilling.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. THOMAS</hi>. I remember saying before the Coroner that if the child's head had been in such a hollow as has been described, the marks upon the lips might have been made by the force of the child resting upon the lip—the positions were described by the Coroner—the cause of suffocation must be continued a minute or more—I recognize Dr. Taylor as an authority on medical jurisprudence—I have known oases where portions of food remaining in the larynx produced suffocation; even by a pea remaining in the throat; even the close wrapping a child's head in a shawl may produce suffocation—I agree with Dr. Taylor that where a child is presumed to be suffocated, owing to the position where he has fallen, evidence of the position of the body, or the sight of the body, is necessary</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187107100164"></xptr>
               <p>before forming any opinion—I recognize Dr. Christison as an authority of eminence on matters of medical jurisprudence—the marks on the deceased's lips must have been produced during life—I agree with him that the appearances of a body, the death of which has been caused by suffocation, are in many cases identical with appearances causing death in other cases.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> If the pea or food obstructed the passages, I should expect to find them in the throat—the throat and air passages were clear—the fact of the marks on the lips affords very strong presumption that suffocation was caused by pressure—a person may have gone across the child's face and so produced suffocation; that would be accident.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You heard the description in which the child was found; from what you saw at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem,</hi> and the remarks related by the witnesses, do those circumstances exclude or not the notion of an accident? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is a very grave question; I don't like to answer it—if it were shown that the child's head went down this hollow place, I could quite conceive its being suffocated there, and the marks on the lips would be caused by the pressure against the iron bedstead—you will not press me beyond my conscience—I can't say sufficiently that accidental suffocation is excluded—I don't believe the bruises on the lip were caused many hours before death—a piece of the lip was removed and examined microscopically, and the mark was found to be simply due to the blood being excluded, and I take it to be pretty nearly certain that if the pressure had been removed before death, the abnormal appearance of the parts would not have been caused—I examined the body eight days after death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. THOMAS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I want to know whether the appearances presented by a bruise inflicted shortly before death, would not be identical with a bruise inflicted shortly after death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; this was not a bruise, but a mark—I think if the pressure had been applied some time subsequent to death, the same kind of mark would not have taken place—you would have an inden<lb></lb>tation, without any blood being in the vessels—the surrounding vessels were congested—there was no sign of the redness of the gums showing painful teething—if the child had had strength to extricate itself and lay down on its back, it would have recovered.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of 116, Walworth Road—I was sent for to Mr. Beer's house, on Good Friday evening, about 12 o'clock—I found the child on its mother's lap, dead—she was bathing its feet with hot water—it had probably been dead an hour, or an hour and a half; it would be difficult to be precise—I examined it carefully—I opened the lips, and observed the impression of the teeth—I asked her if she could account for it—she said she could not—it was somewhat strange to me—I have heard the evidence to-day—where the bed was, there was not room enough to enable a child's head to get between the bed and the wall—it might have been on the edge of the bed, and been suffocated in that way—the mark of the teeth was unusual, and could not be accounted for on the lips—the frame of the bedstead would be here—it was a flock bed, not very far above the mattress—the bed was not more than an inch, or an inch and a half, in thickness—I supposed the child died from suffocation—I assumed that it might be found dead in bed—I was not told that it was found lying with its head upwards, and no bed clothes on—I saw nothing at the time to indicate its being accidentally done, except the marks on the lips, that aroused my suspicion—those marks were, in my judgment, caused before death, and were the result of external pressure, unquestionably—I saw the</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I requested to see the bed—I went up stairs, and immediately examined it—the mattress projected beyond the bed three or four inches—my attention was not called to any fluid on the floor—I put my hand on the sheet, and found it damp—it was where the child had been sleeping, near the edge of the bed—the damp had come from the child's mouth—it did not give me any impression of urine—if the child's head had been lying between the bed and the wall, its mouth might have caused this moisture—it is possible, if the child's hand had been pressed against its mouth, the mouth lying upon the hand, for the weight of the head upon the lip to cause the marks I have spoken of—the child's stomach was very much overloaded with food—it is possible that the child lying across the bed, with its mouth against the bed, and its head projecting on the mattress, the chances of suffocation would be increased by its having an overloaded stomach—I think it possible, if the lower lip had been sucked in by the child, it might have produced the mark—the weight of the child's head lying on its face would have been sufficient to produce suffocation—I have known, recently, cases of children dying from suffocation, without any apparent cause.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I have known two cases of suffocation lately, without apparent cause—they were found in bed—one instance was a child lying in bed, with one leg cocked over the other—there may have been some food in the passage to stop the breath—there were no external appearances—in that case, the child was well at 8.30, and found dead at 11.30.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of 285, Clapham Rise, and 61, Kennington Park—I was at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—I am of opinion that the cause of death was suffocation—I agree with Dr. Lees that the child could have been suffocated from the head being downwards, and there being pressure on the back of the head so as to keep the lips and nostrils against the clothes, it would have died in that position—I am of opinion that if it had sufficient strength to rescue itself from the obstruction, it would revive—I have heard the evidence of Mr. Beer, and if he is right in the description he gives of finding the child on its back, I should say it would be impossible to be an accidental suffocation—I rely on its having nothing over its mouth—there was nothing in the throat or air vessels to cause an obstruction—the marks on the inside of the lower lips were caused by pressure against the upper teeth—it could hardly be understood that a healthy child, if lying on its face, with no pressure on the back of its head, would continue in that posture, and die like that, without nature making an effort to extricate itself from that posture—to cause these marks inside the lips, the pressure must have been continued up to, and probably beyond, the period of death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It is impossible to tell within one or two hours the time the pressure would have continued on the lip—a bruise or mark made after death is almost identical with one made during life, but this was not a bruise, this was an impression—I saw it eight days after death—a pea, and.</p>

               <p>such slight causes, would produce suffocation, or wrapping in a shawl—I have known cases of people lying on their faces being suffocated, in one case, the child was weakly and delicate, through being wrapped in a shawl—I have known children to die without apparent external cause—a child might be perfectly healthy at the time of death, but be suffering from catarrh, or cold—a child suffering from catarrh, the throat being filled with mucous and having an overloaded stomach, the chances of suffocation would be increased—a child does not secrete mucous profusely after recovering from hooping cough—it is of the first importance to come to a correct judg<lb></lb>ment as to whether the suffocation was accidental or not, that the actual position of the child at the time of death should be considered—the appearances of a body, the death of which has been caused by suffocation, in many cases are not identical with death from other causes—I think the morbid appearances peculiar to death by suffocation are different to other <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> causes—I recognize Dr. Christison as an authority.</p>

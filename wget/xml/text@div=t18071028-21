            , she is a widow. The prisoner at the bar had been in my service about three years; he left my service about June last.</p>
               <p>Q. Previous to his leaving your service, had you missed a great deal of your property. - A. We repeatedly missed property, but never could trace it; and it was frequently made up by him from other goods in the house. When we missed property, I have said to him, there is some of the lot lost; he said, perhaps I have laid it some were, else he would look and make it up; and others were never replaced.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he left you in June, how soon afterwards did you receive any information respecting your property. - A. On the 23rd of September. On the 24th I got a constable, and took him up; I went to a public house near St. Martin's-le-grand, we found him there drinking; he asked us what our business was, the constable told him he came to take him for stealing his master's property; the constable took him to Giltspur-street Compter; and then he went and searched his lodgings, No. 30, Angel-street, St. Martin's-le-grand; I went with him, Mrs. Roberts took us into a room, she said the prisoner lodged there; on searching a box, we found a number of duplicates in a pocket book, some of the duplicates were for boot legs; I found several papers; I did not attend to them, they were kept by the constable till the next day. In consequence of these duplicates, we went to four different pawnbrokers; we found articles that we had been robbed of at three of the pawnbrokers.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Mrs. Thompson is your partner. - A. Yes.</p>

Yes, I asked him if he knew me, he said he knew nobody; he made a bit of resistance; I throwed him on the floor and handcuffed him; I told him for what I took him, he said he knew nothing about it; I took him to Giltspur-street Compter; I afterwards went to Angel-street.</p>
               <p>Q. There you saw Mrs. Roberts. - A. Yes, she shewed me a room. I found in that room a pocket book containing duplicates that belonged to Mr. Curtis; and several other papers in the pocket book. I produce the pocket book and the duplicates. This is the list that tallies with the different duplicates that was found in the pocket book. I have had them in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. You attended before the magistrate. - A. Yes, it was one of the aldermen.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say any thing there. - A. No, he said nothing, but only just turning out of the Compter again, he said that he took them with a view of replacing them again.</p>

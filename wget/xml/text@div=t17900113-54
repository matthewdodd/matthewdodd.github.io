               <p>I am servant to Mr. Chase: on the 16th of December last, my mistress sent me of a message down the yard; and coming in, in a great hurry, I looked in at the kitchen window, and saw the prisoner with the trinkets of a watch hanging from his hand; I did not see the watch; but the prisoner was standing in the kitchen, by the shelf; I saw him try to put it in his bosom, but cannot be certain, the door being between; when I came in, he asked me, did I want any muffins? I said, no, but asked him what he had taken from the shelf; he denied it, and said he had taken nothing; I said I saw him take the watch from the shelf; I told him if he did not give me the watch immediately, I would call my mistress down; she was up stairs at that time; he said he had no such thing, and I might search him: I called down my mistress; and when he saw her, he went to the gate; then my mistress and me followed him, and brought him back to the kitchen; I called my master; he questioned him about the watch; and just before the constable came in he told my master, if he would forgive him, the watch should be returned; the watch was in the blue cloth which covered his muffins; the constable found it there; I saw it found.</p>

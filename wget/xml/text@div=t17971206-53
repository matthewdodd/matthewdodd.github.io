             sworn. - The prisoner lodged at my house, he went out to tide's-work, or any thing he could get, he had lodged with me about a fortnight before he was taken up, he was taken up on Lord-Mayor's-day; he never staid out all the time he was with me after seven o'clock, or half past six, I never heard him get up in the night; this handkerchief the prisoner had round his neck.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179712060064"></xptr>Q. How long before he was taken up did you see it round his neck? - A. I cannot say; the prisoner sat down by my fire-side, after he came from work, the very week he was taken; I said to him, Joe, how dirty that handkerchief is that you have got on, pull it off, it was as black as my hat; and he said, he had never another to put on; I pulled a shawl off my own neck, and lent it him while I washed his handkerchief; I washed it, and he told me he had got my shawl tore, he had not wore it; after I had washed it, when it was found by the constable, he told me he had given Bob Richardson sixpence for it.</p>
               <p>Willis. This is my handkerchief, I know it by the hem on each side; it is partly hemmed on one side, and partly on the other, and there is a tear at one corner; I hemmed it myself.</p>

               <p>Q.(To Battle.) Had the prisoner any gin at your house? - A. I never saw him have any thing of that fort in my life.</p>

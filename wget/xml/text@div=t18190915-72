            . I belong to the Surveyor's office at the Bank. On Saturday, the 28th of August, about half-past ten o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner go in and come out of of Shackell's apartment - he is the keeper of the Lothbury Bank gate - she had a wicker basket. I told Shackell of it, who was under the gateway.</p>

            . I am porter of the Lothbury gate. I saw the prisoner coming out of my apartment, and stopped her. I asked her what she wanted? She asked me if my name was not something, that I do not remember. I ran in, but missed nothing. About half-past three o'clock, when I came to lock up the gate, I missed the keys. These are them - (looking at them.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I should like to see them. - (handed to her.) - Now I shall keep them, for the right of my King, my country, and my own right. Nothing can be done in my case now, but a free pardon from the Prince Regent.</p>

            . I am an officer. I searched the prisoner's lodgings in Hope-alley, London-wall, on Monday, the 30th of August, I saw her son; he called her, and she came down. I said,</p>
               <p>"You have taken some keys from the Bank, on Saturday last." She said it was no such thing. I went up stairs; she said,</p>
               <p>"I have not got them." I said I would search. I saw a large trunk, tried to lift it, and said,</p>
               <p>"These are all keys." She said, what was that to me. I also found a box of keys; she said, that was nothing to me. I asked her for the Bank keys? She said she had not got them in the house, but if I would go down stairs she would see what she could do. I went out, she told me to go to the bottom; I heard some keys rattle, ran into the room, and she locked the box. I said,</p>
               <p>"Where are they?" She made no answer. I found two keys between the bed and the mattress, with a label on them, and</p>
               <p>"Bank of England, August 28, 1819," on it. I took her into custody. I found a large trunk, and two boxes, containing about 4000 keys in all, and all, except about 200, were labelled and dated.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have done all this because I never could get any money from any one. I have carried on this, thinking to be brought forward, and that they would come and take me, but they did not. The constables often came, and turned my keys over, so I labelled them to know them. I took them to secure my Country's and my own rights. I have come here for justice, and will have it before I leave the Court. There has been none here for a long time.</p>
               <p>The prisoner frequently interrupted the Learned Judge in summing up the evidence, and the Jury found her NOT GUILTY.</p>

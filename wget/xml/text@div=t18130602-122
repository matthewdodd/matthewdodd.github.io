On the 6th of March I discharged them on account of having burned whalebone to a considerable amount. In consequence of information; on the 14th of April I went down to the side of the Thames, to where the prisoner Whitford lived, and there I saw both the prisoners. Tibbott, the officer, accompanied me, and there I found forty-eight lancets which I knew to be mine; Gilbert was using them.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your discovering this property of yours did you say any thing to the prisoners - A. I stated<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181306020065"></xptr>it to the officer, and they began criminating each other; one saying to the other, you took as many as me, and the other saying, you took as many as me. The officer has the property. They were then taken into custody.</p>

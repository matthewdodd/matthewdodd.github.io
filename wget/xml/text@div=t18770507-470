                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman</hi> 285 <hi rend="italic">M</hi>). On 10th February I was called by Mrs. Eaymond—I went into the kitchen and was told in the prisoner's presence that Gardner was there for an unlawful purpose—the prisoner said that Gardner was a thief and a vagabond—he wanted to have him removed—I asked him what for—for he said that he was a trespasser—I asked him what claim he was there for but he did not say—I said that I would not inter<lb></lb>fere, and went outside and remained there half an hour—I saw a cart there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I saw Gardner come out with an injured leg, and saw him into a cab—he told me that his leg was broken—Boulger did not say a word to me about Gardner having assaulted him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. I stayed to see that no breach of the peace was committed, I did that of my own accord—I heard no disturbance or breaking of a door while I was there, and I must have heard it if it had taken place—I don't think the little boy remained outside all the time—nobody was in the area, but Holmes, the father—I did not see him kick the door.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been in medical attendance on the prisoner since 24th April, and I know that prior to that, my dispensary prescription for copious bleeding was sent to him—he was very much injured across the lungs, and also sustained an injury of the spine, which probably arose from violence—it appeared to be recent when I saw him, within a few weeks—it might have extended as far back as 10th February.</p>

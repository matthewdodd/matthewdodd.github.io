Eveson, the officer, gave me some information, and I saw some lead at Guildhall - I saw the two men in custody - I said to Graly,"How came you to take that lead; what did you do there, it was out of your way?" - he said, "I knew the woman that kept the house, and I went to rest there, as it was a heavy load" - I know Fleet-lane - it is out of the way in going from our premises to London-bridge - I cannot swear to the lead.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What quantity of lead was there wanting for the job they had to do? A. I cannot tell - I could, if I had measured the space they had to cover - I am sure it did not require all this lead - I can tell by<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183402200088"></xptr>looking at the place - I cannot tell how much it would require.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Nunnery is the foreman plumber? A. Yes, it is his business to superintend the lead work on the premises I was working on, at the London-bridge end of Cannon-street - this was the completion of a lead flat - I had been there, but I cannot tell how lately before this happened - it was left to Nunnery to judge what lead was wanted - I cannot say whether this was cut from larger sheets on my premises, but they were seen to take them from my premises - I saw the place that remained to be covered since this happened - I cannot tell when I had seen it before - the lead the prisoner had is about 11/2 cwt., not more, I dare say - my premises are more than a mile from the place they were at work at - what they appeared to me to want was not so much as this - they should have carried the lead jointly - Nunnery has been in my service nine or ten years.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. You had not been at the building at any time which you can recollect before, but when the prisoners were apprehended you went? A. Yes - I can judge by looking at a flat what is wanted to cover it - I judge this lead is more than was wanted there - neither of these men had any authority to carry it to Fleet-lane.</p>

            . I am a patrol of St. Sepulchre's - on the 4th of January I was on duty in Fleet-lane, about seven o'clock in the morning - I was about thirty yards from the prisoner Bellamy's house - but I had before that seen the two male prisoners in the Old Bailey - Graly was carrying a roll of lead, and Nunnery was by his side - they separated, and Nunnery went down Fleet-lane, and Graly went down New-court, and came into Fleet-lane - he there passed Nunnery, and went into Bellamy's, which is one door from New-court - I went to the door, and sent to the watch-house for assistance, and Carlon came to me - Nunnery had been standing at the end of New-court, but he was then gone - I then went into Bellamy's house, and saw Graly sitting on a chair by the side of the fire-place; and Bellamy and another female were in the shop - it is a dealer's in marine stores - there is a counter, and Graly was on the right hand side of it - and the two females were on the other side - this roll of lead was on the ground, by the side of Graly - Bellamy said, "What is the matter?" I said I suspected that lead was not right - she turned to Graly and said, "How can you come here, when I have so often told you not?" Carlon then came in, and I told Graly to go with him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. Did Carlon take Bellamy? A. No, another officer took her afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. How near were you to Graly when he went into the house? - A. About thirty yards - it was at seven o'clock in the morning - it was not light - I had never seen Nunnery before - I saw their backs and their faces, for they passed me - it was not pitch dark - it was day-break - Nunnery was within one door of Bellamy's shop when Graly went in - I did not take him, because he was not carrying anything - I afterwards took Nunnery in West-street, Somers-town - I believe it was his own house - I saw a young woman there - he was at breakfast - I said, "I want you;" and I gave him to a police-officer - I said nothing more to him there, I am sure - there was no woman taking breakfast with him when I went in; but Carlon went in first - I did not ask him if his name was Nunnery; nor did Carlon, to my recollection.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you know he was the man? A. By seeing him, and Mr. Webb saying he was the man - I believe I did say, "I believe you are the man I want;" but it was not in the room: it was in the street - I might have said it in the room; but I do not recollect - I do not recollect that I said, "You must come along with me" - Carlon said that - I do not recollect his saying he was very willing - I did not hear him say he would go anywhere - I recollect he asked what was the matter - he came willingly with us - he did not say he was taken ill on his way from his master's to the building, and was obliged to go home; but the men at the building said so.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you go to his house in consequence of what the men at the building said? Q. Yes; they told us we should find him there.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. At what time did you find him? A. At half-past ten o'clock - I had previously been to the buildings for him.</p>

            . I am a patrol of St. Sepulchre's - I was sent for, and went to Fleet-lane - Eveson was at the door of No. 21 - he told me to go to the corner of Newcourt - I went there, and came back to him in the house - I asked what it was - he said he thought this lead was not right - I took Graly to the watch-house, and then went back to Bellamy's - she was dressed a little more than to cover decency - I asked her how she was to come by this lead - she said at the rate of 10s. a cwt. - I then got an officer, who took her; and I took the lead to the watch-house - this is the lead.</p>
               <p>Graly. Mr. Webb did not ask me any question in Guildhall.</p>
               <p>MR. WEBB. Yes, I spoke to you - there were several persons there - you were Nunnery's labourer, and went by his orders.</p>
               <p>Graly's Defence. I was employed by Nunnery - he told me he wanted a quantity of lead to go to London-bridge - I found him at the shop cutting the lead - I carried it to Smithfield-bars, and then told him I was getting tired - he said I had further to go - he then said he wanted to call by the Old Bailey, and told me to go to No. 21, Fleet-lane, and he would come to me presently - I went to the house, set down my lead, and the officer came in and took me - I told him who I worked for, and to go to my master; Nunnery was at the top of the lane, and saw me taken - whether he had any object in view I do not know.</p>

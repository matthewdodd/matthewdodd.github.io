She frightened me very much when she said so; she told me she had conveyed the bundle into my coal-hole, containing the woman's property at the corner; I said, Lord have mercy upon me, Walker, how could you be so cruel; she said, don't frighten yourself, for I will take it away; I saw her go towards the coal-hole, but I fainted away, and when I came to myself, she was gone; she was taken up the same forenoon.</p>

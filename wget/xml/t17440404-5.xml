            . On the 20th of March, the Prisoner robbed me of three pound seven shillings and six-pence - she took it out of my breeches pocket in Drury-lane.</p>

            , between one and two in the morning. I felt her hand in my pocket, and immediately I missed the money, and she run away; I run after her, but she got away, and I could not see any thing of her - it was in a little passage.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it was the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Minton. Very well - because she was along with me and the other woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you going?</p>
               <p>Minton. I was going to the other woman's lodging, we had been all three drinking at a cellar over against Somerset-house, in the Strand.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the other woman did not take it?</p>
               <p>Minton. I am sure I had my money in my pocket when the Prisoner put her hand into it - it was in a black purse.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you * by so much money? </p>
               <p> * The Prosecutor was a private soldier. </p>
               <p>Minton. I received it of Mr. Dobson, at the Custom-house, on account of tea that was seized in a barn at Camberwell belonging to smugglers.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of your other companion?</p>
               <p>Minton. I don't know where she is now.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this an acquaintance you met in the street?</p>
               <p>Minton. I knew her before, but had not much acquaintance with her - she was not taken till two or three days after.</p>

            . I am a Constable of Covent Garden; between eleven and twelve on Easter Eve (March 24.) this man, Minton, brought the Prisoner into the watchhouse, and in the night I was talking familiarly with her; and I asked her why she robbed such a poor man. She said, D - n it, those that have nothing we can have nothing from, and we must have it from those that have, for we have no respect of persons. She said she had the money, and she swore, she would hang farther and mother, before she would hang herself. Then said I, you should turn evidence. Yes, she said, to be sure I would.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say what money she had?</p>
               <p>Wolsenden. She said she had a three-pound-twelve, a thirty-six shilling piece, and a moidore; I can't tell what silver she said she had, she said she had shared the money between herself and two accomplices. I asked her if she had any of the money left. She said she was obliged to pawn her cloak for two shillings. What, said I, is all the money gone? She said, as to one of her accomplices, she was clothed with that money; she had bought her a gown and petticoat, a shift, a pair of stockings, a cap, and the rest of the money was spent.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say in what Manner she took it from Minton?</p>
               <p>Wolfenden. I cannot say in particular in what manner; she said, D - n it what signifies talking, the truth is the truth, the money I had from him.</p>
               <p>Jury. What condition was she in when she told you this story?</p>
               <p>Wolsenden. Just as she is now.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never saw the man in my life before that night, and he took me into a house to give me a half pennyworth of small beer, I can bring one to prove he never missed the money till seven o'clock next morning.</p>
               <p>Wolfenden. The Prisoner said she dogged the man from that cellar in the Strand, into broad St. Giles's. <rs id="t17440404-5-verdict32" type="verdictDescription">

                  </hi>. I am a bookseller, and live at No. 189, Whitechapel-road. On Monday evening last, between five and six o'clock, I was in my back parlour at tea—the shop door was closed to—it was dark—I should not suppose I could distinguish a man's countenance if there had been no light from the gas—I heard a knocking or rumbling noise at the door—I thought there were some men fighting, and I should have my window broken—I ran out and opened the door—the policeman gave me information, and brought the two prisoners into the shop—he had assistance—he produced two books, which I recognised to belong to me—I looked at the place where they were kept, and found they were gone—I had seen them that day—they were near the window—it is a sash win<lb></lb>dow, which slides up and down—I know the window was closed down at four o'clock, when it got dusk—I had seen that it was closed down entirely—it is rather a heavy sash, and would break if it was not putdown carefully—it does not go on lines; I have pins to hold it up—the books were inside the window—any body outside could see them—when I went into the shop, I found the window still down.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was on duty last Monday in Whitechapel-road, between five and six o'clock—I saw the prisoners—I did not know them before—it was dark—I could not distinguish the features of a person by the natural light—I watched them—they attempted to turn up Cannon-place, then turned into the road again, and</p>

                  </hi>. I have been a medical student, but am now living with my father. On Monday evening last, about a quarter to six o'clock, I was in the Whitechapel-road, in company with Mullins—I saw the two prisoners standing on the footway, talking—it attracted the attention of the officer—on seeing us, they walked on and turned down a kind of court, on the right—they came out of the court immediately, and walked on to Mr. Noble's shop window—Mullins walked before me, and at this time the two prisoners were at the shop window—I could perceive they had their hands on the glass, on the window, but I cannot positively swear what they were doing at the time—Mullins went up, and on his catch<lb></lb>ing them, I saw Wren throw away two books—Mullins could not hold both, and Jackson ran away—I ran after him immediately, and caught him—he ran about 150 yards—I brought him back to Mullins, who was standing at Noble's door, which was then open.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Bexleyheath. I was in the Coach and Horses public-house, at Woolwich, on the morning of the 19th of Febru<lb></lb>ary, between eight and nine o'clock—I was in the tap-room, and saw the prisoner with a comrade—the prisoner asked me if I would stand a pot of beer, and I did—he asked me if I would stand another—I told him I could not afford it, as I had paid for one pot—he then asked me, as I would not stand a pot, if I would be a pint—I said I would—I had this bag (<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>) with me, and a small one contained in the large one—I took the smaller one out of the large one, intending to pay the twopence, and he caught it out of my hand—he made no more to do, but got out the back way as quick as possible, and he ran away with it—I followed him—he ran as hard as he could—I made an alarm, and cried after him—he opened this bag, took the small one out, and flung the large one down at a poor woman's door—he kept the small one—it contained 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—there were three half-crowns, and the rest in sixpences and shillings—I gave in<lb></lb>formation to Chittenden, the constable—I picked up the large bag before I told Chittenden.</p>

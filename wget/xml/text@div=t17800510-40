I turned round and saw a man coming after us, and two men lying in the grass opposite us almost ready to step down upon us. I ran away as fast as I could, in order to escape them; the two that were in the grass got up and pursued me; when I got to the turnstile in the field, one was close to me; I got through the turnstile before him, and ran half the length of the field, but finding I could not get away I stopped; he immediately clapped a pistol to my head and said I must give him my money. I told him I was but a working man and had a family of children; the other was at some distance. I had a stick in my hand; I thought to get an opportunity to knock him down; but the other came up and put a pistol to my pole behind my head; while I stood in that situation I gave them sometimes good words and sometimes bad; they insisted upon having my money. I put my hand under my apron to pull part of it out, and intended to conceal my watch chain, but the little one, the prisoner Brown, laid hold of the watch-chain and snatched it by force.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the prisoner Brown is the man who took your watch? - Yes; I have never had him out of my eye since, look which way I will I have him in my eye; they were with me about ten minutes; I could distinguish their faces very well; it was a starlight night; the other prisoner had his pistol to my head when I pulled the money out of my pocket; Lessingham received it out of my hand.</p>
               <p>Are you sure it was Lessingham? - I am positive of it; then Brown felt in my pocket; he said you have not delivered all your money, if you do not deliver it all this minute I will blow your brains out. I took all the money out of my pocket, but concealed it in my hand, and threw it upon the grass. The next morning I found three and sixpence, which was all the money I ever recovered; whether I had given them all except that three and sixpence the first time I cannot say; then they told me to go about my business and we parted; and I never saw them afterwards till I saw them at Sir

            , in company with us; they are all soldiers of the first regiment. The prisoner is in the Coldstream regiment; he was not on duty; he came there by chance; the battalion he belongs to was on guard the next day; I remember the day because the battalion I belong to mounted guard that day, and then we are more particular. We are on guard every 5th day.</p>

But being asked, he could not recollect who was in his company any other evening, or where he was, but that he might some evenings be playing at skittles at the Black Boy. He said where I can get most beer is the best place for me. That Davis, Bartlet, the prisoner, and himself were all that were in company that evening.)</p>

               <p>I have known Lessingham about two years. He was a tambour-worker. I am a flute-maker, in Turnmill-street, Clerkenwell. He used to come backwards and forwards to a man that works for me. I never heard any but an honest character of him. On Saturday the 22d of April he came to my house, about half after seven in the evening, he staid their till the watch went ten; he was never out of the place. The man he used to come to was in a decline, and subject to fits. I was busy and sent for him to come and stay with me.</p>
               <p>Who was with you on the 23d of April? - I cannot tell any body except this man, who was sick.</p>
               <p>On the 24th or any other day in April can you tell who was with you? - No.</p>

The clock struck eight as I came over Blackfriars-bridge from Walworth. When I came home, he was at home.</p>
               <p>I suppose he continued at home till after ten? - I cannot tell; I came down about a quarter after ten; he gave me part of a pot of beer. He had a handkerchief about his head; he wished me a good night and went to bed.</p>

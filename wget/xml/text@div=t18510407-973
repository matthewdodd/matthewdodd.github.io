                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my brother Ben<lb></lb>jamin. I was erecting some houses in Bath-court, Great Warner-street last month—the water is supplied by a leaden-pipe from the main, through my property—there was about fourteen feet under ground, and then it came into a water butt—it was soldered to the main—on 1st April I missed about fourteen feet of it—I saw <hi rend="italic">my</hi> foreman compare some pipe with what was left, and it corresponded; it is worth about 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

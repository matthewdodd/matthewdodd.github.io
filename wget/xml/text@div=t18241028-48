            . I am a chairman; I have a sedan chair and two poles: I missed the poles on Thursday, the 16th of September, about eleven o'clock; I had seen them about four days before. They have a mark on them, by which I know them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Do you know a person of the name of Munro - A. Yes; the prisoner had been a partner with him, and was forced to give up in consequence of a sprained leg. My poles were at the Albany; there was another old chair by the side of mine, which had not been used for some time. I do not know that it belonged to Munro; it had been standing there ever since I knew the place. I have been working with Munro within the last twelve months.</p>

            . I live at New Brompton; my chair stands at the Duggin Arms, public-house. I bought these poles of the prisoner, for 7 s., one Thursday, about six weeks ago; he said they were his own, but did not say who he bought them of.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know the prisoner as working a sedan chair for some years - A. Yes. I saw him first on this business one Monday; he asked me to buy a pair of poles - I said I had no money. He came a few days afterwards, and left them at my house, and then he came to me at the Duggin Arms: we walked together to my house, and I said to him,</p>
               <p>"These poles are marked, are they your own;" he said,</p>
               <p>"Yes, they are" - they were cracked, and I gave him 7 s. for them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Munro and I are still partners in some poles; I did not know the difference between these and my own; we have two pairs of poles, which stand just behind the prosecutor's. My partner changed a pair of poles of ours with one King, and I did not know but these were them.</p>

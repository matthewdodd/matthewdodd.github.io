                  </hi>. I am an ivory-turner, living in York-place, Hoxton Old Town. The prisoner was in my employ—he was recommended to me as town-traveler—I gave him some inkstands, cushions, wafer-seals, and cigar-tubes—part of them he was to sell, and part were for patterns, which he was not to part with, but to collect orders for—he was to bring me the money he sold them for—he took them away on the 24th of July last year—he never returned to me, or brought them back—I saw some of them a fortnight ago, at Worship-street—the prisoner was brought to me—I had not seen him in the mean time—I said he was a pretty fellow to serve me so, knowing I was a poor man—he said he could not help it, he must let it go as it would.</p>

                  </hi>. J deal in stationery, and live in Leonard-street, Shore ditch. In July last, the prisoner came two or three times in the course of the week, to know if I could purchase any books—I said I was not able to buy, I wanted to sell some, to pay my rent—he said he thought he could dispose of them for me—he brought me these things, and left them as a deposit, while he took my books—he took my books, and returned next day, and told me he had only received part of the money for the books, but he supposed I wanted it all—he made me no offer—I never saw him again till he was in custody—I delivered these things to the constable.</p>

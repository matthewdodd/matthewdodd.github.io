               <p>Prisoner. Q. Are you not in the habit of looking your coral over almost every day? A. Just as my customers may require it; I know this piece by a hole, about half an inch from the top of it, where a branch has been broken off; there are frequently holes, but not like this; I know it from its being an odd drop - I had tried to match it, and could not; it is the largest piece that was left in the box; it weighs about 4 dwts. 16 grains.</p>

            . I am a working-jeweller, and live in Northampton-street. I bought this coral-drop of the prisoner for 3s. 6d.; I asked him if he worked for Mr. Garritt; he said No - (he had before brought me a pair of drops;) I sent to Mr. Garritt to know if he worked for him, and he said he did; he then brought me another pair of drops, and I sent to ask Mr. Garritt if he had sold him any drops - he said he had sold him three pairs; I bought three pairs, and this odd one of the prisoner; on the Monday Mr. Garritt called, and I told him I had bought this drop of the prisoner - he said it was his, and one he had been looking for.</p>

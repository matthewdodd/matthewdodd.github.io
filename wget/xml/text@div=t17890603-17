               <p>The indictment opened by Mr. Leach: and the case by Mr. Knowlys, as follows,</p>
               <p>May it please your Lordship. - Gentlemen of the Jury: you have heard the indictment opened by my learned friend, which contains the charge of murder, and when I am addressing myself to a Jury, who have discharged their duty so well this sessions, I need say nothing to you to call your attention to so important a charge; you well know what is due to publick justice upon a satisfactory conviction of such a crime; you likewise well know how immense a stake a prisoner has who stands under such accusation: gentlemen, I will state the case to you, as shortly as I can. It happened on the 6th of May, a famous battle was expected to take place at Stilton, between two men, of the name of Humphries and Mendoza, it was a matter of much public conversation, and on the day preceding, the Lincoln coach was passing through Enfield to this place; on the outside was the prisoner at the bar, when the coach stopped, the prisoner cried out what odds? not addressing himself to any person particular; the deceased happened to stand near the coach; he immediately said I will take thirty-five shillings to a guinea; meaning on the event of this battle, upon which the prisoner looked at him, and said to him, what are you a fighter? the deceased immediately said yes, I think I am able to fight you; upon this, Ward came from the box, and there was an offer at that time to fight for a guinea; it seems that the deceased was after this informed, that the man who offered to fight him, was a man known as a fighter, and more experienced than himself; upon this occasion the deceased rather failed in point of courage; then the prisoner finding him reluctant, offered to change that bet for a half crown bowl of punch; the deceased declined the fight; the prisoner went up and used several aggravating words, and put his fist in his face; a person of the name of Badder endeavoured to prevent it, but the deceased turned round to a man of the name of Peacock, and said this is too much; they had two rounds; they fell twice; on the second fall the deceased was accused of pulling the hair of the prisoner; when they got up, the deceased said I will fight no more; he left the prisoner, and moved round a cart, saying he had enough and would fight no more; the prisoner went round on the other side, met him; and I understand some attempts were made to prevent his striking him, but he almost at the same instant hit the deceased, who was not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178906030023"></xptr>then in the attitude of fighting, with his left hand in the stomach, and with his right almost in the same instant a blow on the temple; upon that the deceased fell, and in almost an instant appeared dead, and never shewed the least signs of life afterwards. Gentlemen, these are the circumstances attending this business; the deceased declined to fight, he was provoked to it, and at one time had given up the battle. If it appears to you that at the time the deceased declined to fight any more, and had left the prisoner; the prisoner had sufficient time to cool from the heat of the engagement, and went round the cart purposely to meet him, that he went to give him some very violent injury, even though he did not mean death, that he went deliberately to do an injury; even though he might think it short of death; then, under my Lord's direction, I shall hold it was murder; but if you think he did not go round purposely and deliberately, but that having once set his fighting talents at defiance, the prisoner acted under the impression of the rage which that occasioned, then I think you cannot carry it any further than manslaughter. Gentlemen, I shall call all the witnesses; you will hear the whole of the case fairly and impartially, and I am sure the decision that you will give under the direction of the Court, will satisfy all the world.</p>

               <p>Examined by Mr. Leach.</p>
               <p>Where did you happen to be on the evening of the 5th of May last? - I was at Enfield highway when the Lincon coach stopped.</p>
               <p>Do you remember seeing the prisoner at the bar there? - I remember seeing a man of the name of Ward there; that may be the man, but I am not sure: the passengers asked what was the odds on the battle depending at Stilton to morrow; with that Mr. Swain said he would take thirty-five shillings to a guinea, but of which party I am not sure; and I believe one of the passengers, I cannot tell which, asked him if he could fight; he said he would fight him for a guinea; upon that, the gentleman came from the coach, and went to him, and I put my stick to him, and said Swain shall not fight; then Swain asked the other if he would take the law of him, and he said he would not; then some person asked me what I had to do with it; then Mr. 
               <persName id="t17890603-17-person189">
                  Ward

             I believe hit Swain on the head, whether he fell to the ground I am not sure; people came in between him and me, and they set to it to fight, and they had a round together, and fell side by side as nearly as possible, and in the rising, some man, but who it was I cannot say, went to the assistance of Swain, and he got up with his hand in Ward's hair, and when he was got up, he said he would fight no more, and Ward held his hair towards the passengers in the coach, and said it was not fair; with that one of the passengers said Swain ought to have his liver cut out, or something of that nature, for fighting unfair; Swain went round the cart and stood there, and Mr. Ward met him, and he drew back and said he would not fight any more; Mr. Ward then hit him twice, and he fell and never got up any more.</p>

               <p>Mr. Leach. Was Swain in a fighting posture when Ward gave the two last blows? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>You did not see that he was? - No.</p>
               <p>Did Swain after he received these blows and had fallen in consequence of them, shew any signs of life? - No, I never saw him stir afterwards.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. Blows were given on both sides? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Then they fell down both together? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then Swain the deceased, with one hand had hold of Ward by the hair? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And with the other hand he was pegging him? - I did not see him strike, he had hold of him, but I did not see him strike.</p>
               <p>Ward was pretty much beat? - I do not know, I did not take any notice of him;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178906030024"></xptr>I did not see him; but as he came to the coach with a handkerchief up; my attention was about Swain.</p>
               <p>These men did not know each other? - No Sir, not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>They offered to try their manhood for love, I believe at one time? - I believe they did, I never saw the prisoner before; nor Swain never saw him before; Swain was an intimate acquaintance of mine.</p>
               <p>Swain was a pretty goodish man in your part of the country? - I never saw him strike any person in my life; I looked upon him to be a strong lusty hale man.</p>
               <p>Did not you hear him, when this coach came up, talking very largely how he had challenged a man of the name of Johnson? - Yes Sir, I have often heard him say that; he was often romancing that way, but I never knew him to fight anybody in that way.</p>
               <p>Did you see him pull off his apron, and swear he would whip Ward; did you hear him say he would smack his backside? - He might say so, but I did not pay any attention to it.</p>
               <p>He was a blacksmith? - He was so; I remember something of his pulling off his apron.</p>
               <p>He was a stouter man than Ward? - Much so.</p>

             the prisoner sat on the right hand side on the roof, the blacksmith stood by; they were talking about Mendoza, and mentioned immediately a guinea; the blacksmith mentioned about a guinea, and he offered to fight that man for a guinea, with that Ward got off of the roof and went to him; the coachman got hold of the blacksmith's coat and he gave him a pull, and he said for God's sake do not fight that man, for that is

             the prize fighter; upon that, Swaine changed very white, and he said he would not fight; with that Ward said thus? says he, what will you not fight, you country hawbuck, and with that he tapped him, and said, I could have you here, and I could have you there, and slapped him over the face; with that he says no I shall not fight you now; but another time I will fight you for twenty pound; but now I will not; with that he said, what you will not fight me now? no, says he I will not; with that he kept tapping him; I could have you here, I could have you there; the blacksmith said I cannot put up with this any longer, and with that the blacksmith told him that he would knock him down if he could; with that they had a little bit of a hold, then they had a bit of a skirmish, and the little cart stood, and the blacksmith got hold of Ward's head of hair, he pulled some hair off his head; they were down both together, and the young man that is along with me now, he parted them, like one parted on one side the cart, and one on the other; different parties parted them and lifted them up; when they came up, the blacksmith walked up to the Black Horse bar window, and going in this man says will not you stand another round? they went one on the one side of the cart, and one on the other; the horse and cart stood facing the door way; with that, when they were going up there, he said, you blackguard I never had my hair pulled before in my life, will not you stand another round?</p>
               <p>Did Swain make any answer to what was said by Ward? - He said he would fight no more; and as he was going up he hit him over the shoulder, and Swaine the blacksmith made to go into the house, and Ward hit him with his right hand in the belly, and with his left hand on the side of the head, and down the poor man dropped.</p>
               <p>At the time he received these two blows, one of which you say was on the head and the other in the belly, was Swaine in a fighting posture? - No, he was not.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow, another of Prisoner's Counsel. This was the Lincoln coach, and he went into the coach he came in? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You thought the doctor had the worst of it, and had better not fight any more? - Really I did so.</p>
               <p>Did you know the doctor much? - Yes.</p>

               <p>What did he say that he would do with his apron? - That I cannot say.</p>
               <p>You did not hear him say that he would slap his backside with it; did you? recollect yourself now, and remember you are sworn to tell the whole truth? - I would tell the truth; I cannot recollect he did.</p>
               <p>They had two pretty good rounds? - No, Sir, not pretty good rounds.</p>
               <p>You are not fond of fighting; you do not like it? - I have seen a little of it.</p>
               <p>Except the hair it was all fair? - No, asking your pardon, it was not two fair rounds.</p>
               <p>I confess I am not much of a fighter, and if any shame belongs to that confession, I must take it; all the rest was fair except his getting his hands into his hair; that is not fair? - No, I do not think it is.</p>
               <p>It is still less fair to tear off a man's hair? - No, it is not; to be sure he did pull some of his hair off.</p>

               <p>I drove the Lincoln coach, I was at the Black Horse, Enfield Highway, I stopped my horses to water, which I always do; the blacksmith was standing at the door, or near the door, and Ward was at the top of the coach; somebody in the coach, or on the coach, offered to lay a bet of twenty pounds to ten pounds on the fight at Stilton; the blacksmith made answer immediately, and said, he would lay a guinea to thirty-five shillings; Ward says to him, what do you know about fighting? if you do, you have not a guinea to lay; I then took the blacksmith by the coat, and said to him, my friend do not you meddle with people you have nothing to do with, for it is

               <p>I was present when this matter took place; when we stopped at the Black Horse to water the horses, Ward sat at the back part of the roof of the coach with me; this blacksmith was standing down against the window, and he offered to lay a guinea to thirty-five shillings on the fight at Stilton, that was Swaine, I never saw him before; Ward upon the coach asked him what he knew about laying at fighting, and told him he had not a guinea to lay; and Swaine said he would fight Ward for a guinea, and make it up the twenty; Ward got off the coach, and they had some words between them after he got down, and Swaine pulled off his apron, and threatened to whip him with it; in a little time they fell to fighting, the blacksmith catched Ward by the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178906030026"></xptr>hair, and bent him back a great way, and they both fell down together; and after they got up again they set to fighting again, and I did not see any more; I did not see the blow struck, when the accident happened.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Then you say, that from the time of Ward's getting down from the coach, and the time of their beginning to fight, there were some words past? - Yes, there was, but I do not know exactly what it was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. He had offered to fight Ward for a guinea before Ward got down? - He had a guinea in his fingers; Ward was very much beat, he had a cut across his temples, he had a deal the worst of the beating; the blacksmith was stouter a great deal than Ward.</p>

               <p>I was in the Lincoln coach on the 5th of May, going to Stilton, I saw the fight there; they stopped at the Black-horse Enfield Highway, the coachman stopped to water the horses, and this man Swaine stood at the door drinking along with some more, and he said I will lay a guinea to thirty-five shillings on the fight, which was to be the next day, and some gentlemen said they would lay two to one on the fight; and Ward asked him, what do you know about fighting? Swaine said, d - n me, I will fight you for a guinea or twenty; he took the guinea out in his hand, and held it in his hand, and threw it on the ground; Ward got down off the coach, and Swaine took his apron off, and said he would whip his a - e with it; a few words passed between them, and they went to fighting; Swaine had him held by his hair, and he hit him while he had hold of his hair, and the gentlemen that were there, cried out foul! foul! and they both fell down together; Swaine got up, and Ward got up, and Swaine stooped a little bit back, and they got fighting again, and fought till the very last moment; they stood up hitting at one another till the last moment the accident happened.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Tell us as strictly as you can, what you saw pass on this occasion? - I was at the Black Horse at Enfield Highway when it happened; the Lincoln coach came up to the door, and Swaine was standing drinking a pint of beer, and some of the people upon the roof of the coach called out, what is the best odds for tomorrow? I do not know who it was that said so; and Swaine said he would take thirty-five shillings against a guinea; with that there were some words between the parties, and Ward got down from the coach; there were a good many words passed between them both, but I do not know what it was, Ward came up and held his fist in his face, and asked him if he was a fighting man, or would he fight; and Swaine said no, he did not want to fight, but he did not think Ward was much of a fighter; Ward said he would fight him for a guinea, or a bowl of punch, if he chose it.</p>
               <p>Court. Did Ward say that to Swaine, or Swaine to Ward? - Ward said so to Swaine; there were many words passed after that, and then Ward struck him, and Swaine had his apron in his hand, and a guinea,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178906030027"></xptr>and he flung his apron down, and gave the guinea to me; I was standing close by, I did not hear him say any thing at all about his apron, any more than flinging it down; then they went to fighting; after some blows they got hold of one another some way, and both fell down to the ground; when they got up again, Swaine said he would fight no more; there stood a cart in the road, and Swaine went round the cart one way, and Mr. Ward came round the cart the other.</p>
               <p>Court. Did any thing happen about Ward's hair? - I cannot say that he hung in his hair, I heard people say so, but I did not see him; Ward met him at the head of the horses again, and struck him again; I saw him strike one blow on the head, and he fell to the ground; Swaine was standing by the cart, going with his hands in this form (folded).</p>
               <p>Was he at all in an attitude of defence? - No, he was not, he never stirred hand nor foot after.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. They went round the cart, and as soon as they met he struck him a blow? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did not you hear the people call foul, foul? - I heard some of the people call foul, but I do not know what they meant by it.</p>
               <p>Was not it explained at the time to mean that Swaine had fastened in his hair? - I do not know, I heard people say it was foul play; hit him again, I heard several people say that.</p>
               <p>Upon which the smith went round one way, and Ward went the other, and instantly he struck him, and down he fell? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You saw him take off his apron? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath did not you hear him say that he would whip this man with it? - I did not; I was within three yards of him.</p>
               <p>Other people might not hear that which you heard? - No, they might not.</p>
               <p>You will not swear that he did not say, when he took off the apron, I will slap your backside with this? - No, I will not swear it, he was no particular friend of mine.</p>
               <p>A good strong man, was not he? - A strongish man, I do not know the strength of the man, I never tried his strength.</p>
               <p>Was not he a very strong labouring blacksmith? - He was a stout built man.</p>
               <p>Was not he a remarkable stout man? - No, I do not think he was, he was a stouter man than the prisoner, and taller.</p>

               <p>I am a surgeon, I saw the deceased, I believe it was the 5th of May, he was dead; I examined the body, I was informed what happened, but not particularly.</p>
               <p>In your judgment was the death owing to blows? - That is beyond a doubt, that his death arose from the blows he received.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. You opened the body, I take it of course? - I did not, I was once reprimanded by Mr. Philips the late coroner, for opening a body before he had seen him.</p>
               <p>What external appearance would there be on a body, to convince you from the inspection<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178906030028"></xptr>of the body, that there was any blow to occasion his death? - A blow he received on the temple.</p>
               <p>That is not always the occasion of death? - Not always, it very frequently is.</p>
               <p>A person falling down may occasion a concussion of the brain? - It certainly may.</p>
               <p>But you never opened the head to see? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Then there was no concussion of the brain, no fracture of the scull? - No.</p>
               <p>Suppose a man had been fighting, got a black eye; would you tell from that what was the cause of his death? - No further than from the bruises.</p>
               <p>But bruises are not mortal in general; some subjects turn black much sooner than others? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Men who live hard, do not turn black so soon as you or I would? - No.</p>
               <p>You was not examined before the coroner? - No, I was not.</p>
               <p>Mr. SHERWIN sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a surgeon, I saw the body the day after the accident.</p>
               <p>Did you examine it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What do you think was the occasion of the death? - I do not know, I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Were there any external marks of injury? - There was a bruise on the left cheek bone, the only external mark of injury; I saw none else.</p>
               <p>Did you examine the body throughout? - I examined it externally as well as I could, I did not open it, I did not think it of consequence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did you observe any thing externally, that could distinguish it from a death by apoplexy? - Certainly not.</p>
               <p>You have been long in the business? - Yes, more than twenty years.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. My Lord, we make no defence.</p>
               <p>The learned Judge summed up the evidence to the Jury, and then added:</p>
               <p>Gentlemen; this is the evidence against the prisoner; the crime charged is murder; as to that, there does not appear from the evidence, to have been any circumstances from which you will be at liberty to infer that he has been guilty of that crime; for in order to constitute the crime of murder, it must be done with malice aforethought, either expressed or implied; express malice is, where there has been any previous enmity between the parties, where there has been threats made use of, tending to shew a malicious intention in the mind, and some bad feeling of resentment which induced him to take vengeance for a supposed injury; malice implied, or constructive malice, is where the party is either in the prosecution of a felonious illegal act, and murder ensues; the law in that case, will impute malice though perhaps he had no actual antecedent malice against the party; so again, constructive malice may be where a person is acting in defiance of the law, or in opposition to the law, there the law will infer malice; but there is no pretence of any thing of the kind in the present case; neither is there any evidence from whence you can infer actual malice; for they were utter strangers, and this happened in course of words that fell between them, upon which they fell to fighting; therefore the utmost that this crime can amount to in point of law, is the crime of manslaughter; but there is another consideration which you must take into your minds, whether the death of the party happened from the blow that was given; or whether from any extraordinary exertion he might have died of an apoplexy or in a fit, or by breaking a blood vessel; so that if it is not imputable to any blow given from Ward, then you will find him not guilty; but if you think that death was owing to the blow he received, then you are to consider whether or no you will, or will not, find the prisoner guilty of manslaughter: as to that, where people happen to have words, and any sudden quarrel ensues, and death takes place from the blows; yet it can amount no higher than manslaughter, if they fight on equal terms and with equal weapons; and that was the case here; you find from some of the witnesses that the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178906030029"></xptr>deceased was the aggressor, and first all challenged the prisoner to fight for a guinea; but whether one way or whether the other way, does not make any material difference in the consideration of the law, for it can amount no higher than manslaughter in this case: most of the witnesses seem to say that the first challenge came on the part of the deceased, and not originally by Ward; in that case Swaine was most to blame; you find they fought perfectly on equal terms, and if you believe the witnesses, the deceased was the stronger man of the two, therefore they fought on equal terms; one or two of the witnesses have said, that before he hit him the last blow that he declined fighting any longer, and that he was not on the defensive; now whenever there has been time to cool, it has been said by the counsel, that in that case it shews malevolence by the party continuing to shew his resentment, when the other had declined the combat; but I do not think much about that, for you find the interval was exceedingly short indeed between their actual fighting and Swaine declining the combat; one of the witnesses has said that they fought to the last, there was no interval, but that of of merely going round the cart; another matter is the aggravation on the part of the deceased, by catching hold of Ward by the hair; now that in this science, which I am very sorry prevails so much in this kingdom as it does at present, it is not any honour at all to the civilisation of this country, and I wish it was laid aside; but if in the science of fighting, it is looked upon as unfair, it might be looked on by the prisoner as a strong aggravation on the part of the deceased, and must naturally raise his resentment; now supposing that to be the case, the interval was so very short; it is not such an interval as the law will consider sufficient for a man's warmth of temper to cool: the law makes that allowance for human frailty; (though to be sure every man ought to keep a guard over his passions) that when a thing is done in heat, and before a man has had time to cool, if death happens, the law will not impute it to any higher crime than manslaughter; therefore there does not seem to be any ground to infer upon that very short interval, if any there was; that he had sufficient time to cool; especially after receiving that fresh provocation of taking hold of him by the hair, which was almost the last thing that was done previous to giving him that blow; therefore at all events this crime cannot amount to more than manslaughter: Gentlemen, if on the other hand, you are of opinion the death was not owing to the blows and bruises he received; you will find the prisoner not guilty.</p>

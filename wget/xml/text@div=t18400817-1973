                  </hi>. I left the Princess Victoria public-house about three o'clock, on the 2nd of August—I then had the money stated, in a purse—I laid down against the long-field stile that leads to West Acton, and the prisoner Horton came and laid by my side—I bad never seen him before—Smith was over in the field, on the other side the stile—I fell asleep for about an hour—when I awoke my purse and money was all gone except 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—a policeman was sent for, and the prisoners were searched, and the money found on them—the purse was not found.</p>

I was going along, and saw Young asleep—I saw Horton with his two fingers in Young's right-hand pocket, and Smith was over the stile in the long field—he might be fifteen or sixteen yards off—I went across the road, and sat under the shade of a tree—Horton looked at me three times, to see whether I was gone—I then got up and travelled on, to see for a policeman—I did not see one, and sat down again—I then saw Horton go over into the field—he was there but a short time—he then came back, and was very active about the prosecutor—he beckoned to Smith, but he did not come to him—Smith appeared to be watching—Horton was <hi rend="italic">foraging</hi> about the prosecutor for five or six minutes, and then he went over to Smith—I then met a man, and asked him to go with me and awake the prosecutor, and his pocket was turned out.</p>

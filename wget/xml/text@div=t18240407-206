On the 17th of March, about nine o'clock in the evening, I met the prisoner at Ratcliff, with another girl, who I had seen before; they asked for drink, which I gave them, and went home with them to <placeName id="t18240407-206-crimeloc1147">Blue-coat-fields</placeName>

I put my watch under the holster - I thought she was putting her clothes under the pillow, instead of which she was taking mine out - she blowed the candles out, and ran out, and the door was shut - I could not open it - I called out - the patrol forced it open, and came to me. I was fastened in the room for a quarter of an hour. I saw her again between eleven and twelve o'clock that night, and knew her - she denied knowing me, and said she lived in Whitechapel, but afterwards said she lived in that room.</p>

            . I am a watchman. The prosecutor described the girl to me - we went to look for her, and saw her over the way with two girls - he pointed her out. She denied having seen him, and said she lived in Whitechapel, but acknowledged having been in the court; he seemed sober, but I thought he did not know who had robbed him.</p>

I know she had a gold repeating watch with her there, which she generally wore; there was a chain, five seals, and a key, all gold, attached to it.

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in Upper York-street, Bryanston-square. On the 23d of September I took a gold watch chain in pawn for 1 l. 2 s. from the prisoner Evans. She brought the chain, one seal, and one key, and asked what I could lend on them; she wanted 30 s. and said they belonged to Mr. Evans, No. 95, Homer-street. The officer brought her to my shop in half an hour after. I produced them; she had a child with her; she only pawned the chain, not the seal and key.</p>

            . At the time of the robbery I was servant to Captain Duncan M'Leod; Mrs. Spitta was on a visit there; Bridgman was apprehended at his master's, who is a blacksmith; he had been to the house to repair two bells. Mrs. Spitta had left the watch in her bedroom; the prisoner had to work in the drawing-room and parlour only; he had come a little before five o'clock in the afternoon, and was there until past six. About seven o'clock Mrs. Spitta complained of losing her watch. I went to his master's house, (he is an apprentice,) and soon after he came in. The officer searched him in my presence, and found four gold seals, which Mrs. Spitta claimed. The officer insisted on knowing where the watch was; he said,</p>
               <p>"If you look in that drawer (in the work-shop) you will find it," which he did; he agreed at last to take us to where Evans lived. We went; her husband worked for the same master as the prisoner. We found there, on the shelf over the fire-place, the duplicate of the chain, the prosecutrix claimed it.</p>

            . I am a constable. I went with Hayman to the prisoner's master; I found four seals in his pocket, and 15 s. in silver. Mrs. Spitta claimed them. He took me to Evans's house in Crawford-street; it was about a quarter to eight when we got to her lodging - she was denied to us. We went up and found her concealed on the leads at the top of the house. I brought her down. Hayman found the duplicate on the mantle piece - I did not search her. After taking her to the office, we returned to her lodging, and found the other seal and key. I asked her where the rest of the money was that she got for the chain; she said the boy only gave her 4 s. for her trouble.</p>
               <p>MR. SPITTA. I know the watch, chain, seals, and key are the property of my wife, they are worth above 5 l.</p>
               <p>EVAN'S Defence. The boy said he found it, and I pawned it for him, which I should not have done if I had known it would have brought me into this trouble.</p>

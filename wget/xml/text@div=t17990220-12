                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179902200013"></xptr>JAMES JARVIS sworn. - Last Friday evening, about nine o'clock, I lost a till, containing about four pounds, or thereabouts; the till was fixed in the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner? - A. No, he was an entire stranger to me; the first time I saw him was in my shop, I went towards the shop supposing him to be a customer, and the prisoner hurried out as fast as he could; I pursued him, and caught him at the next house to my own; I took him by the shoulder, and asked him what he had been after; he said, what did I mean; I asked him what he wanted in my shop; he said, he came there to enquire for Jack Cressy; I asked him how he could enquire without speaking to any one; upon that, my brother and I brought him back again to our house; I then missed the till with its contents; I sent for an officer, and he was taken to the watch-house, but nothing was found; there had been nobody in the shop to the best of my knowledge, from the time I had been in the shop, about five minutes before, till I saw him; I kept looking all the time; nobody else could have done it, in my opinion.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM PUFF sworn. - I was going into Mr. Jarvis's shop, and saw the prisoner at the bar come out with the till in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner by sight before? - A. Yes, there was another man just by the door; he then went a little way from Mr. Jarvis's shop, and the till was exchanged from one to the other.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I helped my brother the next morning to take the till out of a pond just before my house; he was going to work in the morning, and saw it there, (produces the till): I can swear to this being my till.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. The person I was enquiring after was John Cressy, who lived in that neighbourhood, and was well known to Mr. Jarvis to be a man of good character; I went into Mr. Jarvis's house to enquire, but seeing nobody in the shop, I turned out again with intent to enquire at the next door, when Mr. Jarvis laid hold of me.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character. <rs id="t17990220-12-verdict63" type="verdictDescription">

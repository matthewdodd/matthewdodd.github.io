On Sunday, the 25th of December, at nine o'clock, my door was open; I was busy in the shop - the prisoner came in and took a pair of shoes off the rail, as if to look at them, and in a minute he put them inside his coat, buttoned it up, and was going out - I asked what he wanted - he said a pair of boots; I opened his coat, and took these shoes out of his pocket - he said he had bought them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming by - they called me in to buy a pair of shoes; I took a pair in my hand, turned round to try them on, and he asked what I was about.</p>

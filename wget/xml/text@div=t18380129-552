                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Stevens, he keeps the Rose Inn, Smithfield. The prisoner came into my service last May, and left in December, about eight weeks ago—I missed a brooch which was kept in my room, in one of the drawers—it was open at times,</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. Carr, of No. 15, Peter's-lane, Cow-cross; he is a pawnbroker. I produce this brooch, which was pawned on the 26th of December, in the name of John Fleming—Mr. Stevens got it by paying the interest—we never allow people to see things until they pay the interest.</p>

                  </hi>. I lived at No. 14, Peter's-lane, and live now at No. 2, New-court, Peter's-lane. I pawned this brooch and a necklace—the pri<lb></lb>soner came to my house, and said she had been playing at cards the night before, and lost 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., that she bad not a farthing, and had not the money to pay for the cab to carry her box to her new place, and she told me to get 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the pawnbroker tried them with the stuff he had in the bottle, and would not give me more than 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and that I took.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman S</hi>). On 8th May I was in High Street. Camden Town, and saw Plume and another man; seeing that Plume had something in his pocket rather bulky, I was induced to follow him—they went up High Street, Camden Town, to Rowley's, the pawnbroker's—the other man went as far as James Street, While Plume went into Rowley's and pledged a Church Service, which has been produced, for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he then came out and joined the other man, and they went together to Mr. Hampson's, in Chalk Farm Road, where Plume went in and offered another book for 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. but they refused to take it in—I went into another compartment ald heard what was said—I then followed them to Great College Street, where the other man pledged a book while Plume remained outsider-previous to the other men going in, a ticket passed from one to the other, also a little parcel, which I believe to be a book, and that was done at each place, the one who waited outside always had the stock of books and the fickets—I followed about two hours and a half to different public-houses, and at last to Mr. Starling's, where Plume went in—I then got the assistance of a constable in Uniform, but before I could do so the other one escaped—I went into the shop and said to Plume "How do you account for the possession of this book?"which was handed to me over the counter—he said "It is my property"—I said "Where did you get it from?" he said "From a friend who has gone to Australia"—I said "What about the other books that you and the other man have pledged?"—he said "We have pledged no books"—I told him they had pledged one at Mr. Rowley's, and that the other man had pledged</p>

               <p>one at Mr. Parr's, in College Street—on the way to the station he said "I bought them in Paternoster Row, I cannot remember the number, but I can produce the catalogue of them"—he has not done so—he was remanded to the 15th and again to the 22nd—when I was conveying him to Guildhall he said "Have not you taken the other man, he is worse than me"—I asked him if he would give me the other man's name and address—he said that he would, but he has never done so—he was then remanded to the 28th—twenty-two books were pledged, and Plume had one in his possession—I think the man who has escaped had one, I saw something bulky.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have been twelve years in the force; I have been a detective six or seven years—I have made inquiries about Plume, and ascertained that he has been employed on the <hi rend="italic">Standard</hi> newspaper above nine years—I have not heard that he has been charged before—I did not watch them from any information which' I had received—I cannot explain how it is that the evidence about following them from shop to shop is not in my deposition; I am positive I gave it—I did not caution Plume, I said that he could say what he liked—it is not usual to caution prisoners in dealing with property which I do not know to be stolen; if he had been charged with felony it would have been different—Plume's friends spoke to me and asked me what it was best to do—I said that I could have nothing to do with the matter, as there was a solicitor engaged—I do not know John Broom—I do not know whether Bick has passed under the name of White—I searched Plume's place, and found a lot of pawn tickets in the name of Plume, not relating to books—none of the books pledged are in the name of Henry or John White.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Plume has been charged with assaulting his wife, and bound over to keep the peace—I know that from her own lips.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">re-examined.</hi>) I have examined these prayer-books—they are the property of the firm—they have not been through the hands of retail dealers—there might be a possibility of one of them being for sale in Paternoster Row; if it was sold there would be a mark in it, but there is a possibility that a book might be unmarked.</p>

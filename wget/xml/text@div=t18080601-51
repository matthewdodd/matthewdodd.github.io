               <p>Q. Did you shew her any - A. We never wait upon these kind of people. I took this remnant of print from her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her take it - A. Yes; I was alone and saw it; I followed her out of the shop, brought her back to the door, and took it out of her hand, and I sent for a constable; I am confident it is my master's cotton, it has the shop mark on it; it hung on a horse in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. How comes it to be that she was not tried before this, in June - A. She made her escape from

             the officer as he was conveying her to prison; he was knocked down.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM READ. I am a constable of Hatton garden; the prisoner was delivered into my custody on the 7th of January, near eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. How comes it that she has not been tried before this - A. I was taking the prisoner with another, they were tied together, down to the House of Correction; somebody coming along run against me, whether by accident or design I cannot say, then she made her escape; she has been since in New Prison for stealing a kettle, and was confined two months.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Did you give any information against the prisoner at the bar? - A. I did to the officers at Shadwell, to Rogers, Brown, and others.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of the information that you had given against the prisoner at the bar, on the 12th of June, what did you do? - A. I went to the prisoner's house on the 12th of June, in Norwich-court, Fetter-lane, under the direction of the officers; the prisoner was at home, and her husband was with her, he was cleaning his boots; he is a post-boy; I asked her if she had got any things, meaning bad money; it is the general term we use; she said I might have plenty; she asked me how many I wanted; I told her I had not got much money to purchase many now; but in the evening, if she would produce me a half piece, I would purchase them; they call half a piece twenty; and if you buy half a piece they give you twenty-one for it: I appointed to meet her in the evening at seven o'clock for the half-piece; I told her they were not for me, but they were for one of the Brentford coachmen: her husband asked me if I knew several of the Brentford coachmen; I said, yes, I told him several of their names; he then said, I know they do something in that way; I asked her if I might have them at the time, and she said I might; I left her, and then went to Mr. Rogers and the other officers, and told them what I had done; we all appointed to meet at seven in the evening. We then met at the Tweed-side-house, in Middle-row, Holborn; there we went into a private room; Mr. Rogers marked some money, which was four shillings, in the presence of Brown, Oliver, and myself; he delivered them to me; I put them into my pocket, I had no more money; he said, if I could bring her down to that house, it would be much better; I told him I thought I could; I went then to her apartment, leaving the officers at the Tweed-side public-house; she was at home by herself; then I asked her if what I came for were ready, she said they were; I asked her if she would step to a public-house just by, the person that I wanted them for was there; she said, she would, she would not put on her cloak; she went with me just as she was; we went to the Tweed-side-house, and when I went into the tap-room, I said my friend is not here, we will have a pint of beer, sit down; she sat down, and we had a pint of beer; I said, as he is not here for the half piece, I will have a few for my own use; she asked me how many I would have; I told her I had money enough for eight, which was four shillings.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. When did you first learn what was the price of them? - A. When I first learned the trade, I knew the price of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you at all agreed with her what should be the price of them? - A. Yes; I had bought of her before; sixpence a piece was the common price of them; she made some little scruple of dealing in the tap-room, because there was a person or two there; I told her they would not know our business, with that she put her hand in her pocket, and pulled out a paper under the table, and produced eight, and I gave her the four shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Were those the four shillings that Rogers gave you? - A. The very same; she said she could not stop, she got up to go out, because the coachman did not come; as she was getting up, Brown laid hold of her arm, and said, madam, please to walk this way; Brown saw all the transaction, he came in as a stranger, and called for a pint of beer, and did not sit ten yards off; he laid hold of her, and put her in the private room, where the other officers were, and myself along with her; there they searched her, and I saw them take more than twenty from her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any one search you? - A. Yes; they searched me, and found the eight I had received from this woman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. I suppose you have told all the truth, and nothing but the truth? - A. Yes; I do not know that I have said any thing wrong.</p>
               <p>Q. I dare say you did tell the prisoner every thing but the truth, not one lie or stratagem to get hold of her? - A. If I had told her what I had come about, she would not have let me had a shilling; I told her a falsehood in the first place, the coachman did not want any, and in the next place I did not want any for myself, I only wanted to convict the woman.</p>
               <p>Q. You told two falsehoods for one purpose, to convict the woman - what are you to get for it? - A. I do not know that I shall get any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never get any thing for prosecuting any other person? - A. I never got any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you expect something? - A. As I am a working man, I expect something as wages, I leave it to the generosity of those who employ me.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you are to be paid as you do your work; so much if you convict, and so much if you do not; you say you do not know what you are to be paid - is that one of your truths? - A. That is the truth according to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you have the goodness to tell me what you are, what sort of a journeyman you are? - A. I am a wire-drawer.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180507100080"></xptr>Q. Do you earn any thing at all at it now? - A. At times, when there is any thing to do.</p>
               <p>Q. You have not had any lately? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The wire-drawing business has been a slack business lately? - A. I can maintain myself by sitting at home.</p>
               <p>Q. I wish I could do that? - A. I cannot get so much by sitting at home as I can by going abroad.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe that is a truth - how long is it ago since you worked at the wire-drawing trade? - A. Less than a month past.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you have not got your livelihood any other way? - A. I have told you.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not suppose me to be an old acquaintance - you have come here now again to day, I ask you have you done any thing else to get a livelihood? - A. I am a thread lace-weaver.</p>

               <p>Q. Am I to suppose that you have got your livelihood by that, or worked at it by way of amusement - who do you sell your lace to? - A. I sell it to people in the neighbourhood, and to my own acquaintance.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you deal with any shop-keeper? - A. The quantity is so little that I make, it is not worth the notice of any dealer.</p>
               <p>Q. You would have us understand you got your livelihood by that? - A. I did not say that.</p>
               <p>Q. Who do you work for in the wire-drawing business? - A. Mr. Oliver, in Love-lane, Wood-street; I could work for him to morrow if he had any to do, I worked for him less than a month past.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you yourself been taken up for doing any thing in the smashing way? - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us what the smashing way of business is, the Jury do not understand it so well as I do? - A. Buying bad money of those that make them and pass them on the public.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you have been getting your livelihood when you were abroad in passing bad money on honest tradesmen, you are not ashamed to tell me so? - A. I am ashamed of it and determined to leave it off.</p>
               <p>Q. How old are you? - A. I am fifty.</p>
               <p>Q. High time to leave it off - have you been in custody for smashing? - A. I was for eight or nine days; they could find no bill against me, I had only one bad shilling against me.</p>
               <p>Q. How many more did you accuse afterwards besides this prisoner? - A. Two more.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe in God? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the 9th commandment, Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour; and the 8th, Thou shalt not steal; you knew that before you used to pass bad money? - A. Yes; I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew it then when you went to this woman's house, when you told her that a coachman was the man that you wanted this half-piece for, that was not true? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the officers search you? - A. I do not know whether they did or not, they might rub me down, I do not think that they put their hands into my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the money was marked in your presence, do you know for what purpose the money was marked? - A. They desired me to look as well as the others, and for all of us to be particular to know it again when it was found on the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. For the purpose of giving confirmation to the evidence, do you know that the fact was so? - A. I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You cannot get him to swear to a purpose of theirs? - A. I am not an officer, I do not know their business.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Whether you did not give her that bad money which the officers found upon her, with a view that it should be found upon her? - A. I know nothing at all about that.</p>
               <p>Q. So you would have me to understand you cannot ascertain what you are to have for this prosecution? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Has any body promised you any precise sum towards what you have done? - A. Not a halfpenny, not a promise of any kind.</p>
               <p>Q. You expect they will pay you? - A. Yes, for my time and trouble.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You are an officer belonging to Shadwell? - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. We understand that you and the other officers employed Coleman for the purpose of going to the prisoner's house? - A. Yes, we did so. On the 12th of June, I, Brown, Oliver, and Coleman, all met at the Tweed-side public-house, and in the parlour there I gave Coleman four good shillings; I marked them and shewed them to all the officers and to Coleman: in order that they might be satisfied afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you desire Coleman to go to the prisoner's house? - A. I did; and we waited at the Tweed-side house till we got further intelligence.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon afterwards did you see Coleman? - A. In a few minutes perhaps a quarter of an hour, I did not see him come back, I was in the parlour; I desired Brown, when I understood he was come, to go into the room and have a pint of beer, because he was not so much known as I was; in a very short time, Brown came to the parlour-door with the prisoner, and delivered her into my possession, and Oliver brought Coleman to me he being out of the parlour sooner than I was; I laid hold of the prisoner and I conceived there was something in her hand; in a piece of paper that was in her hand I found twenty-one pieces of bad silver; I then searched her pockets, and found in one of her pockets, two bad shillings in another piece<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180507100081"></xptr>of paper, all resembling each other in my opinion; I searched the other pocket and found the four marked shillings which I had previously given to Coleman; I saw Brown take eight shillings from Coleman.</p>
               <p>Q. They were bad shillings were they? - A. Yes; I asked Coleman how he came by it, in the hearing of the woman; he told me, that he received them from that woman; I asked her was it true, she said, all the money she had she received from Coleman, good, bad, and indifferent; she spoke generally; she said, I received all from that man; I then asked her particularly respecting the marked money; she said, the four shillings as well as the other money she had from Coleman; I asked Coleman if he got the eight shillings which Brown took from him of the prisoner; he said, he had; I asked her if that was true; she gave me no answer; we then took her to the Office; I produce the money, I have kept them all separate in paper, and marked the papers.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. This fellow, Coleman, you have known for some time? - A. No, very shortly; he was no acquaintance of mine.</p>
               <p>Q. I am very glad of it - you did not search him? - A. Indeed I did not think it was necessary, he had no money about him.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not in the tap-room at the time this woman was there? - A. No; Brown was; I found the twenty-one shillings in her hand; she said, she had it from Coleman just before.</p>
               <p>Q. You found the money in her hand which might have come from Coleman, it was not found in her pocket? - A. I cannot say any thing to it.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You are likewise an officer of Shadwell? - A. I am; I remained at the Tweed-side house till Coleman returned with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. How far were you from them while they sat in the tap-room? - A. Something closer than I am to you; I was in a different box and sitting right facing of them, just within the door.</p>
               <p>Q. The box was very near them? - A. Yes; just room enough for one person to pass; I saw the prisoner at the bar and Coleman having some conversation together; I called for a pint of porter while I sat there; I observed Coleman and she had passed something between them at the edge of the table.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Was it at the edge of the table or under the table? - A. Rather under the table.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. At that time you could not tell what they were passing? - A. I could not; I saw Coleman take his hand from her, and he clasp it up in this way; Coleman got up and she likewise, they both came out from between the boxes, and as she was coming out I took hold of her hand and called for Rogers, and Oliver to come; I took her to the parlour-door and gave her to Mr. Rogers: Coleman stood close to me, I took hold of his hand and these are the eight shillings I took from him; I said to Coleman, when I took hold of his hand, what have you got there; Coleman answered, that is the money I got from that woman; the woman said, that she knew nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. At the first, when Coleman said the money he had got, he got from the woman, what was the answer that she made? - A. At that time she made no answer; she said afterwards, that that man gave her all the money that she had.</p>
               <p>Q. Before she was searched by Rogers, you say she gave some answer, do correct yourself and let us know what passed? - A. The words that passed were these, when I took the money out of Coleman's hand, I asked Coleman how he came by it: he said, that he had it from that woman.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the woman say if she did say any thing? - A. She did not say any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. When Rogers searched her did she say any thing then? - A. She said, she had the four shillings that Mr. Rogers found upon her from Coleman.</p>
               <p>Q. Before she said any thing to Rogers, did she say any thing else? - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. She described that she had all the counterfeit money from Coleman, and the four shillings marked money? - A. She did; we took her in a coach and brought her away to Shadwell-office; I have had these eight shillings in my custody ever since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Mr. Brown, who employed you in this scheme? - A. Mr. Coleman came to me, he gave the first information.</p>
               <p>Q. And you concerted the plan with Coleman and the other officers? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. May I ask you what you get in cases of this sort? - A. I have nothing to the best of my knowledge; I have not received any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you expect? - A. I do not expect any thing but what they please to allow me.</p>
               <p>- PARKER sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You have been employed by the Mint for a great number of years - look at these eight shillings that were brought with the four? - A. They are all counterfeit.</p>
               <p>Q. Do they appear to be of the same manufactory? - A. I have no doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the twenty-one which were taken out of the hand of the prisoner? - A. They are all counterfeit, and all of the same manufactory, and these two are of the same description which were taken out of the woman's pocket. (The money shewn to the Jury.)</p>

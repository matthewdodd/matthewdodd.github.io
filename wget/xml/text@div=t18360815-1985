                  </hi>. I am a clerk under Sir John Webb, Director General of the Ordnance Medical Department at Woolwich, which is attached to the Board of Ordnance. These mats were stores used in the office—one laid at my door, and another at the door of a public passage—they were both supplied from the public stores, and so marked—on the 4th of August, about eleven o'clock at night, I heard the noise of a door swinging too which had been propped open by one of the mats, and I heard distinctly female voices—I found the mat was gone, and the other mat from my door—I had seen them three minutes before—I went to see if I could find who had taken them—when I got out I saw nobody, and proceeded to the centre of the gate, about 300 yards—I afterwards saw two women—I overheard some whispering in a privy corner, and presently the prisoners came from that place—this was all within the permises—this was about eight minutes after I missed the mats—the woman had each a cloak on, and they appeared rather large—I stopped them, and said, "What are you doing here?" and at the same time put my hand on the cloak of M'Der<lb></lb>mott—I found there was a mat there—she immediately exclaimed, "I did not take it"—the other also said, "I did not take it"—I had then found only one mat, and as I put my hand on it she let it fall; the other pri<lb></lb>soner immediately retreated, and I saw a mat fall from her also—they are here, and are both marked "B. O.," and the broad arrow—the prisoners are both strangers to me—they begged very hard to be let go.</p>

On the night of the 4th of August, I took M'Dermott at the Royal Hospital—while I took her to the station-house she said, through being distressed for rent she took the mats to make a bed to lay on—I then went with the superintend<lb></lb>ent, and found the other prisoner—they were both quite sober.</p>

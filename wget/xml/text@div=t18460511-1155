                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live at No. 6, Guildford-street—it is my dwelling-house, and is in the parish of St. James's, Clerkenwell—I keep my street door open. On the 4th of May, in the afternoon, I was in my kitchen, at dinner—I had articles of drapery in the shop—I had been absent half an hour—I had fastened the parlour door inside, and left the key in the lock—I heard a wooden roller fall down above me in the parlour—that and the shop are all one—I heard two people walk out—I rushed to the kitchen window, and saw the prisoner stepping from the upper step of the street door of the house—that is not the door of the shop—there was another person going out before him—he stepped out, stopped for a minute or two, and then walked on—I saw his face so as to be able to swear to him—the prisoner is the man—I went up stairs, found the parlour door open, and saw a wooden roller of silk serge lying three or four yards from where I had placed it—a piece of doe-skin which I had left on my cutting-board was gone—I afterwards dis<lb></lb>covered that other property was gone—not more than a minute after I had seen the prisoner on the step, I went into the street and saw him walking down the street from my door—I ran after him—he stood still and I passed on—I said nothing to him—when I got round by a public-house, I saw two other men running away—I do not know them—I have every reason to believe one was the first man I had seen go out—he had a bag with him—I called out as well as I could, and pursued him—he saw me, and dropped a bag" containing the goods—I went after him instead of stopping for the bag—I was intercepted by some of the prisoner's party, who got before me, and wanted to know the particulars of it, and I thought it was high time to go back to the bag—I did so, and gave it in charge of the constable—I after<lb></lb>wards saw the prisoner about twenty yards off, walking deliberately on the other side of the way—I pointed him out to Walters, who stopped him—the prisoner wanted to know what he was stopped for—we told him for enter<lb></lb>ing my premises—he said, "You may take me if you like, it was not me," or something to that effect—I examined the bag—it contained this doe-skin, cloth, and satin (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is my property—I am quite sure the prisoner is the person I saw going out of the shop.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable, and live in Guildford-street, Clerk enwell. About a quarter to two o'clock I saw the prosecutor run across the street—I went out—he held out his hand, but could not speak he was to hoarse—there was no one present when he spoke to me—he delivered a black bag to me, which I have produced—I brought it into my house—he after-wards pointed out the prisoner to me about thirty yards below, on the opposite side—I took him into custody—he asked what I wanted him for—I told him and took him to the station—he gave his name o'John Davis"—the sergeant said, "Are you sure that is the only name you have?"—he said, "Yes"—he said, "What is your occupation?"—he objected to that—the sergeant said, "You may well object, for you were here before in the name of Franklin"—I took this ring from him, and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

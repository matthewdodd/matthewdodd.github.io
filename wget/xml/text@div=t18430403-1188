                  </hi>. I am a police-sergeant of the G division. On Tuesday, the 31st of Jan., between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, I went to the premises of Messrs. Fowler and Swift, tin-plate workers, No. 73, St. John-street, with Mr. Swift—I met the prisoner, in company with a man named Woodrop, in the passage leading to St. John-street—Mr. Swift the elder spoke to Woodrop—Swift, junior, followed York, and brought him back to the counting-house—I told him I belonged to the police, and asked if he had any of his master's property about him—I was in plain clothes—he hesi<lb></lb>tated—I pulled his coat open, and in his side coat-pocket, underneath his hand<lb></lb>kerchief, I found three pieces of tin, which I produce—Mr. Swift said, "How come you with these?" and asked if he had any more property about him—he said, "No"—I pulled off his hat, and found this wire which I produce—Mr. Swift gave him in charge—I found the articles in the presence of Mr. Swift.</p>

            . I am son to the procecutor. Digging in my father's garden, I saw three men coming down by the water-side. I thought, if they did not turn over a bridge that goes to Denham, they could be upon no good. I seeing them come by that, I took a stick and went after them. I saw them very busy with their hands down, and when I got about two or three hundred yards from them, I saw them go down towards some bushes. Then I had an opportunity to get farther on. I saw them just going down before. I jumped over the Ware-Gate, and passed Fletcher; then seeing

             with his hand in his pocket, I thought he had got some fish about him. I called to him to stop. Fletcher said, What do you want with me? I said, I want nothing with you. Just before I got to Hawke, he took his handkerchief and wiped his face. I took hold of Lively. I could not get him on so fast as Hawke. I left him, and went on. Hawke threw some craw-fish down. I took up three. I found nine more. Lively came to us. I brought them all three to my father's. I got my father to acquit them. Going up to Denham, I advised them to pursue better ways. Lively had a little remorse of conscience, and said he would never be concerned with them any more. He added, Hawke said he would come and steal this net in the night. I let them go. I heard them go past me, and heard Lively say, Don't go any farther than the crawfish which I tied in the ditch. One of the others said, D - n it, I'll go and have the net that is worth 4 l.

He carried it as he told me, and he did not chuse to grind it. It was left there a day or two, and examined by several gentlemen; afterwards he fetched it away again.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Waylett. I fastened up his shop on the night of the 7th of April, I went up stairs, and saw the door which communicates between the two houses, between eight and nine o'clock; it was locked with a padlock in the usual way.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was there any servant maid in the house? A. No; no person but me and Conner - he gets his breakfast when Mr. Waylett goes there in the morning; there is no bed in the house but his - I had not touched the door of communication to padlock it, for a month before perhaps; the door is on the second floor - I did not touch it the night before; a person could not have got in there without breaking the door, but that is not where they did get in - I did not see them get in.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When were you there again? A. Between eight and nine o'clock next morning: there is a window, on the first staircase, which looks on the sky-light of the empty house, and that window was broken to let in two fingers to undo the button, and when that was open it would make an opening plenty large enough to admit the body of a man; I saw the padlock in the staple next morning.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Is it a glass door between the two houses? A. No; a wainscoat door.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. For ought you know, not having pushed against the door, you cannot say whether it might not have been ajar? A. It is possible; I was up the staircase the night before, and the lock was in the staple - I am not positive of that; my attention was not particularly directed to it.</p>

            . I am the night officer I went to the house and saw the desk on the floor in the parlour; I waited there to protect the shop and then went to the watch-house with the prisoners - I went to the house again and saw the putty had been chipped round the glass of the door which leads from the show-room, up stairs; and the glass broken as if to admit a hand to get at the lock; I went down to the house again in the morning and saw a window on the staircase standing open; I looked through it and saw the mark of an iron heel, and a chalk mark on the leads which lead over the showroom to the empty house, which is a very short distance; I got out and went through an aperture into the empty house - it appeared to have been a window blocked up with wood; I got through it, and searched over every part of the empty house - I saw the door of communication between the two houses; it is lined with iron - I saw no marks of violence on it; the padlock was hanging in the staple, but not locked - I went into the privy and saw something like a bag on the soil, and we got up a bag containing these articles.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. If a passer by had seen the door of communication as you did, they might have thought it was fast? A. I could not bring my mind to believe it was locked before; I could see nothing to induce me to believe it was locked - the door was open when I saw it, and the lock hanging in the staple; if the door had been ajar and I had not gone against it, or pushed it, and the lock had been in the staple, it might have deceived me.</p>
               <p>COURT to WOLSONCROFT. Q. Can you positively swear you saw that door at all that night - did you not take it for granted it was locked - can you swear it at all? A. Yes; and I saw nothing particular about it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you examine the door particularly? A. No; I went within about two yards of it; I did not particlarly give it a thought - I might give a glance at it as I passed I cannot tax my memory.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you see the padlock? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is there any glass over the shop? A. Yes; the button was turned in the staircase window of Mr. Waylett's house; they had stept over the sky-light over the shop to come to the window - nothing was done to the sky-light - it is but small.</p>
               <p>BARRETT'S Defence. We were coming from Greenwich fair and had had a little drink: we came down Fish-street-hill, and saw the door of the empty house open - we went in and laid down; some person shut the door while we were there, and we could not find our way out again.</p>

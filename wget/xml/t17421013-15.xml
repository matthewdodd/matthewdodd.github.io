            . The Prisoner was at our House on Monday - the Day before he stole the Tankard, and drank Beer there the best Part of the Day; he came again on Tuesday Morning and called for a Tankard of Beer, and my Master drawed him a Tankard ; and afterwards I drew him a Pint and put it into the Tankard; I saw he moved himself nearer towards the Door. Sir, says I, you have not drank all your Beer; if you please to drink it; I desire to have the Tankard, for we do not use to leave Tankards in this Room, he said he would take care of the Tankard, so I went out of the Room, and presently after I went in again, and he and the Tankard were gone. - I had but just turned my Back. - No Body else was in the Room, it was done in a Minute. - I cannot say whether he went out at the Sash, for the Windows were open, or out at the Door.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you see me take the Tankard away?</p>

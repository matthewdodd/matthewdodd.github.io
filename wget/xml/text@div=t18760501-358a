                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Morgan, of 13, The Grove, Great Guildford Street, Southwark—on the night of Easter Sunday, about 12.30, I was waiting up for my husband—the prisoner knocked at the door and asked if my husband was in—I said "No"—he said he was, he heard him talking—I said "If you don't like to believe me, come in and see for your<lb></lb>self"—he came in, and my daughter held a candle for him to see that he was not in—he went back to the door and said "I will learn him to call my wife a prostitute"—I said "What grievance there is between you, you had better come when you are sober and at a reasonable hour"—he was drunk—he said that he would lay wait for him if it was 3 o'clock in the morning before he came in, I could go in and shut the door, he <hi rend="italic">did</hi> not want me to stay there, and I "went in and shut the door—in about ten minutes I went out to see if I could see my husband coming, I went to the corner of the street, and I saw the prisoner and my husband standing—the prisoner said "<hi rend="italic">A good job</hi> you have come out, or I would have killed him dead"—my husband had blood all over bis face and he could not see out of his eyes, <hi rend="italic">his head</hi> seemed almost as big as <hi rend="italic">two</hi>—I put my hands up to my face and began crying and ran across the road to fetch my mother and daughter <hi rend="italic">out</hi>—when I came back the prisoner was gone—my husband came staggering across the road, we got him inside and laid him on the bed and he feinted away—my mother and daughter attended to him, and next day a doctor saw him—he had two cuts on his face, one on face eye and one on the cheek; he bad two or three little marks on his face and one right across the nose; the two cuts appeared to have been done with a knife or some very sharp in<lb></lb>strument—he had one piece cut out of his little finger on the left hand and piece out of another finger on the same hand.</p>

                  </hi>. On the Saturday night I had been on a visit <hi rend="italic">to my</hi> sister at Broad wall; I left there between 12.15 and 12.30; it is about a quarter of an hour's walk from my house—as I was turning round the cor<lb></lb>ner of Guildford Street near my own house I met the prisoner—he was standing there not more than 15 or 20 yards from my house—I have known him for years and we never had a wrong word before—I said, "Holloa, Bill, how are you?"—he said "I will learn you to call my wife a prostitute," and he gave me a terrific blow with his fist at the side of the temple which cnocked me down senseless—I fell in a sitting position on the doorstsp of a mblic-house at the corner—he struck me several times while I was down is hard as he could all over the head—I tried <hi rend="italic">to get up</hi> and I got half way up when he knocked me down again with his fist and commenced kicking ne; he kicked me all over the body and in the privates—I tried to get up again and just as I was half way between sitting and standing he brought his instrument out, it appeared to me to be a knife, and it looked to me ike a double edged knife; he took it out of his left breast pocket; he struck no twice with it; I could not see it coming, and I put up my hand to present</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187605010112"></xptr>
               <p>it, and it cut a piece of flesh out of my finger—he then made a second strike and the knife slipped through my fingers, cutting this other finger, and cut me under the eye, and he struck me again in the cheek—he put the knife in his pocket, then took it out again and said "Look here, I have a great mind to bury this in you"—fortunately my wife ran across the road at that moment, and he returned the knife into his pocket as quick as possible—he said to my wife "It is a good job you have come, for I meant to have killed him dead, however, you can sec what I have done with him now"—my wife put up her hands to her eyes, burst out crying, and ran away—I was left by myself then and I was afraid he might put his threat in force, so I said "Bill, let us part good friends," for I was really afraid—he said "<hi rend="italic">No</hi>, we are enemies for ever"—he then went away—I tottered across the road the best way I could, I just managed to get to the street door and I remember no more till I was in bed and my daughter bathing my face—I had not struck the prisoner or said anything to him, we had been the best of friends till that evening.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have known him between six and seven years—I have not seen his wife more than about six times—I paid her two visits when the prisoner was absent, one was when I wished to see him about some business and he was not at home; another time I asked her to lend me 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. as I had a long way to go and it was raining very hard—she said she had no change but would get it; we went to a beershop next door but one, and she got change and lent me 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> fare and paid for two pints of beer for me and herself; that was on the Monday before the Saturday when this happened—I never said that his wife was a prostitute or a wh—or any<lb></lb>thing of the sort—I am not a deserter; I never deserted from the Army-twelve years ago I left my wife with her consent and went on the tramp to get work; I was away three months—I was then charged with deserting her and sent to prison—I had been to dinner with the prisoner the Sunday before this.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the divisional surgeon of police—I saw the prose<lb></lb>cutor at his house about 11 o'clock on Sunday morning, the 16th, he was in bed and seemed very ill, suffering from shock, both his eyes were blackened and he had several slight contusions on the face and nose, and two clean incised wounds under the right eye parallel to each other, about half or three-quarters of an inch long, not very deep; they were caused by some sharp instrument such as a knife—he also had two slight wounds on the fore and little finger of his left hand, and he complained of being bruised about the body—I saw a considerable quantity of blood on the pavement before the door of the public-house—I thought from the amount of blood that it had come from his nose, but he said not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I could not swear that the wounds had been caused by a knife; any sharp-edged instrument would cause such wounds; the iron tip of a boot might do it, but I think then there would have been more contusion; it is possible, but not probable—a knife would be the most likely instrument.</p>

I live at the Anchor public-house, at the corner of Guildford Street—on this night, between 12.30 and 1 o'clock, I was going to bed—I heard a noise, I looked out of window and saw two men, one on a door-step and the other standing up and kicking the other, five or six times; he then punched him—the one who was sitting down got up—a woman came across the road, she did not step a minute, she went back again</p>

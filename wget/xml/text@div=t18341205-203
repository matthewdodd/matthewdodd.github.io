Last Sunday week I left the house at twenty minutes after four o'clock in the afternoon—I was the last person that left it—I went out alone—I fastened the door, which has a drop-latch to it, which we had put on because we thought the lock was unsafe—I pulled the door to, tried it after me, and found it was fastened—I fastened the back door and every window in the house—my brother had gone out at one o'clock, and the apprentice went out before him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say Taylor was in the cab the night before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, to the best of my belief—according to his appearance, height and size—I never said I saw Jones and another man in the cab, without saying it was Tay<lb></lb>lor—I saw them opposite the King's Head, where there is a good gas<lb></lb>light—they got into a cab from the Crown, as I passed by—I had never seen Taylor before, to my recollection—I have a pretty good recollection of persons when I have seen them.</p>

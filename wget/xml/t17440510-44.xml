In the bar there is a cupboard that my wife puts the money in; she took the money out into a room which is by the bar, and told a 3 l. 12 s. two guineas and some silver, and put it into a tin box in the cupboard (I saw all this) and left her bunch of keys hanging in the door, in about a quarter of an hour she called me out, and I went into the room to her, and left the Prisoner in the bar, in about five minutes two gentlemen knocked at the door, who came to spend the evening with a distiller that this money was to be paid to: the Prisoner still continued in the bar, drank up his beer, and went away; about a quarter of an hour after that my wife went to look for the money to pay the distiller, and the money was missing. Says she this man (Proctor) has taken the money away, what shall I do? Said I, perhaps he has only taken it in jest - The Prisoner is a cage maker or wire worker by business, and used to come sometimes with the officers. I went to his lodging, his wife said he had been at home, but was gone out again. I went to Mr. Guy's in Leadenhall Street to enquire after him, because he said he had been out with him to arrest some body, but he was not there. About eleven o'clock he came to my house, I had told Guy of it, and he had told him what I had said; the Prisoner told me he came on purpose to clear himself - he was admitted to bail.</p>

             confirmed the evidence of her husband with regard to the Prisoner's being in the bar, that she put the money (3 l. 12 s. two guineas, and six shillings) into the cupboard, and that no body had been in the bar from the time she put the money in till she missed it, but the maid servant. That when he came at eleven o'clock as he said to clear himself, her husband said, you have done a fine joke to take the money out of the cupboard, and he said, if you think it is a joke, I have done it in earnest.</p>

I have known the Prisoner fourteen years, every one that knows him knows him to be a silly man by way of jest, but as to stealing, I believe no body that knows him will give him that character - He works for me in the wire way, and if the court would please to realease him, I would employ him.</p>

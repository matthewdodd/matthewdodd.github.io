On Sunday morning, the 24th of October, at a few minutes after three o'clock, I was going home with Brown, my fellow lodger, who had a key - he opened the door, and went in; I am quite sure we shut the door, and that nobody except Brown went in with me - there was no light in the passage; we sleep on the second floor - before I got to the foot of the stairs, I stumbled over a hat, and then I stumbled over a chair which was placed against the bar window; I never saw a chair there before - Brown stumbled over two pairs of shoes at the foot of the stairs - we then went up stairs, struck a light, and came down; Brown pushed the taproom door open, and the two prisoners came out of the parlour - they were strangers; Brown asked what they did there - they said they had no lodging, and had come there for shelter for the night; we then went up and brought the landlord down - he asked what they did in his bar; they said they had been out of employ a long while, and begged for mercy - I fetched a Policeman, and before they were taken away a dark-lantern was found in the coal box, and in the fire-place, a stock and two centre-bits, a phosphorus-box, a small crow-bar, and a knife; the Policeman found a skeleton-key - the prisoners had no shoes on, and one of them no stockings; they owned the shoes at the foot of the stairs - the hat was claimed by Roberts, and he asked for the handkerchief that was in it; there was a coat, a hat, and pocket-book found in the tap-room, which the prosecutor claimed, also a tobacco-box - the prisoners said nothing about those things; I observed the staircase window open - it is about six feet from the ground, and looks into the back yard, which opens into a coach-yard, but there is a wall about six feet high; a person could be raised over the wall.</p>

            . I was with Osborne - I have been in Court, heard his evidence, and agree with it; the window was open - if it was fastened, it would be difficult to get in, but if not, a person could get in by being lifted up; it is about six feet from the ground.</p>
               <p>SHADRACK SHOUT. I live at No. 6, Rathbone-place, in the parish of St. Marylebone. The witnesses called me down; I had gone to bed between eleven and twelve o'clock, and locked the bar door myself - I saw the house properly secured, and am quite sure the staircase window was closed, but cannot say whether it was hasped; it is about six feet from the ground - there is nothing to assist a person to get up to it; I did not know the prisoners before - they had not been at my house that night as customers; I am sure they were not in the tap-room when I went to bed - there are two doors to the bar, and a sliding window which latches at the top, and after getting into the bar, the parlour door is bolted inside - I found marks on the bar door, and a crow-bar or chisel was found, which exactly corresponded with the marks - I saw the chisel found, and gave it o' Pattison; there is a lead to the tap-room door, which would make a noise - I found that cut off; it was there when I went to bed; a coat, a hat, a pocket-book, and tobacco-box were found in the tap-room - I had left them in the bar that night; I am certain they had been removed - they are mine, and worth 20s.; I found the back door leading to the yard open - I had fastened that the night before.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I was called into the house, and found a crow-bar, knife, and phophorus-box; I compared the crow-bar with the marks on the bar door - they tallied; I found a chisel, which I compared with the sash of the window - that corresponded also; a lantern, a stock, and two centre-bits were also found - here is the tobacco-box; it is a large one, for the use of the parlour, also a pocket-book, coat, and hat.</p>
               <p>SHADRACK SHOUT. I swear to all these things being mine.</p>
               <p>Roberts' Defence. I had been without a lodging some time; I went down the gateway to ease myself; my fellow prisoner held my pipe the while, and as I came back I saw the landlord's side door open - I said, "We will go in and lay down there on the stairs;" I took off my shoes to ease my feet - I had not been there long before I saw the tap-room door open; I thought we would go in there - in a few minutes the lodgers came in; we heard them, and got up, and when they spoke we spoke, but as to the housebreaking things I know nothing about them; trouble and misfortune have brought me here - my father was a respectable liveryman of the City, of the firm of Hall and Skelton, of Thames-street; I have not had it in my power to send for witnesses - the side door leads to the coach yard.</p>

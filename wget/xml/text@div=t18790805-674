I live at 33, Dean Street, Soho—on Saturday, 5th July, at 8.30 p.m., the prisoner came to me very drunk; she was a strangerto me—she said, "Will you come and see a baby who is ill?" and at that moment reeled into my chest—I declined to go as I did not like her looks—I said, "Where do you come from?"—she said some name at 28, Dean Street—she understood questions, but she could not stand—she muttered, "I don't think you can do any good, for I think the child is dead"—I said, "Has any one attended the child?"—she said, "No"—I said, "Walk on, and I will follow you"—she went on and reeled from side to side; on reaching her lodgings she was so drunk she could not open the door; the landlady opened it and charged her with neglecting the child—an altercation took place between them—I went to the second floor and found the door locked; the landlady unlocked it—I went in and saw a dead child on a couch—it was dressed—I lifted it up and found it cold and rigid—I concluded it had been dead 12 hours at least—I left, and on Sunday saw the child again at the mortuary—it was very emaciated and dirty, its back was covered with excrement up to the shoulders, which had dried on hard—I had difficulty in getting it off—it might have been there four days—the verge of the anus was raw and dirty, which might be from internal causes—</p>

               <p>the foreskin was very much swollen, so that the orifice of the urethra was completely blocked up—it was phymosis—that might have arisen from in<lb></lb>ternal causes and from secretion and want of washing; it ought to have been fomented and kept down—decomposition had very much advanced on the Sunday, which indicated either a very low power of life, or that the child had been dead a long time—the skin of the right elbow was knocked off about the size of a shilling, as if the child had fallen out of bed—it weighed 9 1/4 lb., and the average weight of a child of that age is 18 or 201b.—he was 24 inches long, which is above the average, and he must have been a very fine child—I afterwards made a post mortem, and found the brain very soft with a small quantity of fluid in the ventricles—there were no signs of teeth, there were miliary tubercles in the upper part of both lungs, but no suppuration; it had suffered from bronchitis which had filled the trachea to its lower part—the heart was ill-nourished and the walls flabby, it fell down when I took it out, and could not retain its shape—the stomach was smaller than usual and contained about a tea-spoonful of what appeared to be milk, the gall bladder was much distended—the omentum was devoid of fat—the intestines were generally empty; the large bowel contained a small quantity of faeces; the bladder was dis<lb></lb>tended with urine to the utmost limit; the mesenteric glands were enlarged—the immediate cause of death was bronchitis—the child had required medical care for a long time—the prescription on this dispensary letter of May 13th is for bronchitis—the state of the child a week before its death must unquestionably have shown that it required care and attention and very careful feeding—I came to the conclusion from the distended state of the stomach and the gall bladder, that it had not been fed for a long time—I have a very large experience, and it is quite exceptional when children do not take food—there was mesenteric disease and that would account for the emaciation combined with miliary tubercles and bronchitis, but I do not think it would account for all I saw—there was tubercular deposit which would account for a great deal of the emaciation—the distention of the bladder would not have any bad effect, that might be temporary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Bronchitis under favourable circumstances is often fatal to children and old people, more so than to people in middle life—it would be objectionable to give heavy food to a child 11 months old suffering from bronchitis; it is objectionable at all times to an infant, but I say it should have beef-tea—the emaciation of the child was not traceable to bronchitis per se; tubercles had appeared on the lungs, which were the cause of the bronchitis; the enlargement of the mesenteric glands was the cause of the bronchitis, and that arises frequently when children are brought up by hand—tubercular disease, mesenteric disease, and bronchitis may all exist in a child carefully tended—I should not expect the child to be emaciated to the extent this child was, although it had bronchitis on May 18th, extending to July 5th.

               <p>- . Q. Boy, you live with that gentleman - A. Yes. I saw the prisoner put his hand in the skin and take out a handful of silver filings, and put it in his left hand breeches pocket. I informed my master.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

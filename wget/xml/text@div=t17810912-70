            . She directed me to his mother's house: she said her name was Donne. I went to the house she had directed me to. Mrs. Donne came to the door. I asked her some questions. She said she did not live there, but lived two doors farther. I went there, and asked whether Mrs. Donne lived there. A woman came out, and said, No; she lived up those steps; directing me to the place I had seen her at before. I went back, and found the door was fast. I knocked, and told them, if they did not open the door, I would break it open. She made a very impudent answer. The prisoner hearing me so positive, got up, and opened the door. I said, I think you are the lad I want. He said, I heard of this last night: by which I suppose he meant the business I came upon. The prisoner desired me to stop till his mother fetched something to drink. I did so. I then sent for the prosecutrix. She came up into the room, and identified the person of the prisoner. I took him to the watch-house, and put him into the cage. The prisoner's father-in-law, who was in the watch-house, went up to the cage. I bid him come down. Then I shut the door, and took the prisoner out of the cage, and brought him into the watch-house. He put his hand in his fob, and pulled out two sixpences, a farthing, and three halfpence. I asked, Is this all? He said, Yes. I said, I shall search you farther. I put my hand into his fob, and pulled out a bit of a ring, and said, How came you by this? He said, at first, I do not know: at last, he said, she (meaning Mrs. Bockey) gave it me last night. I searched farther. I could not find any thing. At last, I searched his shirt-collar, and behind I thought I felt some money. The prisoner then offered to fight. I desired my partner to take the thing off his neck. He did. It was a handkerchief. He took it off, and took out two half-crowns and 5 s. 6 d. and gave it into my hand. I went to the prosecutrix, and asked what she had lost. She said, 29 or 30 s. in silver and halfpence, and a bit of a broken gold ring; that she could swear to a bad shilling and a bad sixpence. I asked what sort of a ring it was: she said it had a large red stone, and two small ones. She picked a bad shilling and sixpence out of the other money. I went up to see if her room-door was broke open: I found the bolt and the lock bent double.</p>

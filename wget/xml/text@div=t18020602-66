            : Last Saturday night was three weeks, between twelve and one in the morning, the prisoner followed me down Newgate-street, across the Old-Bailey, and down Fleet-lane; at the bottom of Fleet-lane he asked me to treat him; I said I had no objection; upon that I went in and asked for a glass of gin; the prisoner said he must have a glass of Holland's, which he had; then he followed me out again, and asked me if I would give him the price of a pot of beer; I told him I could not afford it; he followed me up Fleet-lane again, put his arm round my neck, and said, I could if I liked; I told him, no, I could not afford it; he then gave me a blow on my shoulder, and I was so frightened, that I sell down, and saw no more of the prisoner that I can remember.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not take any thing from you? - A. Yes, he took the bag of halfpence from me; there was five shillings and a penny in halfpence and penny-pieces; he saw me take some halfpence out of my bag in the wine-vaults.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the bag taken from you? - A. When he knocked me down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it in his hand? - A. Yes, he took it out of my left hand: I am generally paid in halfpence, and they were in a bag I made on purpose to bring them home in; I screamed out, and he was taken immediately; I saw the prisoner again on Monday, before the Alderman.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live? - A. At No. 24, Seacoal-lane; the patrol came to me, and asked me to go and see if it was my bag and money; I saw the bag, which I made myself, but no money was in it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. This was an aukward time of night for a woman to be out? - A. It was late, but it was past ten before I was paid, and I had to go to several places to get a few things; I stopped and supped in Whitecross-street, where I had a pint of beer, but no gin.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner? - A. I never saw the man before in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. The man was quite a stranger, and you treated him with a glass of gin; did you tell your husband that? - A. No, my husband is out of town.</p>
               <p>Q. When the cat's away the mice will play, I have heard; what made you treat him? - A. I had the halfpence, and I gave it him out of fear, because he kept following me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell the person who keeps the wine-vaults, how much you were frightened at this naughty man? - 
               <persName id="t18020602-66-person518">A. </persName>
            No.</p>
               <p>Q. Or the watchman? - A. No, I had no apprehension; I did not think he was going to do me any harm; I gave it him out of fear and good nature.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he take the bag of halfpence? - A. In Fleet-lane, just beyond Hill's wine-vaults; he did not hurt me.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not the gin that made you fall, was it? - A. I don't think it could take any effect on me in so short a time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you feel him take the halfpence from you? - A. Yes, I did, and held the bag.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to him? - A. No, I did not; he took it by main force.</p>
               <p>Q. You know that main force, fear, and fright,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180206020029"></xptr>is necessary to constitute a highway robbery? - A. I have spoke nothing but the truth.</p>
               <p>
            
                  <persName id="t18020602-66-person519">Q. </persName>
            Have not the officer told you, that fear and fright is necessary to make it a highway robbery? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Have they told you of the reward of forty pounds? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Has not any body told you of a reward of forty pounds if you convict? - A. I am told I am to tell nothing but the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know there is forty pounds reward? - A. I don't understand the reward; no reward I want to have.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not been told so? - A. No, I have not asked about it.</p>
               <p>Q. I caution you to be careful what you say? - A. What I have said I will say again.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that you never heard from the officers, there was a reward of forty pounds? - A. They never said any thing to me about a reward.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never heard any body say it? - A. No, I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you never heard there was a reward; do you mean to swear that? - A. I don't know any thing about it.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you again, do you mean to swear that when you came into Court, you did not know of a reward? - A. I know the consequence is this, it is a very critical point; what I have said is nothing but the truth; I have said the same as I said before; I cannot say any more.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you never heard, before you came here, that there was a reward of forty pounds for a highway robbery? - A. No, I have not; I was told to speak the truth, and so I have.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Has any body told you there is a reward; say yes or no; you shall answer it? - A. I will answer it so far as this; they said there was a reward; I have told the truth, and nothing but the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. The question is, whether any body told you there is a reward? - A. I want no reward.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been told there is a reward or not? - A. All I can say is, it is a highway robbery, and that I had a right to come to the laws of my country.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been told by any body, that there is a reward for convicting a man of a highway robbery? - A. They did say there was a reward certainly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. You say the prisoner was a stranger to you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Has your husband come to town? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I should be glad to know whether you live separate from your husband? - A. I live with an uncle and aunt.</p>
               <p>Q. And all you have is your own property? - A. Yes; I am a spangle-maker, and lay out what I earn.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect, before the Alderman, asking any body, whether or not the prisoner was she person who had robbed you, for that you did not know him? - A. I say nothing but the truth, he is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not ask somebody? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say, which is the man that has robbed me? - A. There was no one asked me that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Your bag, whatever it contained, was taken from you before you got the blow? - A. No, it was not.</p>
               <p>Q. It might fall from you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You said you were not frightened or alarmed? - A. Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't mean to swear to the bag? - A. I have sworn to it, and must say the same again.</p>
               <p>Q. If you have sworn to that which is not true, you are not to swear to it again? - A. I have sworn to the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear to the bag? - A. I can; I made it out of a bit of cloth.</p>
               <p>Q. You would not give a penny for it? - A. It was worth something to me for the use I made of it.</p>

             sworn. - I am a patrol belonging to St. Sepulchre's: On the 9th of May, at one o'clock in the morning, being at the corner of Bear-alley, Fleet-market, I heard a rattle spring, and went to it; and the watchman told me a man had escaped, and described him to me; I went into the Old-Bailey, and, at the corner of Green-harbour-court, I saw the prisoner come out with a small bag in his left hand; I said to him, its a late hour, but in your dress I suppose you have been barbering; says he, no; he then endeavoured to secure the bag under his apron; I then said, my friend, who are you, out at this late hour; he said, I am a porter just by; I said, you answer the description of a man who has ill used a poor woman in Fleet-lane, and taken from her a bag full of penny-pieces; if you have such a thing in your hand, I am a patrol, and shall take you into custody on suspicion; I then took hold of him by the left arm, and he struck me as hard as he could between the neck and shoulder with his right, and run to Giltspur-street; I recovered myself and followed him; I never lost sight of him; in Cock-lane I heard a scuffle, and somebody call out here he is; when I came up, the person who had the prisoner was just rising, and the prisoner was just above him,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180206020030"></xptr>offering to strike him; I caught hold of him, and held him; when we had lodged him in the Compter, I went to No. 24 Seacoal-lane, and found Mrs. Hayward, who claimed the bag.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. The lady and the prisoner both lived in Seacoal-lane? - A. I don't know, they were both strangers to me; I did not know he lived there till this day; coming along she told me did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not see that woman on Sunday last? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you never see her from the time you apprehended the man? - A. I saw her when we came to find the bill, but never before or since.</p>
               <p>
            
                  <persName id="t18020602-66-person521">Q. </persName>
            Have you never seen her at your own house? - 
               <persName id="t18020602-66-person522">A. </persName>
            Never, or any other.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never been at her house? - A. No. further than calling at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen her at your own door? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you call at her house for? - A. To know whether she would come forward to give evidence.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew she was bound over, and must attend? - 
               <persName id="t18020602-66-person523">A. </persName>
            Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no conversation with her, upon your oath? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell her there was a reward of forty pounds? - 
               <persName id="t18020602-66-person524">A. </persName>
            Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Has any of your brother officers? - A. Not to my knowledge; what they have told her I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you or not know there is a reward of forty pounds for a highway robbery? - A. Yes, I do know it, but never expected this would come to that; I told the prosecutrix it wold not touch the man's life.</p>
               <p>Q. You never had any conversation with her on this subject? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you never desired her merely to tell the truth? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you must have had conversation with her; why did you admonish her to tell the truth; it implies a bad opinion of a person to say, take care and tell the truth? - A. There can be nothing more plain than to tell the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. What state was she in on the night of the robbery? - A. Just as she is now.</p>
               <p>
            
                  <persName id="t18020602-66-person525">Q. </persName>

               <p>Q. Have you and she been drinking any thing to day? - A. Yes, a glass of gin.</p>
               <p>Q. A good many, perhaps? - A. No, only one glass.</p>
               <p>- ROSE sworn. - I am a china-man: On the 9th of May, between one and two in the morning, I was in Red-lion-court, Cock-lane, and heard the cry of stop thief; I went to the end, and saw the prisoner running down Cock-lane; I overtook him and collared him; a scuffle ensued, and we sell twice; he got from me, and run down the lane again; I overtook him a second time, and we had another scuffle, and we were up and down several times; I heard the watchman and patrol coming, and I called out here he is; they secured him, and I took the lantern to look for my hat, which I found, and a bag of halfpence laying by it; I saw the prisoner drop something, but don't know what.</p>

               <p>- VIOLS sworn. - I am a watchman, and was on duty by St. Sepulchre's Church: On Saturday night, I heard Challis say to the prisoner, I am a patrol, and shall take you; then I heard a scuffle, and the prisoner run away; we pursued him down Cock-lane, and Mr. Rose stopped him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Did you know whether the prosecutrix and prisoner were acquainted? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know he lives in Scacoal-lane? - A. I have heard say he lived a fortnight there.</p>

               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>KITTY M'DONALD sworn. - Examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Do you know the prisoner? - A. Yes, but don't know where he lives: On Saturday, the 8th of May, my husband, who is a ballast-heaver on the river, gave me orders to pay the prisoner five shillings, who worked with him, which I did in copper, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, in King-street, Wapping; and he carried it away in a canvas bag, which I took off my side, and gave to him.</p>

            Where was this bag? - A. At my side; I carry thread, and sometimes pieces and my money in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it by mere chance you carried the bag? - A. No, I always carry it at my side like every woman else; they call it a trash-bag in Ireland.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you this bag about you? - A. It is better than three-quarters of a year since I made it myself in England; but I put no mark on it.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it made of? - 
               <persName id="t18020602-66-person527">A. </persName>
            Canvas; there was a white running-string at the top of it.</p>

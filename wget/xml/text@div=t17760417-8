               <p>I saw Reynolds running after the prisoner, and I saw the prisoner drop a bundle; we secured the prisoner; then I went and took up the bundle and the leg of pork, we brought the bundle into the house; we took it in to take an inventory of the things.</p>
               <p>The bundle was taken the next day to the justice's; we staid there some time, then it was delivered back to Reynolds.</p>
               <p>The witness read the inventory, containing all the wearing apparel and linen mentioned in the indictment.</p>
               <p>REYNOLDS. This is the bundle (producing it) I looked it over when I brought it from the justice's, and am satisfied it contains the same things now as when it was first brought into the house.</p>

               <p>I am wife to the prosecutor: I can swear to all the things; they were all missing out of the drawers that night; I locked my drawers at two in the afternoon when I went out; they were then safe; they were gone when I came home.</p>

            . I was coming Home, and I saw the Prisoner with two Hand-saws coming out of my Shop door; I pursued him, and cried out stop Thief, and he dropped them about three Doors from my own House. This was the 26th of April, it is mentioned the 27th, between 12 and 1 at Noon, he took them from a Room behind the Shop; I laid them there, because I lost three out of the Shop about two Weeks before; I followed him and cried out stop Thief, and he dropped them three Doors beyond my Shop. I left the Saws in the Street, and I took him when he had run about an hundred Yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he drop them?</p>
               <p>Hunter. In Westharding-street , I saw the Saws under his Coat , and here is a Witness that saw him besides ; I did not lose Sight of him, and I knew him by haunting the Shop the Night before. I live in Westharding-street , in the Parish of St. Brides .</p>

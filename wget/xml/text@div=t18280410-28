I am the prosecutor's son, and know this gelding - it was kept in the stables at Hanwell; I saw it safe on Friday night, the 22d, about half-past seven o'clock: I drove it down in the coach that night - I went on to Uxbridge, but left the gelding at the King's Arms, public-house, at Hanwell - it was missed afterwards, and I found it at Gibb's on the Tuesday following, and knew it to be the same.</p>

            . I am an ostler, and had the care of Mr. Tollitt's horses. On Friday night, the 22d of February, I left this gelding in the stable, at twenty minutes to ten o'clock, with other horses - it was tied up with a halter in the usual way; I locked the stable door - there were six horses there in all; I went there again about half-past five o'clock in the morning, found the door open, and this gelding gone - there are two doors to the stable; one was bolted inside, and the other locked - the one which I had bolted inside was wide open; there is a window with a slide to it, which was not fastened - a person could get through the window, open the door, and lead the horse out; I have seen it since - it is in my care; the prisoner is quite a stranger to me.</p>

            . I keep the Angel public-house, at Remneham, in Berkshire - it is near Henley, and twenty-two miles from Uxbridge; this gelding was found at my father's, who keeps the Two Brewers, public-house, at Remneham; the prisoner brought the gelding to my father's on Saturday evening, the 23d of February, about six o'clock; I saw him come to the house - it had a regular bridle and saddle on it; I saw my father take the horse<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182804100031"></xptr>from him, but did not hear what he said; he staid there till Tuesday morning, when he was taken away - I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell why he staid so long at your father's house? A. Yes; he said he was sent there with the horse by his master, who was a horse-dealer at Oxford, and he was to wait there till his master came on the Sunday, to go to Abingdon fair; he said his master was to come about the middle of the day on Sunday; he stated this on Sunday morning, that he expected his master that day, and that his master was going to Abingdon fair; that his master was a horse-dealer, and said he lived with Mr. Crab, of Oxford. I heard him, on the Sunday morning, offer a young man, named Nelson, the horse to ride out; he said he had got a horse which Nelson might ride out; this was between nine and ten o'clock, when he was drinking with Nelson and another young man - he said he might ride him out in the afternoon if he chose; I then suspected there was something wrong, and told my father not to let him get the horse out of the stable; I went over to my father's again in the evening, and the prisoner went and helped to take a horse out of a gig, and put it into the same stable as the horse in question was - nothing more happened that night: on Monday I got up, and went to my father's - the prisoner was not up; I went and informed the Magistrate, got a constable, and detained the prisoner and the horse; Joseph Tollitt and the ostler have both seen the same horse, and claimed it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going down to see Mr. Tollitt, as I was out of service; I stopped just by Hanwellgate, to see a man walking; a man came up and asked if I was out of place - I said Yes; he said if I would take a horse to Uxbridge he would pay me for it; I said I could not take it down for less than 30s., and he offered to pay me for it; I brought a horse for him to London, and next morning he gave me another horse, and told me it belonged to a Mr. Crab, of Oxford, and told me to take it there.</p>

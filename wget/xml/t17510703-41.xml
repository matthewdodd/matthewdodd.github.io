            . The prisoner (Carter) came to me and asked me if I would buy a watch, saying, he had found one; he asked 4 l. for it; then the other prisoner said he had found a snuff-box. The watch produced in court and deposed to by the prosecutor, saying, it was made for him by Mr. Fen in Newgate street.</p>
               <p>Collet and the snuff-box were not in court, but the prosecutor deposed he had seen the box, and deposed it was his.</p>
               <p>Mills, in his defence, acknowledged he and Carter were the two persons that assisted in carrying the prosecutor home, and that they had carried him to his house; going back he picked up the watch, and not far from the place where the gentleman fell he picked up the snuff-box near a post.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with Mr. William Thompson, a baker, in Great James-street, Lisson-grove. The prisoner was his journeyman for about seven months—on Wednesday morning I got up about half-past six o'clock—I had occasion to look under the weighing-machine, and found a sack warm—I opened it, and found a two-pound hot loaf—I laid it there again—after that I saw the prisoner place it at the bottom of the barrow, and place his other bread to serve his customers on the top of the barrow—next morning I saw another loaf there, and he again put it at the bottom of his barrow—he took the same quantity of other bread, which is fifty 4lb. loaves, the same as the day before—on Friday I got up at the same time, and saw another loaf placed in the same manner—I told my maiter of it then, and he told me to watch him more closely—on Saturday I got up at the same, time, and saw two 2lb. hot loaves in the same sack, in the same manner as before—I saw him take them and place them at the bottom of the barrow, as before, and place the other bread over them.</p>

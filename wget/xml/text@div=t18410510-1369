                  </hi>. I live in Penny-fields, Poplar. I was going to Poplar in an omnibus, on the 14th of April, with my father</p>

               <p>—a passenger got out at York-square, Commercial-road, and myself, my father, and the prisoner were left in the omnibus—I was at the head of the omnibus, and reclining, as if I was asleep—my father was on the op<lb></lb>posite side, close to the door—the whole length of the omnibus was be<lb></lb>tween us—the prisoner was on the same side with myself near the door—Is when the passenger got out, the prisoner moved along to sit close to me, he immediately put his hand on the bottom of my left-hand trowsers' pocket, moved it across nearly to the bottom of my right pocket, and kept moving it along my waistcoat for a few minutes, then left the pocket, and continued feeling at the top of my trowsers—I perceived his intention, and had my arms folded across my watch—I lifted the watch from the pocket by ray guard, and he took it—I took out my knife and cut the guard, and left the watch in his hand—he moved to the door, and told the conductor to stop—I seized him, and called to my father, "He has robbed me"—two officers came up, and I said, "It is in his right-hand pocket"—I felt, it was not there—I found it on the seat, near to his side, where he had put it.</p>

             sworn. - I was washing at Mrs. Pearson's house on the 25th of March; I had a lodging backwards; I came into the shop, and the prisoner was there; they were talking together something about leaving a jacket. Knowing she had not been well, I asked her if I should make her bed for her; she said, I might if I would; upon that I took a little table and chair that stood by the bed-side away, and the first thing I found was a pair of white pockets on the bed; they seemed very heavy; I took them up, and twisted the strings round, and put them upon the head of the bed; it was a small bureau bedstead, and pulled the clean clothes over the pockets; I had washed them the day before; I put the table and the chair in their places again by the bed-side; I stood a little, but as they were talking, I said, Mrs. Pearson, I will take the things that I have been washing, and carry in doors; she said very well; she asked me how long I should stop; I told her I should be back in the space of five minutes; I carried them in, and then I came into the shop again; I said, is the man gone; yes, said she; I said, Mrs. Pearson, are your pockets gone; she said, oh, d - n it, no. I threw them on the bed; I told her they were safe at the top of the bed; I went to look for them, and they were gone; she threatened to send me to jail, for I must have them.</p>
               <p>JOHN DIXON sworn. - Q.You are an officer? - A. Yes, belonging to Hatton-garden; in consequence of information, Chapman and I found all the property, except about four guineas, the next day after the robbery, at a house in Turnmill-street, No. 30, up two-pair-of-stairs, where the prisoner lodged; I found a silver watch, a pocketbook with the prosecutrix's name on it, two pair of silver-mounted spectacles, two guineas in gold, a watch and one seal to it, and here is the nutmeggrater (produces them); the pockets are not found; we found the property concealed under the mantleshelf; it was hollow, and the mantle-shelf was taken off, and then put over them again.</p>

I am a seaman, of the American ship <hi rend="italic">Eagle.</hi> On 19th June, at a little before 12 o'clock, I was walking in Neptune Street, St. George's, with two of my shipmates—I saw a crowd at the corner of St. George's Street and Neptune Street—they were quarrelling—they appeared to be foreigners—some of them were light, and some dark—I observed the prisoner in the crowd—I did not see any other one so dark as he was—I looked and listened for about two minutes—I then turned to go away with my shipmates—I said there was likely to be a <hi rend="italic">row</hi>—I walked two or three steps, and the prisoner rushed upon me, and stabbed me in the groin—I ran a few yards, and fell—the prisoner followed me up, and jumped upon me—I did not see anything in his hand when he came out of the crowd—I felt the blow—I became insensible, and when I recovered I found myself in the London Hospital.</p>

At a little after 12 o'clock at night, on 19th June, I saw the prisoner standing against the crowd in Neptune Street—I saw him take the knife from out of his belt, and wipe it between his fingers, and he rushed against the prosecutor, and pushed it into his groin—the prosecutor staggered two or three yards, and fell—the prisoner then rushed upon him, and jumped upon him—I saw all this—I was at a window on the first floor, about twelve yards off—the window was open—the gas light was at the corner—I am quite sure the prisoner is the man; I had served him two or three times in our house—the other men were dark, but not so dark as him; he was the blackest—he was not drunk—there were six persons in the crowd altogether</p>

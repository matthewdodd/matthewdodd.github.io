               <p>Court. Did she do it forcibly? - Yes, my Lord; I was sensible off it at the time, I lost a guinea and an half, and twelve shillings: I am sure the prisoner is the person, she gave it to the others, they ran away, and I secured her, the others then attempted to rescue her; there was a watchman in the box, I called to him, he said it was not in his district. She said I should be sent for a soldier, and that I had robbed her of a dollar and an half-crown piece, so we were both sent to prison. Next morning I was discharged.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He took me up a passage with intent to lay with me, and then said I robbed him, because I did not chuse to lay with him.</p>

               <p>I am constable of the night, I took charge of her, and she gave charge of him; I found no property on her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, I was going up Union-court, Holborn, he followed me, and asked to go with me, he took me up Ely-place, he did not like to be decent, and then said I robbed him; he used me extremely ill; there was nobody but us two. I have no witnesses.</p>

               <p>"say never a word, or I will blow your brains out;" that was all that passed.</p>
               <p>Was you frightened? - Yes, I was alarmed; I said nothing, that was the reason, I made no resistance.</p>
               <p>Did the other man do any thing? - He never spoke; he was with him, but he did nothing.</p>
               <p>What became of them after they had your cloak? - I walked on some bit, and did not look back, till I came to the Three-path-ways; the man that said, say not a word about it, was the man that robbed me, to the best of my knowledge; when I came to the Three-path-ways, I looked back, and saw the two men running; I walked on the length of a short field, the men were taken about an hour after they were out of my sight; they were stopped by the pawnbroker.</p>
               <p>Do you know either of them again? - One.</p>
               <p>Which of them? - This man in the light coloured clothes.</p>
               <p>What is his name? - Collins; I cannot be positive to the other; Collins is the man that took my cloak.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of that? - Positive; it was a bright day.</p>
               <p>How long was he with you? - I cannot tell, a minute, I suppose, not more.</p>
               <p>Had you an opportunity of observing him particularly? - Yes, I am quite clear he is the man; my cloak was found again, I heard of it on Sunday at the Justice's, which was the next day; I was informed if I went to Justice Smith's, I might see the prisoner and the cloak; I went and found both the prisoners in custody, and my cloak was there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did she ever see me before? - Never before I was robbed.</p>

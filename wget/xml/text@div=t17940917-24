On the 14th of August I was sitting at the door opposite my lodging, in Chandler's-street; the prisoner past a man who was just by me, and he thought she had some pots in her pocket, he stopped her, and called me to assist him, to take the pots from her, I held her petticoats while he took this quart pot; she had long pockets below her knees, and there was in it a quartern measure, cut with a knife, and the landlord and landlady desired I would take her into custody, because they knew her to be an old offender; and I secured her till the the watchman came and carried her to Mount-street watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the pot that day? - Mr. Wilson has had it in his possession; this is the pot, there are no marks on it, the gentlemen at Marlborough-street office gave it to Mr. Wilson, I put a mark on the pot as soon as I took it from the woman, I know it by the mark, and when I gave it to Mr. Wilson at the office I wrote my name on it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she give you any account of it? - She did not say any thing, but she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170081"></xptr>found it, that was all they could get out of her.</p>

I told him yes, I had been in the habit of losing a great many pots, says be, if you go to Mount-street watch-house, I dare say you will see some there; accordingly I went, and I saw this pot there, it has my own name, and my own mark on the handle, three letters put on by the maker; it was delivered to me by the justice's order, and I have kept it intirely distinct from all other pots.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you kept that public house? - Nearly seven months.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever sold any pots? - No, never.</p>

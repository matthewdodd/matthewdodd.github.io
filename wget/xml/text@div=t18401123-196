                  </hi>. I drive a wagon from Cambridge. On the 18th of November I came to London—I went home with the porter—the prisoner was there, and I went home with her to sleep—I had a sovereign and a half in one purse, in my watch-pocket—what silver I had in my other purse, I could not tell—I gave her 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—we both got up the next morning about seven o'clock—we went to a public-house with the porter, and had something to drink—I was telling the porter that the prisoner had got up in the night, but whether she took any money, I could not tell—he said, "You should mind that, look and see"—I then missed the sovereign and a half—I said to the prisoner, "You have taken a sovereign and a half"—she denied it—I said I would have her locked up—she then said she took 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out, but she would not own to the sovereign and a half—when she was at Worship-street, I said to her, "You must be a silly girl not to give me the money"—she then owned that she had had it, but I had said if she would give me the money, I would not appear against her—I am sure the money was safe in my watch pocket, when I went to bed.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">police-constable H</hi> 103.) On the 19th of November I was on duty at Spitalfields station, the prosecutor came to make his complaint, and the prisoner followed him to the station—he accused her of this—she said, "Lord love your soul, don't lock me up, I only took 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—when I was going to lock her up, she said, "Tell him, if you don't lock me up, I will give it him"—I said, "How can you give it him if you did not take it?"—she then said she did not take it.</p>

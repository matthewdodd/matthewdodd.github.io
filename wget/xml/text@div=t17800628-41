               <p>What number do you suppose the mob consisted of? - There were one or two hundred of them, I imagine. Some were armed with cutlasses and some with bludgeons. When first they came to my house three or four of us served them with liquor. They then called for my books; I laid them down before them. They examined the books and said I was not a Papist. After they had examined the books and drank what they chose, they went out of the tap-room; they gave me three cheers, and cried out, No Popery. They went out of the house and shock hands with me as they went. When they had got thirty or forty yards from the house a woman, who lives opposite to me, called out to them, and said I was a Papist and my house ought to come down.</p>
               <p>What was the person's name who said that? - Clarke; she beckoned to the mob, and her husband called them back; then they came back to my house and pulled it down.</p>
               <p>Look at the prisoner, was he there? - Not at that time.</p>
               <p>When did you first see him? - About half an hour or between that and three quarters of an hour after they came the second time, they began to break down with bludgeons all the house; they pulled all the front of the house and every bit of the bar down; they did not leave one of the boxes in the tap-room. They took all the furniture up into Old-street, and burnt it; they pulled almost all the wainscoting down which was in the one-pair-of-stairs.</p>
               <p>Where did you see the prisoner when you first saw him? - At the bar, pulling part of the wainscoting down.</p>
               <p>Had he any thing in his hand? - He had no weapon, he was pulling it down with his hand.</p>
               <p>How long did the prisoner stay in the house? - I saw him in the house for the space of half an hour or three quarters of an hour.</p>
               <p>What was he doing all that time? - He was drinking part of the time, and at the bar the remaining part.</p>
               <p>In what condition was your house when the mob first came to it? - In full repair.</p>
               <p>What state is it in now? - All the front, the boxes, and most part of the stairs are pulled down. The roof was pulled down.</p>
               <p>Do I understand you that you are sure that the prisoner was not there at first or that you did not see him at first? - I did not see him when the mob first came.</p>
               <p>Are you sure he is the man? - I am sure that he is the man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Whether he can take his oath that I was in the bar drinking the liquor?</p>
               <p>Murphy. He was outside the bar, pulling it down with his hands and I saw him drinking both beer and gin.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>You knew him before? - I had seen him.</p>
               <p>Do you know whose servant he is? - Mr. Calvert's servant.</p>
               <p>I believe there were casks behind the bar? - There were.</p>
               <p>In order to remove those casks was it not necessary that the bar should be pulled down? - No, there is a door on purpose to take the casks out at.</p>
               <p>But were they not fixed? - Yes, but they could be removed without. If the bar must be pulled down to take them out, how were they to be put in.</p>
               <p>Whether persons endeavouring in a great hurry to take away these casks might not pull the bar down? - They had no manner of occasion to break the bar down unless they did it wilfully.</p>
               <p>Jury. What was the use of these casks? - They were gin casks, the draw-pipes<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178006280108"></xptr> came down from the top of the bar, and let the gin down to serve it.</p>
               <p>How much might these casks hold? - Thirty or thirty-two gallons each.</p>
               <p>They were not usually fastened? - No, only fixed upon the shelf.</p>
               <p>Do you know the character of the prisoner? - I never heard any thing against his character in my life. I have seen him once or twice before, I believe.</p>
               <p>Jury. How came you to remark this man in particular? - Because he was one of my own brewer's men, who served me with beer.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Crown. Did he pretend to you that he came there for the purpose of taking away these casks to save them? - No, he did not pretend it to me.</p>
               <p>Had he brought any cart or any thing to carry them away in? - No.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner. Who serves you with spirits? - Mr. Child, in Old-street.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I will say no more than the truth; I would say that if I was going to be hanged. I went through Crown-court into Red-cross-street, there I saw a great number of people standing together. I said, what is the matter? I saw a great heap of wood laid; I asked where it came from? they said the Sun in Golden-lane. I went up and found it to be Mr. Murphy's house. I never knew he kept the Sun, nor was I ever in the house in my life. I did not stay there above three or four minutes; I was on the other side of the way; I never was near the house; and these words I would say if I was going to be hanged this moment, I never was near the bar.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner use to come to serve your house with beer? - I do not know; Mr. Calvert used to serve my house with beer.</p>
               <p>If you did not see him there, how came you to know him? - He is a very remarkable man; I have seen him in Mr. Calvert's yard once or twice when I have been there.</p>

               <p>I have known the prisoner near two years. He has always appeared to us about the house to be a very sober industrious man. If he was not an industrious, sober man he would not have been in the place he is in, for there is great trust and care put in him. During the whole time he has belonged to the brewhouse I never observed him in liquor, nor neglect his business in the least. There are four or five days each week when he is obliged to be up from two or three or four o'clock in the morning till five at night.</p>
               <p>Jury. Whether the prisoner knew Murphy's was a house you served? - I do not apprehend that he did, because he has no manner of connexion with the out-houses.</p>

I turned round, and struck a man's arm on my watch - the watch dropped, the chain broke, I snatched at the watch to get it off the ground - the prisoner and the others snatched at it also. I can swear he was one of them - he snatched it off the ground. I immediately caught hold of him, and called out for help - he was too strong for me, got off before any one came, and ran up a narrow street, down Sycamore-street, into Old-street, across Goswell-street, into Wilderness-row, where he was stopped. I never lost sight of him from the time he got from me till he was taken by Fisher. Next morning, about five o'clock, I went to the Charterhouse-gardens, with Hone and Fisher, and found the watch in the gardens, the Wilderness-row side. I had seen the prisoner opposite that place. I received the push at the time the watch was taken.</p>

            . I was passing along Goswell-street, heard the cry of Stop thief! and saw the prisoner running as fast as he could, without his hat, from Old-street-road, down Wilderness-row; I pursued, and just as I was in the act of taking him I saw him throw the watch over the wall into the Charterhouse-gardens - I saw plainly it was a watch. I secured him. Next morning, between four and five o'clock, I went with the prosecutor and constable and found it there, within four yards of the wall. The prosecutor claimed it.</p>

On Sunday morning, the 20th of May, between two and three o'clock, I was alarmed by a loud knocking at my street-door; it was quite dark - I ran to the front window, opened it, then went down stairs, and let in two officers and two watchman - I gave them a light - I went up, to put on my cloak, and on coming down I found the prisoner in their custody in the ground floor front room - I knew him before very well; he had been apprentice to a hair-manufacturer, and enlisted in the East India Company's service - I said "How could you think of robbing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182705310054"></xptr>me, who have been so great a benefactor to you?" he said,"I met a person in Covent-garden, who advised me if I had a friend to rob him" - I said, "Who is that person?" he answered, "A thief."</p>

            . I am a watchman. On Sunday morning, the 20th of May, between two and three o'clock, I was on duty in Portland-road, and heard some glass break - I went and climbed up on some rails, and saw a man trying to wrench Mr. Scott's back-door open - the fan-light was broken - I fetched three watchmen, and placed them there, while I ran round with another watchman to the front door, and alarmed Mr. Scott; two officers came by - Mr. Scott came down and let us in; he gave us a light; the officers found the prisoner in the garden, and brought him into the back room.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. I heard a knocking at this door, and went up - Mr. Scott let us in - I entered first, and proceeded backwards, and while we unlocked the inner door, which is about a yard from the back door, I saw the prisoner going out at the back door, which was open; he was within the house in the passage; I seized him about a yard from the door, and said, "Halloo my friend, I want a word with you" - he had a knife in one hand, and a chisel in the other; his coat was off, and I found it laying by the garden door; the fan-light was broken; it was a large square glass, a man could have got through there - I searched him, and found a pair of gloves, a handkerchief, and two skeius of silk; the handkerchief was wrapped round his wrist, which was cut, and there was blood on the fan-light.</p>

            . I was with Eckett, but did not see the prisoner till he got into the garden; a square was broken in the fan-light, and a whole square taken out, and laid down very carefully - I found near the inner door in the passage, a hammer; the lock of the inner door had been attempted to be wrenched off; the back door, which was open, must have been unbolted by somebody inside; he must have got through the fan-light to have done it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Great distress drove me to it.</p>

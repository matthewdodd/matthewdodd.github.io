                  </hi>. I am a porter, at 7, Gilbert Place, Spa Road, Bermondsey—on 23rd January, at 7 o'clock in the morning, I was passing down Waterloo Road; when I gut to the corner of Webber Row, I was struck in the mouth, had two teeth knocked out of my head, and was rubbed of my watch; it was in my waistcoat pocket, attached to a chain—I believe there were five or six in the gang that came and surrounded me—I recognise Knight as one of them, and I believe the other two are about the same height as the others; I believe they are all connected with one gang; I can't speak positively to them; I caught a slight glimpse of Knight's face, by the light from a fish shop, but nut sufficient to swear to him—I next saw him on the 28th, at the Tower Street police-station, and identified him out of eight or ten others—I have not gut my watch back.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a box-maker, and live in Legrand Place, Waterloo Road—on the morning of 23rd January, I was passing down Waterloo Road; when I got within a few feet of Webber Row, I saw seven or eight men talking in the road; I thought they were shopmates wrangling, I halted about a minute and heard a person exclaim "Let go, let go," and one of them drew his fist and hit the man in the neck, and another hit him in the side, and the prosecutor came staggering across to me—I said "What is the matter?—he said, "You see how they have served me, they have robbed me of my watch"—the three prisoners turned down Webber Row, and turn<lb></lb>ing round there are two fish shops lighted up with gas, and the gas threw the light on their features and I saw them by that; I am certain of all three—I don't know which it was that struck the prosecutor; that was done in the dark—there were six or seven persons surrounding the prosecutor, and I saw these three come out from the six or seven—I knew Ryan and Towasend by sight—I gave a description of them to the police.</p>

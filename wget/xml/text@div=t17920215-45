I carried him to the watch-house, and he gave charge; and the prosecutor began to cry like a child, because of losing his money and hat; the prisoner said to the prosecutor, when he came up to him, Is that your hat? No, says he, for you threw it to the other fellows: he said at the watch-house he could not tell whether it was four or five shillings exactly; the prisoner said he had no money about him; I did not search him, nor see him searched.</p>

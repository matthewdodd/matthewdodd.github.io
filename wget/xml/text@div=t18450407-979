                  </hi>. I live at Leytonstone—my house is on the high road from Stratford, to Woodford—at the back of the house is a meadow where I keep my sheep, and behind that is Hainault Forest—my garden wall abuts on a lane and on the high road, and my meadow on the forest—on the 9th of March I had five sheep in the meadow—in consequence of information I went there on the morning of the 12th, and there were only three sheep—I saw a gap in the fence which parts the meadow and field—in attempting to lift the sheep over, the wool had been torn—there</p>

               <p>the front of his trowsers had blood on them, and also behind, and there was blood on his shirt sleeves and wristbands—I asked how he accounted for the blood—he said the front might be from his nose bleeding—I said, "That don't account for the blood behind"—he said he could not account for that, but he believed that was from the stains of ochre—they appeared to me stains of blood—they were down from the joint of the legs—the blood appeared in the same way as T have seen on butchers' dresses.</p>

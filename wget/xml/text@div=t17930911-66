He said he had no objection to his own box, but his box was not at his lodgings, it was in a person's hands in Moorfields; I asked him how it came there, he said when he was in custody by the officers of Whitechapel for a child this woman swore to him, he was running off with his box, and seeing this person that he knew, he desired him to take it into his possession; I went with him to Moorfields with the officer, he did not know where the man lived that had the box, he said he had lived with Langford, a customer of ours, but he had left him. I desired he would leave me the key, and that he would go with the officer the while, he said he had not got the key, I said it is very odd, you should leave your box and key at a strange man's, I then sent him home, then I and the officer went to his apartments for to search this Curran's box, for she had her box, but before I went to Catharine wheel-alley I went to Mr. Windsor's, the pawnbroker's, and while I was there, in comes the woman prisoner at the bar, with two blankets to pawn; I had been with Curran that morning to see what I could find out, and whether this letter came from her; the young man came out of the warehouse, and said here is the woman that has pawned these cotton counterpanes in the shop now; she was in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Was what the pawnbroker said, said in her presence? - Yes, it was by Mr. Windsor's man, I don't know his name; she was rather alarmed at seeing me, I asked her how she came by them blankets, particularly one which I owned? she said she bought it, I asked her what she gave for it? she could not tell me that, at last she said it was given to her, she said one Mrs. Cavenor had given it her, I asked her where that woman lived? she said she kept a public house in Whitechapel; I had this woman sent for, and when she came she denied it, and the prisoner said nothing, the woman upbraided her as a very wicked woman; now says I, tell me some other story, this will not do, she then said that she bought it, but she would not tell me where, nor she could not tell me what she gave for it; I then went up to her apartments with her and the officer, and searched her box, but did not find any thing in it, there was another box under it, but that I could not open because I had not the key, and she said Maxey had it, I brought her back to the pawnbroker's, and after taking her before a magistrate she owned to pawning a blanket and a cotton counterpane at another place, then I came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110116"></xptr>back from her apartment to Maxey and asked him for the key of that box, for I thought I should find it out; he said he had no key; I said you have two keys. I collared him and endeavoured to get it out of his pocket, he had got a coarse apron on, he took every thing out of his pocket and rushed them into his breeches, and endeavoured to get out of my possession; Mr. Windsor's man assisted me, and I was obliged to take up the poker and threaten to knock him down if he did not deliver the key, at last I sent for a warrant, and we took the key by force; the first thing we did we went to the apartment and opened the box; the first thing we found was a pair of buckles of mine, and several small pen knives which I will not swear to, though I know them to be mine; from there I went to Smock-alley, Widegate-street, leading from Bishopsgate-street to Spitalfields, and there we found another box, the man brought a box on his head to Mr. Windsor's; I took the buckles, they are here, they are mine, we then took him to another pawnbroker; before I found it out in my own house I persuaded him very much to confess, but I told him if I found it out of my own accord I would prosecute him; there was three cotton counterpanes which I can only swear to the manufacturer's mark, because they have had the policy to take off our paper which had the shop mark on.</p>

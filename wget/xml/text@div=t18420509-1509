                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the 11th of April, be<lb></lb>tween nine and ten o'clock in the evening, I was in Tottenham-court-road—I saw the two prisoners, who I knew before, standing at Mr. Johnson's shop window—I saw Painter take four boots, which were hanging just outside the shop-door, and hand them to Thompson, who was standing close to him—he put two of them in each pocket—they were going away when I went up and laid hold of them—they struggled to get away—Thompson took the boots out of his pocket and threw them on the ground—I called for assistance—a young man came, and we took them into the shop with the boots.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Painter's Defence.</hi> I was passing up Tottenham-court-road on my road to Kentish Town. I stopped at the shop about a minute and a half. The man came up, and dragged us into the shop, what for I do not know. He pulled three boots out of Thompson's pocket. I was never in the shop be<lb></lb>fore. I have been out of work.</p>

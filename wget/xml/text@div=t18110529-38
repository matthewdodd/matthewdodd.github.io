            . I am a watchman. On the 27th of April between twelve and one o'clock, I was walking up this passage, I heard an alarm of stop thief, I turned back and met a person at the corner of the passage, I ran against him and he against me. I stopped the prisoner, he scrambled away from me and was taken about thirty yards from me, the prisoner dropped these articles, I picked them up, two gowns, a bonnet, and a petticoat, and some other articles, the prisoner was then taken to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH COOPER. I walked into the Almonry between the hours of twelve and one, I heard a noise at No. 7 in the Almonry, I went there and found the prisoner in custody, and the property was in the room along with him at the prosecutrix's house, I then took him, in company with the watchman, to the watch-house. I searched him, and found two one-pound notes in his pockets which he dropped on the floor, I afterwards took him to Tothil-fields Bridewell. This key dropped out of his pocket on the floor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find what lock that key belonged to. - A. No, I went back to the house afterwards, and found the staple lying where it had been drawn off, it was laying outside of the door in the passage. On looking further in the room, I found this iron crow on the bed, covered over with a corner of the rug that laid on the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the night was this. - A. Between the hours of twelve and one. The prisoner said after he was in custody a week or so that he should not have done it if he had not been drunk.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to say that. - A. I do not know, I mentioned to him, that it was a bad thing he should do so, he said he should not have done it if he had not been drunk.</p>

            . I live in the Almonry Westminster, next door to Mrs. Jones. I was standing at my door about half past twelve o'clock, I heard Mrs. Jones cry out stop thief, and the prisoner ran out of Mrs. Jones's door, the prisoner running by hit me on the arm as I stood at the door, he ran across the road, and dropped the property by Mr. Wright's passage.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him drop it. - A. Yes, he had it under his great coat, he ran off towards the other part of the Almonry, I was present when he was secured, I caught him by the coat. These are the things that were picked up.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. These gowns are mine, the bonnet and the habit shirt are mine, they are the property of my husband, his name is Durick Jones.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, were these in the house before you went out. - A Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see them. - A. When I was in the room about eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. The house was broken open by drawing a staple was it not. - A. Yes, I went out about eleven o'clock, and returned about half past twelve.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, at the time I am charged with committing the robbery, I was in a state of inebriety, and how I came in the house I cannot say, all the recollection that I have of the transaction is being taken to the watch-house, and on the following day when I was at Tothill-fields, the woman who owned the property agreed to make up the matter provided I would make up one pound, I had not the money about me, but an acquaintance of mine offered to pay the sum, with which she was perfectly satisfied, and which was paid her by Mrs. Field. Under these circumstances I trust the court will take it into consideration, I have never been in a court of justice before in my life, and I have always conducted myself to the satisfaction of my employers, and can have a character from them all.</p>

On the day before I received a letter from Mr. Abbott, I opened it in the prisoner's presence, it contained a 20 l. note; she was sitting by my side at needle-work; the note fell down by the side of the fire, and she picked it up; and gave it me; I said</p>
               <p>"Mary there is a 20 l. note, pick it up;" this was about half-past twelve; I gave the note to Mr. Revett, when he came home after candle-light, I gave it him in the letter; he went out to get it changed but could not; he then put it in the cash-box, and locked it; he took the box up stairs, when we went to bed, and put it on the drawers in our bedroom. On Sunday about half-past one, I went to the cash-box; my husband was not at home; I had taken the key out of his pocket in the morning, and placed it in the looking-glass drawer which was locked; this was between eight and nine o'clock in the morning; I opened it about half-past one, and took out 6 s. in silver; I did not then see the 20 l. note; I did not look for it; I only went to the silver drawer; I immediately locked the cash-box, and placed it between the bed and the mattress; I am confident that I locked the box; I carried it by the handle, and if it had not been locked it would have opened in my hand; I was very particular in locking it; I left home a few minutes after this, and went to where my husband was; I came home with him in a coach about nine o'clock; we were not sent for; I found several people round the fore garden gate, and there was an alarm of fire; I found several people up stairs; but my conversation was directed to the prisoner, whom I found sitting in the parlour, by the door; Mr. Balls was up stairs; I asked the prisoner how the fire came, she said, she did not know; I repeatedly asked her, and received the same answer; she did not move from her seat, but appeared quite unconcerned; Mr. Revett went up stairs; I saw the bed-room before he came down, and I saw the bed-hangings were burnt, and the bed was on fire then; I had given the prisoner leave to go to chapel that evening; I went to Mrs. Ball's house, which is five minutes walk, and returned shortly; Mr. Revett then produced the cash-box, and the 20 l. note was missing, he said,</p>
               <p>"Mary, you know something of this," she denied it; he said,</p>
               <p>"There should be a 20 l. note in this cash-box," I had replaced the key in the dressing-glass drawer, it was not produced at this time; Mr. Revett said, it would be better to have every person in the place searched before they left, which was done by the parish constable; the prisoner was still sitting in the same place all the time; till the officer desired her to go into the other room to be searched. The note was not found, she fainted away, and was afterwards searched; the outside of the box was burnt, a sovereign which I had left in it, and some silver was still there; the prisoner had frequently seen me take money out of the box - I am sure I did not leave it in the state it was found.</p>

            . I came home with Mrs. Revett; I had put the 20 l. note in this cash-box, (producing it) under this bill of exchange, and placed the inner box, containing the silver and gold over it; when I came home at night I went up stairs, and perceived, on approaching the bedroom, that the curtains were on fire and nearly consumed, and immediately on my reaching the top of the stairs, Balls handed the cash-box to me; the bolt of the lock was shot, but the asp was not in it; the bed was partly burnt; the straw pallias appeared to have been set fire to in four places; the bed furniture was entirely consumed; the posts of the bedstead were partly burnt; but the sacking particularly, over a place where it appeared to me a fire had been kindled on the floor; a place in the floor and wainscoat were burnt; also the paper of the room, and the bed-board; that was all the damage. When I missed the 20 l. note I saw the prisoner sitting in the parlour, I said,</p>
               <p>"Mary, you know something of this," she said,</p>
               <p>"Indeed, Sir, I do not;" I then ordered a general search; I directed Williams to go to Ball, and search his lodging, as he had been at my house; he is a relation by marriage; I went with him; the note has not been found. When the prisoner was going to be searched she appeared agitated and fainted - immediately after the search she was taken to the watch-house.</p>

            . I went to Mr. Revett's house on this day; I got there at half-past four o'clock, before my husband; I found the prisoner alone; I went to enquire if her mistress was out, (I am Mr. Revett's aunt) and if she wished to go to chapel I was to keep house for her; she said, her mistress had given her leave to go out; Mr. Revett had asked us to come in the evening, and let her<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182204170036"></xptr>go to chapel; I returned home to tea, and came back to the house a little before six; the right hand parlour shutters were shut up, and one of the kitchens; she went to chapel as she said, and returned at a quarter-past eight o'clock. I was in the house the whole time, and in the left hand parlour the principal part of the time. When I first entered the house after she was gone I searched every room, it was about six o'clock, being alone I thought it proper; I saw nothing in disorder at all; I searched the bed-room, and looked under the bedstead, there was no sign of fire or any thing to occasion it; the bed curtains were neatly folded and laid upon the pillow; the bed was not turned down; I had no candle, it was not dark enough; when I came down, as the kitchen was shut up, and the cellar dark, I lighted a candle which was left on a table in the parlour, I lighted it at the parlour fire; I looked round in the cellar, kitchen, and closet, under the stairs, then returned to the parlour and put the candle out; I did not go into the bed-room with the candle; I saw nothing of the cash-box; there was no fire in the bed-room grate, nor in any room but one parlour and one kitchen; the prisoner returned at a quarter-past eight o'clock, I had lighted the candle then, and she took it from the parlour to go into the kitchen to light her kitchen candle, and pull off her things; she came up with my candle, I asked her if she had been to chapel, and if she was in time; she said Yes; I asked who preached, and what was the text; she said, she did not recollect it; Mr. Balls came at half-past eight, and sat with me; I then told the prisoner we would take some bread and cheese and porter for supper, and return, observing that I supposed Mr. Revett would not be offended; she said,</p>
               <p>"Oh, no!" and brought up the tray, and fetched some porter. We then thought it would be best for one of us to stop till Mr. Revett came home, and I left Mr. Balls there.</p>

            . I came in and had bread and cheese; my wife went home; the prisoner came into the parlour, took a candle and went out of the parlour, and shut the door, she staid out nearly ten minutes, and came again into the parlour, and set the candle on the side board; I do not know whether it was lighted; when she came in she sat down on a chair by the door; I never knew her do so before; I had not asked her to sit down; I said,</p>
               <p>"Mary, you had better come nearer the fire," and moved to let her; we talked for ten or fifteen minutes about Eagle-street chapel; I then smelt fire, and said,</p>
               <p>"Molly, I smell fire;" she said,</p>
               <p>"I have a time or two."</p>
               <p>Q. Once or twice you mean - A. Yes, I took the candle off the table and went up stairs; the smell increased, and when I got to the chamber-door, I saw the smoke coming from between the door and door post. I called out and said,</p>
               <p>"Mary, the bed is on fire," she was still sitting in the parlour. I came down to her, went to the front door and gave the alarm of fire; she still sat there and did not stir to give any alarm; she was crying and did not speak to me. I went over the way to Messrs. Brooks to give the alarm, and returned immediately; I took a candle and went down to get water; the fire was extinguished; Mr. Brooks, Ellen and Williams came into the house and assisted. The prisoner remained sitting in the parlour till Mr. Revett came home; Williams found the cash box and handed it to me; I gave it Mr. Revett in the same state as I received it, it was very hot; I went down with him; his account is true.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When you came down, having discovered the fire, you at once went to the door and gave an alarm - A. I did, I was gone a very short time leaving her alone in the house; she could have escaped if she choose, or while I was up stairs. She fainted when the constable ordered her into another room to be searched; it was not proposed for a woman to search her - the road is open to the house in front; there is a brick wall behind, seven feet high, a back door leads to the garden.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. After your wife left did any body come in - A. Nobody. I should think the place could not have been set fire to a quarter of an hour before I discovered it. I cannot say whether the bed was turned down or not, the back door was bolted; I saw the watchman open it to get at the water-butt.</p>
               <p>MRS. BALLS. I was alone in the house about two hours.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose that after you examined the room, if any body had set fire to the bed directly after, must you not have discovered it - A. Yes. The back door leading to the garden was bolted and barred, and the shutters also.</p>

            . I am Mr. Revett's servant. On the Saturday I had bought nine bundles of fire wood - I used a bundle and a half on Sunday morning, and left half a bundle in the dresser drawer, and put seven in the cupboard under the stairs, the prisoner was in the kitchen and knew this. After the alarm, next morning, I looked in the closet and found only three bundles; but next morning I found two more in a foul clothes basket, which stood in the same closet - I might have put them there myself; only two bundles were then missing. I know that the prisoner had a cambric muslin slip, which is a sort of petticoat with a body and short sleeves - I saw it on the floor of the bed-room, were we both slept, on Sunday morning; she had worn it on the Saturday - it was old but serviceable. On the Monday I saw part of it between the bed and mattress in our bed-room, and the other part I did not find. When I came home with my master and mistress, the prisoner was in the parlour; I asked her where the fire was, she said she did not know - I asked her three times, she said she did not know whether there had been any fire in the house or not. I asked why she did not get a light for the men who were going down stairs getting the water; she said nothing. After she was searched I asked her if she went any where besides to chapel; she said not in the evening, but she went in the morning to No. 11, Saffron-hill; I asked her again in the morning about the text, she said she could not remember the chapter or verse, but the words were,</p>
               <p>"Seek and ye shall find, knock, and the door of mercy shall be opened."</p>

            . I am a constable. I was passing, went into the house, and extinguished the fire. The bed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182204170037"></xptr>things were taken off, and under the wool mattrass I saw the tin cash-box; it was open ajar and very hot, I could scarcely hold it. I called for the master of the house; Mr. Balls represented himself as such, and I gave it him in the same state.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cabinet and portable-desk maker, and live in Jewin-street, Cripplegate. The prisoner had been my journeyman two or three months—he worked by the piece—I sent him home with some port<lb></lb>able-desks on Friday, the 24th of October, to Verriman and Co., St. Paul's Church-yard—he was to have brought me back 29<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he took part of them in the morning, and he remainder after dinner—I said, "Have you received any money on account?" he said, "No, none"—he went with the rest in the afternoon, and returned, and said they would look over them in the morning—I asked him next morning, (Saturday,) if he had received any money—he said "No"—I sent my son with him on Saturday</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183411240054"></xptr>
               <p>morning—he returned home, and said he was to go again in the evening, for the money—he did not go in the evening, and I sent my son, as he did not return to my employ, after dinner—he had given me no notice.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. DOANE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What day was this? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The 24th—he had taken goods there on the 20th, and brought the money for them—it was four dozen of portable-desks—he was to bring 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. On the 20th—they were sold at that price, and had no ink glasses in them—I received 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. For them—I gave him a memorandum how much money he was to bring me home—he paid that money to Mrs. Bath—there was no bill made out at all, of the desks sent to Verriman and Co., it was only a memorandum—I should have sent a printed bill, if I sent a bill, but I did not know whether they would keep all the desks—I had not seen Messrs. Verriman—I sent him to several places, to dispose of them—I sent him to sell them as well as he could—I say, "Take samples of such goods—you must not sell them for me under so much"—he gets an order for them, at a certain price, then comes to me and says, "I can only get so much—shall I take that for you?" and I tell him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he say that on the 24th? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, as they were ordered on the 20th; he took them on the 24th, at two separate loads—I had not set<lb></lb>tled with him for the previous load, before I sent him with the second—they were too heavy to take at once—I saw him on Saturday morning, after he had taken the last load, and sent my son with him to receive the money, and he absconded—Mrs. Bath saw him at twelve o'clock—I saw him on Sunday morning, and he said that on Saturday night he was in<lb></lb>toxicated in Smithfield, and robbed of the money—that was when he was apprehended.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you say you would send him to Botany Bay, let it cost what it would? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I do not recollect saying any thing of the kind—I do not think I should forget it if I had—I do not believe I did say it—I paid him wages by the piece—if I take a man off for any job, I pay him so much—I should have paid him by the day for this, but he absconded and pre<lb></lb>vented me.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On Saturday, he said he had been robbed of the money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not on Saturday, but when I apprehended him on Sunday morning—on Friday afternoon he said he had not received any money on account—he was not in partnership with me at all—none of the goods were his—I do not know whether he described the goods sold on the 20th, as mine, or his own—he went with samples of them first.</p>

My father sent me on Saturday morning with the prisoner, to received the money—I went with him to Verriman and Bromberg, St. Paul's Church-yard—he went into the counting-house, and told me it would be better for me to wait in the ware-house—he came out, and told me he had not received the money—he came home, and told my mother so also—he was to return in the afternoon after dinner, to go again, as he said, but he never came back—my father, in the evening, was anxious to know if he had received it, as he had not returned—I went to the house with the account.</p>

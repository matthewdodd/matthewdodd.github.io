            . On Monday night, the 10th of October, my cellar was fast at eleven o'clock my cellar window is under my bar window, at the front. I fastened the cellar window myself; I went down about eleven o'clock to see that every thing was fast; I saw every thing was fast at eleven o'clock, On the next morning, I went down into my cellar to get some liquors to put into my bar; I missed three casks, one of peppermint, another of shrub, and the other containing brandy bitters, but they were not all full; the shrub was two gallons, value twenty four shillings, the peppermint, thirty six shillings, the brandy bitters; half a guinea, and the casks, seven and three pence I had seen all this in my cellar the night before when I closed the cellar, and when I went into the cellar in the morning it was gone. I looked at the cellar window; the bolt of the cellar window had been wrenched off; I imagine by a crow; there was the impression of a crow. I did not see the crow, only the mark of a crow. or some other instrument. I heard no noise in the night. I have a witness here that did.</p>
               <p>MRS. WEBBERS. I live next door to Mr. Hearn. On the 10th of October in the morning, I heard a noise near my cellar window. I had some lodgers which I had tored to take their goods out, I was fearful it was them taking their goods out, it was not, because I found their goods in the room in the morning.</p>
               <p>JOHN GILLMORE. I am an officer. I went with Waller and Wetson to the lodging of the prisoner, on Friday the 14th of October, to the prisoners lodging in Vine Street, within two hundred yards of the prosecutors house. On searching the lodging's I found these small slaves, and two pieces of heading; the heads have got the prosecutor's name, written in chalk upon them. We found several hoops in the fire, and two pieces of heading, and we found more pieces of staves burning, and in the same room we found a bottle containing rather better than a quart of brandy bitters, in a stone bottle.</p>
               <p>Q. Nobody lays claim to that bottle, do they - A. No. Mr. Hearn was desirous of trying the bitters with those of his own. I gave Waller, the constable, the bitters to take to Mr. Hearn, for Mr. Hearn to compare it.</p>

            . I live at No. 6, Anderson's-walk, Vauxhall; I am a servant to Mr. Barnett, and sons, distillers. The staves produced by Gillmore, are part of Messrs. Barnett and sons casks.</p>

             the distillers man; they are equally a likewith mine, in every respect; they are the same in taste and smell; I really believe the bitters came out of my cask. I have not the least doubt it is the same as what I had in my cask.</p>

Gillmore found the head of this cask in the prisoner's room; this cask had peppermint in it; there is P M, denoting peppermint, that I wrote myself.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Had your name been writ upon the casks that were missing - A. Yes, and I have no doubt the cask with my name chalked on it. That is the cask.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mills. Do you know the staves - A. I do, by the race mark, and I know the cask by my writing upon the head; the staves answer with the head; they are three gallon cask staves, and this is a three gallon cask head.</p>

            . I am a constable. I went with Gillmore and Waller to the lodging of the prisoner; he was in bed when he was apprehended. I took these two pieces of the cask out of the grate, they were burning; I found the other pieces at the bottom of the cupboard, in the prisoner's room; it was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181410260017"></xptr>there with a number of hoops, now present; these are the hoops of three cags.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mills. Look at these hoops; can you tell how many casks these hoops formed - A. They belong to three casks, twelve hoops upon three casks; here are nineteen there ought to be thirty six: these hoops had been on more than one cask; some were two gallons, and some three gallon cask hoops; the name is written by myself; that head was a three gallon cask of peppermint.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I bought two casks of a man up by St. Giles's church, they were empty casks; part of the staves were in one of them; he had a stone bottle in his hand, for which I gave him five shillings. I asked him how he came by them; he said, he had been cleaning out a publican's cellar, and what was in the bottle was damaged shrub.</p>

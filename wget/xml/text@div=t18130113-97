               <p>Q. When did you lose this timber - A. Between ten and eleven o'clock at night, on the 1st of January, the watchman knocked to my door; he asked me if I had lost any timber. I said, I did not know. He said, he found a piece upon the shoulders of a man; he had brought it to me to look at. He brought it up to the pile where it was taken from. I went out, and compared the piece that he had brought back with the piece that had been cut that day. It was the piece that had been sawed that afternoon. One piece corresponded with the other.</p>

               <p>Q. When had you seen it before the watchman came - A. I saw it that very afternoon. It was then upon No. 16, the next door. It was upon the arch<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181301130056"></xptr>walks, neither in the road nor in the path-way. I am sure I had seen it that afternoon.</p>

            . I am a watchman, in Hackney-road. I was crying the hour of ten. I saw the prisoner tumbling something near the saw-pit. It was after ten. I asked him, what he was doing. He said, it was nothing to me. I said, I was ordered to take care of the timber. He shewed me a piece of a bedstead. He seemed to be in liquor. He said, he lived in Coal-harbour-street. He came with me as far as Nelson-street. He went away, and instead of my going into the box, I went to the other end of the street. I heard a person coming down. I met the prisoner with a piece of timber on his shoulder. He put it down by his own door, I said, this is a comical piece of bedstead. He knocked at the door; his wife let him in. I knocked at the door. I said, tell your husband to come out. He came out, and at the corner of the street, I lost him. I went back, and secured the property that I had seen upon him. I took it to Mr. Foulkes, and Mr. Foulkes believed it to be the piece that was near the saw-pit. I took Mr. Foulkes with me to shew him where he lived, and there was another piece of timber before his door, who brought that I do not know. I am certain that he is the man.</p>

I am the prosecutor's wife; when the prisoner was gone out I went up stairs; I missed two gowns, a shawl, some bed furniture, a book, a cloak, and some flannel - I went down and told Chapman about them; she said, if I went up into their room I should find a gown in the bed - my drawers had been broken open, but I cannot say when - when the prisoner came back she was given into custody.</p>

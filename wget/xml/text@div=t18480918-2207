I called again—he came to the door, and asked me to walk in—I went into the back parlour—he held his hands up, and said, "A serious thing," or a "Dreadful thing has occurred; here has been a robbery in the house, and I shall be ruined"—he was shaking, and appeared very much, confused—Mrs. Bennett afterwards gave me these receipts (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

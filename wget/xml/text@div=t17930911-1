               <p>I live in the house of the other lady; I am no relation. On the 20th of August, Tuesday, Mrs. Sparrow came to me, and told me that on the Monday afternoon she had missed some tea spoons, as she had had some company; and she asked me to go to the prisoner's house, and ask her if we knew any thing about these spoons. On the Friday following we went to the prisoner's lodging, and after that to Mr. Wright's, in the Hambury; and they produced two spoons. That is all I know of it.</p>
               <p>Court to Sparrow. Why do you charge the woman with taking the rest of the property? - I went down to her house on Monday the day I missed them, the 19th, and before I missed them; I have missed the other things since I found the tea spoons. I cannot say any thing further about the other things. I believe them to be my spoons, the one I brought from Somersetshire, and is marked in my maiden name, the other is marked in my husband's mother and father-in-law's name; my name is in a cypher, the other is in initials. I have no doubt about them at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Has this woman any children? - I do not know at all.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I worked for her, and I was distressed for some money, and she owed me some, and I said to her, madam, if you please I want a triffle of money; says she, I am rather short of cash, take these spoons and pledge them. I had pledged things for her before, and I went and pledged these spoons for her, for three shillings, and kept the money. At this time Mr. Sparrow was gone out of Town; my mistress gave me the spoons to pledge.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Sparrow. On your oath did you give her these spoons to pledge? - No, my lord; I never pawned a thing in my life.</p>
               <p>Court to Pawnbroker. In what name were they pawned? - In the name of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110004"></xptr>

            . I live at No. 10. in Golden-Lane, Cripplegate Parish; there is a Jew lives at my house, they call his name Solomon; who is the man that received this plate. I think it was the second of April in the morning, a man came into the street and called Clarke, and this Jew that lodged backwards jump'd out of bed, as my wife did likewise; and the Jew said it is no body to you, I will go down; my wife went to the window and saw the prisoner at the bar; it was quite day light; my wife is here; I did not see the prisoner then: Solomon and his wife went out and they went away together; between five and six o'clock as I was getting up, somebody knocked very hard at the door; I went down half dressed, I opened the door and

             the Jew and his wife came in; Solomon put his hand in his breeches pocket and gave his wife about forty or fifty enamelled gold rings, and two gold watch cases; she went up stairs into the chamber with them; Solomon stopped in the shop, and presently after a man came in with a deal box and went up into Solomon's room with it; I went up into the shop to get some sticks and shavings to make a fire with, and Solomon called me down (the man was then gone) and he asked me to fetch him a bushel of charcoal; when I came with the charcoal I saw the box opened, and it was full of plate mixed with horse dung; I told him I did not like it; he said it was nothing to me, he dealt in plate: there were six or seven waiters large and small, several pair of silver candlesticks of different patterns, one was a sort of a common brass pattern.</p>
               <p>Matthews. There was one pair different from the other, and three pair alike; one pair the corners were rather sharp, the three pair were round; they had loose nossels and a little engraving on the foot and in the cup of the nossel.</p>
               <p>Clarke. They bid me take hold of one of the candlesticks and see if it would make a good shew in a beaufet; there was a silver cross for a table, an old fashion'd two handled cup, and an old fashion'd coffee-pot: the Jew sent his wife out and she return'd in an hour with an iron mould for an in got and an old man they called Boucher a Jew; they made a charcoal fire and melted all day in Solomon's room; and in the evening of the same day the prisoner came and had ten or eleven guineas, I cannot say which; and he came daily for the money for it; the reason I know it, Solomon sent for some gin, and asked me and my wife to drink, and so I saw it; Solomon told me in the whole he paid 130 guineas for it; I saw him take money at different times, a great many guineas; they came continually; the prisoner's hand was wounded, he said it was in attempting to break open the chest, but he found the way at last.</p>
               <p>Matthews. There was a good deal of blood in the closet and on the plate box.</p>
               <p>Clarke. The prisoner said they tried a large iron skewer, but it would not open the box; but at last they found the key, carried the plate out, and hid it in the horse dung behind the house, till they could get a coach to take it away; the Jew shewed me a 20 l. bank note payable to Mr. Ewer or bearer, and said he bought it with the plate; he wanted me to go with him to a tradesman to buy some chairs; I told him I would not be seen in such dirty work. I made a discovery of it to Sir

            . I have known the prisoner about three years. On the 1st or 2d of April, I cannot say which, Lyon, Peal, the prisoner, and myself, set out from a house in Gravel-lane, and went up the back way to Mr. Ewer's; there was a cart stood at the back door: the front of the house is in Lincoln's-inn-fields; the back part in Western's Park, at the back of the Bull and Gate. We got upon the cart and got over the wall into the yard; on the other side there was a cistern, or dust hole, that we got upon; Lyons went in first; I went in afterwards; Lyons got over the area, put up the sash, and then put his hand on the rails, and pushed open the shutters and got in. Talbot was on the outside of the house, the corner of the park, I believe, to watch if any body was coming; there was no house we could get over to but this; Lyons proposed to get over; Peal bid Talbot go to the corner of the Park, and see the watchman did not come round upon us unawares; we got over first and came back again; we could not get the back door open; Peal took an iron and wrenched the lock off; Lyons shoved the shutters of the back window into the middle of the room; Lyons handed me out a Bank note out of the house; we took several pieces; there was a watch, a cross stand for a dish, several waiters, a small saucepan, candlesticks, and other things; there was a crest upon the plate; I believe a serpent winding round something; there were several spoons. Lyons cut his finger with taking the things out; the prisoner was never in the house; he had lost the use of his limbs, and said he would not go into the house; somebody brought me an apron and we put the things in it. The plate was put in some dung till they went and fetched the coach. When we came out Talbot was at the upper end of Wheston Park; he was waiting there till we came out; Peal and Talbot fetched the coach and put the plate in it; Peal and Talbot went into the coach; Lyon and I went home directly to bed; the next morning I was taken up, and when I was cleared before Sir John, three days after I saw the prisoner in Gravel-lane. The money the plate was sold for was divided among us at different times; I believe I had about thirty guineas of it; I was not at Solomon's with them. Talbot and I were at variance after I came out of gaol because he did not come to see me in gaol.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Lyons like Talbot?</p>
               <p>Colby. No, very different; he is a shorter person. I think I saw the prisoner after we came out of the house, helping Peal with the things into the coach; I was so overjoyed there was so much of it I did not take much notice.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take notice of the bank note?</p>
               <p>Colby. No; it was sold to Solomon for 7 l.</p>
               <p>Q. You never was at Solomon's yourself?</p>
               <p>Colby. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know who the man was that carried it to Solomon's?</p>
               <p>Colby. Peal told me he carried it to his own house first, and put it in a box.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know of your own knowledge which of the three carried it to Solomon's?</p>
               <p>Colby. No; Lyons and I went home as soon as it was put into the coach.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I do not know more of it than a new born baby; I have been had down three times to be tried.</p>
               <p>Q. to Matthews. Was there any cart at the back part of the house in the morning?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177309080079"></xptr>Matthews. I did not see any, there is one frequently stands there.</p>
               <p>Q. from the jury. Does the dust place and shutters answer the same description?</p>
               <p>Matthews. Yes.</p>

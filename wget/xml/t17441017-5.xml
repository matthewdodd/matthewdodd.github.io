            . I sell fruit just by Mr. King's shop; I saw the Prisoner lay himself over the shop window, and he seemed as if he had been a little in liquor. I did not much like him, so I watched him and saw him put two books into his bosom. I did not interrupt him at all, and presently he took a third and went away. Then I left my stall and took hold of him, and said he must come back with me. I carried him to Mr. King, and said, Mr. King, here's a customer for you, and took these three books from him: then he began to be very obstreperous and fell a beating me, but I did not mind that, for he had not strength enough to hurt me; and as I was going out of the shop he drew his knife to stab Mr. King: Then I went in again and he tried to bite me, and tried to bite every body; then we tied his arms, and he kicked like fury and swore most desperately, and said, You old rogue, if ever I am let loose again, I'll be the death of you and your wife too.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you by these knives?</p>
               <p>Henderson. I felt something about him, and took these knives out of his pocket; I searched him farther, and took 3 s. 6 d. and five pennyworth of halfpence out of his pocket, and then he cried he was robbed. <rs id="t17441017-5-verdict33" type="verdictDescription">

            . My husband keeps this house. The prosecutor called for a pint of beer - he went into the taproom to light his pipe; while he was there the prisoner came to the bar, and called for three halfpenny worth of gin, which he drank and went towards where the budget was - he returned and went out, with the budget under his left arm; when the prosecutor complained, I told my husband what I had seen, and he was taken in five minutes, but the property has not been found - I had seen the prisoner several times, and am quite sure he is the man; I knew the budget - the prosecutor usually leaves it at our house after he has done work.</p>

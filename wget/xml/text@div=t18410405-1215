                  </hi>. I am a boot and shoemaker, living in Oxford-street. I missed a quantity of boots from the next house, No. 207, where I before lived—Ricketts was my shopman for about a year—in con<lb></lb>sequence of something George Thornton said to me, I went to the shop of Walters, a pawnbroker, in High-street, Marylebone—I saw a quantity of boots and shoes belonging to me there—when I took stock, at Christmas, I had a great deficiency—Thornton afterwards brought Clifford to my shop—she had an opportunity of seeing my shopman—she said that the man who gave her the boots and shoes was not in the shop—Ricketts was there at the time, he passed her once and back again—in the afternoon I called Ricketts into the ware-room, told him I had been robbed, and asked if he knew any thing about it—he at first denied knowing any thing of it—I asked if he knew the woman that had been brought to the shop—he said he did—I told him it was my opinion he knew something of it—after a long pause he told me he must confess he had taken some—I gave him in charge—I made him no promise or threat.</p>

I went to Clifford's lodgings, in South-street, and saw her there—I told her I had received in<lb></lb>formation that she had pledged a quantity of boots and shoes, and I wished hef to tell me where she got them from—she said she was a gay woman; that she met a man in Regent-street, who took her to a house in Sheppard-street, and gave her two pairs of boots; she met him again a few nights afterwards, he took her to the same house, and gave her two other pairs—I said, "You took a pair to Mr. Walters to pledge, what have you done with them?"—she said the person she sent with them brought them back, as Mr. Walters would not take them in, she suspected something was wrong, and she put them on the fire, and the tickets of the boots that had been pledged before—she went with me to the prosecutor's—when in the shop I asked her if the man was in the shop—she said he was taller and darker than any man in the prosecutor's shop—I let Clifford go, and the same night the prosecutor gave Ricketts into custody—I took him to the station, and</p>

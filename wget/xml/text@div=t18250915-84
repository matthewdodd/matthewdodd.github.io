On the 30th of July, at six o'clock in the evening, I was going on board my ship - I was a little intoxicated, but quite capable of knowing every thing, and am quite certain that I had three sovereigns tied in a handkerchief, which was in my cap. I am sure the money was in my cap - I was just outside the <placeName id="t18250915-84-crimeloc464">London-dock-gate</placeName>

I am sure the prisoner is the man who knocked me down - he was a stranger to me; when the other man ran away I picked up my cap, and ran after the prisoner; as both ran away; I called "Stop thief!" but nobody stopped him; I caught him myself, and he knocked me down twice after that - I had the marks on me for weeks after; I secured him at last, and gave him to an officer. I have not recovered my money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. You had lately returned from sea? A. Yes - I had 2 l. in my pocket when I left the Docks at two o'clock - I received 1 l. from my master that morning. I had not drank much - I called at the Brown Bear, and had four or five pots of beer among three or four of my shipmates, and some spirits - we were there from two till near six o'clock - it was close by the London-dock gate - Marsh and Smith were with me - I left John Cane at the Brown Bear - I went to no other house. I saw the prisoner knock my hat off, and saw him take the money - I was capable of running after him - I caught him in the alley - I did not meet him - I followed and took him, without losing sight of him - he was not more than two rods from me.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is not the prisoner lame? A. I do not know; Smith, who helped to take him, is gone to sea.</p>

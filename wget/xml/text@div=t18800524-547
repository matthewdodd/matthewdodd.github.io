                  </hi>. I am a labourer, of 14, Poland Street, Oxford Street—on the morning of 10th May I was walking in Parker Street, at 12.45, and met Burke and another man, and I believe Bailey, but I am not so sure of him—Burke attacked me on the right side, the one who got away took me by my throat, and I believe Bailey was on my left—Burke took 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from my trousers pocket, and the one I believe to be Bailey a bunch of keys—the man who had me by my throat took my scarf pin and a silk handkerchief off my neck—Burke struck me on my head with his hat—the one at my pocket dropped a handkerchief and my keys, and they all three ran through Brewer Street to 15, Skelton Street—I followed them; Burke and Bailey stood at the door, and Bailey said "If you come any further we will knock your brains out"—I returned, picked up the handkerchief, met a constable, who came down Skelten Street, and Burke and Bailey started off the doorway; the constable fol<lb></lb>lowed and took them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Poland Street is a quarter of an hour's walk from Parker Street, walking sharply—I was going home after seeing a friend; I had only one glass of ale previous to meeting my friend at 9 o'clock—we went to another public-house, but I only had one glass of ale—I was quite sober—I had not strength to call out because he was so tight about my throat—I kept my eyes on the house where they were when I went for the police<lb></lb>man, and they were watching me—their street door was open—I kept look<lb></lb>ing round—I should know the third man if I saw him.</p>

On 10th May I was on duty in Drury Lane about 12.45—Bragg came up, and I went with him to Skelton Street; he pointed to a door on the left where they had run in—the two prisoners ran out at that door; I ran after them, took them both, and found 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on Burke and 3 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on Bailey—there was no one else in the street Cross-examined.

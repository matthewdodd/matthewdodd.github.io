            . On last Tuesday evening a little before six, in the <placeName id="t18090215-3-crimeloc10">Upper Clapton road</placeName>

A man then came up to me on the whip side, I was driving; he presented a pistol to me and demanded my money; by that time they all had taken their stations; there was one man at the horse's head, another had hold of the reins, there was another by the side of the gentleman that was with me, that is Mr. Swabey's side; he presented a pistol to him. There was a general cry, perhaps of them all, I cannot say how many of them, out with them, out with them. Soon afterwards, or perhaps during it, Mr. Swabey was forcibly dragged from the chaise; the chaise flap having been torn, he was dragged into the road. I had by that time got my hand into my pocket and delivered money to one of the robbers, the man by me with the pistol.</p>
               <p>Q. How much money was it - A. From the best calculation I could make, I believe it to be upwards of three pound; to the value of three pound I am certain in gold and silver; he said that would not satisfy him; I told him it must, I thought it sufficient. He demanded my watch, and desired me to be quick in giving it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give it him - A. Yes, I did. It was a gold watch, gold chain, and two gold seals; the watch was capped and jewelled. He then stood upon the step of the chaise, desired me to unbutton my coat, and rifled my left hand waistcoat pocket, from which he took a pair of scissars, a small paper parcel containing cards, addressed to a brother of mine, and a small piece of liquorice. I merely mention this to state the scissars and piece of liquorice were returned to me as of being of no use to them; he returned them at my stating they were of no use to them, but kept the cards. He then felt the slash pocket of my driving coat, and asked what was there, I said nothing but halfpence for the turnpike; he said he did not want these, but he put his hand in there and took the halfpence; and I believe there was a six pence there, I am not certain; at such a time I believe it is impossible to be collected: shortly after that I found somebody coming on the step of the chaise of the other side, which I was glad to see; it was Mr. Swabey getting in after having been rifled. I looked round anxiously for my friend, it disengaged my attention from the men, after hearing one of the prisoners say, do not kill him; previous to that I saw three men engaged with him; they had quitted my horse and reins and were engaged with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say you heard one of the prisoners say do not kill him - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was that - A. Shortly after they had dragged Mr. Swabey out of the chaise.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of them was it - A. I was just going to mention it; I should name it as Carr, the man who robbed me; it was the man that robbed me, he said do not kill him.</p>
               <p>Q. His name is Carr is it - A. Yes; except roughly handling, he used no improper language. Mr. Swabey got in the chaise and I drove away.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing else taken from you - A. Yes; I concluded the currants were taken out of the chaise; my whole attention or the greatest part was taken up with the man that held the pistol to my head. The currants did not appear to have dropped on the road; when they were brought to Bow street they were not soiled.</p>
               <p>Q. How many pound - A. Six pound; I cannot swear that they were taken out of the chaise, the parcel had not the appearance of being dropped in the road. I am certain they are my own; they contain my address and the stables were I put up; I did not miss them till the next morning, my confusion was too much to enquire what was taken out of the chaise.</p>
               <p>Q. You said there were four persons, were there - A. Yes, I know none but Carr; that is not to be positive of them, they have the appearance of the men; I am sure of Carr to the best of my knowledge and belief.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not swear positively - A. I do not; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180902150004"></xptr>would rather he would be let loose upon the public than my conscience be burthened.</p>
               <p>Q. Then according to your best knowledge and belief you will swear no further - A. No further; under such circumstances it is impossible to be collected at all times, perhaps.</p>
               <p>Q. You were quite alarmed I suppose - A. I cannot say I was; I was more alarmed for the fate of my friend, who was dragged by the three men so far; I did not know what became of him; the other three I could only see their persons generally; as to their faces I had no opportunity of seeing.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not take any notice of their dress - A. No further than there were two in jackets and two in coats; one man was in a light coat; the man in a light coat is not taken.</p>
               <p>Q. What had Carr on - A. The same jacket he has on now; Carr and Kelly were in jackets; I did not know it was Kelly until I saw him in Bow street, then I did not know his person except from his figure and his dress, then I thought that to be the man. Carr I believe to be one of them, and he had the same jacket on he has on now.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you say of the other prisoner, had he the same coat on he has now - A. I believe so; they were too soon removed out of my sight; it is impossible to speak precisely, they were at some distance.</p>
               <p>Cross examined by Mr. Alley. It was on the 9th instant you were robbed - A. Yes; on Thursday, a little before six in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the length of the place from where you was robbed to Ratcliffe Cross - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance were you from Whitechapel, was it an hundred yards - A. I should suppose two or three miles from Whitechapel.</p>
               <p>Q. Then Ratcliffe Cross is a considerable distance from where you was robbed - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Upper Clapton in Middlesex - A. I believe Upper Clapton is in Middlesex.</p>
               <p>MR. SWABY. Q. Where you in the chaise with Mr. Samuhda on Thursday last, in Upper Clapton road - A. I was; I saw four men, one particularly caught my attention, who was on the wrong side of the road, where there was no foot path. Mr. Samuhda was on the whip side, he called out to Mr. Samuhda to stop, and directly pointed a pistol to him; and another man came on the other side to me with a pistol, and another man unarmed. They desired me to get out of the chaise; the flap being up they tore it open, and dragged me out on the road; two came to me at first, then another one came up to me; having my chaise coat on, they broke it open, it being buttoned at the top; they felt in my waistcoat pocket, they found no watch nor money in my right hand pocket; in my left hand waistcoat pocket there were three pennyworth of halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they any pistols with them - A. One had; that man is not taken; after I was dragged out, I took notice of one man in particular; his name is Kelly. I am quite sure he is one.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take notice of the other - A. Nothing further than his height and size, generally; I cannot speak assuredly to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you will not swear as to the others at all - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the man that presented the pistol to Mr. Samuhda - A. At first I saw him, I could not swear to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he like one of the prisoners - A. In form he was; that was all I could discern, he was like Carr.</p>
               <p>Cross examined by Mr. Alley. When was Carr taken in custody - A. I understood since, he was taken the morning after the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to Bow street the next day - A. (Mr. Sumuhda). We went to Bow street the same evening.</p>

            . I am one of the patrols of Bow street office.</p>
               <p>Q. On Thursday night were you in the road between Newington Green and Ball's pond - A. Yes; Loyd and Upton, two patrols, were with me; I saw four men coming from Newington Green way, towards town. Loyd was first, Upton next, and I was last; I saw four men pass by, I said to Loyd, let us go and frisk these men, I think they are the men that did the trick on the Hampstead road; accordingly I went back to Carr, who was the last man; I said do not be alarmed, we are officers, I must search you; before I had got the words well out of my mouth, he gave a jump and went towards Newington Green.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he run - A. A little he did; I pursued him, he put his hand between his jacket and waistcoat, as if he was going to pull something out; he took a short turn round, and went towards Ball's Pond; I pursued him towards the turnpike, I called out stop him; when I came near the turnpike, a man in a soldier's great coat fired a pistol at me; he was one of the four men, he had a light coloured soldier's great coat on; he has made his escape. At the shock of the pistol going off I did not know whether I was not shot; I lost sight of them.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of night was it - A. It was about seven o'clock, to the best of my recollection; we did not take Carr till the next morning about seven o'clock at his lodgings.</p>
               <p>Q. Then they both made their escape for that night - A. Yes; we apprehended Carr the next morning; we went to one Kelly in Vine court, Broad street, Ratcliffe Cross; there were five patrols went with us.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go there - A. About two o'clock on Friday morning; when we went there we found Carr in bed; there were two more in the room, we brought them with us; the name of one was Mullins, and the other was Welch; they were discharged by the magistrate, and Carr was committed.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Carr say to you, or you to him - A. I asked him where Conner was, he said he was not come home; I then told him he must go along with us.</p>
               <p>Cross examined by Mr. Alley. You do not mean to say it was Carr that you saw - A. By the waistcoat and breeches it was the same; it was on Thursday night we stopped them. I found on Kelly a knife and some money.</p>
               <p>COURT. Are you sure it was Carr you saw on Thursday night with the men - A. Yes, with respect to his dress it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the same man that you saw the next morning - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you found Carr the next morning at two o'clock at his lodgings, that was Carr - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the same man that you met the night before - A. His dress answered the same description, being dark I could not possibly see his face. Here is a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180902150005"></xptr>pound note, eleven shillings in silver, a crown piece, a half crown, two shillings, and three sixpences; there is a gentleman in court that has spoke to one of the sixpences.</p>
               <p>Mr. Samuhda. The half crown piece appears to be what I had in my pocket; having no idea of being robbed, I took no further notice of it; I would not attempt to swear to it.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure that Conner is the person that Lloyd had hold of - A. I am.</p>
               <p>- LLOYD. Q. You were in company with Frost and Upton on Thursday night - A. Yes, between Newington Green, and Ball's Pond.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was that from Upper Clapton - A. It might be a couple of miles, I cannot exactly say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you meet any men - A. I met four men; we took them in custody; we passed them, and just turned back; I laid hold of Conner, the big one; I told him I was an officer belonging to Bow street; I went to search him, he had this parcel in his hand; I asked him where he got it, he said he purchased it in the country; he said he would give me a fall; by his saying that I put my hand into my pocket, and took my pistol and put it to his head; I told him I would blow his brains out, if he stirred hand or foot; he said he would go with me any where; with that we brought him up to the office.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take a parcel from him - A. Yes, this is the parcel; I took it from his hand; it has been in my custody ever since. I am sure that is the parcel, it contains currants; the note I took out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that parcel directed - A. Yes; it is directed for Mr. Samuhda; he told me it was sugar when I took him first, he had purchased it in the country, it was his property. When he came before the magistrate, he said he did not know whether it was sugar, or what it was; he had picked it up in the road; it had never been down in the road, it was quite clean.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a night was it - A. It was a very dark, rainy, disagreeable night; the roads were very dirty all the way we went.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. I take it for granted you found nothing at the prisoner Carr's lodgings belonging to the prosecutor - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. You had never seen Conner - A. No, he said he was his bed fellow. Going down stairs into the other room, I observed his stockings were about this high in wet, rather over his ancles; I asked him how they came so, he said they were the mark of half boots.</p>

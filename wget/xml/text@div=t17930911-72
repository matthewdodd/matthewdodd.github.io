               <p>On Friday a quarter before seven, on the Friday the 30th of August, in the evening. I was in a little house which I was building, and this man was working in the house, and could earn twenty two shillings and two-pence per week. I observed him going from the end of my yard where I had lost a considerable quantity of wool; I watched him from that part, and then I lost sight of him while he was gone into the shed; as he come back I stopped him with something in an apron; I asked him what he had got there? he said, only a few chips; I then took the apron from him, and opened the corner of it, and saw it was pewter pots; I called my servant immediately to prevent him getting away, and called for a constable, and gave charge of him; there was one quart pot bruised quite flat up, one pint pot seemed bruised entirely up, the other had a piece cut out with a chissel, where the name had been; I put the piece to it, and it quite fitted that part.

            , Jacob's Wells, Barbican, who was the man that kept the house before Mr. Burder came in; and I ordered the constable to take the pots into custody, and to take the prisoner to the compter. I went to Mr. Burder's while I sent for the constable, and desired him to come and look at them; he claimed them as his property, as soon as he saw them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not I tell you that I found them in the cellar, and was taking them to the publican to own them? - Before I gave charge of you, you said they were chips, and afterwards you said you was going to carry them home.</p>
               <p>Court. Can you say that the pots you saw in the hands of Mr. Burder, were the same you took from that man? - Yes,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110122"></xptr>they were kept in my yard till Mr. Burder came, and then they were given to him; they were given after that to the constable.</p>
               <p>Court to Burder. How do you know they are your pots? - By a private mark which was made on all the pots I took of Mr. Grimsby.</p>
               <p>Q Had you ever sold any of these pots with this private mark? - Never.</p>
               <p>Q Did you miss any pots that day? - I did not that day. I lost four or five dozen in the course of a month.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was at work at Alderman Staines house this day; when I had done work there I carried in my tools, and I found these pots under the stairs; when I first worked there I was told the alderman was a very strict man, and therefore when he first met me I said they were chips, but when he was taking them out of my apron I said they were pots, and I was going to carry them home to the Jacob's Wells.</p>

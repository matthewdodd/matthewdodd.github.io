                  </hi>. I live at 26, Hartland-road, Camden Town—I am a porter out of employ—on Thursday night, 9th December, about 20 minutes past 7, I was waiting for a friend near Mr. King's door, 4, Sambrook-court, Basinghall-street—whilst waiting there I heard a creaking noise up in Mr. King's warehouse, on the first floor, and I saw a glimmering light at the same time—I stood for perhaps ten minutes to listen, at the same time my friend came out of the Sambrook hotel—I heard some foot-steps in the warehouse—I then went for the police—I could not find one just then and came back—they were then on the stair-case—I saw a light on the stairs, and they were wrenching out the partition to get into the next warehouse—I tried the padlock outside, that was all right—two policemen at last came, and after waiting in the court about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, the two prisoners came on the parapet of a building next to Mr. King's, and said, to save the police any more trouble they would come down and give themselves up—Rogers came down first, he slipped down the spout, and Gibson came down in the same way.</p>

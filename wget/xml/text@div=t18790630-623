                  </hi>. I am an accountant—I have audited the books of Clark and Co. since 1872, also of Bunnett and Co. since 1874—I have known the prisoner since 1870; I was always on friendly terms with him—he left the employment on 28th February, 1878—after that I went into the accounts to make up a statement as to how he stood; he had a copy of it—after that there was a meeting on 28th March—the whole of the books were produced that were necessary, and we went very fully into them—the interview lasted, I think, four hours, and a balance was agreed and struck—I sent him a fair copy of the account, with a letter making an appointment to exchange cheques on the 30th—he did not in any way refer to these accounts that he is now charged with having embezzled—on 28th Mr. Taylor went to the bank to make inquiries—on the 30th I received this letter from the prisoner, and this on 3rd March. (<hi rend="italic">This called attention to certain errors in the account.</hi>) This letter of 2nd April is addressed to Mr. Clark (This stated that the balance due from him to the two firms was 698<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.) At that time no reference was made to these three sums in question—I find a paying-in slip of 21st August, 1875, for 145<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and one for 146<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., payable to Smith and Sons, dated July 28, 1875—I should say that cheque is in the handwriting of the prisoner—on 19th August, 1875, I find this entry, "F. Grafton, 169<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.," in Bunnett's rough cash book; that indicates that F. Grafton's</p>

               <p>account was to be credited with that amount—there is no other entry on that page in his writing—he has had the benefit of that 169<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> At that time I was accountant for both the businesses of Bunnett and Co. and Clark and Co.—I think the first balance-sheet I drew out of Bunnett and Co. was in 1874, Clark and Co. in 1872—Mr. Turner had been at Clark and Co.'s before me; I believe he had done one balance<lb></lb>sheet at Bunnett's; he received a larger salary than I did; he had about 80Z. per annum; I had 502. from Clark and Co.—I was examined at the police-court before Mr. Newton; there were nine or ten examinations—I presume Mr. Clark is here; I don't know—the 169<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the rough cash-book repre<lb></lb>sents a sum of money paid in to the company's credit at their bankers, and in the company's books it is credited to the prisoner in his own handwriting—that book is open in the company's office, and as the moneys come in they are entered to the names of the persons paying them in—this represents that sum as paid in by him to his own credit, and he had credit for it in the ledger; the ledger is here, it is entered to the account of F. Grafton, Esq.; the book-keeper, Mr. Johnson, gives him credit for it; it is his writing; it is entered from the rough cash-book, which is the foundation of all the entries that are made in the ledger—the sums of the firm and Mr. Grafton's money are not mixed together in this account—this is the journal which contains the whole of the entries belonging to the business of Bunnett and Co.; this represents that the 169<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was paid in the company's counting-house in money, and paid in afterwards to the company's banker; it is part of the total of the 406<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there is nothing wrong in that particular item—it is the proceeds of amounts drawn by Clark and Co. to pay Smith's account—the notes have been traced—this 146<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was not alluded to at the interview of 28th March—I did not allude, to it; I did not know of it at that time; I don't recollect that I ever knew of that item; there were so many things that we were finding out about that time, but to the best of my knowledge I was not aware of that item—I had not called Mr. Clark's attention to it, or my own—Mr. Johnson had spoken to me about that 146<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a long time before; but I had no reason to recollect it as a matter connected with Mr. Grafton—Johnson did not tell me that he had omitted to debit Mr. Grafton with that amount; he mentioned it during the auditing while I was checking the books, about the time the entry was originally made, or a few months afterwards; it would be some time during the year; some question turned up about an amount of 146<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. charged through. Peck's account—Johnson said there was something about an item of Smith's in Peck's account; I am speaking of some years ago—Johnson was then book<lb></lb>keeper to Clark and Co.—he was sent down to Bunnett by Grafton; after the regular book-keeper of Bunnett had left the books were in arrear, and that is the reason some of the entries appear in his writing, this Amongst others—he never mentioned that he had omitted to debit Grafton's account with 146<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he did not say that Grafton had taken the money for his own use and that he had told him to debit him with it; he never hinted at such a thing—he said there was something about the second item of 151<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. through Peck's account, and I said "If it is in Peck's account of course it will come through it, because if it has been a cheque it must show through the books of the firm;" that ended the matter—there was a private account of Grafton's in both firms; you have it there—Bunnett and Co. stood in the relation of bankers to Grafton in that account—the joint moneys of master</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187906300018"></xptr>
               <p>and servant were not paid in to Bunnett and Co.'s account—the joint moneys of Grafton and Bunnett and Co. were paid into Bunnett and Co.'s bankers, the Deptford branch of the London and County—Clark and Co.'s moneys were never paid in to Bunnett's bank—Grafton had an account with Clark and Co., and also with Bunnett and Co., a drawing account, or a private banking account—he could draw moneys for himself from either account; he signed "Clark and Co." under a power of attorney, and he signed "Bunnett and Co." under a director's minute—as to the 146<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., Johnson did not ex<lb></lb>plain to me the circumstances under which he was ordered to debit Grafton's account with it, and that he had forgotten to do it; if he had it would have been my duty to see Grafton then charged with it—I was at the police-court, and heard Johnson give his evidence—Grafton never posted anything in the ledger; it is very seldom that a manager does; it is the book-keeper's duty to do it—I believe a warrant was issued for Grafton's apprehension—I was not consulted about it—I did not know that it was issued at the time—he has been in the employment of this firm 25 years—Mr. Clark is his brother-in-law; he married his sister—I do not know whether Mr. Clark is to be called as a witness; I have not the conduct of the case; he is here—he has regularly sent to him every six months a private account—he takes the same part in the business now that he has done for some years past—Mr. Taylor is the manager now—I am secretary to Bunnett and Co., just as Grafton used to be—he was manager to Clark and Co. as well—I believe Mr. Newton, the Magistrate, wished this case to be referred, and it was referred; at least, it was intended to be—this order of reference (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is Mr. Clark's writing. (This was dated 22nd May, 1878.) I know nothing of the contents of it; I have a general knowledge that it was arrived at—I am not aware that an action for wrongful dismissal has been brought against Mr. Clark—Mr. Turner was one of Mr. Grafton's sureties; he was bail for his appearance; I am not aware that he was surety for anything else—I can't say whether the Magistrate liberated Mr. Grafton on his own recognisances; the matter was arranged in a private room; I was not present—I understand that a second reference was suggested, that there was a dispute about the terms, and then a summons was issued; I only know it by hearsay—I know nothing about the power of attorney; my duties were confined simply to the figures and the books—I should say the signature to this power of attorney is Mr. Clark's—I believe Mr. Clark was taken ill in 1869; that was before my introduction, which was in 1872—Mr. Clark was examined before the Magistrate, I think, on one occasion—I understood that Mr. Grafton had unfettered discretion in the business (the power of attorney so stated), but I don't know anything of the nature of it; I never read it—in 1875 there was a balance to the prisoner's credit of 221<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. with Clark and Co.; in 1876,161<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; and in 1877,108<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he paid money in and drew money out as a matter of convenience—this was not an account for the business—he had the control of the business; Mr. Clark had unlimited confidence in him—he drew all the cheques in the name of Clark and Co., and he signed for Bunnett and Co. as secretary, and accepted all the bills—he could have drawn a cheque for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on Bunnett and Co., and had it debited to his account—the cheque for 146<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was drawn for the purpose of tendering to Smith and Son by Clark and Co.; Mr. Taylor tendered it—I know now that that cheque was cashed across the counter, and the money tendered; I should not know it at the time—I know now that Smith</p>

               <p>and Son refused the tender, and I heard that the bank-notes remained in Mr. Grafton's cash box; they were afterwards paid in to his account with Bunnett and Co.—if he had kept them they ought to have been debited to his account with Clark and Co.—I did not keep the books of Clark and Co. at that time; I only audited them; Mr. Johnson kept them—if he made a mistake in not debiting him it was his fault—the business of Clark and Co. is a very large and profitable one, amounting to some thousands, and Bunnett's also; they both make revolving shutters; they both belong virtually to Mr. Clark—the prisoner had not the entire management of both businesses; he was secretary to Bunnett and Co.; Mr. Taylor had the practical management, he was the sub-manager; the prisoner was nominally the manager, but Bunnett's took up so much of his time that he virtually did little at Clark's—I know of Grafton's dismissal by Clark on 28th February or 1st March—he had been to Paris—the business of Clark and Co. was to be made over to him and Mr. Taylor, and they began to manage it from 1st January in that sense—Grafton received the debts due to Clark and Co.—he only received the moneys accruing and belonging to the business credited after 1st January, 1878, as a matter of convenience, the business being virtually his—they were to pay by instalments—I do not know that Grafton actually paid 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Clark or at the bankers' for wages; I should say it was not so; he paid 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mr. Garland, manager at the bank where the money would be paid in, is here—Grafton was 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of pocket on making the final total balance of payments and receipts during the two months—he was credited with 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—ho drew 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. partly from Clark and Co., 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from one and 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the other business, and he claimed that as his own money—the date of the agreement for sale of the business to Grafton and Taylor was 28th February, and not having been executed it expired—I heard of Mr. Barron visiting Grafton before the warrant was issued against him, but do not know—Barron was not sent by Mr. Clark, and did not say so—I have been to Grafton's house—he lived at the same house at the time of the inquiry and when the warrant was issued—I do not know whether Barron gave him notice of the warrant—the book-keeping in both businesses was in arrear—Mr. Stevens was book-keeper at Bunnett's, and went to New Zealand—I checked the books, but did not make them up—I made no inquiry about the 126<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or asked for any voucher; its going into the bank is a receipt for it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. I audited the accounts—I audit other people's accounts also—Bunnett and Co. had an account with the Dept<lb></lb>ford branch of the London and County Bank, and all accounts paid in by Grafton were paid into that account—he was credited with all the amounts he paid in his own name—as far as the bank was concerned ail moneys were paid in by Bunnett and Co. to their own credit—I am speaking of the ledger acconnt—all moneys received for the company were paid in to their credit at the London and County Bank, Deptford, and any accounts paid in. by Grafton to his own credit would so appear in this account—all sums paid in by him would be put down to his credit—if the books had been properly kept he ought to have been charged with all money he had received which belonged to Bunnett and Co., and the 145<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which he received, and which, as appears by the paying-in slip, was paid into Bunnett and Co. on 19th August, 1875, would have been so charged—the grand total was 334<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., partly composed of 145<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in notes, and is credited in the books to Bunnett and Co.—the whole of the accounts are collected in this journal</p>

By the Jury. I should not at the next audit inquire for the receipts corresponding with the counterfoils in the cheque-book—the books and cheques are usually taken in audit as evidence—the cheques were drawn as to the debit of the drawing account of Alexander Clark—Mr. Clark had a copy of his account half-yearly—I did not ask for vouchers of each of the payments in the year at the last audit; the cheques are vouchers—the counterfoils were very irregular, many of them blank—they were not altered or interfered with or destroyed—I should say it was Grafton's duty to debit the 151<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. himself as soon as paid by Mr. Taylor—it was drawn payable to Smith and Son, and debited to them in their ledger account, they being creditors for the same amount.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager to Messrs. Clark and Co.—Messrs. W. H. Smith and Co. did business for them in 1875, and in July, 1876, an account for 156<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was sent in to Clark and Co.—I had some conversation with Mr. Grafton, who drew a cheque for 146<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and directed me to cash it and tender the notes to Messrs. Rogerson and Ford, the solicitors to Messrs. Smith—I cashed the cheque at the Holborn branch of the London and County Bank, and received a 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note (50827), dated March, 1875; two 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes (41981 and 41982); one 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note (25231), May 29, 1875, and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in money—I tendered those notes to Rogerson and Ford; they stamped some of them, but did not accept them, and I returned with the money to Mr. Grafton, handed it to him, and told him the result—he put them, in his cash-box and said that he would speak to Mr. Peck, the solicitor, about the matter, by whom I afterwards found the matter was settled, and this cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) for 151<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., payable to Mr. Peck, was drawn by Mr. Grafton, on 10th August, 1875—my attention was afterwards drawn to the state of Smith's account in the books, and I said to Mr. Grafton, "Peck's account seems to show that he has paid this matter of Smith; what has become of the notes that I tendered to his solicitors?"—he said, I suppose Peck had them"—a communication was afterwards made to Mr. Peck and he came to the office—I spoke to him, and he rather warmly</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> My position then was sub-manager—Mr. Grafton did pretty well what he liked—I have not succeeded him as secretary; I am in the same position as before, only instead of calling myself sub-manager I call myself manager—I am a director of Bunnett's now; I was not before—I presume I have been qualified; I hold one share—Mr. Clark did not give it to me, nor did I buy it—I hardly know whether it belongs to me—I dare say if you ask the solicitor to the company he will be able to give you an answer—if anybody attempted to take the share from me I should not resist; they could have it—it is not valueless—here is Grafton's account with Clark and Co.—it is a very large business—I do not collect the money, I take it from the collectors and hand it to Mr. Grafton, who pays it into the bank to the credit of Clark and Co.—perhaps on the whole there is an average turn-over of 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 30,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year to Clark of business done—he had no banking account at Deptford; that was Bunnett and Co.'s account—the 1875 account is not one which was opened with Grafton; they are credited with their salaries here—there was a balance in his favour in 1875 of 225<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—this balance, brought down, January 1, 1875, 58<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., was in favour of Mr. Grafton, I believe—this, "By cash 230<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," "By cash 210<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," is money paid by him—there is an entry to Grafton's credit with Clark and Co.—I believe one other clerk has an account like Mr. Grafton's; here is my own account, opened on 31st June, 1874—I had not the power to draw on this account; Mr. Grafton was the only person who had power to do so, under a power of attorney—here is another account of George Wilson, in 1873—my account is for my salary only—Mr. Johnson was the book-keeper; he left in 1877—there is a private account of Clark and Co.—Mr. Grafton drew every cheque that was required—he may have drawn for Mr. Clark's private account for Mr. Clark's private debts—I paid in 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Grafton's account in 1878 in reference to a proposed purchase of the business—those were the moneys which had been collected since January, 1878, of Clark and Co.—no formal agreement was drawn up, otherwise I should be in the possession of the business now with Mr. Grafton—Grafton was dismissed on 1st March, since when he has established himself in London and in Paris in the same business, a patent shutter manufactory—Mr. Clark is paralysed; the doctor said that he should not attend to business, and he generally referred every<lb></lb>thing to Mr. Grafton—the agreement between me and Mr. Grafton was given up at Marlborough Street Police-court, and I have destroyed it since—I do not know whether it was part of the terms of reference—I have not filed a bill in Equity—Mr. Clark did not ask me to destroy it; I had nothing to do with Mr. Clark—I destroyed it because there was no further use for it—Grafton's being prosecuted had nothing to do with it—I tore it up</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>). I produce Clark and Co's ledger of 1875—I find no entry on the counterfoils or a cheque of this date, but here is a blank counterfoil—Mr. Luckhurst's name is not here—the cheque appears in the ledger in an amount of 15,411<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to the debit of Alex<lb></lb>ander Clark, it also appears in the cash-book and journal—the entry in the cash-book is, "1875, Sept 23rd, A. Clark, Esq., Luckhurst 96<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—that is a debit to the prosecutor—from the cash-book it is entered into the journal, and forms part of the 15,411<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I should say that this "Luckhurst" on the cheque is in the writing of Mr. Ernest Grafton, the son—there is a debit to Mr. Grafton of 96<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and if you add the balance that would give him a debit of 157<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at the end of the year; in other words, there is a deficiency of 378<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which he took the benefit of within the dates mentioned.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>). Clark and Co. were in the habit of dealing with Mr. Eadon, of Holborn, an agent for the sale of springs for revolving shutters—the springs made by Eadon were supplied to Clark and Co., and invoices rendered to them; a three months' acceptance was then given for the amount—when springs were supplied it was necessary that they should be tempered or prepared in some way before they could be used,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187906300026"></xptr>
               <p>and they were sent to the New Cross Manufactory; they were there tempered by Bunnett and Co., and afterwards delivered to Clark—this (produced) is an invoice signed by Eadon on 23rd September, 1874, for 93<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., the price of a quantity of springs, for which this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the acceptance at five months due on 18th January, 1875—the signature to the acceptance is Eadon's writing, but the acceptance itself in the name of Clark is Grafton's writing; that has been duly honoured—Eadon had nothing to do with Bunnett and Co. as far as I know; that 93<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was a transaction of Clark and Co. pure and simple, and not of Bunnett and Co.</p>

In 1874 I was works manager at Bunnett and Co.'s manufactory, New Cross—I remember the springs to which this invoice refers being delivered there to be tempered for Clark and Co.—they were tempered, and they went on to Clark and Co.—I was in Bunnett and Co.'s employ from the time it was started—they certainly had no direct transactions with Eadon.</p>

I produce the books of Clark and Co.—there is in them an acceptance of Eadon's invoice of September 23rd, 1874, for 93<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; if it had appeared at that time with "Clark and Co." struck out and "Bunnett and Co." put in, it would not have appeared in Clark and Co.'s books at all—if it had originally been "Bunnett and Co." it would never have got into Clark and Co.'s books—I have an entry of a bill on 21st June, 1875, by Clark and Co.—that would not have been accepted by Clark and Co. if it was an invoice to Bunnett and Co.—Bunnett and Co. are debited with it—G. A. Eadon is credited with springs sold, 93<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., in Bunnett and Co.'s books; the entry is in Mr. Johnson the bookkeeper's writing, who would make it from the invoice, assuming that "Clark and Co." had been struck out and "Bunnett and Co." put in—there is a very faint pencil entry in the ledger under the heading, "G. A. Eadon, December 24th, by goods 93<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>." and that is deducted from the 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in Bunnett and Co.'s book, leaving 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; that is the amount of cash that has been paid—that pencil entry, I should pay, is in Grafton's writing—I should think it got rubbed out when the ledger was cleared up—there is no other account of Eadon's in Bunnett's books; the account was opened</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187906300027"></xptr>
               <p>for that transaction alone—I say that the pencil marks are in Grafton's writing, but if you take a cheque and compare it you can judge for yourself—the entry ought not to have had any existence in Bunnett's books, but Bunnett is debited with it thus: "1875, London and County Bank, January, 251.; May 14th, 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; August 12th, 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 1876, August 22nd, 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.," making a total of 93<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—in the counterfoil of Bunnett and Co.'s cheque-book I find, "January 5th, 1875, Eadon, steel, 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;" that corresponds with the entry in the ledger of the same date—we cannot find that counterfoil or the two next, but we have the cheques; one is May 14th, 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I find a counterfoil of the fourth cheque, which is "Eadon, 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>." which I say is in Mr. Grafton's writing—that is for blind tick or ticking, but it is blotted—the "Eadon" is, I say, in Mr. Grafton's writing—Eadon lived in Sheffield, but he had an office in Thavies Inn—the two cheques payable to bearer do not bear Eadon's endorsement—the first cheque, January, 1875, is payable to order, and bears Eadon's endorsement—the acceptance is dated January 18th—I know Eadon's signature—he is in Australia, but I heard from him a few days ago—this is the original cheque; it is drawn by G. A. Eadon for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the London and South-Western Bank, January, 1875, payable to Frederick Grafton, Esq., or order, and the private account of Frederick Grafton is credited with the 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. goes into the bank, and afterwards Grafton takes credit for it for his private account—Bunnett is there debited with the whole amount of 93<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., as well as Clark and Co.; the amount is paid twice over.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I cannot say in whoso writing the crossing of the cheque is, as it is only two straight lines—Grafton was not my master—an auditor takes a professional fee, but a servant receives a salary and attends at regular hours—I receive my fee half-yearly—you do not offend me by calling me a servant—Mr. Grafton drew the cheques with which I was paid—I do not know that Mr. Grafton sometimes drew cheques for a trades<lb></lb>man, and actually cashed them for him, or that he drew cheques for Mr. Clark and cashed them for him—I did not know that the 93<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was one of the sums referred to arbitration—the accounts referred to arbitration were made out by me; I will correct myself; it is difficult to deal with a mass of figures—I do not know that Mr. Eadon supplies steel to Bunnett and Co.—all the cheques I produce, and the invoices and all the entries I myself found out there, are here in Court; they were, I presume, left by Mr. Grafton; it is entered in the invoice-book copied from the altered invoice—the books are kept at Queen Street, but the steel was received at New Cross—the steel was entered from Clark and Co.'s statement, and not from the invoice—both firms have paid for the same goods—in Bunnett's invoice-book or journal there is an entry of Eadon's supply of goods to them, and in Clark and Co.'s books also—I have heard of such a thing as a duplicate order for goods—I never heard that Grafton had lent 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to to Eadon—this 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque is first charged as a payment to Eadon, and after as a payment by Grafton to his own credit—anybody as acute as me would not see it in a moment; I could not see it in the books—I audited the books in 1875 for both firms—I did not see the invoices or look at the counterfoils, or ask for the receipts; I accepted the books as evidence—I call that an and it; if I had wanted an explanation I should have asked the bookkeeper, and if he had not explained I should have gone to Grafton for it—in auditing accounts I do not ask for receipts or vouchers; cheques are</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187906300028"></xptr>
               <p>vouchers—I have not always asked for vouchers since this, but I have sometimes, and I sometimes did then; in this instance I did not—had I asked for receipts and they were not produced I should not have passed the audit, as probably these things would have been disclosed or explained—I cannot give an opinion as to whether Grafton's mouth would not have been closed if I had inquired further into the matter—he would have been called upon for an explanation by Clark—"blind tick" is known in the trade that would be an intelligible expression—I cannot produce the counterfoils of the other two 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheques.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Eadon was paid by means of those four cheques, and that closed the account—I find in Clark and Co.'s books a similar account, a credit to Eadon of 93<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for goods, on December 23, 1876, so that unless goods to that amount were delivered to Clark and Co., and another lot of goods to that amount to Bunnett's, that account must be entered twice over, and paid twice over—the entry is, "1875, bill due 21st Jan., 93<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—there is, I believe, no entry of the weight of the goods—on the invoice altered from Clark and Co. to Bunnett and Co., in Grafton's writing, the words over the stamp, "Received by cash on account 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," are in Eadon's writing—from this it appears that before the acceptance was given Eadon received in cash 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in advance, and here is a cheque in Jan. for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., payable to Grafton, Esq.—if that was a repayment of the cash advanced on the 25th the account would be squared—the acceptance of the 15th was given for the full amount, and if money had been paid in advance that would make it straight—this cheque being payable to Grafton, if he had advanced the money himself it would be quite proper to carry it to his private account—Bunnett and Co. are credited with the 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and Eadon is debited—these three cheques to Eadon, payable on account of Bunnett and Co., limited, would lead me to believe that the amount was discharged, and when I audited the books I assumed that it was all correct—the books show a credit to Eadon of 93<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., discharged by Bunnett and Co. in that way—on this statement for the goods made out against Clark and Co., dated Jan. 18, 1875, the words at the foot, "By acceptance at five months, G. A. Eadon," are Mr. Eadon's writing—I should call the acceptance a receipt—I find no separate receipt—when an account is discharged by cheque it is usual to get a receipt in full when the last cheque is given—in a case like this loose receipts might be given—it is a very general custom in business to send in statements of accounts. (<hi rend="italic">A paper was fare handed to the Jury in which the word "cheque" had been altered to "cheques"</hi>) There is no cheque of the same date preceding that—on the face of it there appear to have been two descriptions of the same amount on the same day with the two firms—this book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is Bunnett and Co.'s; it purports to be "Goods received from and on account of Clark and Co."—it is in the store-keeper's writing at the works.</p>

I have had great experience in testing handwriting—I have seen this bundle of cheques—to the best of my belief the endorsement on the 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. cheque is not in the same handwriting as the one for 1,600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the formation of the letter "A" on the cheque seems to be completely misunder<lb></lb>stood by the person who wrote it—Mr. Clark invariably forms his capital letter "A" by a single operation of the pen; that is he crosses it with, the same opera<lb></lb>tion, forming a loop in the middle—in this signature the crossing of the "A." is a ring made by itself independently by a separate operation of the pen—the "a" of "Clark" in the signature of the cheque for 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. is formed by a combination of the letter "e" and the letter "i"—the common mode of forming the letter "a" is to join it to the next letter preceding it; but in this instance the "e" portion is very plainly formed, very deliberately formed, and stands by itself disconnected from the "i" portion, and very unlike any instances of the genuine signatures—then the "r" of "Clark" is connected with the "k" by an upstroke taken from the bottom of the "r"—the formation of the "r" is on a different principle to that in use by Mr. Clark—then the "k" is unlike—those are the principal reasons except this, the signature inclines rather more upwards than Mr. Clark's.</p>

Turner, not to disclose any matter con<lb></lb>nected with Mr. Clark's business or interfere with the same, under a penalty of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; Mr. Clark to withdraw from present proceedings; the agreement with Mr. Taylor to be given up and cancelled"—that is the agreement relating to the transfer of the business from Grafton to Taylor—"Mr. James Waddell to be made the arbitrator," &amp;c.—it is signed "Frederick Grafton," and then underneath, "For Alexander Clark, Walter Barron"—I think no agreement was drawn up at the police-court on that occasion—this is the agreement of reference signed by Frederick Grafton—this is a duplicate signed by Mr. Clark and Mr. Renshaw, dated 22nd May, 1878 (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—after that a deed of covenant was entered into, in which Mr. Turner became responsible for Mr. Grafton to the extent of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have not got it here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I was perfectly ready to go on with the arbitration at that time if Mr. Lewis would have done so—I know that in October, when they refused to go on with the arbitration, Mr. Lewis issued an action against Mr. Clark for malicious prosecution—on the renewed proceedings there was a summons, and then we went into a great number of cases, and the Magis<lb></lb>trate finally dismissed the summons without giving any reason whatever—he pulled up very abruptly and said, "Is that all?" and then he said, "I dismiss the summons"—Mr. Lewis made a very long and able speech—we called Mr. Chabot, but the Magistrate said "Why do you call him? You had better call him on the trial"—and he said that Mr. Clark's denial was quite sufficient.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">A. G. RENSHAW</hi>. I was instructed by Mr. Clark in the first instance, and I instructed Mr. Wontner to attend to the criminal part of this matter—up to that time I had been acting as the solicitor—I was aware of the suggested arbitration and also of Mr. Clark's state of health and that of his wife—I was not present at the time the agreement was drawn up, but I was made aware of it shortly after; and in pursuance of that I endeavoured for the next six months to carry out the arbitration, and endeavoured to arrange a meeting with the arbitrator and Mr. Lewis upon several occasions—I waited in town all the long vacation, I don't think a lawyer could do more—there was a long correspondence between us which speaks for itself—no time elapsed without being enlarged by the arbitrator—I sent down to Mr. Lewis very many times and tried to make arrangements, but some quibble was always made.</p>

               <p>Magistrate—I have heard the documents read—the counsel for the prosecu<lb></lb>tion had opened their case before the documents were executed—Mr. Wontner had suggested to the Magistrate that the prosecution consisted not only of Smith's case, but of other cases, amounting to about 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and thereupon the case proceeded, and after some witnesses were called simply to prove formal evidence, and Mr. Taylor was partly cross-examined by me, and the circumstances were stated as to the cross accounts in this matter, it was suggested that this was not a case for a Criminal Court at all—with reference to Mr. Grafton's irregularities after 30 years' service it was suggested that if we could not account for any balance that might be due by him we should be prepared to pay them, but he declined to be made responsible, as the errors had arisen from bad book-keeping, and he was the victim of it—after one or two meetings it was finally arranged, and terms were agreed to, and an order of reference; and in addition Mr. Grafton was called upon to sign an apology for the errors in book-keeping—he absolutely refused, and said he would sooner the case should go on and be investigated by a Magistrate—this was stated in Court, and that the errors in book<lb></lb>keeping would not have occurred if the books had been properly audited, and that the clerk had brought him into this position—thereupon the matter was left to the Magistrate upon Mr. Wontner giving the Magistrate the reason why he refused to sign the apology—the deed of reference expired on 30th June—I was perfectly ready and offered Mr. Renshaw to enter into a fresh agreement of reference—Mr. Grafton was perfectly prepared to deposit any sum of money for which he might be found liable—a dispute arose between Mr. Renshaw and myself—then I complained to Mr. Renshaw's clerk that Mr. Clark had said he would ruin Grafton if it cost him 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; so Grafton informed me, and I said, "Mr. Grafton declines to enter into any renewed agreement except it bears the date of the original agreement"—an attempt was made to get a new agreement but it failed, and then they threatened me again with the Marlborough Street Police-court—the Magis<lb></lb>trate suggested that I and Mr. Wontner should attend before him, and then he suggested that the matter should go to reference—I consented to do so—it did not go to reference—they stood out to make Grafton liable for the lost reference, which arose from their own fault, and those terms were not agreed to, those were the main reasons why the second reference went off, and then in fifteen months they summoned Grafton up again to Marl<lb></lb>borough Street Police-court—the Magistrate, I think, for ten days went into the case and dismissed the summons, and stated he did not believe any Jury would convict Mr. Grafton of fraud in such a case, and that it was stated in Mr. Grantham's presence—I swear every case was gone into except Landrier'a.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I say distinctly that Mr. Newton said, "I shall dismiss this summons; I do not believe any Jury would ever convict Mr. Grafton of fraud"—I think everything appears in the correspondence—I should like the whole of it read.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in the service of Clark and Co., and also of Bunnett and Co.—in reality they were one firm—I was in Clark's service eight and a half years—I saw there was no prospect of my salary increasing, and as chance put a better situation in my way I took it, and left Clark's at the end of March, 1877—I went into the service of Brown and Co., 90, Cannon Street, and am there now—I remember an item of 146<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in respect of which I discovered an error—to the best of my recollection it was in March, 1877, just before I left—I discovered it through an act of Mr. Peck's, the solicitor at that time—I mentioned it to Mr. Godwin and to Mr. Taylor, who tendered the notes—he told me he had returned the notes to Mr. Grafton—I did not see Mr. Grafton for some time—before I saw him I saw Mr. Peck, the solicitor, and I challenged him about it, and he disclaimed having had the money twice—while we were speaking Mr. Clark came into the room and said, "What is all this about?"—"Oh," I said in a bantering sort of way, "it is only Mr. Peck, who has had the money twice to settle Smith's account"—it was only a joke; I did not intend or mean it—after<lb></lb>wards, when I found Mr. Grafton had really had the money, I pointed it out to him—he said, "Oh, you know what to do"—he did not seem very pleased—he meant I was to debit his account with the amount—it was never debited; I intended to debit it, but the books were not closed—it would be one of the last entries I should make—I was pressed very hard with work at the time—I kept all the books except the order book—each firm had a separate set of books—in Clark and Co.'s firm I was engaged as book-keeper—they had a rough cash book, a fair cash book, a debtors ledger, a creditors' ledger, a journal, sales book, and order book—I several times complained of my hard work—I was not the only one who complained—Grafton's and Clark's private accounts passed through the business books of the firm—the cheque for 136<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., paid to Hards, Vaughan, and Co., is debited to Mr. Clark's private account, so that he would see that cheque and be able at once to detect if it were wrong—the cheque for 196<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. debited also to Mr. Clark's private account—I do not remember whether the name was Luckhurst—Grafton knew that there was an auditor employed, and that the accounts were regularly audited—a 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque to Mr. Fase is entered in the books as "Mr. Fate," and it is entered to Mr. Clark's account erroneously—those are the only three entries in Mr. Clark's account that are complained of in this indictment—I don't recollect Grafton saying anything to me about drawing out Fase's cheque—I remember calling Mr. Clark's attention to one or two items which I said I did not know whether they were for him or not, and he said he would take the book home and look—in debiting those cheques to Mr. Clark's account I never received any order of any kind from Grafton to do so—it was simply an error which could easily have been detected if</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187906300045"></xptr>
               <p>the books had been properly audited—no charges were made against Mr. Grafton up to that time—they were errors which were found out and corrected—Mr. Clark was in the habit of passing all his private transactions through the business books—I knew that both firms made the same kind of shutter, and that they required the same springs—in 1876 I was authorised by Mr. Clark to go and assist in the evening at Bunnett and Co.'s in writing up their books—I remember a cheque for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in Eadon's case, which is marked in pencil in the ledger—this writing may be mine; I write very like that when I write with a pencil—I cannot read what it is—I should take it to mean that they have evidently found in this credit account the amount of the claim, and I have put in the claim provisionally—the ink is my writing—in 1869 Mr. Clark had an attack of paralysis—I recollect him almost entirely himself again at the end of August of the same year—I know it by his purchasing an estate at Guildford, and another estate at Taplow, which he possesses now—he entered into several speculations—independent of my ter to Godwin Mr. Peck knew of this mistake about the 146<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque—at letter had nothing to do with it—during the eight and a half years that I was in Mr. Clark's employ I knew Grafton, and I always considered him to be a man of honour, honesty, and integrity—I thought he was rather erratic in his business transactions, that is, in keeping his cash book—no one dared to insinuate anything.</p>

This cheque bears his" (i.e., Mr. Peck's, the solicitor's) "endorsement, but I cannot tell you what it is for"—it was not necessary for me to make any inquiry of Grafton—when Peck's account was rendered I in the natural course went into it—this is Peck's account (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he has not put the date when he rendered it—the last item is in 1875—he would never render his account—I will prove to you by this letter that this identical account was not rendered at that date, September, 1876—G. Eadon's account in Bunnett's books is partly entered up by me—on one gave me instructions to enter it that I know of—all these entries in Clark's books, December, 1874, amounting to 93<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., are in my writing—there was a separate invoice for this—the two last entries on the Dr. side are in my writing from the cash-bock, "Dr. to cash, 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; July 22, 1876, Dr. to cash, 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I assume that those payments had been made in discharge of the account—these other amounts, Hard's and Vaughan's cheque, and cheque for deposit on land, and so on, I saw in the books, and entered them to Clark's private account—I don't think I entered Luckhurst's cheque for 96<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 23rd September, 1875.</p>

I am house-surgeon at King's College Hos<lb></lb>pital—I attended Downing—I found him suffering from a severe wound at the back of the right arm—it did not appear to me to be a dangerous wound—it struck me as having been inflicted by a blunt knife—it was not a clean cut wound—the upper part was cleanly cut, but the lower part was torn, and the muscle was protruding—it must have been caused by something sharper than glass, I think—I don't think it would be produced by rubbing against a nail, because the upper part of the wound was cleanly cut—the wound was about the middle of the arm, and ran towards the inner side—the muscle was divided.</p>

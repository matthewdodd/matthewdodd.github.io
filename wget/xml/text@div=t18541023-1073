                  </hi>. I am out of business; I lend money. In Jan., 1849, I was lending money, under the name of the Atlas Loan Company—an application was made to me for a loan—I say not got it here—I have lost it—the form was of the usual description.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HORNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi>, What did it state? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was a formal application for a loan; it was filled up, by one Stevens and Henry Lake—this bill, was made some few days after the form came in—on the, form Mr. Lake was represented as being a resident in the house, No. 9, Shaftsbury-crescent, for nine months—that was on the form—it was brought to me by a person who gave the name of Stevens—I afterwards went to the direction that was written on the form, No. 9, Shaftsbury-crescent, Pimlico—I there saw the prisoner—I had the form of application, with me at that time—I believe I showed it to him—I read the address I am certain, before I went into the house—I do not know that I showed it to the prisoner—I asked him if he had given his, word to become security for one Stevens—he stated that he had; for he had known Mr. Stevens lot a number of years, and he was a very industrious man, and he was poor, and he was disposed to serve him—I stated that I was very sorry it was a wet day, and, he said he could get the <hi rend="italic">bus</hi>, and get near to my office—I then left—I afterwards saw him at my office, in about four hours after I had been at his house—I took this stamped bill and placed it before John Stevens and Henry Lake—they were both there—they both signed it—the prisoner signed the name of Henry Lake, and I gave them 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I cannot, exactly say who I gave the money to—they were both together when it was given—at the time I saw the prisoner at Shaftsbury-crescent, he said he had resided there nine months, and, also, it was stated on the form—he represented himself to be either a surgical instrument maker, or an engraver, but he had retired from business—I went to the house, No. 9, Shaftsbury-crescent about a fortnight afterwards; One of the instalments was then due—I applied for the instalment—I did not find the defendant there; he was gone, and I got a very bad account of his character; I never, got paid a farthing—I have never been paid by him, or by Stevens—I endeavoured to find Stevens, but I have not been able to see him since Jan., 1849—my motive for advancing this money was, I believed the prisoner's representation that he was a respectable man, and had resided there nine months—I certainly should not nave advanced the money if I</p>

               <p>had not believed that representation to be true—I think I saw the prisoner again about three weeks after this transaction; I met him in Compton-street, as I was walking with a gentleman.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You, saw him here last Sessions, when he was acquitted? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; but I had seen him previous to that—I was not present when you defended him, and the Jury would not allow you to address them—I was out of Court—I should not have lent the money if it had not been for these statements—I certainty would not, if he had not given me this promissory note—I took this as security for the loan—the statements made by the prisoner were before this note was executed—when I went to the prisoner, he said he was an engraver—I am positive of that—since he was acquitted, two persons became bail for him; I did not call on them, and advise them not to become bail for him—on my oath, I never said anything of the kind—I had notice that those two persons were willing to become bail for him, and I called on them at their houses—I saw them, and the result has been that the man has been kept in gaol ever since—I had never seen the defendant previous to some person coming to my office about this loan.</p>

I let the house, No. 9, Shaftesbury-crescent, in Dec., 1848, to the prisoner; under the name of Henry Lake—I did not receive any rent from him for that house—I let it on an agreement—about 28th March, 1849, we received a note, enclosing the key of the house—I went to the house, and found the prisoner was gone—we never received any rent—before it was occupied by him, in Dec., 1848, it had been empty for about six months—the prisoner represented himself to be a retired innkeeper.</p>

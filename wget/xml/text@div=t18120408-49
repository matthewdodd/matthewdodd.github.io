               <p>Mr. Gurney. It is your custom I take it for granted to desire persons to write their names - A. Not always; I do sometimes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long afterwards was it that you saw the prisoner in custody - A. I think it was in February.</p>
               <p>Q. And then I believe you saw him in custody - A. I did; I was taken to the public-house adjoining the office.</p>
               <p>Q. You take a great number of notes in the course of a year - A. Not of that amount; my trade is such that I take mostly one's and two's; the circumstance of taking a ten pound note is rather unusual; after I had given him the nine one pound notes it struck me that it was foolish to give nine one pound notes in change for so small an article.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. As that time has elapsed have you the least particle of a doubt that he was the man - A. Not the least.</p>

               <p>Q. What did he give you in payment - A. A ten pound note.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you put any mark upon the note that you received of the prisoner - A. I did not at the time on the 26th I received it; on the 28th I carried it to the bank for inspection.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it out of your sight or possession until you put a mark upon it at the bank of England - A. It had not.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at it and see whether the mark you put upon it at the bank is upon the note - A. It is; I am perfectly sure it is the note I received of the prisoner, I did not see him again until he was in custody some months after.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know before you went to the bank that other persons had similar notes - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You doubted the note before you went to the Bank - A. I did, in consequence of something I heard. The prisoner said he came from Barnet; I was busy at the time when he first came in; he was in the shop about half an hour; I sold him two counterpanes; in the course of conversation, he said he came from Barnet, his wife had been there the week before, and she had purchased some articles that she liked; he said he was going in a chaise, he could take take them to Barnet, he had a boy with him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. I suppose you have shopmen that serve in the shop as well yourself - A. No; my wife serves in the shop; I always put the money in the drawer myself.</p>
               <p>Q. You carry the notes up stairs of night I suppose - A. Yes; I had no other ten pound bank note.</p>

               <p>Q. Look upon the prisoner, do you know him - A. Yes, perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon what occasion did you first see him - A. He came into Mr. Mackwell's shop on the 26th of November, I believe between three and four in the afternoon, he was in company of a little boy; he asked to look at some silk handkerchiefs, which I shewed him; he fixed upon two at a low price, he bought them.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the price - A. About seven shillings a-piece. He bought something else, some little trifling haberdashery, the whole amount was eighteen shillings; I was not able to give change; I went across the way with it to Alexander Illman, a linen draper in the same street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you deliver to Mr. Illman the same paper that you had received of the prisoner - A. I did.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you any doubt then of his person - A. I had not then in the remotest degree, nor have I now.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus. Did you take any particular notice of the man, more than any other man - A. I did, and the impression that it made on my mind, that I recollected the person more forcibly than before.</p>

I said to my daughter-in-law, put Mr. Mackwell's name upon it and give change; I went to the bottom of the shop, I did not look particularly at the note or else I should not have given change at night.

            , a well-known character here, who told me they were all good notes. I had ten ten's from him at one time; one ten at another; four fives, three ten's, six two's, and eight one's at another time; he then told me these were all good Bank of England notes, and I knew no other till about a week prior to my apprehension; he asked me if I had paid them all away; I told him I had, except two small ones; he then told me that I was a very bad judge not to know a good note from a bad one; he told me they were certainly forged notes. We had a serious altercation about it, and that at my own house; I told him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181204080049"></xptr> I had two small ones left which I burnt in the fire before his face, and a woman that was present; I told him I did not think he was capable of deceiving me in that kind of way, from the length of time I had known him, and the often dealings we had together; he told me he hoped it would be all right, and that nothing further would come of it; he returned me a twenty pound Dartford bank note by way of appeasing my trouble; he said he would take care to support me through it, as I never knew they were bad bank notes. A few days after I was apprehended he hearing of this it took a great effect upon him, he was taken ill in fact to his bed, and he died in about a week afterwards; at the time I was in prison he frequently declared to those that were in the habit of seeing him, that he gave me the notes for good notes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. to Foy. I believe you apprehended Bray, either at the prisoner's house, or close to it - A. He came there, I kept him in custody while I was searching the prisoner's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that he is dead - A. I have heard so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. The evidence that I have to offer is of the death of Bray, and his declaration when he was in the view of death.</p>

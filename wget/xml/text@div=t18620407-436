               <p>Monday, 10th March, about 7 o'clock in the morning I was in Farrar's-rents with my stall—the prisoner came and asked me for a halfpenny cup of coffee and a slice of bread and butter—they came to 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she gave me a shilling—I was not quite sure that it was a bad one; I pretended not to have change, and asked a little boy to run to a shop and get change—he brought it back, before going into any house, and said it was a bad one—I accused her of knowing it was a bad one, and of belonging to young man with one eye who had given me a bad one the week before—she made no reply, but walked away—I sent the polioeman after her—the boy only went a few yards, the distance from one house to another, and then he gave me back the same shilling—I gave it to the constable.</p>

On Monday morning, 10th March, I was on duty in Bishopsgate-street, and saw the prisoner in company with a man with one eye, coming across the street towards the stall—I went and spoke to Mrs. Taylor, and she gave me this shilling (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I then went after the prisoner, and overtook her in Sun-street—(the man had gone to Long-alley)—I said, "Have you any more of those about you?"—she said, "Oh! do you think I am a fool?"—I said, "Well, you must come back along with me; where is the man with one eye?"—she said, "If you want him, you had better go and look for him; if you had got him you might have made a job of it"—I took her back to the coffee-stall, and Mrs. Taylor then said, "I believe she is one of the same gang that passed one on me last week"—I told a sergeant that was with us if he saw a man with one eye following us to take him in custody—I took the prisoner in custody—in going to the station she said the man had got the <hi rend="italic">swag;</hi> that she had no money—at the station the female searcher searched her—only an empty purse was found on her—I saw the man the following morning at Horse monger-lane gaol, and this morning at the bar.</p>

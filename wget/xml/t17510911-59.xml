            . On Monday morning July eight, between seven and eight o'clock, Shepherd came to my door; I look'd out, she said come down and open the door, saying Mrs. Barret desir'd I'd come for her bellows, she wanted them at the Marshalsea-prison; her husband was a prisoner there; I let her in, then she said she was to go up and make Barret's bed; she went up, and kept making a great rattle; I went out, when I came back, I went to lift the box; I was going to put my husband's cloaths where the money was, and the cover came up with my hands. I call'd Shepherd up, and told her the case; she said never be affrighted, may be your husband has done it to affright you. When she got out of the door, she run away. After she confess'd to 14 s. I ask'd her how she did it; she said she did it with one of my husband's chisels; that she shut both the doors, and carried the box into Barret's room, to do it. I ask'd her where the chisel was, she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175109110036"></xptr> told me upon the top of the Chimney-piece; when I came home, there I found it. Our room is on the same floor as Barret's; she went through our room to go to her's; I know nothing against Barret.</p>

I went and told Mrs. Rogers, she was willing I should be there a time. I lay there three nights, on Saturday morning I went to the prison, to Mr. Barret, his wife was drunk at the door, he had given her a black eye; when I came to Mr. Rogers he said, if she or I offer'd to come there, he'd break our necks. On the Sunday morning I went and told her; she said, she would move her goods, and take another lodging. She desired me to go to Mr. Rogers's, on the Monday morning, and bring her bellows; I went and knock'd at the door, she insisted upon it, she should not have them; I went and told Mrs. Barret, she would not let her have them; at night Mrs. Barret came and told me, Mrs. Rogers charg'd me with breaking the box; the next morning Mr. Rogers dragg'd me into an ale-house, and the constable insisted upon searching me; and pull'd out a great many things from my pocket. He took 8 s. and 6 d. out of my hussive, and carried me to Sir Samuel Gore, and then to Bridewell; I never was up the stairs, Mrs. Rogers would have for give me, if I would have sworn against this other prisoner; her husband is in the Marshalsea-prison for debt.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an innkeeper at Hayes. The prisoners were in my employment—Shepherd was my ostler up to 10th March—Red worth had previously been my ostler, and had left about a month before, and I</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, T</hi> 207.) On Saturday, 10th March, I was called by Mr. Kenyon, at a little before 2 o'clock, and saw the prisoners and a man named Alford, who is still at large, in the tap-room—they were quite drunk, and were given into my custody by Mr. Kenyon, who said that he thought they had been drinking his wine and spirits, as they had only had two pints of beer during the day—Redworth said to Shepherd, "You hold your noise, you b——y fool; if you <hi rend="italic">split</hi> we shall be transported"—Shepherd had not spoken, that I am aware of—previous to my putting the handcuffs on he was very violent, and said, "You b——r; if I had got my knife, I would cut your b——y throat"—they were so violent that the third man made his escape—I took them to the station—I cautioned Redworth; I did not tell him that it would be better for him to tell the truth—he told the sergeant that Alford and Shepherd were in the cellar, and that he waited outside and saw them—Shepherd made no reply—they were both handcuffed together—I then went back to Mr. Kenyon's to make further search—Ser<lb></lb>geant Roadknight came shortly after me—I was searching the premises, and up in a loft, over the skittle ground, I found seven pint and two quart bottles of wine, which I believe was sherry, and two bottles of stout, eleven altogether—they were covered over with a mat—I took them to the station.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Before Redworth made that statement, did Shepherd say anything? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He said that Redworth knew all about it—I think that was after Redworth had made his statement—it was after Redworth was in the charge room that Shepherd said it—it was after Redworth had said that Shepherd did it—Redworth was taken into the charge room, and then Shepherd was the next.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> That is directly contrary to what you told the Magistrate; you said that Shepherd said, "Redworth knows all about it," and afterwards that Redworth said that it was Shepherd and Alford who did it; now you say that Shepherd said so; which was said first? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Redworth said in the first place that Shepherd and Alford were in the cellar, and afterwards when Shepherd came into the charge room he said, "Shepherd knows the whole of it"—what I said before the Magistrate was quite correct; I believe Shepherd was in the charge room first.</p>

I am a police-sergeant of Uxbridge—I was at the station about 5 o'clock in the evening, when the prisoners were brought in—they were so drunk that I could not have them in together—Shepherd was brought in first, and I told him that he was charged with breaking into Mr. Kenyon's cellar, and stealing his wine—he made no observation about the wine, but wanted to speak to Mr. Kenyon—I was there the whole time—Redworth was afterwards brought in—he said that he wished to speak to Mr. Kenyon, that it was Alford and Shepherd who broke into the cellar, and the servant and Mr. Kenyon's grandson knew it, pointing to the servant, who was in the charge room, and saying, "There she is"—they were then locked up—the reserve man, Turton, <hi rend="italic">T</hi> 93, after<lb></lb>wards told me something, and I went to the cell door, and heard Shepherd speaking to Turton—I heard him say that Alford got into the cellar, and handed out the wine to Redworth, and they carried it across the road into the skittle ground, that they called him and gave him some of it to drink, and if we went to the loft over the skittle ground we should find some wine covered over with a mat, and that some of the bottles were thrown down the privy by Alford—I then went to the loft, and found eight bottles of sherry, two bottles of stout, and an empty quart bottle—I searched the privy with Cheetham, and found one empty quart bottle—I went back to the station, and told Shepherd that I had found these things; he said that other parties put them there, and not him.</p>

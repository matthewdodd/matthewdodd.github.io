On the 28th of March, the bell rang - I asked who was there-the prisoner answered, it was him, and he wanted to see my master, and that he had got a letter for him. I opened the gate, and asked him for the letter. He said, he had not got one, but wanted to write to my master. I told him, I had no paper - He said, he had got paper, and pushed by me, and went up the garden into the passage, and into the parlour. I put the candle down for him, and went into the kitchen for pen and ink. I heard the glasses jingle as I came up, and met the prisoner in the passage. He said, he would not write, but I was to give his compliments to my master when he came home - He said, he came from Highgate. I I went into the parlour, and found the stand empty. I told him he had got something out of the parlour - He denied it. I fastened the door, and told him I would have them before he went away. He pulled the cruets out, and told me not to make a noise, as he only did it in fun. Newton came up stairs and secured him. He could have got out before I got up stairs. He did not take any paper out.</p>

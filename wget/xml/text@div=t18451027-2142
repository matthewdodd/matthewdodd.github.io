                  </hi>. I am in the service of Tobias Child, leather-dresser, John-street, Dockhead. The prisoner was in his employ—in consequence of suspicion, I was directed by my master to watch him, which I did, from four o'clock to six, in the afternoon of the 22nd of Sept., and at half-past five I saw him in the warehouse—he staid there about a quarter of an hour—the leather grafts are kept there—he went in again afterwards, and remained there about ten minutes—I saw a bit of coloured leather in his hand—he could not see me—I told Mr. John Child what I had seen—he and Tyler went into the warehouse.</p>

The prisoner was in his service twelve or thirteen weeks the last time—the leather was kept in the warehouse—Hogan gave me information—I examined the warehouse, and missed two pairs of grafts—they are in imitation of French grafts for boots—I got a policeman—the prisoner left the premises about twenty minutes after, and was stopped about four yards from the gate—I saw the police-man take his hat off—he found two pairs of grafts in it—they have our shop-mark and my initials on them.</p>

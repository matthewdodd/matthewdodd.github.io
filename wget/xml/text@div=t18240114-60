             had a quarrel about jumping in sacks; Gibson had a sack of his master's (Fawcett,) and George's master was owner of the sacks they were jumping in. George claimed the sack Gibson had; words arose, Fawcett said,</p>
               <p>"If it is not his sack, you have no occasion to be bouncing about it, my man shall fight you for a leg of mutton and trimmings." one shilling was staked by each of them, they were to fight on the following Monday, but Gibson did not come forward. They met at the Bird-Cage on Wednesday, there was no malice or anger; about seven hundred people were present; the prisoner was there and took part in it. I cannot exactly say what the prisoner did, but he picked Gibson up at different times. Pell was the principal man, he was Gibson's second; it was a very equal match, and appeared a fair fight to me; only at the first round Gibson hit 
               <persName id="t18240114-60-person612">Charles</persName>
             a foul blow - they all called out</p>
               <p>"foul" - they fought an hour and five minutes; George had the best of it for the first half hour; nobody endeavoured to part them but Lloyd; he went to Gibson, and said, he had better leave off; but he said, he thought too much of his sovereign, and persisted in fighting; about the end of the battle, George struck a blow on the head and temple, and Gibson fell several times; he received several blows on the head, they were given fair; he fell at the last blow, and could not get up; Gibson was beat very much, and had one eye blinded; he died in about twenty minutes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. The deceased was your brother. - A. Yes; he applied to the prisoner to be his second on the day of the fight; but he said he would rather not, and my brother got Pell for a second.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the prisoner from the beginning of the fight, tell your brother he had better leave off - A. I cannot tell, because I was not near enough; I did not tell my brother, that if I was him I would fight till I died. I advised him to leave off.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner do any thing more, than humanely assist your brother when he saw him down - A. No, he picked him up several times, and washed his face with a spunge.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he interfere with George at all. - A. No, my Lord.</p>

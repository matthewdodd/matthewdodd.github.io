               <p>Q. Was there any other person coming by at the time? - A. I spoke to this Jew to buy these goods; I told him I had not money to pay for them, and I went to get a constable, and when I came back the Jew was gone; and I saw another man, an Irishman, in the fair, felling a black coat of mine; and a deep blue coat; I told him it was mine, and then a constable came to my assistance, and in going through the fair I met with the same Jew again, and, in consequence of his information, we went together to Mr. Harris's, in Russel-court, Drury-lane; he had sold the things to the Jew, and the Jew sold them to the Irishman; they are in court, in the possession of the constable; the shirts I never found; we found the gown-piece at Mr. Harris's.</p>
               <p>(Cross-examined by Mr. Ally.) I live in Woolpack-street, Westminster, and keep a house of lodgers; I discharged this soldier out of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Is any body concerned with you in the profits of your lodgings? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What time was it when you quitted your house? - A. About nine at night.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you leave behind you in the house? - A. I left three lodgers in the one-pair-of-stairs, and, I believe, the two were in the two-pair-of-stairs, but this soldier was not in the house at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. How do the lodgers open the door, on the outside? - A. They call to the others; my apartments were locked up; there were two locks.</p>
               <p>Q. Your lodgers could let themselves in and out when you were out? - A. Yes; one had got a key, and the rest let one another in.</p>
               <p>Q. They were all lost out of your own room? - A. Yes; the front room, below stairs.</p>
               <p>- HARRIS sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 6th of November the prosecutor came with some peace officers to my house, with a Jew that I had sold six coats to that morning about ten o'clock; I bought them of the prisoner at the bar the day before; I bought the gown-patch in the morning, about eleven o'clock; in the evening of the same day he came again, with six coats and a burying cloak. (Produces the gown patch.)</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know the coats again that the prisoner sold to you? - A. I cannot say; I bought them in the evening, and when I looked at them the next morning I saw they were a parcel of rags, and would not suit my shop; I called in several Jews to look at them, as we shopkeepers usually do, when we have things not good enough for our shops; I sold them to this man for half-a-guinea, which was what I gave for them; the prisoner was present when I sold them for half-a-guinea.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ally. Q. He came to you first about eleven o'clock? - A. Yes; and he came about five in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was it? - A. The 5th of November.</p>
               <p>Q. He produced a card? - A. Yes; I am very cautious who I buy of; I asked how he came by it; he told me he had been recommended to me by a person that, from his description, I supposed to be my brother-in-law; he told me what size he was; he said he did not know his name, nor were he lived.</p>
               <p>Q. You would not have purchased these things but for his producing the card? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you in the habit of shewing these cards to your customers? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How came the prisoner to be found out? - A. When I was taken, on Friday the 5th of November, the constable let me go upon giving my word for my appearance the next day; I went to my brother-in-law and told him I had bought a gown patch and six coats, and he told me he was a recruiting serjeant.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing as to the custom of an allowance to be made to the recruiting serjeant for the old cloaths? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Capon. This gown patch is mine; I bought it of a poor woman; she said it was at Mr. Brown's pawn-shop; the poor woman went to her parish in Clerkenwell; I have had it three or four years.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a married man? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. What occasion then had you for such a thing? - A. I thought I might have occasion, perhaps, for another wife.</p>
               <p>Harris. There are four yards and an half of it.</p>
               <p>Court. There is no particular mark about it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the same you bought of the prisoner? A. Yes; I gave him 12s. 6d. for it.</p>
               <p>Capon. This is the coat I bought out of a pawn shop, about a year, or a year and a half ago; this blue coat I bought at Rag-fair; and this surtout coat I bought in Tothill-street, I have had it about a year and an half; this burying cloak the church-warden of the parish gave me; this black coat I bought of a lodger about a year and an half ago.</p>

            So that you have no doubt about these things; - A. I can positively certain make oath to all of them; they were all missed at the same time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ally. They had been lying by you some time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. As to the cotton you have never opened it? - A. No, nor looked at it so as to know what it was; I have had it so long in my custody that I can positively swear to it.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Harris). Look at those coats again. - I believe them to be the same that I bought of the prisoner, and sold to the Jew; the cloak is patched in several places.</p>
               <p>Harris, cross-examined by Mr. Ally. Q. Do you mean to undertake to swear, having them in your possession so short a time, that they are the same? - A. I cannot positively swear, but I believe them to be the same.</p>
               <p>Q. When the prisoner was taken, did he not tell you the name of the persons he had them of? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at those things, and see if you know any of them. - Yes, these are the coats I took with me to Mr. Harris's shop; Harris acknowledged he sold them to a Jew.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. Please your Lordship, and Gentlemen of the Jury-At Bow-street I told the magistrates where I had these things from; and when I went to sell the gown patch to Mr. Harris, the man that owned it went with me; and Mr. Harris gave me 2s. for being recommended by his brother-in-law; their names were Cranmer and Martin; there was a young man in company at the time; they wanted me to buy a gown piece; I got acquainted with them by being in the recruiting service; they are what are called bringers, to persuade men to enlist, at which they were very successful; I told them I knew a person who was only beginning business, a Jew, and he would buy it; Cranmer and I went to Harris's, and he gave me 2s.; I told him, it was customary for me to have an allowance for all I bought or sold, or caused to be bought or sold, of 2s. in the pound, and he agreed to do it; Cranmer had the half guinea, and we went back to Martin, and they shared the money between them; I went to the Bunch-of-Grapes, in the Little Sanctuary; Mr. Harris will not deny that I carried a man with me each time; I went there several times, and if I had stole them, I should hardly have carried them where I was known; this man went with me, and sold the coats, and they gave the young man a shilling for carrying them, who will appear upon my trial; I went to Mr. Harris next morning for the shilling, and he was selling of them to the Jew, for the same money that he gave me for them, and therefore could not give me any thing out of it; I did it in my integrity, without any deception or fraud, not knowing they were stole any more than any gentleman in court; I gave in the names of the two men to the magistrates at Bow-street.</p>

Yes; on the 3d of November, I was with the prisoner all day, and at night he went home with me to my lodgings, in Little Welbeck-street, Cavendish-square; and the landlord did not wish for the prisoner to come to my lodgings, as he knew nothing at all about him; he charged the watch with him, and put him in the watch-house.</p>

               <p>Q. Recollect very exactly and very concisely; you say you staid there the remainder of that day and all of that night? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Should you know it again? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Where did you go from the Parade, and who with? - A. To a public-house in the Strand, with those two men we met upon the Parade.</p>

               <p>Q. How long did you remain with you? - A. He did not leave me at all; the man returned with him to the public-house.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you remain at this public-house in company with the prisoner? - A. A few minutes, I believe, and then we went to the prisoner's house.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You left the two men behind? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any appointment made to meet afterwards, and for what business? - A. There was to be a house-warming at the Bunch-of-Grapes, in the Little Sanctuary; these two men that had the gown-piece said they had got six great coats to sell; they asked Farmilo if he could fell these great coats.</p>
               <p>Court. This was after you got to the Bunch-of-Grapes? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who went to the Bunch-of-Grapes? - A. I and the prisoner and altogether.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it was these two men that said they had these coats to sell? - A. Yes; they asked the prisoner if he would sell them for them; and the prisoner and I went up stairs with the men that belonged to them.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was that? - A. I cannot say; it was one of the two men; the coats were tied up in a dirty looking thing, and I carried them to Mr. Harris's.</p>

I saw the two male prisoners in the parlour - there were two or three more persons with them, drinking together round a small table - Mr. Baker was drinking with them. Mr. Ifould made some application to me about discounting a bill before we entered the house; and when there we spoke about it in a tone that might be heard by others. I produced a canvass bag with 75 l. in notes; the parties round the small table could have seen it; we sat opposite them: there was a 5 l. Uxbridge note, signed

            . We were talking about my horse - the other party joined in the conversation; I had given the notes to Ifould to count, and he put them into the bag again, which drew up with a string - I put it into my right hand breeches pocket, but one end of the string remained out of my pocket; the two male prisoners went out with me to the door; one was before, and the other behind me - the one behind me shoved me, and I made a little bit of a slip; the other pretended to save my falling; I did not see him pull the bag from me, nor did I feel it go, but I am certain I had put it into my pocket the minute before I went to the door - I came back to the room in about five or seven minutes, and missed my money soon after. I had received all the Bank of England notes from a person of the name of Jones, at the Coopers' Arms, public-house, West-street, Smithfield. When I returned into the parlour the prisoners were gone. On the Wednesday following I was at the Police office; I saw the three prisoners there. I heard Osman say that the woman was his wife. The Uxbridge note was 5 l.; there was one 20 l., four 10 l. notes, and two 5 l. Bank notes; the Uxbridge note had</p>
               <p>"Five Pounds" in letters, in blue ink, upon the face of it - this note I have in my hand, for 5 l., No. 16,915, is one of those I had from Jones; it was in the bag. I got it last from the Bank of England, on the day the prisoners were examined - it has Jones's hand-writing upon it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You produce this as a 5 l. note that was in the bag - A. Yes; I did not take notice of the number, but it has the name of Smirke in Jones's hand-writing. I know that note very well. I was not in liquor when before the Magistrates, but I was rather fresh on the night of the robbery; I was sober enough before I went into the house - but I got a little there. I was there an hour and a half before I went to the door. I had been in the parlour about half an hour before I pulled out my notes - I was not very fresh then. I put the purse into my pocket about an hour before I went to the door. I only drank with Mr. Ifould - I did mention his name before the Magistrate; there were four persons sitting together, and two of them went out to look at the horse, and I went with them - they went out with their hats on. There are two or three steps at the door. I was in the house after I went to the door for about three quarters of an hour. Mr. Baker was in the room when I came back, but he soon withdrew, and so did his companion - he was gone before I missed my money. There were other persons in the room - I suppose ten or twelve: it was the time of Bartholomew fair.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182409160079"></xptr>Baker did not tell me that night that he saw the notes taken. I missed my purse seven or eight minutes after I returned to the room. I am a discounter of bills, not jointly with others, but to serve a friend. Baker came to my house on Tuesday. I told the Magistrate it was Tuesday or Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Re-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. I was not quite certain which day it was: Baker came down without my sending for him; I slipped on the top of the steps in consequence of the man pushing me - Baker was not at the door at the time I slipped: I did not go out at all with them - when I returned to the room Baker was there, and about two yards from the - he did not come nearer to me - I am positive he was not within arms' reach of me: I sat in the parlour, on the right hand of the door, and their table was on the left, where Baker was: when I came into the room, the table he was sitting at was about two yards from me, and there was a table between us - he appeared to be looking at the horse when I came in; there were curtains to the windows, partly drawn, but not wholly; he could see the horse through the aperture - I did not say that other persons went out at the same time, and one of them had a sustain jacket.</p>

Bank note, and a 5 l.

On Saturday night, the 4th of September, about eight o'clock, White came in a hackney-coach, and offered a 5 l. note of the Uxbridge New Bank; it had the amount in large letters on the front of it in blue ink; I did not at first change it. He produced a 20 l. Bank of England note. I afterwards changed the 5 l. note. He came to my house again on the Monday morning, about ten o'clock, and said he came to ask what note he changed with me on the Saturday night, whether it was a 5 l. or 10 l.; the box<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182409160080"></xptr>was searched to find it, and he said the person from whom he had taken it said it was 10 l., and he wished for the note to convince him that it was 5 l.

            . I am driver of the hackney-chariot, No. 802. I was at Barnet on the first day of the fair. I took the prisoner White, and a man in a fustian jacket. They got in together at the Lying-in hospital. I agreed to take them there and back for 15 s., besides the chance of passengers on the road. I took them there, and brought back White and the man in the fustian jacket, and one other person. I got to Barnet between twelve and one o'clock, and returned about seven. I took them to Mr. Bevan's, the Star, in the City-road.</p>

            . I keep the Coopers' Arms, in West-street.

I gave them to him between the 12th and 20th of August.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. How do you know this note. - A. By having written the name of Smirke on it. I never took but this and another from him. From the writing, and the note having been worn, I know that it was in my possession. I paid no notes to any one but Mr. Fullwood, from the 4th of August to the 1st of September; I gave him 107 l. in change for silver, and seven country notes.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 8th of September I took the female prisoner into custody; both the male prisoners were then in custody. She and another came in a coach to the office, and she enquired whether there were two persons in custody. She would not give her address, but I had a search-warrant, and found where she lived. I got a key from her which opened her door, at No. 1, Lancaster-place, North-street, City-road, and found a bill of parcels in a drawer in her room.</p>

            . I am a master pork-butcher, and live in Old-street, and am acquainted with a person of the name of 
               <persName id="t18240916-214-person1775">Thos. Baker</persName>
            . I have heard him say that he once was a regular prig, and lived by prigging; he told my man so, and the man told it to me and my wife and to two officers. He said it to me when I lived with him as journeyman, eleven or twelve months ago. I left him in January last. I would not believe him upon his oath, and no man in London would ever say that Mr. Baker would take an oath without it was a great falsehood. I left him because he charged me with stealing a pig's head, when I only asked him civilly for my wages; and he said, if I would confess it, and go away, he would say no more about it; I would not, and he then sent for an officer. I then lived with Mr. Robinson, in Brick-lane, about three weeks, and then set up for myself in Old-street, as a pork-butcher, about two hundred yards from Mr. Baker. I know nothing of either of the men at the bar; I do not think I ever saw them in my life. I never was in custody except on Baker's charge. I have seen Vann several times, but was never in his custody. It was not for stealing sausages that Baker turned me off; he gave me a character to Mr. Robinson nine years ago. The last time I was at Mr. Baker's is about six weeks ago; I saw him last night; I did not tell him that if he came to this trial I would try to transport him, but I told to Mr. Brough's man, and to Baker's man, that he once tried to transport me, and said if he came here to-day, I would be here, and tell the truth. I lived with Mr. Stoke's, of Aylesbury-street, and left him because I was sweeping the floor and found 6 d., and went with his nephew and spent it. Mr. Stokes did not charge me with robbing him of silk. I bought some, and gave it to his wife that he might give me a good character, which he did.</p>
               <p>By the COURT. Q. When Baker charged you with stealing the pig's head, did you go before a Justice - A. Yes; but they dismissed the charge. Fordham was the officer that took me.</p>

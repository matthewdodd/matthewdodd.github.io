                  </hi> My husband's name is George Fisher; he lives at No. 149, Leadenhall-street, and is a hair-dresser. On Thursday, the 24th of Dec., I was sitting in a room adjoining the shop, and heard a noise at the shop-door—I went there—a gentleman came in to ask some question, he opened the door, and he shut it as he came into the shop—I noticed the prisoner come from behind the counter, stooping down—I called to my sister, who was going through the shop, not to allow her to go out of the shop—I noticed the prisoner's features—I had seen her in the shop about half an hour previously—she was begging then—she went out, and I shut the door after her—no customer came in during that half-hour—there is no difficulty in opening the door from the outside, only turning the latch—I examined the till behind the counter—it was open, and I missed a box in which gold and silver money was kept—I said the box was gone with gold in it—the prisoner immediately stooped forward, and threw the box down on the ground, with one of the half-sovereigns and a 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece in it—she had previously thrown down two half-sovereigns—I heard her drop them—I got a candle, and found the box where she had placed it, on the ground, with one half-sovereign and a small silver 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece in it—the two half sovereigns were on the ground close by the side of it—it had contained that money—the house is in the parish of St. Peter, Cornhill—the prisoner must have opened the door to get in—my husband had opened the door when he went out, and I heard him close it—she must have turned the handle, as nobody had come in—I lost nothing else.</p>

            . I live in Wilson-place, Gray's-inn-lane, and am a shoe-maker. I was coming down Keppel-street, on the 3d of March, and saw the two prisoners walking towards Tottenham-court-road - they had each of them a basket - I saw Hodges stop at the corner of Torrington-street - Corrick went down the street, and down the area steps - I went on the opposite side and saw him come up; he met Hodges again, and they went towards Russell-square; I then rang the bell and the servant came down; I asked if she had lost any thing - she said she had lost a purse - I went after them to Heurietta-street, and got assistance to take them: 1s. 6d. was found on Corrick, and the purse in his coat pocket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you at the office? A. Yes - my foreign name is Lewis Nicco, which I kept till my mother married again; I never was in any of the police-offices as a witness - I once went to apply for relief, when I was in distress, three or four months ago - it was before Mr. Rogers, at Hatton-garden - the beadle of the parish was with me; I was once taken up for stealing my master's money: I have not said this was a silk purse.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How near was Green to either of the prisoners, while you were going to the office? A. He went close to them - they were hand-cuffed together, and he was behind them - they were searched in the watch-house - there was nothing in the purse - the silver was in his waistcoat pocket.</p>

I came into the watch-house as they were being searched - the purse, the key, and the money were on the table; I said "Who did you take them from;" Green said "I took the key from Hodges, and the purse from Corrick;" I said to Corrick "Is this your purse?" he said Yes, he had it some time.(Purse produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>HODGES' Defence. I was standing, with my elbow on the post, and was going home, when they came and took me; Green said "Let Hodges go - we don't want him;" the other man said "We may as well take them both."</p>

               <p>anything about Furze's case—I was at the Halifax Arms about 7 o'clock on 2nd February, it might be between 7 and 8 o'clock, I think it was before 8 o'clock—I walked with Mackay to the station, as he did not know the way—on the road I said it was a very serious thing of him locking a man up in a case like this—he made use of very obscene language and said he did not care, he knew as much as Davis did, and he would b----up the license at the Halifax Arms unless his friends came down in the morning with 150 <hi rend="italic">quid</hi>, and if I was a friend of his I ought to produce some portion of it—I know the prisoner's handwriting, these letters (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are all in his writing.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It was about the middle part of the day when Mackay gave his evidence at the Police Court, somewhere about dinner time—I did not take a note of what he said, I am speaking from memory—I did not give my evidence till 15th April—I had the Halifax Arms once myself, I bought it about this time twelve months and sold it to Davis—I had the Rose at the same time as the Halifax Arms—I was at the Grapes in Houndsditch about eighteen months ago, I sold that and lived out of business for a month—I then bought the Rose and the Halifax Arms together—I kept the Rose and put my son-in-law, Mr. Morgan, in the other as 1 could not hold two licenses; the Halifax Arms was transferred to Davis just before last Christmas—Morgan was in it about nine months, or six or seven months—I did not keep a beershop in Boston Street, Hackney Road, I had a licensed public-house there, I sold it ten years ago, I had it about eighteen months and sold it to very good advantage—I have had thirteen licensed houses in the city and suburbs within twenty-six years.</p>

                  </hi>. I am managing Common Law clerk to Messrs. Burchell, solicitors in the Broad Sanctuary, Westminster—they are the solicitors acting for Messrs. Carter Wood, the brewers—I was at the Police Court on 3rd February, when this case against Davis was heard before Mr. Hannay—I took a note of what Mackay swore on that occasion (<hi rend="italic">referring to it</hi>) he said that his name was William Mackay, living at 3, Thomas Street, Hackney Road, a licensed victualler's broker—on Monday night last, 1st February, he was at the Halifax Arms, at the house kept by Davis, it was a benefit night of a friend of his—he said "He asked me to take some tickets, and 1 took 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth, I took the trouble to send them out; in the evening I went to the Halifax Arms, I went upstairs into the club-room. When I came downstairs 1 walked to the bar; I was standing at the far end of the bar, the prisoner was standing talking to another man, I heard Davis say to the other man Get a card out of his pocket, he has got some <hi rend="italic">quids.</hi> Then Furze came round the corner and stood on my right hand side, I felt somebody's hand in my pocket, and I missed my pocket handkerchief. There were two women there, one of the women said 'I saw him put his hand into your pocket.' Directly Davis had said this Furze went round to my pocket. There was a very rough lot there, and I gave instructions to a detective and he captured Furze, and in the evening I took Davis. There was 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold and papers in the pocket-book; I found the papers in my box this morning at my private residence.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Notes were taken by the Magistrate's clerk—I took <hi rend="italic">down</hi> all I thought material, we were acting for the defence—I took down every word he said in chief, and the cross-examination as far as it goes—he may have said a little more—I did not give evidence before the Magistrate when the prisoner was charged with perjury—I heard Towsey give evidence as to what he heard Mackay say—I don't remember an objection being taken by Mackay—Mr. Hannay sent for the depositions that had been taken on 3rd February, and they were produced, they were written in a book—I don't think I had this paper in my pocket at the time, it was at the office—I did not tell the Magistrate that I had taken it, it was not necessary—I did not mention to anybody that I had taken it, I brought it here to-day with other papers in the action, because I thought it might be wanted—there were two actions brought by Mackay, one against Davis and one against Towsey—he admitted in both actions that he had not any ground for the claim—the first writ was on 18th January 1875, for 42<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., there had been a writ before that, but we had nothing to do with that, Mackay had settled that between himself and Davis—I believe the claim on 18th January was for cash lent and work and labour done—Davis brought the writ to me—I took his written instructions to enter an appearance, which I did in due course—Mackay delivered a declaration on 28th January, and notice of trial, and we pleaded in due course on 10th February—here is the replication dated 18th March, I suppose the issue would be delivered with it—he was not threatened that if he proceeded with the action there would be a summons for perjury against him, I believe a summons was applied for about 25th March—the action is not still pending—it was put an end to by a letter from Mackay "I hereby withdraw from both my actions, and I further undertake and agree never to proceed with them, and also to pay whatever law costs have been incurred; with regard to the charge I made against Mr. Davis, I entirely exonerate him from the same"—I heard that letter read before the Magistrate—in another letter he not only counter<lb></lb>manded the notice of trial, but he said that his attorney had been acting without his instructions.</p>

That he stopped—I am not aware that he negotiated with the brewers for the loan of the money for me to go into the house; I did not; Mr. Towsey did 1 believe—the brewers offered to advance me 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., being a public man, but I did not know that Mackay had been the means of getting it; I swear that—1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was the price of the house—Mackay did not <hi rend="italic">get</hi> four bills of 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each for me for the other hundred pounds; he did not get them accepted, he got one and kept the money—one I took away and gave back to the party, because I did not want it; the 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that he kept I had borrowed from another gentlemen, or I could not have gone into the house, and the other two I paid—Mr. Towsey discounted one—Mackay did not get it discounted—a wine merchant dis<lb></lb>counted the other; I did not know the wine merchant—it was accepted on the night of the change, nobody got him to accept it; he offered to do so and I was offered money besides by Mr. Muddle, a friend of mine, a publican—the negotiation was going on for five or six weeks before I got into the house—I saw Mackay in reference to it during that time, twenty times I should think; it might have been more or less, and he kept writing letters to me to go and see him—he did not tell me of communications he had had with the brewers, he told me of communications he had had with Mr. Towsey—he never told me that he had seen the brewers, or that he had been several times to them to induce them to advance the money; he told me that Mr. Towsey had—I have not gone with Mackay to the brewers; I met him there once, he went to give me a good character if I required one—he did not give a written guarantee to pay the four 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bills if I did not take them up;</p>

On the night in question there was a benefit for Bob Travers, not a sparring match—I should think there were 100 persons upstairs—there were a few fighting men among them, no woman—I decline to answer whether there was a rat match there a short time before—I should think Mackay came downstairs on this night about 10.30, from that to 11 o'clock—there might have been eight or nine or ten persons at the bar when he came down, not more than a dozen—I knew most of them as customers, and knew several of their names—there were several women and their husbands; I knew them—there were no women of the town to my knowledge; I am sure of that, I don't, allow them there—there was a man "named Grant, a labourer and his wife, and Armstrong and his wife; I knew them as customers they are not here—at the time this is said to have happened they were drinking at different parts of the bar; there was no noise or confusion, everything was quiet—I was behind the bar with Mr. Payne, he lives at the house; he goes by the name of Beverley because his wife is a professional singer—he has lived in the house almost ever since I have been there—I do not know Joseph Donaldson—I never heard of a man complaining of being drugged and attempted to be robbed at my house at the end of January—all the time I have been in the house I have never had a complaint till Mackay made it—I know that he took some tickets for this benefit; I don't know how many, or the price—Furze was no acquaintance of mine; I knew him from coming to the house, for a month I should think—I knew nothing about his antecedents till I was told by Detective Cowley, and I then forbade him the house and he has not been since; that was after this—I don't know where he is—my brother was there that night; he is not here—I believe he was conducting the room upstairs for the man that had the benefit—he was downstairs at the time this happened—Jane Harrison was not there that I know of—there were one or two women there that Mackay used to write to and treat; they were his friends, not mine—Turk was not there at 10.30.</p>

I live at the Halifax Arms, Halifax Street, and am a house decorator—I was there on 1st February assisting Davis, the proprietor, from 11 o'clock till about 12.30 at night—I saw the prisoner there—he came downstairs from the club-room about 11 o'clock or 11.15, as near as I can recollect—I was at that time behind the bar with Davis—I saw Furze in front of the bar—I did not hear Davis say to Furze while Mackay was in front of the bar "Get a card out of his pocket, he has <hi rend="italic">quids</hi>"—the bar is a pretty large one; a good middlingsized bar—if it had been said I must have heard it—I did not hear him speak to him at all—I did not hear anything said by anybody about Furze having his hand in Mackay's pocket—I did not see Davis speak to Furze and then see Furze go and stand by the side of Mackay—if he had done so I must have seen it—I did not hear any women say anything—Furze left about 12.15 or 12.20—he did not return again that night—Mackay had had some drink in the house—he did not pay for it—he said "Put it down to the old score"—we had some bother in getting him out that night—we had to send for two policemen to get him out—they removed him—I did not hear him say a word about having been robbed—if he had made such a complaint in the presence of the policemen. I must have heard it—next morning, Tuesday, I was in the Halifax Arms at 11 o'clock, when Davis was there, behind the bar—Mackay came in; he called for some ale, and after he had drunk it he said "Now, you <hi rend="italic">sods</hi>, I am going to <hi rend="italic">nick</hi> a ticket-of-leave man, and if that don't settle the license of the b----Halifax Arms I will do it by fair means or four—he did not charge Davis with anything that morning—he then left the house—I have never passed by the name of Beverley; they called me Beverley because they knew my wife in that name; that was her maiden name, and she is a professional singer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> They call me Beverley at the public-house—I am a house decorator—I was at my work last week—I can't tell how many persons had been upstairs at the benefit—I was not upstairs—I did not see any sparring—when I came home about 10.45 I should think there were about fourteen or fifteen persons in the bar—I heard the prisoner say before the Magistrate after I had given my evidence "Do you find, sir, that I said it was 10 o'clock"—I did not hear Mr. Hannay say "That is so, and it would certainly seem to make this gentleman's evidence valueless"—I did hear the defendant say that he had stated that the robbery took</p>

               <p>place at 10 o'clock—I saw him come down from the room—I knew the people in front of the bar as customers—there were some women there—some of the people were drinking, and some were not—Mackay appeared to me to be drunk—I had seen a good deal of him at the public-house, and he had been drinking a good deal there—I never knew Furze, till I saw him at the house, and I believe that was the first time I had seen him—in my life—I knew the names of one or two persons who were in front of the bar—I don't know Jane Harrison—I know a girl, they used to call "Jane," and who came there—I don't know anyone of the name of Donaldson—I was never present at a rat match—I never heard anything about it—I did not hear there had been a complaint that a man had been robbed there before—I lived at this public-house, because Mr. Davis was a friend of mine, and he asked me to come and help him in the bar in the evening—I am married to Miss Beverley, and she still retains her maiden name—she lives at this house—she sings of a night—I have not seen much roughness in that neighbourhood—not more than there is in any other part of London.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> After the prisoner came from the upstairs room he remained downstairs for about half an hour before he left—I served him with some drink after he came downstairs.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 65, Beaumont Square, and am a publican out of business—on the morning of 2nd February, I was in Mackay's company with Towsey—we went to the Halifax Arms, at that time Davis had just been given into custody—I went down to the station, and on the way I asked Mackay what was the cause of it, and he said "I know what I am about. I know as much as Charles Davis, unless I get 100 <hi rend="italic">quid</hi> I will b----up the license of the Halifax Arms"—those were his words as near as I can remember.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I don't remember whether or not I told the officer what I have now stated, in fact I am certain that I did not—I don't know what you mean by asking me if I am a pugilist, I should not allow a man to take a liberty with me—I have never fought in the ring—I have had a <hi rend="italic">good</hi> many fights, and I should to-day if any one molested me—I have never fought by appointment for money—I could not tell you how many fights I have had, I have had so many—my last fight was some time back, I am getting too old—I don't know Furze, I never knew such a man—I have never been a witness in this Court before to my knowledge—I have been a witness—I remember the stamp office robbery at Manchester, it was tried at Manchester; I went down there; I was subpoenaed as a witness for the pri soner—I don't remember a watch robbery in St. Martin's Court in London—I was not a witness here in the watch robbery that I recollect, if I have ever been I must have forgotten it for I don't recollect it—I don't recollect that I have given evidence in this Court.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I attended on the morning of the 3rd at the Worship Street Police Court for the purpose of giving my evidence—the charge was dismissed on the evidence of Mackay before the Defendant had the oppor<lb></lb>tunity of calling witnesses.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">re-called</hi>). I received this letter of the 10th April; it is in Mackay's handwriting.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> That is the letter that Mackay brought himself, or else it was brought by his daughter—he called upon me when he came out of prison and begged of me to withdraw from this charge—he came out on a Saturday, I think—he was kept in prison till he found bail, and after he obtained bail he came to me with his wife—I think the letter was written the day before he came, but I won't be positive—I am sure the letter was written before I had an interview with him—his wife came first and sent him the next day or the same day—I did not have any conversation with him about that letter, or with anyone on his behalf—the letter stated "I hereby withdraw from both my actions against you two, and I further undertake to agree never to proceed with them against you in any circumstances whatever"—there was no arrangement that if he withdrew from the action that I was not to go on with the perjury—the summons for perjury had been taken out before the letter was written—he came to me and asked me to withdraw the summons—that was the same day or the next day after the letter was written—the letter was brought to me for me to take to the brewer to show them, to try and induce them to intercede with Davis to get him to give up the prosecution for perjury—I read the letter; it was in an envelope, but not closed—he brought the letter and gave it to me—I know now that he came with the letter—I did not go to Mr. Davis; I did not promise to go—his wife came on the same day that he brought the letter; she came in the morning and he came in the after noon—I was disgusted with him and her too, and I took no notice—I said that her husband was a very bad man and I would not intercede, if he wanted to see me he had better come, and he brought this letter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> This is the envelope in which the letter came—he gave it to me open, and it has never been sealed, (<hi rend="italic">The letters, proved to be in the prisoner's handwriting, addressed to the prosecutor, were read. The first few contained the charge of robbery, as appears in the evidence, and protesting that unless stopped and settled with he should proceed with the prosecution; the later letters were from the prison, withdrawing the accusation, and stating there there was no ground for the, charge he had made.</hi>)</p>

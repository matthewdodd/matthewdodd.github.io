               <p>What became of the husband? - I do not know, I have not seen him since.</p>
               <p>Is he run away? - The Justice did not commit him, he was discharged before the Magistrate: I found some of my things in East Smithfield, and some in the Minories, the pair of sheets were with Thomas Green.</p>
               <p>Is that pawn-broker here from East Smithfield? - No, the sheet is here.</p>
               <p>What way of life were this man and his wife? - They told me they were American Loyalists, and were waiting for money, and they promised us week after week to pay us, so I went into the room to see if my property was there, it was marked A. D.</p>
               <p>THOMAS GREEN sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a pawn-broker, this sheet was brought me from the prisoner, the 16th of July.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did you know the prisoner before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>To Prosecutor. Had these poor people paid you any rent? - Yes, they paid me five shillings, out of which I lent her half a crown and a shilling.</p>
               <p>In what way did the husband take it, from week to week, or for any considerable time? - It was not him that took it, he was not present.</p>
               <p>Court. Supposing the husband to be a party, and privy to this, the wife cannot be guilty; and it is impossible that the sheet could be missing from the bed without the husband's knowing it.</p>

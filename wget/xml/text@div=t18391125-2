                  </hi>. I keep a chandler's Shop in Ship-yard, Temple<lb></lb>bar. On Saturday, the 10th of August, the defendant was in my debt 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he came to my shop about five o'clock that day, and produced this paper—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"10th of August, 1839—Messrs. Barclay and Co., pay to self 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., as advised by Messrs. Gurney and Co. "—he said, "I am indebted to you something; if you let me have 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on this I will call or send you an order at the beginning of the week to make up the deficiency"—I let him have the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., supposing this to be a genuine paper, and that there was money in the bankers' hands to meet it—he told me if I went for it on Monday, or paid it to any of my tradespeople, or at the bank, it was as good as the Bank of England—I presented it, but it was not paid—I saw Mr. Chaston at the bank.</p>

Q.</hi> How many years have you known me? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Eight or nine—I cannot say to what amount we have done business—I do not know whether it was not 10002.—it was always honourably conducted until this—you never owed me any thing before—if this cheque had been paid I should have had to return you some money—the first time you were taken before the Magistrate you were dismissed—I offered to shake hands with you—I said it was no use to quarrel, and you said, "I will enter an action, and ruin you"—the Magistrate's advice was to go to Messrs. Gurney, to see if your statement was correct, and then I went to the banker's, and there was no effects—I did not say if this money was paid I would forego the prosecution—the money was never tendered me—some one came, and said something about it, but that was after it was out of my hands—after you were committed they offered me the money, and I referred them to</p>

               <p>Mr. Harmer—it was not tendered previous to your being committed, be<lb></lb>cause I took a solicitor to the Court for fear I should commit myself.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. The prosecutor was willing to receive his money, but the solicitor said there was 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for his expenses, to which I did demur.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the banking-house of Robert Barclay, Bevan, and Co. I have seen this cheque—we had no orders transmitted to us to meet it—I know that by reference to the books—we have an account with Messrs. Gurney's—if an order of this kind had been received from them I must have known it—the cheque was produced to me—I referred to the advice-book, and there were no orders—I have written "NO" at the corner—Messrs. Gurneys reside at Norwich—they have no London house—we are their agents—the prisoner kept no account with us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> How many banks have Gurney and Co.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About twenty-one, I believe—we have had cheques presented when there was no advice, but we do not pay them—we have paid cheques, expecting that the advice would arrive—if this had been presented as it is now I should have had a demur about paying it without the sanction of the firm, as it bas not "or bearer" on it—sometimes they put the words "or bearer" on it themselves.</p>

I took the prisoner into cus<lb></lb>tody—Duffey was with me—the prisoner said, "Duffey, I know I owe you the money, but I will see you d—d before I will pay you"—this was at the station-house in Bow-street—he appeared very angry.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I traversed this case from last Session, thinking I should have had a witness from Vienna, but as I do not think I should have been able to produce him, I did not traverse again—I have had considerable experience in banking-houses in London for fourteen years, and I have seen similar cheques to this, which have been paid—the sum of 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was to have been paid into one of Messrs. Gurney's banks on my account, and if I could have brought the witness I intended, he would have stated that he told me he was going to Yorkshire, and he would pay the money into one of Gur<lb></lb>ney's banks—but I have not seen him or heard from him since September—the money is still due to me—I had been at the Docks that day tasting some wine, and I called on the prosecutor, who has known me some time by my trusting him, and I said, Mr. Duffey, give me 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on this, and I will call on Monday or Tuesday, and receive the balance"—I was coming home on the Monday or Tuesday, and met the prosecutor, who said, "That cheque is not paid"—I said, "It will be in a day or two; 1 have trusted the man before, and he has never deceived me"—three or four days after<lb></lb>wards</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183911250007"></xptr>
               <p>I was surprised by being taken up—I was irritated, and said, "How could you think of treating me in the way yon have done?"—he said he did not care, he would go on—I went before Mr. Twyford and ex<lb></lb>plained the case—he dismissed the case, and in a few days I was taken again.</p>

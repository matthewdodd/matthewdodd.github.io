                  </hi>. I am a gold-lace maker, of 48, Brewer Street, Golden Square—about 3.15 on the morning of 19th June, I heard a noise in my back shop, and found a quantity of coats, trousers, and boots lying on the floor—I went into the shop, saw the prisoner, and said "Halloa! what are you doing here? drop that bundle"—he had a bundle containing a lot of my clothes—he made no answer—I said "I will have you"—he turned round, looked me full in the face, and jumped through the ground glass fan-light like a Harlequin, saying, "No you won't"—I informed the police, and saw him at the station a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes afterwards, with two of my coats on—he must have dressed himself in them just out<lb></lb>side my bedroom door, as two coats and a waistcoat were left there which were not mine—I had fastened up the place, and seen the things safe between 9 and 10 o'clock the night before—the sky-light was shut down, but not bolted—the entrance was obtained by the sky-light, as none of the doors were broken—my house is in the parish of St. James, Westminster.</p>

Q.</hi> Was it day-light? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, it was 3.30—I described one of my coats to the sergeant before I saw you—it had a pocket-book in the breast pocket, which I lost—before you were captured, I described you as having a dark moustache, sallow features, and short, with a long great coat on—I heard that you had a brother; you said "Don't prosecute me; if you like to go to my brother, he will give you some money, and make a man of you, and set you up in business"—the coat you are wearing is not mine—the shop which was broken into is under the same roof as my dwelling-house—there was no breaking to get in, as the sky-light was lifted up on its hinges, but there was breaking in getting away—you had to get on the roof, and drop down from the sky-light.</p>

On 19th June, about 3.30, I was in Peter Street, about a hundred yards from Brewer Street, and saw the prisoner running—I directed Waller to follow him—I went back into Brewer Street, and found a ladder close by the prisoner's house in Smith's Court—I am sure the prisoner is the man—I found these coats on the prosecutor's premises.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman C</hi> 151). On 19th June, about 3.30 a.m, I saw the prisoner running about 150 yards from the prosecutor's house, and away from it—I followed him to the corner of Edward Street, where he turned a corner when I was nearly overtaking him, and I lost sight of him for about five minutes—I saw him again in the closet of a yard at No. 14, St. Ann's Court, and am sure he is the same man as I saw running—as soon as I opened the door he sprang from the closet to a pair of steps, and then to the top of a wall 7 ft. high—he then went across two or three cisterns, and jumped down into the area of No. 13—I was still after him—I can jump pretty well—he went up a staircase, and through a small window, on to the roof—there was no means of my getting to the roof except by going to the second floor back, and I had to jump upwards to a stack of chimneys,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187207080026"></xptr>
               <p>and on to the roof—someone told me something, and I saw him lying crouched by the stack of chimneys, holding the far end of the chimney pots—he said "Are you coming after me?"—I said "Yes"—he said "I am b—d if I don't throw you over into the court"—I said "Here goes then," and by the time I reached the stack he sprang across the alley, which is 40 ft. deep and 5 ft. wide, into an aperture 44 ins. wide—I jumped across the alley after him, and into the aperture—he ran along a corridor, and I after him—he dodged me on the landing, and slipped down the second landing—I got hold of him, and he slipped away like an eel, through a passage, and in at several doorways, and got into an old lady's bedroom—the whole of the tenants ran out in their night-clothes, and it being rather dark I caught hold of an old gentleman in mistake, and the prisoner slipped out at the doorway, and went on to the first floor, and I after him—he looked over into the court below, but thought it was too far to drop, and ran into the entrance of the building, where I caught hold of him tight, and took him to the station—he was wearing the prosecutor's coats—he said, going along, "You might as well have given me a b—good hiding, and let me go"—he did not attempt to throw me down; he found it was no use.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did not I walk down the street? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You ran as hard as your legs could carry you—you had plenty of time to <hi rend="italic">chuck</hi> the coats away if you had stolen them—I ran after you because the coats did not seem to fit you very well.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I told the inspector I was an acrobat. A lot has been stated to-day which has not been stated before, the inspector took him to a private place and persuaded him. The man with the black moustache has got away. The robbery was committed at 3.30, and at 3.30 I picked the coats up. My brother is an acrobat, and I was running to see him; he is the only friend I have in the world; the coat was stolen, and I unfortu<lb></lb>nately put it on. When the policeman halloaed after me I would not come because I didn't want to be locked up, I only ran for a bit of a game to let him see he could not take me; he knocked me down and made me bleed, then he said I did it myself; he broke the cartilage of my throat, he bled me all over with his staff. When he first came he could not say I was the man.</p>

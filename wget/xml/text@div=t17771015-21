               <p>I lost two pair of thread stockings out of my shop in July last; I did not see the prisoner till he was brought back to the shop with the stockings: the prisoner asked pardon for taking so great a liberty as taking a parcel out of the shop. I took him before a magistrate; the parcel was then opened, which appeared to contain these two pair of stockings, which had been sold to a gentleman.</p>

               <p>The prisoner came into the shop, and asked to see some silk stockings; Mrs. Lovibond shewed him some; he asked if Mr. Lovibond was at home; she said, no; he said he would wait for his coming in: I was sent to look for my master; I did not like to go, as I suspected the prisoner; I soon returned; then I saw the prisoner making an attempt to put the parcel into his pocket; he saw me, and then he put them on the counter again; then he began fingering some hats, and then I saw him put that parcel into his pocket: as soon as he was gone out of the shop I told Mrs. Lovibond that he had taken the parcel; I pursued him: when I came up to him I said, you'll be so good as to leave that parcel behind you; he did not appear to hear me at first; I repeated it; then he took it out, and said there they are. Mrs. Lovibond came after him with two men, and desired he should be secured, which he was; he said he would go quietly; he was taken by a constable before the justice.</p>
               <p>[The stockings were produced.]</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. There is no particular mark on them, except being marked with four threads; but I had sold them to a gentleman, and had wrapped them up in that paper.</p>
               <p>KIRKPATRICK. When he was going to be carried before the justice he had no money but 6 d. in his pocket and a few halfpence.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called several witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>I am an optician's glass-grinder: on the morning of this robbery my wife was in labour; I was in St. Paul's Church-yard, an' please your Highness, I was near Mr. Baker's shop; I saw Pearce, he had a hat on with what they call the knucklers cock; I saw them go over to the church-rails; I went down Ludgate-hill, and came back again; then I saw Pearce and another man standing by Newbery's; one of them spoke, I don't know which; I went between them, and walked on as far as Mr. Thompson's, in London-house yard; I went to the Goose and Gridiron, and came back again; I walked about the place some time, and on turning round I saw the prisoner Pearce, and a man in a blue jacket, standing; then I saw Freeman, the patrol, and I told the watchman I had some suspicions; about ten minutes after, I went down Ludgate-hill, and at the corner of Ave-Maria-lane I saw Pearce coming down, and he went over to Creed-lane, and there was a man in a blue jacket; I told the watchman there was one of the men who had been lurking about for some time; then they laid hold of Pearce, and as soon as they laid hold of him I heard a rattle; I ran towards the Tobit's-dog, and saw Lewis run over the way; I am positive as to Pearce; I had never seen him before; the lamps gave a very good light, the night itself was dark; I did not speak to Pearce, or Pearce to me; the first time I saw him might be five-and-thirty minutes after four in the morning.</p>

               <p>My Lord, I had been drinking in Newgate-market, and about two o'clock I came with a woman to St. Paul's; she said she would go with me if I would call a coach; I called a coach, and went to Holborn, and from thence to Gough-square; the woman did not go with me, so I thought it was as well to go to somebody that I knew; when I got to Gough-square, I could not get in; therefore I walked back to Creed-lane, No. 2, a place well known: before the aldermen none of the watchmen could swear to me, or even say they knew me.</p>

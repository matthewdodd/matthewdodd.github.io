                  </hi>. I live at 9, Woburn Place, Russell Square—I am a member of the College of Physicians—I married the prisoner's stepdaughter—in 1878 I started a business in Lombard Street called the Metropolitan and Provincial Discount Association—the prisoner was then in my employment as manager of that business—this bill for 135<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., dated 12th June, 1879, drawn at three months, by the prisoner, purports to be accepted by J. Lamond Hemming—it is not my signature—to the best of my belief it is the prisoner's handwriting—I never gave him authority to accept it—the first time I saw it was at the latter end of January, 1880—in October, 1879, I received a letter from the solicitors to Messrs. Barkers' the bankers, in consequence of which I came up to town, and was on my way to Barkers' when I met the prisoner—I told him I was going to Messrs. Wordsworth, Blake, and Harris, on account of a letter I had received demanding payment of a dishonoured accept<lb></lb>ance of mine for 134<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said "Oh, give me the letter, it is my affair, I will set that all right; how stupid of them to make this mistake"—upon that I gave him the letter, and took no further steps in the matter two days after he told me that the thing was perfectly arranged and was all right—in January this year an execution was put into my house by the Sheriff under this bill for 135<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I made application to stay the execution, on the ground that the bill was a forgery—execution was stayed, and the action was abandoned, and I got the costs—the signature to this bill for 111<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. Is my handwriting—there are marks in pencil over the signature—that is the only bill I ever gave the prisoner—I was sued in the Divorce Court in the name of Hawkins.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Mr. Wise was the gentleman that brought the action against me in the Divorce Court—he was no friend of mine, I never saw him in my life—he cited me as a co-respondent as having committed adultery with his wife—the Judge considered that he had proved the statement—I did not appear—I then went by the name of Hawkins I did not describe myself as a medical practitioner then—I believe the entry was as a commercial traveller—I never had been a commercial traveller—I have been a medical practitioner since I qualified in 1877—I have kept dogs and have sold and bought</p>

               <p>dogs—I employed the prisoner to bet on the turf for me on one occasion—I was not a bookmaker—I had no bother with a lunatic asylum at Fulham—there were proceedings against me in Chancery for a dissolu<lb></lb>tion of partnership—I gave a cheque for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to the parties, which cheque I stopped within an hour, on the advice of my solicitor, but the money has since been paid—I did not go into a patent medicine business—there were some negotiations about it—the business in Lombard Street was started long before that, in connection with the prisoner—he was not a partner, he was the manager—I paid the rent—the premises were taken in the prisoner's name and mine as joint tenants—he brought no money into the concern; he was to work the business, I had to find the capital—he found the brains and I the money—he had no salary, he was to nave a share of the profits; he was not my partner; I did not look on it in that light—he had not the power of drawing what money he liked for himself—he took bills in his own name and sued on them—the rent was paid from the business; he paid it, but not out of his own money—I had nothing whatever to do with the business; I found the money, he conducted the business—the bill for 118<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was not a bill for his accommo<lb></lb>dation—I accepted it—that was in 1877, the business in Lombard Street was not started till August, 1878—the 118<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill was for my accommo<lb></lb>dation; he got it discounted at Barker's for me; it was not for the pur<lb></lb>poses of business—I will swear that other bills were not done in the same way, and that I never gave him authority to sign my name as acceptor—that was the only bill he ever drew for my accommodation—I did not state before the Magistrate that I gave the bill in November, 1877, lor Mr. Johnson's accommodation; if I did it was a mistake—I did not, on 4th November, 1877, accept a bill for 111<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., or on 17th June, 1877, a bill for 108<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., or on 25th November a bill for 133<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I never paid those bills—no applica<lb></lb>tion was ever made to me for any of these bills—this cheque of 28th June, 1877 was not the proceeds of those bills—they were for advances on Peruvian shares—I first beard of this forgery at the latter end of January, 1880, when the execution was put into my house; I had never seen the bill; I had a letter about it from Messrs. Wordsworth, demanding payment of this bill in October—I have not got the letter, I gave it to the prisoner—I did not answer that, I was going to see Messrs. Barker when I met the prisoner—I will swear that I never told him that when he wanted money he might accept for me, if so, why attempt to imitate my signature—in December I accused him of embezzlement—I wrote him this letter of 20th December, 1879—I was not annoyed at his com<lb></lb>mencing a business on his own account—he did not come to my place and give me a thrashing; he assaulted me—I instructed my solicitor in January to take criminal proceedings, and a warrant was taken out at once, but he was not taken till July, he could not be found—I did not know that he was in the City all that time—I was in communication with his wife; I borrowed 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of her—I have not paid it back—I never gave instructions to my solicitor to sell some reversionary interest of my wife's—there was 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in trust in Chancery, out of which my wife was to receive 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> In December, 1878, I forbade the prisoner to take any more money out of the business—I said at the police-court that the prisoner always asked me for money; when he wanted money for dis<lb></lb>bursements he applied to me for it—I have since ascertained that the</p>

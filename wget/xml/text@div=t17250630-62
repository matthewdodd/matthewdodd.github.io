             thus deposed: I am a Glasier, and live on one Side of the same Shop as Mrs. How lives in. I mistrusted the Prisoner, and ask'd her, if she knew him? She told me, No. Whereupon I follow'd him, to see if he went to Mr. Corbet's, who lives upon College-Hill. Before he was gone far, he met another Man, with whom he went thro' Sun-Yard into Broad-street, and so through Newgate. There being two of them, I call'd a Porter to assist me, and stopt the Prisoner, and he deliver'd the Goods to me out of his Bosom; but the other ran away.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner thus made his Defence: I met Mr. Corbet's Servant, and he told me that his Master had sent him for some Handkerchiefs to Mrs. How's; but that he did not care to go, because he ow'd a little Money thereabouts: and therefore if I would go and fetch them and some other Things at two or three other Shops, and bring them to him at a House upon Snow-Hill, (but I have forgot the Sign) he would give me 18 d. So I agreed, and he gave me a Note of Directions at what Shops to call, and what Goods to ask for.</p>
               <p>Mr. Corbet thus deposed: I never saw the Prisoner before Mr. Harton brought him to me to enquire if I had sent him to Mrs. How's, and then he gave me the Note of Directions, that he says he had from my Servant. This is the same Note, and I believe it is my Servant's Writing; but that Servant was gone from me before the Fact was committed of which the Prisoner is now indicted.

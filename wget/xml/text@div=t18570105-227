                  </hi>. I drive a <hi rend="italic">cab.</hi> I knew Harben Elderton, the deceased, for about sixteen years—on Friday, 19th Dec., about half past 2 o'clock in the morning, I was in Whitechapel High-street, opposite the Horse and Leaping-bar public house—the prisoner and the deceased were both there about 12 o'clock, when I went in, and were <hi rend="italic">rowing</hi> about a shilling that the prisoner had been robbed of twelve months ago—I saw them come out of the house, and the prisoner told the deceased he would punch his head for the shilling he had been robbed of—the deceased said, "I don't want any <hi rend="italic">row</hi>" and the prisoner struck at him—he struck at his head—the deceased had a pipe in his mouth—the prisoner struck at him, and either his fist or his wrist struck the bowl of the pipe—the pipe was broken and fell on the ground—I saw the deceased put his finger in his mouth, take out a little piece of pipe and throw it on the ground, and another piece about two inches in length fell with the bowl—the deceased said the pipe was in his mouth, and he walked away—this was done imme<lb></lb>diately after they came out of the house—some short time afterwards the deceased came back and made a complaint—I felt his neck, and there was a lump at the back of it.</p>

               <p>into the London Hospital, and examined him—he complained of pain in the back part of his throat, and on examination I found a small piece of pipe in his tongue—I took it out—he still complained of pain at the back of his throat—I searched, but could find nothing—he was made an out patient, and came again in the morning—I attended the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi>—the cause of death was the penetration of the carotid artery—that was quite sufficient to cause death.</p>

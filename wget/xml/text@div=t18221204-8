On Sunday, the 10th of November, at half-past six o'clock at night, I went out leaving nobody at home. I locked and padlocked the door, and took the key with me. I returned about ten o'clock, and found the door open, but nobody in the house except the lodgers. The room was hired by my father, who is a broker, to put things into. I missed two new mattresses, a new feather bed, and the bed I slept on, two sheets, two bundles, some quilts, and other articles. I made the new bed myself - it is worth 2 l. 10 s. The mattresses are worth 3 l.; they cost us 30 s.</p>

            . I am the watchman. On Monday morning, the 11th of November, about a quarter past seven o'clock, I saw the prisoner with a truck in Featherstone-court - he put a mattress on the truck; there was one on it before. I sent my brother watchman off with information, and when he returned I saw the prisoner put a bed on the truck. I took him in charge, and delivered the property to Walker. He was about two hundred yards from Featherstons-court.</p>

            . I lodge in the same house with the prisoner, at No. 9, James-court, Featherstone-street, I was at home from seven o'clock till ten on Sunday night. I was standing at the door about ten minutes, and saw a man come into the court with a bed on his back - he put it down on the stairs, and the prisoner came out of his room and helped him with it into the prisoner's room - a woman lit them up. I saw nothing else broght in. I suspected they were only cheating the landlord, and went away directly. I do not know whether the prisoner had been out. I had been at home all the evening. I was not further out than the end of the court. I think I must have known if he had gone out at all between six and seven o'clock.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went to the prisoner's lodging, which is about sixty yards from this room, on the 11th of November, in the evening, and found a bed looking-glass, three quilts, and a sheet.</p>

               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>HENRY MARTIN re-examined. I live in the garret over the prisoner's room. I had been at the door about ten minutes when the bed was brought in. I had come from my own room, where I had been all the afternoon. After the bed came in I went to Whitecross-street. The prisoner was in his room at the time I went down - he could not go out without passing me at the door; his door was shut. I had not heard him move about in his room. The prisoner came down to the man of his own accord - he carried it up three or four stairs before the prisoner came and helped him. The prisoner lives up one pair. The man did not call him - I must have heard if he had called.</p>
               <p>The prisoner in a long Defence, stated that a man had called on him two days before, and asked if he might move his goods to his room, as he was fearful of their being seized for rent, and that when they came, he found them<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182212040006"></xptr>too bulky, and desired him to remove them, and they agreed to pay him to move them in the morning.</p>

In November, 1822, about three o'clock, I went out, leaving nobody in the house. I returned at four, and found the outer-door, which I had fastened, broken off its hinges and forced in. I could not get in - I went to the window and found the sash half up; I got in and missed a band-box, which I had left in the window, it contained this property, except a gown and shift, which were taken from another box. I found a gown in pawn, in the middle of June last - we lost 5 l. worth of property. The prisoner told us, he was a messenger to the Mendicity Society, and used to visit us, and was at the house five days before the robbery, but never came after.</p>

            . I am the prosecutrix's mother. When I came home all her property was gone. I went to St. Giles's for relief, and found the prisoner there; he ran away on seeing me. I caught him, and said,</p>
               <p>"Don't you know me." He said,</p>
               <p>"Yes, I do, Mrs. Doggett - how is your family?" I said,</p>
               <p>"They are getting better, why do not you call to see us, as you used?" He said he had been in Kent ever since." I said,</p>
               <p>"Why did you rob me?" He said, he did not. I told him a neighbour saw him come out of the window; he said it was not him, but a country-woman that robbed me.</p>

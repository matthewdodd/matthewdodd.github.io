               <p>How did the man who was with Jones bring the cask up the yard? - In his arms: after the cask had been in the yard about an hour, I saw Jones come up the yard and look at it, and turn away again.</p>
               <p>Look at the other prisoner, is he the man that had the cask? - I cannot swear that he is, or that he is not the man.</p>

I cry'd out, and a young man came up, and said, what, Staffordshire Nan! I thought you had been in Newgate. I don't know that young man, nor have ever seen him since she went from me directly. Two days after, I ask'd a woman who was selling fruit in the Broadway Westminster, if she knew one Staffordshire Nan; she told me she was then in Tothill-fields Bridewell. My husband and I went there, and told the thing, and that I could know her if I saw her. I saw 14 or 15 people, but neither of them the prisoner; then the man call'd her by name, and she came D - g her eyes very badly; said I, was not you in the Park on Sunday night? she said she was, but did not rob any body there. Said I, you rob'd me of 12 s. then she threw a pipe at me through the grates.</p>

            . I am a prisoner in Tothill-fields Bridewell, but have at times, when the governor is out of the way, the care of the prisoners. The prosecutrix came and ask'd for Staffordshire Nan; I took her down, she call'd for Staffordshire Nan; the prisoner was smoaking a pipe, amongst the rest; as soon as she appear'd, the woman tax'd her with the robbery; the prisoner us'd many bad expressions, and threw a pipe at her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I never saw the woman till I saw her in Bridewell; my sister sent me there for a quarrel; her commitment was read, dated July the 8th.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. John Dodd, who lives in the parish of St. Marylebone—he is the housekeeper. On the 30th of November I went to bed about eleven o'clock—I sleep in the lower part of the house—I saw the window were shut before I went to bed—the outer window was shut down, but bot fastened—there are shutters inside the window but they were not quite closed—I left them a little open to admit light in the morning—that window communicate with the area—I was awoke about four o'clock in the morning by a noise at the window—I got up, and found the window drawn down, and the shutters pushed right open—soon after I saw Compton, the policeman, who showed me a bag, which belongs to my master—It was on the cute-stand the night before when I went to bed, in the cupboard, in the pantry—the cruet-stand remained in the cup board, then, but it was drawn out about a foot from where it was the night before—I am sure it had been removed that distance from where it stood the night before, and the bag, which was the covering of it, taken off—a person could reach with a stick from the window to the place where the cruet-stand was—I saw the policeman in the area where the bag was—he had another policeman standing at the top of the area gate—the prisoner was in the policeman's custody in the area—I knew him before—he had been in Mr. Dodd's service, and I succeeded him—I asked what he had been about—he said he had not been about any thing—the policeman showed me the green baize bag, and asked if I knew it—I said, "Yes, it is the covering of the cruet-stand, and he must have been in the pantry"—he said he had not—I called my master, and we found inside the pantry two sticks tied together—he could reach with that from the window to the cruet-stand.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman, On the morning of the 1st of December I was passing Mr. Dodd's house, and heard a noise of footsteps in the area—I stood some time, and heard footsteps again—It was about four or a quarter past four o'clock—I tried the area gate, and it was fast—I got over the railing, went down the area, and on the steps of the area I found this green baize bag—I looked into the privy, and there found the pri soner—he had his coat, waistcoat, and hat off, and put by the side of him—his small clothes were not down—I said, "Are not you the servant who used to live here?"—he said, "No, never; I came a long way out of the country"—I took him into custody, and asked how he came there—he said he got over to ease himself—I said it was a pretty place to come to ease himself—I rang the bell, and the servant came to the door, and called his master; and going through the house the servant gave me these two sticks—I did not see the state of the window as I took the prisoner away—this is the same bag and sticks as I found.</p>

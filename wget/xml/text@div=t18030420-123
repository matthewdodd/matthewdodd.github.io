             sworn. - I am one of the marshalmen: On the 23d of October, 1801, I apprehended the prisoner, in consequence of information I received; I went with Hynart; I saw her go into Richardson and Goodluck's; I went in, and stopped her; I searched her, and in her left-hand pocket was nothing of any kind but four base shillings (produces them); in her right hand pocket I found four or five guineas in gold, and two Bank-notes of one-pound each, all good; I took her to the Compter, and Mr. Clay delivered me these two shillings (producing them); the four shillings I found upon her I do not think had been in circulation; the other two shillings that I had from Mr. Clay did not appear to have been in circulation. She was admitted to bail, but has not appeared till she was taken into custody lately.(Mr. William Parker proved all the shillings to be counterfeit, and merely washed over.)(The prisoner in her defence denied having any knowledge of their being counterfeit.</p>

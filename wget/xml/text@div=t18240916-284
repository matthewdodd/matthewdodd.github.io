               <p>"I have got an apron;" the prisoner who had a knife in his hand to prepare hung-cloth with, came out of the store-house, went past Jones up to

            , and without saying a word, took hold of his apron and cut it nearly across - he then cut a second time, and the deceased threw his apron back, to prevent his cutting it; the deceased then took hold of the prisoner's white apron, set his foot upon it and tore it; nothing further happened at that moment. I turned my head aside, and heard a witness say</p>
               <p>"Good God Brown, what have you done." I turned round, and Scott was shaking his left hand, which held very much indeed, Scott turned to Brown, and said</p>
               <p>"If you have any malice against me, don't cut me, strike me;" he then hit Brown with his right hand. Jones said to Scott</p>
               <p>"Put your hand into the liquor-stand" - he did so. I said to him</p>
               <p>"Take your hand out and go to a doctor;" we took up the bits of apron and tied up his hand; the prisoner with others went with him to the doctor's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. The prisoner went with him to the doctor - A. Yes; there was no expression used but what I have stated; he cut the deceased's apron for a piece of bung-cloth. I did not see how the wound was inflicted; the aprons are made of the same cloths as hung-cloth.</p>

            . I am in the service of Mr. Reynolds. On the 9th of August, the prisoner asked me if I had any bung-cloth. I said No; Scott was coming up the yard, and said</p>
               <p>"What do you want, bung-cloth?" he said Yes; then said he</p>
               <p>"Cut Jones's apron," Brown said</p>
               <p>"I may as well cut yours;" he passed by me and cut off a piece of Scott's apron with the knife. Scott did not seem to like it; he laid hold of Brown's apron and tore it off. Brown looked very savage, and took hold of Scott's apron again. Scott went back that he should not get his apron. Brown cut at the apron again, and cut Scott's hand - some of the blood came in my face. Scott said</p>
               <p>"If you have any animosity against me, don't cut me, strike me;" he then struck Brown with his fist. I said</p>
               <p>"For God's sake take him to a doctor," and Brown and Henniugton took him; they had had a few words a little time before. Brown was fond of giving a joke, but could not take one - they had a few jokes together. Brown said he did not mind me or my partner; but he would not put up with Scott's jokes, and would serve him out; but whether he meant to give him a thumping or not I do not know.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. A. Did he cut more than once at the apron - A. Yes; he cut one piece off at one chop, and then cut properly at the apron all the way.</p>

            . I am a drayman in the employ of Mr. Reynolds. I saw Scott lay hold of Brown's apron and tear it to pieces under his feet - after which Brown took hold of his apron, cut at it several times with the knife; the deceased, in attempting to pull it back from Brown, snatched at it, and received the cut. I saw Scott strike Brown - it was not a very severe blow.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. In endeavouring to pull the apron back was the time he received the cut - A. I think it was the knife went against his hand. In my opinion it was quite an accident.</p>

               <persName id="t18240916-284-person2417">August. He</persName>
             died of a disease in the chest in about three weeks after he came. I have no doubt that the wound of his hand hastened his death. He died of inflamation of the lungs. He was opened, and the state of his lungs lead me to say this - there was an appearance of disease of the lungs before he received the wound; it was most likely excited by the wound, which otherwise might have remained quiet. The loss of blood was very considerable, which, with the irritation of the constitution, no doubt excited the complaint. I believe he would have died of the disease eventually, but he might have lived several years. I cannot say that the lungs might not have been excited by anything else - a cold, or other things, might have done it.</p>

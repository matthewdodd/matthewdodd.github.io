               <p>JOHN BURROWS. On the 2d of August, about half-past twelve o'clock at night, I was in <placeName id="t18250915-106-crimeloc575">Princes-street, Coventry-street</placeName>

I accused her of taking it; she denied it. I had been drinking a little, but I think I perfectly recollect every thing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Did you know her the next morning? A. No, I fixed on somebody else. I had been to a bean feast, and felt my money safe when I got off the coach. I had been to a wine-vaults with another woman, and do not know whether it was safe after that.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was at the corner of Porter-street, Newport-market, and saw the prisoner running down the street, and the prosecutor after her - she came up towards me; the prosecutor said, "Give me that 5 s. back;" she said she had not got such a thing about her - I took her to the watch-house, and she then said she had a 5 s. piece down her bosom, which he had given to her.</p>

            . The prisoner was brought to St. Ann's watch-house. I asked what she had done with the money; she said it was in her bosom - she put her hand in, but did not find it; I then took her into the lock-up place, and opened her frock - it fell down at her feet.</p>

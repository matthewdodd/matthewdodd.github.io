I received four twenty pound Bank notes and some small notes; altogether, I received eighty four pounds, and some few shillings; I received this at about three or four o'clock in the afternoon, and came on shore at six; before I came on shore, the prisoner had asked me and some of my shipmates to come and lodge with him. We went up the water in a boat, and landed at Blackwall, and I don't know the name of the place where the lodging is.

The prisoner wanted me to go with girls, and he took me and my shipmates to a house where there were some. I did not stay there; we had some beer there together. My shipmates all went away together with girls, and he and I set out together to go home to the lodging; it was about half past twelve at night; and just as we got ten yards from the house, in a dark place, he stepped behind me, and up with his first and knocked me down directly; my hat fell off. and he kept me down with his knee upon my breast, and stopped my mouth. Some gentlemen were coming by, my hat fell off when I was knocked down; I got up, and called out watch, a man came up tome, and wanted to drive me away, I picked up my hat, but my money and handkerchief were gone, and I could not find them any where.

            . I live at No. 6, Ball street, St. George's. On the night of the 17th of August, between the hours of twelve and one, I was standing at my own door, I saw two coloured men, the prisoner, and the prosecutor, coming along the street; I saw the prisoner knock the prosecutor down; I did not see him do anything else, as I went and called the watch. I took them both to the watchhouse, where they could not make out who was the person charged; for the prosecutor said he had been robbed, and the prisoner said he had drawn a knife upon him. The prisoner was searched, and in his breast jacket pocket, the notes were wrapt up in a Jark handkerchief. The prisoner claimed it as his; the prosecutor as his. The prisoner was told if it was his, to tell what was in it? this was said before the handkerchief was examined. The prisoner said there were nine one pound notes in it, the prosecutor said there were one, two, three twenty pound notes in it, and upon opening the handkerchief, it was exactly so.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Walford. At first I took no notice of them in the street; but the prisoner charged the prosecutor with drawing a knife against him; and for that they were both taken to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prosecutor searched - A. No, but he produced a knife, when he was asked if he had one; it was a small one.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. By the good God I am innocent of robbing this man, I had the note to take care of for him as a friend. I went down to Woolwich and went on board his ship, knowing some of the crew; and he being a stranger, and a man of my own colour, I asked him to lodge with me when he came to London, which he agreed to. He told me I had better stay on board, for there would be blankets and things which would be throwed away, and as I might as well have them as any one else. When the crew was paid off, he sent one here for half a gallon of rum, and we got all quite comfortable; and when we were coming off, they all made me commodore, and this here Jack, (pointing to the prosecutor) was drunk, and very riotous, and disobeyed my orders; when we came on shore, he would have more rum; I told him I was commodore; I was superior officer, and would not let him, but he would have some, and went and got some. We hired a cart to bring up the chests, and my blankets and things, and we all got on board, and was very merry; but this Jack was drunk and quarrelsome, and would have something to drink, at every public house he came to. After we came up, he changed one note, and gave me the rest to take care of; and went to a cook's shop, and got something for supper; we went into him at the cook's shop, and he wanted to go with girls; we went to a house where there were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181509130034"></xptr>some, one got one, and another got one, and this Jack made a bargain with a lady, but something was the matter and she went away. I fancy they did not agree. Jack made a row, because she would not stay, and blamed me for it, saying I took her away. At last we agreed to go home to our lodgings; he was very quarrelsome; and in the way pulled out his knife, and swore he would kill me Portugue. I was obliged to knock him down to try to take away the knife, and when the watchman came up, he swore I had robbed him, and I was taken to the watchhouse. He came here to swear away my life to day (addressing himself to the prosecutor.) You Jack, you know it was all a drunken frolick; so help me God Almighty I am as innocent as the child unborn.</p>

            . I am an unfortunate girl, and live at No. 5, Williams court, Cable-street. In August last, I remember being in company with the prisoner and the prosecutor; it was on a Thursday, I heard a noise at No, 7, of some people merry making, and being in an importunate situation, I went and opened the door, and saw a number of sailors and women drinking and making merry. I said I suppose I am not wanted here; Mr.

             a dark blue handkerchief, saying Morris, take care of that until to-morrow morning. I don't know what were the contents; I did not like the prosecutor's company, he was very quarrelsome, and I got up and went to my own lodgings.</p>
               <p>Cross examined by Mr. Gurney. I have been in this unfortunate situation between nine and ten years. I have known the prisoner at the bar about nine months, by his coming to see a girl that is in the same situation as I am in, and who live up my court; I have known the woman with whom he cohabits, nine years. I was informed that this prosecution was made against him, and that was the reason I came here to day; he did not send for me.</p>

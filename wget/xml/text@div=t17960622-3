               <p>Court. Q. Did he hold both your arms with one hand? - A. Yes; I looked him full in the face; I went home and told my master, that he was so remarkable a man that I was sure I should know him again; it was a moon-light night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing to you? - A. No, he did not. On the King's birth-day, in Palace-yard, I saw the prisoner again, he stared me full in the face, and I knew him directly; he came up to me, and began to draw his hand across my breeches; I told him I had seen him before in Berkeley-square; I followed him into St. James's-square; there was such a crowd I was afraid to call to any body to assist me; I told him I would charge him with robbing me; and he begged I would go with him into Park-street, to his house, which I did; to Mr. Dodd's, a coach-maker, Mr. Dodd was in his office; I told him I would charge the prisoner, it was no matter what, I said, that the prisoner was the man who robbed me; Mr. Dodd begged I would not, because there were men at work that would hear me; he begged I would go up stairs, that the prisoner was a relation of his, and a man of fortune, that he had married a woman of fortune; and begged, as nobody knew it but us three, that I would not charge him; that he would bring forth the man or the watch, on Monday night, or whatever the watch was worth; he told me to rely upon him as a man in circumstances that he would not tell me a lie; and he went down and called up his clerk, who was a witness to this, and he brought up a tumbler of shrub to drink; the clerk was the witness to produce the man on Monday, or the price of the watch what ever it was; he gave the prisoner some shrub to drink; they wanted me to go into the next room, and I would not go with them; I told them I would stay in the passage; he said, he wanted to speak to the prisoner a minute, which he did, and then I went in again, and he offered me ten guineas, if that would satisfy me for the watch; I told him I could not say what it was worth till captain Gower came to town, he had given me the watch, and I did not know the price of it; if it was worth less than ten guineas I was to give him the overplus; or if it was more, he was to give me more. I left the prisoner there, and on Monday morning I went down to Mr. Dodd's house, and the prisoner came down stairs to me, and went with me to Marlborough-street, and I went with him to Mr. Moore's, the gentleman that sits there (the attorney for the prisoner); and then we came to an ale-house where there was a club, and a party of men waiting for them there; and they threatened to prove an alogy, and have me pillored, that was at the public-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mr. Moore present? - A. Yes; they called me a swindler, and that I had no watch; I went to the office, and the man was committed, and they abused me in the like manner at the office.</p>
               <p>Q. He was not fully committed upon the first hearing? - A. I appeared the second time, and he was fully committed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. This was about half past eleven on Easter-Sunday night? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does your master live? - A. Russel-place, Fitzroy-square, he lodged then in Edward-street, Portman-square.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does Lord Westmoreland live? - A. In Berkeley-square.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your master that night? - A. At home, in Edward-street.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be out so late that night? - A. I was going to St. James's-place, from Berkeley-square to my cousin's, w...is servant at Mr. Johnston's.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you usually go on visits at twelve o'clock at night to your fellow-servants? - A. No; I was going about business.</p>
               <p>Q. At near twelve o'clock at night? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you expect to get to your master's house? - A. I was not bound to any hour of coming in, I would have been in a little after twelve o'clock if it was not for the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. At very near twelve o'clock you were in Berkeley-square, that was going directly contrary to your master's house? - A. That was to Mr. Johnston's.</p>
               <p>Q. And then you were to do your business in St. James's-place? - A. I had no business to do, but to give a letter to go to Ireland to my cousin, who was going the next day to Ireland.</p>
               <p>Q. You could not have done that before one o'clock? - A. I was in at half past twelve, because I did not go there, as I had been robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it would have been one o'clock before you could have got home, if you had gone about that business? - A. No, it would not.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner never said a word to you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179606220009"></xptr>Q. It was a fine moonlight night? - A. It was a very clear night.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw him with the flap of his breeches down, and the shirt hanging out? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not that surprise you very much to see a man coming towards you with his breeches down at that time of night? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You stood upon your guard, I suppose? - A. No; he went on one side and I walked on the flags; he caught hold of me immediately as he came up to me by the side of me.</p>
               <p>Q. He put his arms round you and pinioned you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He is not a much stronger man than you? - A. No; but there was another man just by.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that other man come up? - A. No; I strove to get my arm away and could not.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that man, do you mean to say that man with one hand could hold you by both arms? - A. Yes; he clasped me with both arms, and then took away my watch; he felt my breeches and then my waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you could not get your arms away when he had hold of you with one arm only? - A. No; I could not.</p>
               <p>Q. That you swear positively? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And, looking at the size of that man, you will swear it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was the watchman from you? - A. I saw no watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath how far was the nearest watch-box to you? - A. I saw no watch-box nor watchman till I came out of Berkeley-square; it was no matter where the watch-box was when I was robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give an alarm to any body? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way did he run? - A. Not down Berkley-square, but across another small street that comes across, that goes into Piccadilly, Hay-hill I believe it is.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the other man? - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you attempt to run after him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give any information to any watchman you saw? - A. No; I saw no watchman at all.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not at all attempt to get out of his way? - A. I thought he would pass me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell any thing of the flap of his breeches being down at Marlborough-street before the Magistrate? - No, I did not, for all the party abused me so much that I was afraid.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say Mr. Conant would not hear what you had to say? - A. He desired them to hold their tongues; that there were people of that description in London.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at all say to Mr. Conant that the flap of the man's breeches was down? - A. No. intended to say it, but the Justice said that two men standing so close together it was easy to know what they were about.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mention any thing about his rubbing your breeches in Palace-yard? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you upon good terms with the landlord of the house where your master lodged? - A. No; I kept my distance as a servant.</p>
               <p>Q. There are other servants in the house? - Q. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mention this extraordinary matter to any one person in that house? - A. No, I did not except to captain Gower.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw the prisoner from that time till you saw him on the 4th of June? - A. I thought I saw him in Bond-street, but I was waiting upon my master and I could not go after him to take him then.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt that it was him that you saw in Bond-street? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Your master, I believe, searched in the pawnbroker's shops after the watch? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you communicate it to your master? - Yes, when I got home.</p>
               <p>Q. Not before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at the prisoner? - A. I am sure he is the man that robbed me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any powder in his hair? - A. I cannot say; he was dressed in black, and a scarlet inside waistcoat on; he said at Mr. Dodd's that he was on board of a ship at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. That is as true as any thing else that you have said? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were at St. James's you saw the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You stared at him? - A. Yes, I knew him directly.</p>
               <p>Q. He stared at you in return? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he speak to you? - A. No, he came close to me and rubbed up my breeches, with his hand in his coat pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you know you were safe enough? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath did not you raise any alarm, or try to knock him down for using that indecency? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you take that to be the greatest insult that can be offered from one man to another? - A. I did not know what it was; I put my hand upon my watch, and I thought it was to take my watch again, for I knew he was the man that had robbed me; I spoke to him, and told him I had seen him at such a place, and he made off through the crowd.</p>

               <p>Q. You made no alarm? - A. No, not till I went after him and took him.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179606220010"></xptr>Q. Did you tell any body - See what a rascal this is? - A. No; there was a carriage coming, and he made off; I overtook him in King street, before he came into the square, and I took him by the coat, and told him he was the man who robbed me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he attempt to get away from you? - A. No, he told me to call a coach, and I told him I would not; he begged of me to come to his house, and I went with him to Mr. Dodd's.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did not you make an offer that, in case the man would raise the price of this watch, you never would come forward again? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath did you not declare to Mr. Dodd, that if he could raise the price of the watch, and tell him it was a disagreeable thing to his relations, that you would not appear against him? - A. Not till captain Gower came to town, as I did not know the price of the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell Mr. Dodd, the moment you could know the price of the watch, you would take that price for the watch and would not appear against him? - A. They called three times at Mr. Gower's at Russel-place, to settle it, Mr. Dodd and his party; I told him I would not have any settlement till Mr. Gower came home.</p>
               <p>Q. You found the man there on the Monday? - A. Yes; he went with me to the office.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the prisoner insist upon your taking him before a Magistrate, for he would not agree to any such terms? - A. No; that gentleman (Mr. Moore) has used me very ill.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ward. Q. How many minutes walk would it have been from this place where the robbery was committed, to St. James's place? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. You had a letter to deliver to your relation, which was the occasion of your going there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you asked leave of your master to go out that night? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You have no doubt that the prisoner is the man that attacked you? - A. I have no doubt at all about it.</p>
               <p>Q. You are not much used to London, I believe? - A. I never was in London before Christmas last, when I went to Gower-hill; I did not know the way, it was a hackney coachman directed me down Berkeley-street.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. May it please you Lordship, Gentlemen of the Jury: On Saturday the 4th of June, being the birth-day of his Majesty, I was standing to see the company go to the ball-room; I had not been there long, when being tapped on the shoulder, I turned round, and saw the prosecutor; he told me he saw me about three weeks before in Berkeley-square; I told him he was mistaken, and I thought no more about it; I staid three or four minutes, when Lord Westmoreland's carriage coming past, I took that opportunity of going to prevent the inconveniency of being hustled; the prosecutor came up to me and told me not to run to fast, he had a word with me; he said I had robbed him of his watch, and he would have satisfaction for it; I told him he was very much mistaken, and if he would accompany me home I would convince him of his error; he said if I would make satisfaction for the watch, as I appeared a decent man, he would not say any more about it; I told him I was not to be frightened in that way, I lodged over Blackfriars-bridge, and I thought it best to go to Park-street to Mr. Dodd's; I then turned up St. Alban's-street, and he went with me to Mr. Dodd's; what passed there Mr. Dodd will be able to inform you, Gentlemen. It is very happy for me that on Easter Sunday, which is a remarkable day, I can prove by the most respectable witnesses, that I was not out of the house all that day; that I was in their company from six that night till two the next morning, and that at the instant the man charges me with robbing him, I was at supper with my friends.(The prisoner called

               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury. It does seem to me that there must be some sort of mistake on the part of the prosecutor in this case. Here are four witnesses whose character and respectability are totally unimpeached, who positively swear he was never out of their company any part of that evening. Gentlemen, they have been cross-examined, and very properly by the Counsel for the prosecution, to collateral circumstances, because when witnesses come here with a fabricated story, it generally happens that upon little collateral circumstances, which the witnesses have not settled between themselves, they contradict one another in a way that shews they don't deserve any credit; but in this case, in all the collateral points they tell you the same thing; it seems to me therefore that there is some mistake in the case, and the weight of evidence is such that I think you will have no difficulty in saying he is mistaken, and that it could not be the prisoner at the bar.</p>

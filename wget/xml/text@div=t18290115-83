            . I was an apprentice to Richard Caneding, a carpenter's tool manufacturer. On the 1st of December Mr. Levy put the prisoner in possession; on the Wednesday, just after dinner, I had to go into the shop, and the prisoner said to me, "I want somebody to take a parcel into the City for me - I do not mind paying them for it;" I went over with my mistress to my master, and my master told me to take the parcel - I went over and said I was going out with the horse and chaise; the prisoner then asked me to take the parcel and gave me a direction where to take it and a note - it was directed,"Mr. Levy, pen-cutter, Chicksand-street, Osborne-street, Whitechapel;" I believe there was a direction in the parcel, but I do not remember what it was: I took the parcel to my master, and he opened it - it contained all the articles stated - a great number of tools.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Have you not heard your mistress say, that she gave the prisoner these tools? A. No.</p>

            . I was plaintiff in this action. The prisoner was put in possession by Levy; I heard something of this sort had happened, and gave information of it - the prisoner was taken into custody; he called me aside, and said he hoped I would not prosecute him - he did not know there was any particular harm in it, and it was a regular thing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was that all he said? A. Yes, to my remembrance; he did say that Mrs. Canedine said he might have a thing of a sort, and Mrs. Canedine has confirmed that to me - the goods were sold by a bill of sale; Mrs. Canedine is lodging in the house, but she is not in possession - her husband is in the Marshalsea; I have a person in possession of the goods: my man is serving in the shop; the apprentice is merely employed to tell the prices - Mrs. Canedine is not selling the things.</p>

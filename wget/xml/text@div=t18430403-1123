The deceased, Samuel Hunt Baker, was my son—on Friday, the 24th of March, he came home to me between one and two o'clock, and told me something—I saw a wound in the back of his neck—I ascertained it had been dressed by a surgeon, and sent him up stairs to bed—in consequence of some<lb></lb>thing he told me, I did not send for any medical gentleman immediately—I sent for Mr. Part next day—my son died on Tuesday the 28th.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Cambridge-place, Cambridge-terrace, Camden-town. On Saturday, the 25th of March, I was called in to see the deceased—I found a fractured wound at the back of his neck, close to the base of the skull—I examined that wound with a groove director, which I found penetrate an inch and one-eighth, and from that wound there oozed a quantity of serum—the wound was half an inch long externally—the boy was labouring under symptoms of inflammation of the membranes of the brain, for which I used the ordinary remedies, leeches, cold lotions, and purgatives—in spite of all those remedies, the symptoms continued gradually to in<lb></lb>crease, and he died on the fourth day, the 28th of March—I attribute his death to the wound at the back of the neck—he had no other malady or complaint about him that I observed, that would have occasioned or contri<lb></lb>buted to his death—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—I observed in the spinal canal, which is the cavity containing the spinal marrow, a punctured wound, which corresponded with the one externally, it was an eighth of an inch long, and penetrating the membranes covering the spinal marrow—there was extensive inflammation of the membranes around the wound, and at the base of the brain was effusion of a large quantity of serum, the result of that inflammation, which was sufficient to account for his death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had you attended him at all before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—he appeared to be a stout, fine healthy boy, rather robust, and tolerably muscular for his age—I do not think if I had been called in earlier the fatal conse<lb></lb>quences could have been averted, because wounds of that description, pene<lb></lb>trating the spinal cavity, generally prove fatal in spite of all treatment—I saw nothing which could have caused his death except that wound.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a lamplighter, and live in Crown-place. On Friday, the 24th of March, I was in company with the deceased under a wal<lb></lb>nut-tree in a field opposite Mansfield-place, Kentish-town, with Roberts and Walter—the prisoner came over the fence with some cow parsley in his lap, and a knife in his hand—he said to the deceased, "Did I sell a halfpenny worth of milk on the bridge?"—I did not know what that meant—the deceased said, "Yes"—the prisoner said, "You are a liar"—the deceased replied, "You are a liar"—the prisoner said, "You are a b----liar; because you are a thief yourself, you think every body else is"—the deceased jumped up and struck the prisoner with his fist—the prisoner struck him with his fist—the deceased struck him again on the head—the prisoner grated his teeth, held the knife up, and said he did not care a b----if he stuck him—the deceased stood facing him—he put his hands up, turned round to save the blow, and the knife caught him in the back of the neck—he did not throw the knife—it did not go out of his hand—the deceased said, "I am stuck"—the prisoner dropped the cow parsley out of his lap, and ran home directly—the deceased was so weak he could not get over the fence—I helped him over, and took him to several surgeons, but could not get assistance—I at last left him at Mr. Birmingham's, a surgeon—I afterwards saw him again at the station, when the prisoner was taken—they then appeared on very good terms—I think their meeting in the field was merely accidental—the two boys were not a fair match—the deceased was the more powerful of the two.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live in Mansfield-place. On the 24th of March I was in the field, lying down by the tree—I saw Mellor coming across the field with some cow parsley in his lap, and his father's shoe<lb></lb>maker's knife in his hand—he came up to Baker, and said, "What business had you to go and tell <hi rend="italic">Ted</hi> Parker that I kept a halfpenny for the halfpenny-worth of milk that I sold?"—Baker said, "So you did"—Mellor said, "You are a b----liar; because you are a b----thief yourself, you think every body else is"—Baker then got up off the ground and made a hit at Mellor, who fell down and did not receive the blow—he said, "If you hit me, I'm b----d if I won't stab you"—he dropped the cow parsley, ran up to Baker with the knife, and was going to strike him in the face—Baker stooped his head, and re<lb></lb>ceived it in the back of his neck—Mellor ran home with the knife in his hand—Baker said to me, "Oh, Peter, he has stabbed me; take me to the doctor's," and we took him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

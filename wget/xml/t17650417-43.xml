I was taken ill, and was in my bed, when the prisoner was detected with seven bobbins in her pocket; she was brought to my bed-side, she went down on her knees, and owned she had robbed one of the best of masters, and begged forgiveness: she said she had carried it on by putting in empty bobbins, (we go by tale): she, to keep the tale always right, dropped in so many empty bobbins and took away full ones; this she acknowledged to me. She acknowledged she had robbed me about a year and a half, or near two years.</p>

            . I know the prisoner brought a great quantity of silk home, but I did not see her steal it; she lived with me some years: she always carried her work home very well, till near two years ago; she used to lay it by till she had an opportunity to draw it off; sometimes she would bring two bobbins, sometimes three, sometimes none all the week.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she tell you how she came by it?</p>
               <p>A. Hannah. No, she did not; but she must think I knew she could not come honestly by it.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the bobbins marked?</p>
               <p>A. Hannah. There were I. S. on them: I knew that to be Mr. Sharrard's mark, (four empty bobbins produced, marked I. S.) they were marked like these (a quantity of bobbins, full of silk, produced.)</p>
               <p>A. Hannah. (Takes up two of them,) This silk here, came from off Mr. Sharrard's bobbins: I saw the prisoner draw the silk off.</p>

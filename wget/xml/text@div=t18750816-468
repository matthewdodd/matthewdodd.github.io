               <p>Blackfriars Road—part of the house is Mr. Bidden's warehouse, it consists of two railway arches with gates—there is a lamp by the side of the gate—on 23rd June, about 1 o'clock, I was in bed and heard something opening, and the crash of wood; I looked out at the window and saw three men standing opposite, with their backs towards Mr. Bidden's gate, and their faces towards me—the middle one turned round and opened the gate with something; I could not see what, and then he drew it to, turned his back looked up and down the street, and then entered at the gate, and closed it after him—the prisoner Duffield then tried the gate with a push as a policeman would, and went towards Blackfriars Road, and the other man the other way and stood at the corner—I awoke Mallows, the drayman, next door, who tried the gate with the key, but he could not enter; I ran and got a policeman who returned with me—Mallows was still outside, and finding he could not enter from the front, he went to the back—I saw Mrs. Mallows standing at her door, and while I was talking to her, Duffield passed me, and I said to her "That is one of the men"—I believe Duffield heard that he looked at me and walked on in the direction in which the other had gone—Mallows and the policeman made their way in at the back and came and opened the gate, and I saw that it had been fastened with two gimblets, one at the top and the other at the bottom of the lock; I went into both the counting-houses and found the desks all open, and on the table were these eight wedges, three crowbars, and two chisels—I described the men, and on 3rd August, I was fetched to Stones End Station, where I selected the prisoners from ten or twelve men—Inspector Halse was there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I am sure Clark was there—two or three weeks after<lb></lb>wards an officer named Stephens took me to the Borough, pointed out a man and said "That is the man I want you to see," and asked whether I knew him—I said "No, I cannot recognise him"—I said to the acting inspector "At the distance he was off he looked to me as though he had no hair about his face," I said 'nothing about his having a tuft' of hair on his chin; I described him as about my own height 5 feet 5 inches, he had no hair about his face'—there was no lantern there only a lamp at the corner of the yard—his back was turned towards me while he was prizing the door—I said that he looked to me to have a brown overcoat—I used the word "brown."</p>

I am a drayman to Mr. Bidden—I shut up the premises safely on this night, and was aroused about 1.30 by Wesson, but could not get the key to turn one way or the other—I went to the back of the premises, got over the wall, got in and found the door fastened with two gimblets.</p>

I live at the Builders' Arms, Union Street, Southampton, kpt by Earl Wills—on 23rd June I went to a ball, after which I went to the Builders' Arms, and saw Clark in the parlour when I arrived—Mr. Wills was there at the same time, and he came up to London with me on Sunday morning to attend this trial, but he has gone back to Southampton—he was telegraphed for yesterday to come here to-day—there was a little bit of a <hi rend="italic">shindy</hi> on this night with some Oxford gentlemen, and this knife was intro<lb></lb>duced and the blade broken; to the best of my belief Duffield is the person who broke it—Clark had a friend with him, who, to the best of my belief was Duffield—some supper was fetched and I had some crab with them—I cannot recollect whether the master, the mistress, or the servant fetched the super—the landlord did not have supper with us; I and the two men had supper together.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I am a musician, and played in a band at this ball, which is held every Wednesday night at the Victoria Rooms—I don't know whether Clark was there—I had not known him before; this was the first time I had seen him—I slept there—I saw him again next morning when I got up, but I had no conversation with him—I met him in London on Sunday night when I arrived from Southampton—I saw him at his mother's house—the gentleman who served the subpoena fetched me—I did not know Duffield before that night; I have no doubt about him whatever—I believe he is the man, to the best of my opinion—I said at first that I could not recognize him, but now I do—to the best of my opinion he is the man who broke the knife by playing with it, chopping it on the table—I did not know the prisoner by any name—when I came up to town I went to Mrs. Clark's, 88, Friar Street, and have been stopping there since we arrived—I am quite clear that the weekly ball is on Wednesday night—I first saw the prisoners on that night at 10.30.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> During the day of the ball I was round the Isle of Wight—I recollect two Oxford gentlemen playing games on the day of the ball and they were at the Stockbridge and Bilbury Races—I was served with a subpoena, and conduct money was paid me to pay my fare up to London—I have had opportunities of seeing Clark, but I have not seen Duffield till this morning, and while I have been giving my evidence I have been</p>

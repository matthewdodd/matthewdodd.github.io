I live at 6, Circus Street, New Road, Marylebone—I was discharged from the Grenadier Guards on boxing night, having served my time—early on the morning of Saturday, about half-past twelve, I was at a public-house in Queen's Road, Chelsea—I was changing money there—I saw the prisoner there, and two men with him—I afterwards went</p>

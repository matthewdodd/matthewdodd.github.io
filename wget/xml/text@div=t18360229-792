On Saturday evening last, the prisoners came and asked if I purchased old silver—I said, "Yes"—he asked what I gave an ounce for it—I said it depended on what he had—he then said he only had this spoon—I said it would not suit me, "How was it broken",—he said it had been trodden on—I said it had been broken on purpose—he then said, could he not have it repaired—I said, "Yes, on Monday morning"—he said could he not have it sooner—I said, "Yes, in two hours" he said could it not be done in less—I said, "Yes, in an hour"—he gave his name "Jones," and said he would call again for it in an hour—I then sent for the officer.</p>

                  </hi> I am landlord of the Dolphin public-house, Church-street, in the parish of St. Matthew, Bethnal-green—it is my dwell<lb></lb>ing-house. On the 1st of July, a little after twelve o'clock, I went to bed—I shut the house up myself, it was not quite safe, for I had neglected to put the screw into the bar-shutters—the window was not closed, but the shutters were shut down, with the exception of the screw being put in—three pack<lb></lb>ages of halfpence, 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in each, were on the ledge inside the bar-window—I also had an ink-stand in the room—about a quarter-past three o'clock I was alarmed—I looked out at my window, and saw the police, I came down stairs, and saw the bar-window open, and the policemen getting in at the window—I missed the coppers immediately—I did not miss the inkstand till it was produced—I am quite sure it was there when I went to bed—this is it (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>)—I have seen some of the coppers since—I cannot swear to them—I did not tie or pack them up myself—they were what I had taken in business.</p>

               <p>Bethnal-green—I found the shutter of the prosecutor's house down, and the window up—I moved the shutter and found it was not fastened—the window was up nearly as high as it would go—I gave an alarm, but could not make any one hear—I went round the corner and saw the prisoner standing close by the window—I saw him draw his hand out of the window with something in it—I closed the shutters—he did not get into the room—a man could get the halfpence without getting into the room—he ran away, I ran after him, and called, "Stop thief!"—I saw him put the halfpence into his pocket as he ran—I only lost sight of him in turning a corner—he was not a minute out of my sight—I saw him stopped—I asked where the halfpence were—he said, in his pocket—I put my hand into his pocket and took part of them out, and part he gave me himself—I found some brown paper in his pocket, with some halfpence in it—I heard some money fall as he drew his hand from the win<lb></lb>dow—I did not pick it up, the sergeant did.</p>

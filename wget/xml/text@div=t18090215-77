I rubbed the prisoner down; just turned two o'clock; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180902150039"></xptr>saw something full in his pantaloons, his pocket stuck but; I asked him what he had got there; he said his pocket book; I said you must pull it out; then he said I will go back with you; we went back into Mr. Bell's office, in the accompting house; I took it out of his pocket, I found it was tea; eleven ounces; he begged hard of the warehouse keeper to forgive him; he had a large family, and it was the first time. It is black tea.</p>

            . I am an assistant elder to this warehouse; there was tea in the warehouse; I heard the prisoner say it was his first offence; he begged forgiveness. The tea is worth about eighteen pence or two shillings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I can tell you in what way I came by this tea, I found it laying about the warehouse; I had not a bit of paper to put it into, I put it in my pocket with full intention of taking it down to the accompting house; we were all very much hurried in our day's work, we did not leave the warehouse till the clock had struck two; it slipped my memory, when this gentleman asked me what I had got in my pocket; I said my pocket book; I did not recollect then; I had my pocket book in my other pocket; I recollected when I asked him to go back. I really forgot that I had the tea in my pocket.</p>

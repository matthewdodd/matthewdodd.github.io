No; she slept in the two pair of stairs, and she took this sheet from the one pair of stairs; I am very certain this is the same sheet; I have two more like it; I took it from under her petticoat, and I left a person to stand by her while I went for a constable, and when I came back the sheet was behind the door.</p>

I know nothing about it; I pulled all my things off, and she could find nothing; she said she had lost a great many things, and she would make me pay for all; and then she went into the one pair of stairs room, where two women were in bed, and she brought the sheet out from behind the door.</p>

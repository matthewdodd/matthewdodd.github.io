            . I am an officer, and was with Smith. I saw the prisoner putting the watch in his pocket, nearly opposite Lord Castlereagh's house; he was near the rails; three others were following him out of the crowd. I followed him to the other end of the square, and then took him. The watch was found in his pocket. He could not have picked it up; there were too many people.</p>

               <p>"Is there any one who owns this watch." The man saw me put it in my pocket and took me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a convict in the Pentonville Prison, undergoing sentence of penal servitude—I know the prisoners—I have known the Cruises about two years, and Palmer, who was a cabman, about five years—I know the house, 29, Golbyn Road, Westbourne Park, near Kensal Green—Mr. and Mrs. Cruise and a Mrs. Naylor resided there in December last—I went there on December 11th—I met Alfred Cruise, or Frederick I think his name is, on that day—he was going to Camden Town, and on the way he said, "I have got a mark where some carpets can be had, will you make one?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "It is an easy job"—he said he had seen them on several occasions, and made inquiries respecting the house, as it was to let—in the evening I was at the house mentioned—on our way from Camden Town he said it was impossible for me to carry them by myself, they were too weighty—he asked me if I knew one—I said "There is Palmer, he has nothing to do, perhaps he'll make one"—he said, "Let's go and see him"—so he accompanied me over the water to Kennington, where Palmer lived—we met Palmer in the Waterloo Road—we told him we had got a job for the next day, but did not tell him the particulars then—we appointed to meet at the Gower Arms, in Gower Street, at 11 next warning, it is a kind of private front—I accompanied Cruise to his house in the evening, in the Golbyn Road—Elizabeth Cruise was there—on the morning of the 12th Cruise told the old lady we were going to work the old lady for the carpets—she said, "I hope it will come off"—we went to Gower Street, and then Cruise said, "This is the house, I will go and see that it is all right"—he pointed it out, it was No. 70—he went there—I waited outside—he was there about twenty minutes—when he came out he said, "I have got the old lady's name," Roberts or Robertson, I can't say which—we went</p>

               <p>to the Gower Arms, and had something to drink—Palmer was waiting at the corner, and he went in with us—Cruise said, "We must write a note"—I said it would not do, the old lady is sure to know the governor's hand<lb></lb>writing—"Oh yes," he says, "that will do; she don't know no better"—Cruise told me what to write—he told me what part of the house the carpet was in—the other writing is not mine—I went with the note—Palmer and Cruise went after a truck—there was a name on the truck, something beginning with "C"—Palmer pulled the truck up to the door—upon presenting the note we got some stair carpet, turkey carpet, and some drawing-room carpet, and put it on the truck—I gave a man 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to help us—Cruise stood on the opposite side and had a laugh at us while we were trying to get it on—he followed till we got to a public-house, and then he helped to shove up behind—we pulled up at a public-house in George Street—we went into a beer-house in Camden Town—I forget the name of the street—there we squared up a little—about 7 in the evening a cart was going by, and we all asked the man if he would like to earn a few shillings by moving some carpets—they were then moved to Cruise's house in the Golbyn Road—they were left that night—afterwards the big carpet was cut, I think on the 14th—thirty odd yards of stair carpet was pawned by Cruise and Palmer—I waited at a beer-house—the Turkey carpet was pawned on the Monday before Christmas, by Cruise—the goods brought in altogether 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the money was divided—Mrs. Naylor had 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for opening the door.</p>

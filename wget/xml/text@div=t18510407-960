                  </hi>. I am coachman at 8, Finsbury-circus. On 10th March, at a quarter-past ten, I met the prisoner in Castle-street, and told him I would give him a job to come and pump some water for me, as I was in a hurry; and he came and pumped some—the carriage was in the yard where the pump was, and inside the carriage there was a coat of my master's and one of mine—he may have been there half an hour—I went into the stable to attend to my horse, and when I came back he was gone, and my coat also—I found out where he lodged, went to him in the evening, and charged him with stealing the coat—he said he was sorry for it, necessity compelled him to do it, that he pledged it for 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he had lost the money and ticket out of his waistcoat-pocket, and he had got an affidavit of it, which he showed me—he sent me the new ticket the next day, by a little boy—I have known him some years, and he knew where my yard was.</p>

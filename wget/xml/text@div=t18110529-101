               <p>Q. Was Bolton one of them men - A. He was. He then went down with the other man towards the craft with the waggon to take the coals out, as soon as the waggon was loaded he drew up to the counting-house<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181105290065"></xptr>to ask for the tickets; I observed the waggon and told him I believed he had more than twenty-one sacks in his waggon; he told me no he had not; I told him the situation of the sacks were such that induced me to believe that he had more; he told me no he had not, and stated that Bolton had forgot to pitch a seventh sack down on the near side, which accounted for the appearance of the waggon, having four sacks the last row of all. I told him I was not satisfied, and wished him to recollect whether he had more than twenty-one; he told me he certainly had not; I got upon the wheel of the waggon for the purpose of counting the sacks if I could, I was sure I counted twenty three, but they were so irregularly placed I was not certain whether they were twenty-four or no; I said to Manning I was not satisfied with the appearance of the waggon that he should draw up under the hay-loft window, and I would try to count them there; giving him an opportunity of being aware of my observations; and to take them out. The waggon stopped there, I endeavoured to count them, I could not do it precisely; twenty-three I was sure of, but I was doubtful of the fourth. He called to me as I was coming down stairs; are you satisfied, with a sneer; I told him I was satisfied, and he might go on; he went on; he should have gone straight on over Blackfriers bridge, into the Kent-road; I followed him down Fleet-street, I met Creswell the constable; I and Creswell followed the waggon, and instead of the waggon proceeding on the road it turned down by Rowland Hall's chapel, I followed, and we passed Union Hall. There we got another officer, his name is Clark. The waggon went into Snow's fields, it there stopped; upon its stopping Creswell desired me to fall back, so that I did not observe what was done by Manning; Creswell called me soon after, and told me they had detected the man delivering, and then I went into the house of

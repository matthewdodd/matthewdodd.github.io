             - on Thursday, the 9th of January, I was sent by my master with half-a-dozen hats to Mr. Myers, Hounsditch - and in Fenchurch-street I saw Clarke - he began talking to me, asked where I was going, and where I lived, and I told him - he then said he was going down Mark-lane, and turned into Mincing-lane - he came over in about five minutes, and said, "Have not you got farther?" - I said, "No" - he said, "I am going down a court opposite the East India House, and will walk with you" - then Smith came up and said, "Are not you going from Mr. Brown's to Mr. Myers'?"- I said, "Yes" - he said, "I have just come from Mr. Brown's, who said, if I made haste I should overtake you; you are to give me the hats, and to return home" - I said,"I have got to get the bill signed" - he said, "Mr. Brown said that was of no consequence" - I gave him the hats - he asked me to go down a court with him, which I did - and then he said the person was not at home - he was going away, and then said, "I am going down Cornhill, go on, and I will overtake you," and I saw no more of him - I went home and told master - Clarke had got out of me where I was going - and then Smith came up and seemed to know all about it - on the 15th I saw them together in Long-alley, and gave them into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. Is your master here? A. Yes - I had never seen Smith before - he was with me a very short time - when he said he had come from Mr. Brown's, I gave up the written direction - I am sure they are the two men - they each had got a brown coat on, and an umbrella - I am sure of Smith by the umbrella and coat, and by his face - I knew him again directly I saw him- I saw him again six days afterwards, and was quite sure of him - master had directed me to leave the hats at Mr. Myers's, and get the book signed - Clarke first came up to me in Fenchurch-street, about five minutes' walk from Cornhill.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you other persons in your establishment who manage your business? A. No - nobody sells hats but myself.</p>

Having reason to suspect all was not right, on the 27th of May, I marked two half-crowns, two shillings, and a sixpence, and sent them by my brother to Mr. Leach - I remained up stairs while Leach came to the shop and purchased some articles; I came down immediately he left, and told my brother to give me the money out of the till - I examined it, found two marked shillings and a sixpence in the till, and no more marked money; neither of the half-crowns were there -I sent for an officer, and the two half-crowns were found in the prisoner's pocket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. The prisoner was very confidential with you? A. I liked him as a <rs id="t18300527-192-deflabel1026" type="occupation">servant</rs>

               <p>Q. Then you owe him nothing? A. Yes, a promissory note; he holds my promisory note for 70l. - he was in business for himself, and I bought articles of him which were not exactly saleable, and gave him this promissory note till I was able to sell them - this was about three months ago; he could not sell his goods, and came into my employ - when the note is presented I will pay it; I never asked him to enter into partnership with me - I know Mr. Jordan; I deal with him, and owe him about 400l. - the prisoner was in his service, but went into business for himself on leaving him; I sell mercery goods, and Jordan is in the mercery line - Jordan did not threaten to call in his debt, if I did not get rid of the prisoner - I knew the prisoner in Jordan's service; I cannot exactly say how long he was in business for himself, perhaps about three months - I did not apply to him to come to me; he came because he could not get a living in business.</p>
               <p>Q. No doubt he got ready money for you for his goods then? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you the audacity to swear that? A. I bought a few articles of him.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. What became of the goods you gave the promissory note for? A. I have the greater part of them now - I paid him ready money for little things when he was in business; he gave me this little assistance with his goods, because I am a poor man.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you not say you was ready to pay the promissory note? A. Immediately it is presented it shall be paid; if I have not got the money friends will assist me - there were several half-crowns found in the till; I did not count them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the general managers of the London and County Bank—in consequence of information which was sent to me I went to the Covent Garden branch on the afternoon of Friday, 23rd April—I arrived there at 3.30—I think I had seen the cheque for 44<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and the other documents in Lombard Street, but I had them with me when I entered the bank—Maturin was in the bank office—I went into the manager's room—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a ground plan of the offices of the Covent Garden branch—the desk where Maturin usually sat, is marked with his name—I don't recollect whether he was there when I went into the bank—he was called into the manager's room two or three minutes after I got there, almost immediately—I had the cheque for 44<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at that time—I asked Maturin what explanation he could give as to the circumstances under which this cheque for 44<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. which had 'been paid into the bank in the morning to the credit of Mr. Hoar, found its way to the credit of Mr. Ambrose Brown in the middle of the day-—he said Brown had sent the cheque to him in an envelope and there was a memorandum with asking him to have the cheque placed to his credit as he had a bill to meet that day—I said "Can you show me the envelope"—he said he would go and loot for it—he brought in two envelopes addressed to himself, but they were both dirty and I said "It can't be either "of those two where is the memo<lb></lb>randum—he said he had torn it in' pieces and thrown it in his waste paper basket—L said "The pieces must be there perhaps you can go <hi rend="italic">and</hi> find them"—upto that time nothing had been said about Hoar's credit slip—it was about that time when we were speaking about the memorandum I said "Was not there a credit Slip paid in which these two cheques for Mr. Hoar"—he said "My rule is when there is a credit slip to check the cheque with the credit slip and then I put the slip on the file"—he pro<lb></lb>ceeded to look down the file for the credit slip; but could not find it—the file had been brought into the manager's room—he then went out into the bank to look for the fragments of his memorandum from Brown—I went with him and while he was looking at the frag<lb></lb>ments of his paper basket which he had turned out on a desk behind him I looked about the floor and picked up any fragments of paper which I could find there—he gave me the fragments of paper which he said was all he could find of the memorandum from Brown—that is now pasted together and forms the document which has been produced the fragments which I picked up from the floor, with two or three pieces which came from the waste paper basket, formed the credit slip marked "A "the fragments had been screwed up in little pieces and thrown about they-covered a space of about 6 or 8 feet—they surrounded his desk, and two pieces were found in the waste paper basket, but neither of those pieces had any writing on them, they were only portions of the slip—the pieces which I picked up from the floor had been crumpled up, manipulated—I went back to the room and called him in, and after we had stuck the pieces together as well as we could, I said "There is no reference in that memorandum of Mr. Brown's of his having sent you a cheque for 44<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—he said "The cheque was sent to me by Brown"—the fragments of the credit slip had been placed out</p>

               <p>flat so that I could make out the words "Sheffield" and "Wolverhampton," and the amount—they have been better pasted since—that is Mr. Hoar's credit slip which is marked "A"—I said "Here are the remains of Mr. Hoar's credit slip which came with these two country cheques"—he made an expression or gesture of surprise—I don't know what were the words ho used—I said "Someone has stolen this cheque, and not content with being a thief, he has thrown the fragments of the credit slip about your desk to throw suspicion on you"—he said "I hope you don't think that I am a thief"—I repeated that someone had stolen the cheque—I don't recollect whether I mentioned Brown's name at that time—he said that he was very anxious for the sake of his own character to have the matter investigated—I communicated with Mr. Mullens—the Sheffield cheque for 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was shown to me by the manager—I don't recollect who brought it in—I handed it to the last witness at the close of the day, to enter in the draft sent book—up to that time there was no—entry in that book of either of these cheques—I went and tried to see Mr. Brown between 4 and 5 o'clock—I went twice, but unfortunately I could not see him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am solicitor for the prosecution and solicitor to the Banker's Association—I was first made acquainted with any difficulty with reference to this branch, on Saturday 24th April—I went first to the London and County Bank, Lombard Street—shortly after I arrived Maturin was introduced into the manager's room at Lombard Street where I was sitting—Mr. McKewan said to him "That is Mr. Mullens the solicitor to the bank, we have requested him to make all possible inquiry into this matter"—I said to Mr. McKewan "I think the most convenient thing for me will be to go up to Henrietta Street with Maturin"—we left together, and after call<lb></lb>ing at my office, we went to Henrietta Street—I did not take any docu<lb></lb>ments with me—I had not been made acquainted with the case then, only that there was something for me to look carefully. into—when I got to Henrietta Street I was shown into Mr. Livermore, the manager's room, and he gave me a certain detail of the matter as far as it had trans<lb></lb>pired—Maturin was not present then—I saw Mr. South and took a state<lb></lb>ment from him and also from Mr. Lawrence, and then Maturin came in—I asked him to tell me how the cheque for 44<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. came into his hands along with the credit slip in Brown's writing—I took down this statement in writing and afterwards read it over to him, and he said it was correct; "Baylis gave me the envelope, between 11 and 12 o'clock. I opened it, read it, and threw it on my desk; contents, a memorandum, tore this up, credit him the cheque; went on with my, work. About a quarter to 1 o'clock went out to dinner after clearing up my desk, then seeing the credit I handed it over to the cashier, Mr. Lawrence, saying 'Will you, credit this to Brown, as he has got a bill or cheque' "(he said he did know which it was) "to meet; I did not examine it; I saw it was a, cheque and that is all. A little after 2 o'clock. I returned From dinner; Mr. Livermore spoke to me about where I got credit from; told him as above. I saw Brown, on the afternoon of 22nd April, he is a tailor in the Strand; he said "My acceptance has been returned again, and I have given a cheque for it. I will send up the first thing in the morning and again in the afternoon, before you close." I understand him to mean he would pay in money that morn<lb></lb>ing, and afterwards I was to mention it for him as he. would not like the cheque to go back. I did not see him yesterday. I did not go to him yesterday, or to-day; he has not written to me or 1 to him"—Mr. Liver<lb></lb>wure gave me the fragments of the memorandum which has been produced,</p>

               <p>and I put them in order and read it over to Maturin, and said "There is nothing said here about any cheque for 44<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., how do you account for it"—he said "I can't account for it, that is how it came to me"—it was then 4.30, I think in the afternoon, and I left the bank, making an appoint<lb></lb>ment for Maturin to meet me there again at 9.30 on Monday—I then went to Brown, but could not meet with him, he was at Brighton—on the Monday I went to the bank, shortly after 9 o'clock, and Mr. Livermore showed mo a letter marked "Y" beginning "Dear brother Maturin"—after reading it Maturin was sent for into the room—I then told him in consequence of something Mr. Livermore had said to me a discovery had been made that several falsifications had occurred in the books, and I particularly pointed out to him the addition of a figure "4" before "55" in the pounds column, making it appear to be 455<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I asked him if he "would give an explanation of it, and he said he could—he looked at the book and asked to see two or three books which he named, and they were all brought into the room—he had a slip of paper and a pencil in his hands and he turned over the leaves of the books and appeared to take extracts from them—Mr. Highton, the assistant manager, then began to put questions to him and I said "No, stop, no questions must be put to Maturin, if he has anything to say let him say it, he can do just as he pleases"—he paused for a moment, threw down the pencil and said "Then I won't"—an officer was in waiting, and he was then given in custody—I afterwards investigated the matter with reference to other charges, and I have been engaged on it ever since—this list which has been used was made out by me; I should say that is not the first list that I prepared—I prepared this—the first was not quite as large as this—there was a difference of about 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have never offered to accept money from Brown, or his solicitor, and to withdraw from the charge some conversation took place between me and Mr. Moss, which was at first without prejudice, and I took up the line which I always do in these matters—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the first list that I spoke of and the other is the same with the addition of two items and several items struck out—I found I had erroneously put down several items in that account which ought not to have been there—I made it correct and sent another list to Mr. Moss—I looked into the matter of Skinner's account which has been introduced to-day, but 1 found there was no occasion to go on with it—Skinner's casw does not resemble this in the slightest.</p>

Paddington, 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Dublin 49<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was the one that was improperly credited; Glasgow 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was improperly credited—Leeds 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 39<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—then there is the 44<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. which is being investigated now—I made the list 633<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—then there was a deduc<lb></lb>tion for the small balance there was on his account on 23rd April and I made the net amount 440<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Brown owes the bank that amount; he admitted that to be correct—he gave me a statement in writing of the way in which it came about; I have that statement here; it was made in consequence of a communication I had with Mr. Moss after he was committed for trial Mr. Moss sent me a paper signed by Brown and attested by Mr. Moss—I have had communications with Mr. Moss continually—he told me that Brown believed he was borrowing money from Maturin—he said that Maturin had represented himself to him as a man of considerable property</p>

               <p>not being dependent on his bank salary, but having property of his own, and that he had a banking, account of. his own at Vernon's—he said, he was induced, in consequence of these representations; to borrow money from him—these sums which he has admitted to be correct he said he believed he was borrowing from Maturin, and finding the money was obtained from the bank he was quite ready to pay the bank—I made remarks upon what Mr. Moss said; he has offered to pay the money—when Mr. Moss had gone over the original paper with me and told me that Brown averred that he had no idea but that he was borrowing money from Maturin personally, I put the figures over to him and said "If you look in the pass-book you will find the drafts are credited Greenock, Dumbarton, Dundee, Glasgow, Newcastle; do you mean to say that Brown did not know that he had never paid in any such drafts as those received from those places?"—I must say that that did not take place in one day; we had several interviews—Mr. Moss told me that Brown had written the letter dated from Brighton, at Maturin's dictation and that he had done it in order to get Maturin out of a scrape the diffi<lb></lb>culty understood what we were talking about—I don't find that the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which was entered was debited to Brown's account two days afterwards; it was not debited until after the investigation was begun—when the first two items were discovered they were debited immediately by the. manager to Brown's account—there is 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. credited on 20th February; I don't find a debit of that 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the 25th, certainly, not; it was not debited until after this matter was, discovered—there was one, "Dumbarton," that was not debited with "Dundee," the next day or two days afterwards; I can't say whether it was or not without the pass-book—I know only two items were debited which brought down the balance to 444<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; those two items were debited since the prisoners were committed for trial—I requested that the sums as discovered should be debited—sometimes the country cheques were entered as cash, and sometimes as sent for collection—Maturin did not lend money to Skinner that I am aware of.; I should say certainly not—I investigated the matter so far as to discover that Skinner's credit was a mis<lb></lb>take, in only one instance; I found that he had been credited with 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by mistake, which was afterwards rectified—I did not ascertain whether it was Maturin's mistake or not—there was not a mistake in Courts' case nor in any other, nor anything wrong—I have not found that Maturin has lent money to other people—Skinner's mistake had no reference to Maturin lending him money, so far as anything I have learned; it was discovered to be a mistake which might have been made by anybody—I do not know by whom it was made.</p>

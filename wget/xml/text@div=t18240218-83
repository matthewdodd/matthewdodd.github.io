            . I am servant to the prosecutor. On the 1st of February, at seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came into the kitchen, and said he was going out for milk; he never returned. About eight o'clock, when tea went up, the spoons were missing - we looked for the plate, and it was all gone. I had seen some of the table spoons and a dessert spoon on the kitchen table that day, the prisoner was in the kitchen at the time - I did not see him do anything to them - I saw him bring the soup-ladle into the kitchen in the evening; he was the only man servant; the key of the door, which he kept to let himself in, was found on the sideboard, in the front parlour.</p>

            . I am a constable of Mary-le-bone. On Saturday the 7th of February, I heard a cry of Stop thief! looked out of my door, and saw the prisoner pass. I followed him. A coachman on horseback was pursuing him. I followed him to Nassau-street, and lost him there. I am sure it was him. I went again in three-quarters of an hour, and saw him coming out of Union-mews - he ran away - I pursued, and lost sight of him again, but caught sight of him in Little Argyle-street; followed and took him in Cleveland-street, and asked why he ran away from the coachman; he said he did not know. I searched him, but found nothing.</p>

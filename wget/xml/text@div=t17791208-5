On Wednesday morning, the 20th of October, the two prisoners came into our shop between eight and nine o'clock; I think they are the two women; I am certain to one of them, who is Sarah Plodrow; I am not so certain to the other. They desired to see some muslin, which I shewed them; they said it was too high priced. They then desired to see some book muslin; I shewed them some.

             stoop down, and she seemed rather confused, upon which I looked on the counter and missed some muslin, I asked her if there was not some muslin dropped down on her side, as I was certain I missed some off the counter. They immediately said there was not any at all.</p>
               <p>There was, I suppose, a counter between you? - There was.</p>
               <p>Who told you there was none dropped? - They both said there was none dropped. As I thought there was, to give myself an opportunity to look over the muslins, I sent out for change.</p>
               <p>Had you any of your own people in the shop? - Nobody else. They offered me a guinea to change to pay for what they had bought, I rang the bell for the maid, in order to send her for change; she not being in the way a gentleman's servant who lodged in the housewent. During the time the man was gone for change, the person whom I suspected to have taken the muslin, went to the door under pretence of looking for the servant that was gone for the change and she went away; upon which I told

             that her friend was gone from the door. She said it did not signify, she perhaps might see her again, but if she did not it was not material; I said her going away confirmed me in my suspicion that she had taken the muslin. At this time the man returned with the change; I told the man, whose name is Hallet, that the other woman whom he had seen in the shop had stolen some muslin and was gone away. I did not know what to do, I was extremely intimidated. Plodrow said directly that she was very willing to surrender herself to be searched, to shew that nothing was upon her. She desired me not to be positive that I had lost the muslin, as I was in so great a flurry; but to look over them more carefully. I had taken an account of them myself but the day before; they are entirely in my charge; I lost three remnants of muslin, making in the whole fourteen yards.</p>
               <p>What is it worth a yard? - They were different prices, one at four shillings, another at five and sixpence, and the other at five shillings a yard. I sent for a constable to take charge of Plodrow; she said she did not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177912080006"></xptr>know where to find the other woman. Plodrow was taken before Justice Hyde, who committed her. Justice Hyde sent for me again on Thursday evening, and said he had learned where this other woman was, but that I must go and look at her to see if I knew her. I went, and as near as I can tell, from the great intimidation I was under at the time, and from the situation of the house I went to, I think that the prisoner Taylor is the person.</p>
               <p>Do you now believe it to be so, though you are not positive? - I do believe her to be the person, but I cannot be positive.</p>
               <p>What dress had she on? - I did not remark particularly, only that they had both black cloaks; one I think had on a crape gown, but I cannot be positive to that.</p>
               <p>Plodrow. This Lady (the other prisoner) is not the person who was in the shop with me.</p>

               <p>I attend at the Rotation-office in Litchfield-street for Mr. Smith, of Tothill-fields Bridewell. I went along with Miss Gollop, and the Justice's clerk, to seek for the prisoner, Taylor. I told Miss Gollop we would go to the houses about St. Giles's with her, and if she saw the woman I told her not to mention it immediately for fear of any disturbance. We went into an alehouse where she saw the prisoner Taylor; she said she believed she was the woman, but she could tell better the next morning. The next morning she said she believed she was one of the women.</p>

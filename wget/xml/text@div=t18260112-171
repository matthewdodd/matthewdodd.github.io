               <p>JOHN WAIN. I am seventy-eight years of age, and live at Hendon - I have a little garden. On the evening of the 17th of December, I was with my barrow at the <placeName id="t18260112-171-crimeloc969">Eight Bells, Hillingdon</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18260112-171-crimeloc969" type="placeName" value="Eight Bells, Hillingdon"></interp>

I had half a pint of beer there and was coming away - the landlord said it was a quarter past ten o'clock; I then went out and proceeded straight across the road into the foot-path; I had wheeled my barrow about 200 yards on the foot-path, and saw no one on the road till a person came behind and pushed me down; he stepped out of the road and held me down with one hand, drawing my watch out with the other. I had no help in me, and my falling turned my barrow a little aside; as soon as I got up I saw the person running at a good distance; the moon shone; I went back directly to the Eight Bells; I could not tell exactly who it was, but I described his height, and said he had a brown coat on; some person in the tap-room said they thought they knew who it was; we went to see if we could find any footsteps; I had left my barrow there, and we saw two foot-steps just before one another, close to where I had been held down - it was soft ground, and the mark of the two feet were very distinct, and the impression of the tips and nails of the shoes. I went home and went to bed, and was called up again. The prisoner is the same sized man, and had the same coloured coat on - I believed he was the man, and I believe so now. When he took my watch he ran towards his own house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was before him the same night, and he said he did not think it was me, and he could not swear to me. Witness. No; I said I would not swear to him, but I thought he was the man.</p>

            . I was watchman. I was sent for to the Eight Bells; I said I had seen the prisoner come from the lower part of the town to his own house - it was past ten o'clock, but not half-past; he would have to pass the Eight Bells in his way home from where I saw him; the landlord, and some other persons there, suspected him, and I went to his father's house, in about three hours, and found him in bed - I found a pair of shoes, which he acknowledged were his, and he was going to put them on - they were old shoes, and had been lately mended - they had heel tips and nails in them. I got a light and fitted the shoes to the marks - they fitted exactly in nails and tips, and size. I do believe that the impressions there made had been made by these shoes - the barrow had been taken away before I got there.</p>

            . I was called up to take the prisoner. I compared his shoes to the places where the foot-steps were - they corresponded exactly - the tips of the shoes had been put on the day before, and out of the toe of one shoe there was a nail gone, which corresponded with the foot marks.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's mother. He lodged with me - my husband is alive - he worked in the brick fields last summer, and was digging a well at Acton, about three weeks before this; on the night in question I went to bed at ten o'clock, and he came home in a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes; I am sure it did not exceed the half hour. I have every reason to suppose he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182601120064"></xptr>went to bed directly. My house may be two hundred yards from the Eight Bells.</p>

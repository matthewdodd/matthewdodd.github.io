                  </hi>. I keep a shop at 3, Little White Lion-street, Seven Dials—on 19th April, between 8 and 9 in the evening, the prisoner came and asked me to show him two plated desert spoons which were in the window; he asked the price of the two—I said "A shilling"—he offered me eightpence for them—I said "No; I have refused tenpence, and will take no less than a shilling"—he said he would take them to his mistress and see if she approved of them, and, if not, he would return in ten minutes and would I take them back if she did not—I said "Yes"—he gave me a florin and I gave him a shilling—he left with the spoons—after he had gone I bit a piece out of the florin, and found it was bad—I had-no other money in my pocket, and did not mix it—I went out and found him in a public-house, five minutes walk off, drinking gin and water—I waited till he came out, and said, "Young man, you bought two plated spoons of me about a quarter of an hour ago"—he said, "No"—I tapped him on the breast, and said, "You have got the spoons still"—I took them out, held him till a policeman came, and gave him in custody, with the spoons and the florin.</p>

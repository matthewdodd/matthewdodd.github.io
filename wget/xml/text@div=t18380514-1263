                  </hi>. I live with Mr. Halliday, who keeps the Staf<lb></lb>ford Arms, at Pimlico. On Wednesday, the 4th of April, I served the prisoner with a glass of gin, between seven and eight o'clock—he gave me a shilling, and I gave him change—I put the shilling into the till—there was no other shilling there at that time—about eight o'clock Mr. Halliday came down—he took the shilling from the till, and saw it was a bad one—I am sure it was the same that the prisoner had given me—Mr. Halliday laid the shilling on the shelf, and told Mrs. Halliday and me not to meddle with it—it remained there till the evening, when Mrs. Halliday served the prisoner with half a pint of ale, and he gave her another shilling—the shil<lb></lb>ling that remained on the shelf was given to the officer.</p>

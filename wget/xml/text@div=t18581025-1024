                  </hi>. I live with my mother at Peckham, and am a retired tradesman. On Monday afternoon, 26th July, I had occasion to go out about a few minutes after 3—I left my mother at home alone—I returned in about twenty minutes—I came in at the side entrance with my latch-key, and came the back way into the kitchen—when I came in I saw a man laying hold of my mother; she was in a chair and the man was standing over her holding her by the wrists—I thought at first that she was ill—I said, "Hallo, what are you doing with my mother?"—the man looked up very much confused and started towards the passage door—I laid hold of him by his two collars—he dragged me towards the staircase and hallooed out, "Jim! Jim!" upon which two men came downstairs—I was then at the foot of the stairs, holding the man who had had hold of my mother—the prisoner is one of the two that came down the stairs; the other one was a taller man than the prisoner; he had a life-preserver in his hand, and he struck me with it six times on the head, and a terrible blow on the jaw-bone, I could not eat for nearly a month afterwards, except soft victuals—I was struck seven times altogether; six times on the head and once on the jaw—it was this life-preserver (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), or one very much like it—I kept hold of the man who had been in the kitchen until the three of them came upon me—I then left go of him and went into the garden to give an alarm—the men followed me; one of them went out through the side-gate, another flew over the wall, and this man, when he had got some little distance in the garden, turned round and grated his teeth, and felt in his breast-pocket for something—I then threw a garden-pot at him and hit him in the breast with it—he then turned round and jumped over the wall; it is a six-foot wall—I returned into the house—there was an outcry about one of the men being taken—that was the man that I found in the kitchen—he was taken and brought back by the constable, and he has been tried and convicted—I found this life-preserver in the passage, and the hat of the man who has been convicted—I went up<lb></lb>stairs, and in my bedroom, I found one drawer open, and the things in it were pulled from the back to the front, I suppose to see what there was in it; there was not much of any value—I missed a broken seal and an old purse, that was all—at that time a man named Perry lived next door to me—when I went in on this occasion I saw Perry leaning over his gate with his arms folded, at the time the men were in the house.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my father at Albert-cottage, James-ground, Peckham. On Monday, 26th July, about 3 o'clock in the afternoon, I was in front of Mr. Kilburn's house—I could see the garden-wall of Mr. Kil<lb></lb>burn's—I saw two men get over it; the prisoner is one of them—he used to come to Mr. Perry's house early of a morning and go out—Mr. Perry's house is next door to Mr. Kilburn's—I have seen him go to Mr. Perry's house about six or seven times—when I saw him get over the wall I ran round through my father's cottage, and I saw this man and another man run past me—I saw the prisoner throw something like this (a life-preserver) into the hedge—I afterwards looked in the hedge where it had been thrown; I could not find it, and I called a gardener's man and he knocked it out with his hoe—that was where I saw the prisoner throw it—it did not appear as if it had been long in the hedge when I got it out; it was perfectly dry—I have gene<lb></lb>rally seen the prisoner come out of Perry's house about 3 or 4 o'clock in the morning—I have no doubt but that he is the man I saw getting over the wall on this Monday afternoon.</p>

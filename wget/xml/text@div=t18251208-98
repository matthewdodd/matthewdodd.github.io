               <p>BENJAMIN PHILLIPS. I am a constable. On the 17th of November, about seven o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner and another young man, who appeared older than himself, in company with him; one of them was at the door of Fowler's shop, and the other at the window; I watched, and saw them go a little distance from the door and exchange hats; the prisoner had a white straw hat, and the other a black one; the prisoner then went into the shop and brought out the till, which he gave to his companion, and they went on - I took them both - the elder man struck me, dropped the till and got away - I still kept the prisoner, and said I was sorry he was in such a job as that - he said the other had led him into it.</p>
               <p>LYDIA FOWLER. I am in partnership with my sister Harriet - we keep a little shop - the constable came and told me the till had been taken - I saw it afterwards - it had two sixpences and some copper in it.</p>

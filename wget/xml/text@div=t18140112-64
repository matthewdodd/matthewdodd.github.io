               <persName id="t18140112-64-person597">Q. </persName>
            What are you - A. A watchmaker; I live in Ship-yard, Temple-bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you acquainted with Vickrey, the officer - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At the latter end of October, did he furnish you with any bank notes - A. Yes, on Sunday the 31st of October; I took these bank notes to the White Hart, Hooper-square, Goodman's-fields. He gave me eight one-pound notes and a two-pound note, ten pounds in value.</p>
               <p>Q. What public-house - A. The White Hart, Hooper-square, Goodman's-fields; it was in the evening. I went there about half past seven.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got there whom did you meet - A. The male prisoner at the bar; I told him I was informed that he had got some screens to dispose of.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you understand by screens - A. Bank notes. The prisoner said he had got some screens to dispose of, but he had got but seventeen, what could I stand for them; I said, what are they, bank; he said no, country, Colchester bank; they were prigg'd screens. I understood by that that they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181401120034"></xptr>were stolen notes; prigg'd screens is the cant term for stolen notes. I told him as for that I did not care about that, I was going out of town, and if any body could work them I could.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you mean by working them - A. Get rid of them. He then said, are you going to Wales; no, Yarmouth; I thought of trying them along the coast. The prisoner said, oh, the coast will do well, and seemed pleased at the idea. He next said, well, what will you stand for them; I replied, I am not prepared to take a great number, as I have but ten pounds about me; I said, when were they got, have they been got long; he replied, no, only the night before last. I said it was necessary I should know whether he would wish them to be started immediately, or whether he would wish them to sleep, that is to lay by until they were forgot; he replied, oh, sleep, by all means; I would not have one of them started for three months; I told him very well, it should be so, the money was no object. He said now to business. I said what do you ask for them; he said, he did not know; what did I give; I said, that depends upon circumstances. He then said, what did you give for the last; I said, twelve; meaning twelve shillings a piece. The prisoner replied that will be about fourteen for ten pounds; I said, no, as it is our first dealing, and I have to lay out my money, I must have fifteen. The prisoner said, I have got a partner, I don't know whether he will agree to it; I said, tell him it must be so, I will have fifteen. The prisoner replied, I do not know, I will go and get them. I said, dear me, I understood you had them about you here; he said, no, but I shall not be long in fetching them. How long will you be gone; he said, I will not be above twenty minutes. He went, and in about twenty minutes he returned to me again, told me he had got the fifteen. He came into a private room. and very carefully drawed the curtains around him; he took out the fifteen notes. He gave me the fifteen notes, and desired me to count them; I being somewhat agitated, I counted only fourteen. The prisoner said, give me leave, you have made a mistake.</p>

                  <persName id="t18140112-64-person598">Q. </persName>
            What money did you pay him with - A. The ten pounds I received of Vickrey, the eight one-pound notes and the two-pound note. After we completed the bargan we parted. I immediately went to Vickery at the White Swan, in Mansell-street. I have measured the ground since, it is about four hundred paces.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus. You said you were called out; who was the person that called you out - A. It was a person acquainted with Vickrey.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was that person that called you out - A. It was an entire stranger to me; he called me out of the public-house where I was waiting for the express purpose of seeing the prisoner.</p>
               <p>COURT. Do you know the man's name - A. I do; I believe his name is

            . Q. In the latter end of October last, did you employ the last witness, Emblin, to endeavour to detect the prisoner - A. I did, under the direction of the magistrate. On Sunday the 31st of October, I furnished Emblin with eight one-pound notes and one two-pound note for the purpose of dealing with him; I took the numbers and dates of the notes on a piece of paper, and marked some of them in the back; some were already marked on the back, of which I took the particulars.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that Emblin went to the public-house that he has spoken of, did you, Lavendar, Westbrook, and Bacon, go any where - A. We did;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181401120035"></xptr>we went to the Swan in Mansell-street. When I gave Emblin the notes, I followed him to within fifty yards of the house I had sent him to; it was not the White Hart that I had sent him.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon afterwards did you see him again - A. I waited in the street for him; I saw him within a quarter of an hour. I saw him running on the other side of the way; I met him in the street. He gave me fifteen one-pound, Colchester notes; I marked them all, and the next day I delivered them to Mr. France. I marked them before I parted with them. These are all the right notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, look at the last, the last note is the note upon which this indictment is framed. After you had received these of Emblin, did you and the other officers proceed to the habitation of the prisoner - A. We did.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was that to the spot where you saw Emblin come back - A. From where I left Emblin to make the purchase I suppose it is about a quarter of a mile.</p>

            After you had received these notes of Emblin you went, and the other officers to the house where you could find the prisoner - A. Yes, we fell in with him in Chamber-street, St. George's in the East. It was in the street that I found him and the woman at the bar together.</p>
               <p>COURT. You found him about a quarter of a mile from the Swan public-house - A. Yes, I knew that was in the way to his lodging. I found him and the woman walking together; I walked behind them about an hundred yards; at the turnpike-gate I stopped them; I knew there was a house there that I could search by the light. They were arm in arm walking together, as if in company. I called them by name, took hold of them both, and took them into the turnpike-house. The prisoners were searched in my presence; there were a quantity of notes found upon them of that description; they are in Lavendar's custody. I heard Lavendar say he found two one-pound genuine notes upon the prisoner

               <p>Q. When did you see Abey last - A. I met him to day, as I was coming here, close to my own house; about three miles from here.</p>
               <p>Q. to Emblin. You gave the prisoner all the notes that you had of Vickrey - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You told him you had been used to give twelve shillings, he said he would give fourteen for ten pounds; did it not occur to you that nine pounds would make the purchase - A. I was employed to make the purchase; I did not mind the price.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you find upon him these two bank notes which are now produced - A. I did; I likewise found three one-pound notes, purporting to be Colchester notes of one-pound each; they have not been out of my possession ever since: and I found a large copper plate upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the plate - A. It certainly is. I found four bits of copper upon him</p>
               <p>Q. Are these the bits of copper - A. Yes. The large copper plate I found upon him leaves the place blank where bank should be; the bits of copper fill up the blanks in the large plate; so as to make up such notes as were found upon him, excepting the one pound and the signature.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen these two impressions made from the large plate - A. Yes, and the one pound in the centre I put in myself, in the presence of a witness. I likewise found two glass stamps, one the impression of a crown upon it, and the other the word four-pence upon it, and a circle. These are the stamps.</p>
               <p>Q. Do they appear to be in imitation of the stamp imprest upon promissory notes - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you examined these notes found upon him, so as to say whether they are imprest with this stamp - A. Certainly; I have some of them. I believe them to be imprest with this stamp.</p>

            's Defence. I beg leave to observe the things that Westbrook produced were brought to my lodgings, by Samuel, saying, he wished to leave them at my lodging until he returned; he never did return. Samuel was the man that 
               <persName id="t18140112-64-person620">drew</persName>
             the draft of the plate on paper, and took me to this man's door to give the order for the plate. When I went for the plate then he took me again to the door, and gave me a pound note to pay for it; and the very Sunday evening of this transaction Samuel gave me a roll of paper with a bit of thread round it, and told me there was a particular friend of his waiting at the public-house for it. He did not observe what the roll was to me. When he gave it me he said, there is the man, go in and have some conversation with him; the man has been transported, but that is nought to you. As to the conversation that Emblin has said I had with him is all false; there was, nothing of the kind. The only conversation that I had with Emblin, was to know whether he was the man that wanted the roll of paper, and when I gave him the roll of paper he presented me with ten pound, saying it was for Samuel. Samuel sent me to him in that house, saying, he had got to go to Wellclose-square, and that he had no time. When I came out of the house Samuel came to me, and said, has he given you any money for me; he then said, he promised to lend me two pounds; he lent me two pounds out of that ten pounds. I presume that is the two pounds the officers found upon me, and then when we came out of the Brown Bear my wife and me were talking together upon different subjects. I had occasion to go under a gateway; Samuel gave me these things, saying, he would call for them in the morning; there was going to be an execution in his house. I left him under the gateway, and when I returned he was giving my wife a parcel, I presume the parcel that was found upon her; he said to her here, mistress, put this in your pocket, and when you come to tea to-morrow bring it with you. I am sure she did not know what it contained. Emblin told me he knew 
               <persName id="t18140112-64-person621">Samuel</persName>
             a long time. I did not ask him what the transaction was. As for the conversation that he has related never passed; it is entirely false. Mr. Vickrey has said, he should like to have got hold of Samuel. It is well known that Vickrey knows what kind of a man Samuel is better than I do. I could enter into many things about Samuel. It is well known it is not in my power to bring such a thing as this to perfection. Samuel was the man that found the money to get this plate made, under pretence of its going into the country, and when we went to Mr. Justins' door he told me to go in and pay for it. I am very sorry Samuel is not at this bar to-day; it would be of service to this country if he had, for the the numerous things that he has been guilty of; he is the sole cause of my misfortune. It is well known it never was in my power to do such a thing as this. The rascal wanted me to rob the house I lodge in of two feather beds, and the landlady's chest at the foot of the bedstead; he wanted to unscrew the lock to see what was in it. I am confident my wife is innocent of any offence.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you been in the granary. - A. I had, on the over night there was corn and empty sacks in it. I sat up all night on seeing one of Mr. Greenway's servants leave the granary door open. About half past three o'clock Thomas Sanders, Mr. Greenway's servant, went down the yard towards the stable door, in the mean time, a young woman was coming towards the room with the light, I went to stop her from coming into the room with the light, and

After he came down the granary stairs, I went down to the front door, and when he came out into the street, I walked on one side of the way, and he on the other, across the centre of the town, he went into the boot yard with a sack of corn on his shoulder, and after he came out of the boot yard, he came down and crossed the road and spoke to me, after that my mother's sister let me in, I saw Burgers take the second sack out, and take it to the same place, being a moon-light night, I could see him go up the same yard from my own house.</p>

            . I live at Watford. From the information of the last witness, I immediately went to Edgware, I heard from Burger's master, that he was gone to town with a load of hay. I followed the load of hay, and about a hundred yards before I came to Hampstead, I observed the end of a full sack of corn as I supposed it to be, the end was not quite covered with a cloth, the other part was. I went down Hampstead to get a constable, which I did, and then went to meet Burgers. When we got in sight of him, I saw him set his horses off from where Mr. Giles lived, he was talking to Mr. Giles, he was on the foot-path, I gave the constable charge of him, and asked him what he had done with the corn, he said he had none, I told him I was sure he had, I had seen one of the sacks when I passed him, I asked Mr. Giles if he knew any thing about it, he said he did not, I went into Mr. Giles's house, I asked him where the corn was again, he said he had not seen any, I told him I should insist upon finding it before I quitted the premises, I was sure it was there, I searched the ground floor, found nothing there, I went down stairs, and then I found the corn. I told 
               <persName id="t18110220-41-person477">Giles</persName>
             I was sure that was my corn, one sack was as it was in the cart apparently, and the other sack of corn was shot into a tub.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know that sack. - A. Yes, it was one that I had on my premises.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the corn. - A. Yes, so far as any person can know corn, the sample from the bulk. Giles, the prisoner then told me that he bought it of Burgers, and gave him a pound note for it.</p>
               <p>Q. How much was the corn worth. - A. About a pound, or a guinea. This is the sack, it was one entrusted in my care.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I bought it, and gave a fair price, it was shot in an open town, where a number of people must have passed. I had no thought of a person offering to sell a stolen thing at that time of the day.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

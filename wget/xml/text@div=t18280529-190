On the 28th of April the prisoner came to master's shop in a hackney-coach, and stopped at the opposite shop, which is also master's; Huntsman (master's nephew) came over to me, with him, and told me to give him 1l. 5s.; I gave him one crown, four half-crowns, and 10s. - it was Mr. Keen's money.</p>

On the 28th of April the prisoner came and asked me for 25s.; I thought it was all right, as my uncle had gone out with him on business - Slade gave him the money from the till; the prisoner was in a coach and drove off with it - when he came, he said "Make haste, run over the way, and tell Henry to give me 25s.," which I did.</p>

            . I am an officer. I had a warrant to take the prisoner; he was intoxicated, and said he would not be searched - he gave up 2l., and threatened to bring actions against us all; there was a crown-piece, seven half-crowns, and other silver, among the money he gave me.</p>
               <p>JAMES HEDGES KEEN re-examined. I had lent the prisoner money several times; he was repairing Mr. Yates' house, and was to pay me when he received the money - instead of which, he brought me a letter to read for him; it was addressed to him, and stated that his Lordship would give his decision in some case on the 28th of April, and wishing to see him about a bond: he came to me again on the 27th and persuaded me to go with him, and on the 28th said I should receive my money; I went with him and his boy to Lyons' Inn, to Mr. Dix's office - he came out in a few minutes and said "Come along;" we went to Boswellcourt and got some refreshment - he told us to wait there while he got a lobster, but he did not return: he talked about receiving 128,000l. - I do not believe he had any law-suit.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 3, Denison's Terrace, Redman's Row—about 12.40 on the morning of the 12th June I was in Sidney Square, Mile End, on my way home, having left my sister's house at 12 o'clock—as I was passing the Three Compasses, where it was rather dark, suddenly two men came and took hold of me; they held my arms down very tightly, one on one side and one on the other—one held my hand down with the" right hand and rifled my right hand pocket with the other; the other one still kept hold of my arm down by my side—they took my purse, containing 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., three keys on a ring, and a scarf pin of no value—I called "Police!"—one of them hit me on the right side of my face and knocked me down—I should not like to swear to the man who did that, but I believe the prisoner to be the man in my own mind—I won't say who hit me; but it came from my right side—this latch key belongs to me.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, K</hi> 102). On the morning of 12th June, about 12.40, I heard cries of "Police!" and "Thieves!" in Sidney Square, Mile End—I ran up towards the spot where I heard the cries—I saw the last witness on the ground and two men running away—I asked the pro<lb></lb>secutor what was the matter—T thought he said "I have been robbed by those two men of a sovereign"—I pursued he two men through Lady Lake's Grove and Newcastle Place into the Mile End Road—one ran. to the left and the other crossed the road; that was the prisoner—he fell across a form there was standing outside a public-house—I did not lose sight of him; I caught hold of him—he said "There is a man says he has been robbed in Sidney Square; you must come back until I see"—he refused to come back, and resisted very violently and pulled my light lamp from my belt—with the assistance of another constable I brought him back—the prosecutor was gone—the prisoner appeared to be strongly under the influence of drink.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Brown, and live at No. 45, Horrox-street, Marylebone. I went out on the morning of the 3rd of August, leaving my baby's cotton night gowns safe—I left the prisoner in my room—she was a lodger of mine—when I came back, about seven o'clock, I went to the box and missed them—I accused the prisoner—she said she had not taken them—here is one of them—it was found in a marine-store shop.</p>

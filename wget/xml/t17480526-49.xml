               <p>Cuthbertson . The Defendant did bail the action, and it was nonsuited by Mr. Graves the attorney.</p>

               <p>Cuthbertson. He gave bail to the action that afternoon, but I did not care to serve it.</p>
               <p>Pris. Did you tell Mr. Travers this as you came along?</p>
               <p>Cuthbertson. Yes, I told him there was an action entered against him, and by whom.</p>
               <p>Q. What, that it was Blake that had sworn to it, and taken it out in the name of Elgar ? How came you to take bail for such an action?</p>
               <p>Cuthbertson . It was by direction.</p>

               <p>Q. What is Mr. Weaver?</p>
               <p>Travers. He is a serjeant at mace.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it by your consent that she went there?</p>
               <p>Travers. No, my Lord; they found a way to lock me up eleven months in Ludgate, and robbed me of all I had; Esquire Davis knows the whole affair, and I have a note of 50 l. from Elgar to Mrs. Travers.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is your wife now?</p>
               <p>Travers. My wife has been dead three or four months, and the two children were sent home to me. She sent for me about an hour and an half before she died, and delivered some old things to me, and there was a note of Elgar's hand, payable to my wife, for 50 l.</p>

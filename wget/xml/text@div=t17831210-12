               <p>Had he a bludgeon in his hand? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He was in company with the other? - Yes, they were taken about three quarters of an hour after, I followed them, I went to Acton, I came to Shepherd's Wash, and got some people to go with me, I found Haines in a publick-house, and Crouch near his own door; at the time he stood by while I was robbed, I knew Crouch particularly.</p>

               <p>Jury. The prosecutor has not mentioned any crooked farthing.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. What do you say as to the farthing? - I cannot be positive to it, I had a crooked farthing, it was taken from me, I believe this to be it.</p>
               <p>Bowyer. The prisoners both denied it then, but on their examinations before Sir Sampson Wright you will find they confessed the robbery. (The confessions which were taken in writing before the Justice shewn to him.) This was Haines's confession which I saw him sign, it was read over to him before he signed it, it was free and voluntary; it is signed by Mr. Addington: Crouch made the confession first, and on Haines being sent for over, he immediately confessed it; they were both read over to them, indeed Crouch read his himself; he said he was induced to commit the robbery by Haines, who first proposed it.</p>

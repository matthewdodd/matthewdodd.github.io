On the 28th of June, about nine o'clock at night, the prisoner came and asked to see some shoe ribbon, which came to 3 d. I was measuring it, and saw her take something out of the ribbon box - I asked her what she had got - she said nothing; I took her hand from her pocket, and there were seven yards of ribbon. She still declared she had nothing. I gave her in charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. She had some liver and bacon in her hand - A. Yes. She put her other hand into her pocket, as if to pay me - she did not take it up to look at it - she had no money to pay for it.</p>

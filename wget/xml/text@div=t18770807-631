               <p>streets into White Cross Street, where the Great Northern Depot, the Bee Hive, is—three or four of their vans were waiting to go in—Yearly went to the tail of van 476, took hold of a box near the tail of the Tan and pulled it over—Hosier was close to him with his face towards him—the boy then came to the back of the van, fastened up the the tailboard and went to the front of the van again—Yearley made a second attempt to take the box, but the carman drove away—I afterwards saw Hosier go to the tail of van No. 348, Yearley was close by Hosier, reached over the van and took a brown paper parcel from the middle of it which he pulled half-way over the tail<lb></lb>board—the boy <hi rend="italic">drawed</hi> the van into the yard and the prisoners walked on. Hollowed them and took them in custody, and charged them with stealing the parcel—they both said "Well, we did not get it"—Hosier said at the station "You have got us straight and we cannot grumble"—they gave false addresses.</p>

I am a van guard in the employ of the Great Northern Railway—on 9th July I was in charge of a van outside the depot—I saw Yearley go to the van and draw a box to the tail—I went and put up the tail of the van and said to Hosier "Somebody has been interfering with this, he had better not let me see him do it again"—I also saw Yearley—the van driver was inside—I fastened up the tail and went round the off side—Yearely walked away before Hosier, and then I went away.</p>

In the morning of the 9th of May, at about five o'clock, I discovered my house to have been broken open; I was called up by some man passing by; I discovered my kitchen shutters to have been opened; it is not a sunk kitchen; they were inside shutters; the glass of the sash was broken, or cut; the sash fastening was forced; it had been fastened by an extra screw. Two holes were bored through the shutters, one with a gimlet, and the other with a centre-bit; they had first made a hole on that side of the shutter which would not enable them to get down the bar; then they made another hole on the other side large enough for them to get their hands through. I then discovered that the things mentioned in the indictment were gone; I discovered a basket was missing, which had been ready placed with the things to go to the mangle. At the lowest rate, the things I lost came to sixteen pounds, eighteen pounds, or twenty pounds; they were all my property; I was the sole occupier of the house, with my family. I can't say I was the last up the night previous; of my own knowledge, I know that the sash of the kitchen was fastened down; I went to bed at about eleven o'clock; I had seen the greater part of the things the night previous, before I went to bed; some I had worn, and some my children had worn. I was not disturbed at all until five o'clock. When I came down stairs in the morning, I found a gimlet in the kitchen, immediately under the shelf; in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181605290012"></xptr>front court I found a large oak stick, and the kitchen bar, the bar which fastens the shutters; I found a candle also turned with the wick downwards in a salt-seller in the roasting-jack; there was salt in the salt-seller. I never used a candle in that way. All my properly has not been found.</p>

                  </hi>. My husband is a whip-thong maker, of Sweetland-court, Bishopsgate-street. On 6th April I was cleaning windows, and saw the prisoner come up the court—I had occasion to go in doors, and about five minutes afterwards saw the prisoner turning round the sentry box in which the fireman sits—I went down stairs, and saw him open the fireman's box, and take out what I thought was a blanket and a coat—he laid them down on the pavement, turned the box into its right place, put the cord across it, picked the things up, put them under his arm, came up to me, and asked me which was Shoreditch station—I told him I thought he knew better than I did, but if he did not it was straight along; but he did not go straight along, he turned down Artillery-lane, which excited my suspicions, and I followed him—I met Blowes, the policeman, and told him.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>, 616). On the evening of 16th Aprill, about a quarter to 8 o'clock, Mrs. Covill told me something, and pointed to the prisoner—I stopped him, and asked what he had got there; he said he had got his brother's things out of the fire escape box—I said, "What is your brother's name?" he said, "Tyler," and that his brother was going to be shifted to Old-street-road, which I knew to be the case; and knew the name to be right, therefore I let the prisoner go—I afterwards saw him and identified him.</p>

               <p>conversation with her—I was six or seven minutes in conversation with the prisoner in the street—I did not know who he was, or I should have taken him before—I believe at the time I identified the prisoner at the Mansion House, the other prisoners were told to take their caps off—the prisoner had not a fireman's cap in his hand then, he had a different cap—he had a fireman's cap when he was examined at Clerkenwell.</p>

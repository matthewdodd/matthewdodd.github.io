                  </hi>. I am a dock foreman, and live at Whitechapel—on the evening of 27th November I was going through Prince of Orange Court, St. George's, about 6 o'clock in the evening—I was going home from my employment, carrying my coat on my arm—the prisoner struck me a blow on the face, which knocked me down; and as I was falling, the man who "was with him snatched my coat off my arm and ran away—I jumped up and seized the prisoner immediately—I have no doubt that he is the man that struck me—he gave me a black eye.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The blow was violent and sudden, and I fell to the ground—I saw no one but the two men, and two or three boys playing in the court—the court leads from one street into the other; it is about 30 yards long—merely observed the back of the other man as he ran away—I could not swear to him.</p>

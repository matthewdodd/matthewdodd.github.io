                  </hi>. My husband is a victualler, of Rotherhithe-street. On 18th Nov. the prisoner came, between 11 and 12 o'clock in the evening—he asked for a pint of porter—he gave me in payment a Victoria sixpence—I was very busy, and it did not strike me it was bad—I put it into the till—I am quite sure I saw what the reign was—there was other silver in the till—the prisoner went into the tap room, and drank the porter—he afterwards came back for some more, and offered me a sixpence, precisely like the other—that was about ten minutes after he had come the first time—I had been serving other persons in the mean time, but I had taken no silver—I had not put any other silver into the till, I am quite certain—when he gave me the second sixpence, I said, "I don't think this is a good one; you gave me a sixpence before; why do you not give me 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the porter out of the change I gave you?—he said, no, he gave me a 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece; he had not given me a sixpence—I told him I was confident when I looked into the till I should find the other sixpence bad—I looked into the till, and I found a Victoria sixpence—there were five other sixpences there, all old ones—there was not one other Victoria sixpence in the till—I bent both the sixpences, one very much more than the other—after I had bent the second sixpence, I put it on the counter, and the prisoner took it up, and went with it into the tap room to speak to some one—I followed him in immediately, with the first sixpence in my hand, and said, "I demand that sixpence that I bent and gave you back"—the prisoner said, "This young man is looking at it"—(there was a young man by his side, who had a sixpence in his hand)——when I demanded the sixpence, he gave it me—it was the same sixpence that I had bent—I put both the sixpences into my husband's hand, and the prisoner was given into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Mr. James Woodgate, and live at the Freemasons' Arms, Sutton-street, King's Cross, St. Pancras. I employed the prisoners' father to paint the house, and the prisoner and he worked at the painting—on the 4th of December, I found two boxes and a chest of drawers broken open—the two boxes were in my bed-room, and the chest of drawers were in Mr. Woodgate's room—I lost from my boxes a quantity of linen, a pair of trowsers, a silver watch, a gold ring, three silk handkerchiefs, a silver pin—I cannot say when I had last noticed the boxes, or the property—they had been out of my sight for some days—I missed some silver spoons the same day from the drawers—there were 19 tea-spoons, 4 table-spoons, 2 pairs of sugar-tongs, 2 caddy-spoons, a shirt, and 5 books—part were in my drawers, and part in my boxes—some of the books were in the boxes—the silver was in the drawer in Woodgate's room—7 tea-spoons, 2 caddy-spoons, and 1 pair of sugar-tongs were mine—the other articles of plate were Woodgate's—I missed them about twelve o'clock, I think, in the day—I did not know who had taken them—the prisoner and his father had worked at the house from the latter end of October, up to the present time—the prisoner had access to both the rooms—on the 4th of December, I missed my property, and directly went to the police-sta<lb></lb>tion, to Fryer, the officer, and on the Saturday following I took the pri<lb></lb>soner—I did not see him after missing the property, until I took him—he had been at work within a day or two, but after I missed my property he did not come—his father came to my house on the Saturday, and I went to the father's house, and saw the prisoner there—I asked him if he knew any thing of the robbery of my house—he said he knew nothing at all about it—I told him that I had strong suspicions that he knew something concerning it—</p>

A gentleman, named Parker, gave information about it to the policeman—I wish to know why he is not at the bar—he was the chief receiver of the property—he sold the plate to a smelter in Wilderness-row—one lot for 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., another for 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and another for 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

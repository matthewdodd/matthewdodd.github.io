The prisoner and some other persons came to my house last Saturday evening, from a quarter to half-past eleven o'clock; they ordered half a pint of gin, some water, and a glass; they paid for what they had - and when they were gone, I missed the glass; they had been there ten minutes - I pursued and overtook the prisoner and another of the party; the prisoner had a basket, in which two glasses were found belonging to Mr. Wade; we went to his house, and I found on the mantelpiece this glass, which very much resembles mine - but I cannot swear to it.</p>

                  </hi>. I lost a watch on 18th January, on Tower-hill, about half-past 12 at noon—there was a crowd at the west end of Postern-row—I went across to see what it was—the crowd moved a little, and during that time my watch was taken—I looked round and saw the chain drop from the prisoner's hand—I accused him of having my watch—he said he had not got it, and asked me to search him—I saw that he had not got it; I sup<lb></lb>posed he had given it to a confederate—I went back and met the witness Nicholls—in consequence of what he said we went after the prisoner—he walked up Goodman's-yard, Minories; he got out of sight there and ran—we pursued him, and caught him at the Black Horse, in Limehouse-street, and I gave him into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I was on Tower-hill on 18th January—I was standing on the right side of Mr. Dick, and saw the prisoner on his left, a little way in front—he was pushing very close to the prosecutor—a minute or two afterwards the prosecutor turned round and accused him of stealing his watch, and at the same moment the prisoner turned round, and I am almost positive passed the watch, for I saw his hand go down to another man—I did not see the watch—there was a person close enough to him to take it—he then made an offer to be searched—Mr. Dick searched him, and of course he had not got it—I went after the man that I believed had it, but could not catch him—I afterwards went with Mr. Dick to the Black Horse.</p>

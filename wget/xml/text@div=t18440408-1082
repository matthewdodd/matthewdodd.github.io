                  </hi>. I live in Lisson-road, Lisson-grove, and am foreman of the street sweepers. On the 3rd of April I was sweeping in Edgware-road—a cart came past Cambridge-terrace loaded with dust going towards Paddington—the prisoner was following about ten yards be<lb></lb>hind the cart—there was nobody besides him with it—the cart was on its right side, but he was on the wrong side of the horse—he came up before the cart on the right hand side of the cart, bat the wrong side of the horse—he came on the off side with a whip in his hand—whether he hit the horse I cannot say, but the horse knocked a man down—I was on the footpath behind the horse on the same side as the man—the cart hid the prisoner from me, except that I saw him run and over<lb></lb>take the cart—at the time he came up, the horse turned round short, and knocked the man down—his name was John West—he worked for me, and was on the same side of the road close to the kennel—the cart wheel pasted over his loins—I heard the prisoner say, "Why did not the man get out of the way?"—he said he hallooed—I had not heard him halloo—the prisoner was very much intoxicated at the time—he went staggering up to his horse, and as he went to the station he wanted more beer—it was a quarter-past ten o'clock in the morning.</p>

I saw this happen—I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner go up on the off side of the horse—I was about twenty-five yards be<lb></lb>hind, on the near side with Brophy—he was nearer the cart than I was—I saw the prisoner go up on the off side, and hit the horse about three times with a whip—it directly ran to the near side, and the shaft or the horse knocked the man own—the wheel went over him—the prisoner stopped the cart, came behind, and said, "Did the wheel go over him? the said he had hallooed to him to get out of the way—the prisoner was very much in liquor, but not so drunk but what he could walk by the side of the horse till we found a policeman—any body could see he was drunk from his way of walk-ing—the cart would have cleared the deceased by two yards if the prisoner had not struck the horse—the deceased was working in the kennel.</p>

I am a sweeper—we were cleaning the Edgware-road, and had nearly finished, when the prisoner came up with one of Mr. Staple<lb></lb>ton's dust-carts—just as he got opposite the deceased, he went to the off-side of the horse and struck it, and the shaft struck the deceased, knocked him down, and the wheel went over him—I should say the horse and cart would have cleared the deceased if the prisoner had not struck it—the near wheel was two or three yards from the kennel, and the deceased was shovelling close to the kennel—there was nothing passing at the time.</p>

             depos'd That going up stairs, she saw the Prisoner sitting in a Chair, who told her she was very ill; to which she reply'd, That appear'd by her Countenance, for she look'd as if she was struck with Death: That she ask'd her for some Sack, she gave her some, and she fainted away; that then she endeavoured to recover her, and having done it, got her to Bed; and perceiving a great deal of Blood, she went down and acquainted her Mistress. Her Mistress depos'd That she suspecting her being with Child about a Month before, had tax'd the Prisoner with it, and the Prisoner said, She wondred she had such hard Thoughts of her; and that she had given her Warning about a Fortnight before her Delivery. That being inform'd by Katherine Reader of her being ill, she went up, and having examined her Linnen, and seeing nothing of a Child, thought there had been only a Miscarriage. That the next Day she sent for a Midwife, and upon her examining the Prisoner, and being of Opinion there had been a Child born, they charg'd it very home upon the Prisoner. Mrs. Sims the Midwife depos'd, That she being sent for the Night after, did examine the Prisoner, and finding there had been a Child born, urged her to tell where it was: That after having directed to 2 or 3 Places where it was not, the Prisoner turn'd aside the Pillow, and there was the Child, ty'd up pretty fast in a Cloth. That she own'd it was born alive, and said she did call for help so loud, that had it not been for the Rattling of the Coaches in the Street, and the Crying of Two Children in the Nursery, she must needs have been heard. The Midwife farther depos'd, She did believe the Child was at its full Time, and was born alive; that she did not perceive any Marks of Violence offered to it, but 2 Specks on the Forehead, which she believed happened by its falling from the Prisoner on the Ground. The Prisoner in her Defence deny'd that the Child was born alive, said she had made Provision for it, and that she was a married Woman. And to prove this she call'd several Persons. Her Mistress own'd that she hir'd her as a married Woman. A Master and Mistress with whom she had liv'd before deposed, That a Person had several Times came to demand her away as his Wife, and had been very troublesome; that she had owned she was his Wife, but that he was so great a Rogue to her she could not live with him, he having 2 or 3 other Wives. This last Evidence exempting her from the Statute on which the Indictment was founded, the Jury <rs id="t17230116-37-verdict200" type="verdictDescription">

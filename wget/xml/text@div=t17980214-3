               <p>Q. What was the whole amount of the things he had looked out? - A.Thirteen shillings; I told him we had not cash in the house, I would go out and get him change; I went to the next door neighbour's, and asked him if he could change it; he said, if I would give him two shillings he would give me two guineas; I gave him two shillings, and he was going to indorse it with my mother's name; he said, if it was a bad one he should look to us for the money, I told him to look sharp after it; the maid was coming up with a candle, he held it to the light, and said it was cemented, he would not change it; I took the note and went over to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that note? - A. This is it; I put my name at full length upon it at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take any constable with you from the watch-house? - A. I took Henry Bates to my mother's; the prisoner was standing at the door when I went past to go to the watch-house; I might have been absent ten minutes, I cannot positively say, Bates, and another man, ran over to my mother's before me, the prisoner was then in the shop mixed with other people, I did not see him at first, and I said, the man is gone; he said, no, here I am, where is the change; I then went behind the counter, and said, your note is a bad one, Sir; Bates, and the other man, said he must go with them, and they took him over to the watch-house, and searched him, I was there, but I did not see the whole of the search; I saw him take out a paper, I don't know what it was.</p>

               <p>Q. You were gone ten minutes? - A. I cannot say to a minute.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was your next neighbour's that you went to? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go no where else? - A. Yes; to the shoemaker's.</p>

               <p>Q. It might be quarter of an hour for what you know that you were absent? - A. It might.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had had change yourself you would have given it him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you occasion, in your way to the watch-house, to pass by your own house again? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner at the bar was standing at the door then? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long a time might elapse, from the time you saw him at the door, till you returned from the watch-house? - A.It might be about five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean that five minutes to compose a part of the ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There were several other persons in the shop when you returned? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I hardly need ask you if he had been so disposed, in the course of that quarter of an hour, he might have gone away? - A. He might so.</p>
               <p>Q.Though you suspected he was gone away, he was the person that gave you the information that he was not gone away? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go to the shoemaker's after? - A. Because the hatter told me to go there.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did he say for what purpose you were to go to the shoemaker's? - A. He said, to shew it him, and hear what he said about it.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you give the same note to James Lynden that you received from him? - A. Yes; I delivered it back to him in the watch-house, I saw him put his name upon it; when I went over I saw the prisoner standing at the shop-door; young Mr. Lynden went behind the counter, I took the prisoner to the watch-house and searched him, I found upon him another note for ten pounds, I marked it.</p>

            , Esq. sworn. - Examined by<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179802140010"></xptr>Mr. Fielding. Q.Is that the examination of the prisoner taken before you? - A. It is the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he asked by you how he came by these notes? -</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. I must beg first to ask a question or two, before Mr. Tolfrey answers my learned Friend's question. - Q.At what time was that examination taken? - A. On his first being apprehended, a very short examination was taken, and he was committed for further examination; the examination that is now produced, was taken the second time that he came up.</p>
               <p>Q.Recollect, as well as you can, the day of the month when this examination was taken, or the day of the week? - A. He was apprehended on the Saturday evening.</p>
               <p>Q. At the first examination, I believe he had his friends attending him, his Counsel and Solicitor? - A. No, he had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect any Solicitor and Counsel attending him? - A. I believe there were three examinations, and I think it was the third time, that this examination was taken, and then there was a Solicitor and Counsel.</p>
               <p>Q. At the former examination, he had not any friends on his part, to give him any advice at all? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know if his friends and Counsel had been there that day, and gone away, supposing that no examination would have taken place? - A. His attorney had been there that morning, but I do not know upon what account he went away.</p>
               <p>Q. That examination, I believe, took place in a private room? - A. Yes; it was desired by the Solicitor for the Bank that it might be kept private.</p>
               <p>Q. At either of these examinations, were you induced at all to hold out any favour to the prisoner at the bar? - A. No; not at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing held out to him to induce him to tell the story that he afterwards told in the examination, or which could lead him to do so? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Not previous to that time, nor at that time? - A.Neither.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the conduct of the prosecutor, which very often happens in circumstances in which the Bank are concerned, favourable to him upon either of those examinations? - A. I really do not understand you.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there, from the conduct of the prosecutor and yourself, humanely considering the case, any thing that could lead the prisoner to suppose that favour would be extended to him? - A. I certainly did hope, at first, that it would have been such, as would not have led to his commitment; that was the impression upon the mind of the Solicitor for the Bank.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not think, that from the liberality and humanity of the prosecutor and yourself, he might have collected that? - A. He might at the second examination.</p>
               <p>Q. And that in the presence of his Counsel and Attorney? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And notwithstanding that, there was another examination in private, at which, neither his Counsel nor Solicitor were present? - A. That was in consequence of a search.</p>
               <p>Q. In point of fact, the third examination did take place in the absence of those who had before attended to give him advice? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At which of the examinations was it that you advised the prisoner at the bar to speak the truth? - A. At both the examinations.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that conveyed to him in such sort of humane and friendly language as to induce him to speak the truth, if he was so inclined? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It was with an evident tendency to make him speak the truth? - A.Certainly; he was advised also by his own Counsel, in my presence, to speak the whole truth.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect any conversation that fell from Mr. Winter, Solicitor for the Bank, to induce him to give the account that he did give, in reference to the detection of other forgeries? - A. I do not recollect it.</p>
               <p>Q. Were other forgeries talked about? - A. No; I recollect, upon the second examination, Mr. Winter desired his Attorney and Counsel to go out and speak to him, and that if any other persons were concerned with him, they would mention it; they retired with him into another room; when they came back, they said, they had advised him to tell the whole truth, but that he had still told the very same story that he told when he was first apprehended.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp took an objection that the examination was inadmissable, in as much as the account given by him was induced by a hope of mercy held out on the part of the prosecution.</p>
               <p>The objection was over ruled by the Court.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. By the term humanity, do you mean mercy and forgiveness? - A.Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Rooke. You see he does not desire him to confess, but to tell the truth, which is a very different thing from telling a man it will be better for him to confess.</p>
               <p>Mr. Baron Thompson. The Magistrate cannot extort a confession from a prisoner.</p>
               <p>The Counsel for the prosecution declined offering the examination in evidence.</p>
               <p>- WINTER sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fielding. Q.You, I believe, went to the house where the young man lived? - A. Yes; in Grosvenor-street, Miss Davey's, I there found, in a drawer used by the prisoner, in a place called the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179802140011"></xptr>butler's pantry, a book, entitled, the Artists' Assistant in drawing Perspective, Etching, Engraving,&amp;c.; another book, containing a set of German Text Copies upon copper plate, a tea-cup, containing a composition, the ingredients of which I do not know; a bottle that appears to have contained gum-water; in a tea-cup, a small hair brush, and in a case, several other hair brushes, an instrument which appears to have been used for erasing; and after the examination at Marlborough-street office, I found some small bits of paper, upon which I make no comment. (Produces them).</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You found these things in the butler's pantry? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner at the bar was not there at the time? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know, of your own knowledge, that that was the prisoner's drawer? - A.Certainly not; it was so pointed out to me.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the particular time you found this? - A. I rather think the day of the last examination, the Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the prisoner apprehended? - A. The preceding Saturday.</p>
               <p>Q. So that from the Saturday to the Wednesday, any body so disposed, might have put these things into that drawer, or taken them away? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know, unfortunately at this time, it has more than once happened that Bank-notes have been picked up in the street, that have afterwards turned out to be forged? - A. There is a man now in custody, whose defence is of that sort.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know, without adverting to any person in custody, that Bank-notes have been picked up in the street, which have turned out to be forged.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What is that to us, it is only Mr. Winter's opinion at any rate.</p>
               <p>Mr. TERRY called again. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You have seen this note, look at it again, (the two pound-note), how does that appear to you to have been effected? - A. With ink prepared with water and gum.</p>
               <p>Q. Has it been stamped or engraved? - A. No; it has been done either with a pen or a brush, or both.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had an opportunity of trying that composition that was found in this cup? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it in your judgment done by that kind of composition? - A. I have endeavoured to analyse the contents of the cup, it is composed of several things; the imitation on the Bank-note consists of blue, which has been laid on first, and then Indian ink and common writing ink; the contents of the cup are blue Indian ink and writing ink.</p>
               <p>Q. In your judgment, upon your oath, has that alteration in the note been effected by the same materials as you found in that cup? - A. By the same kind of materials.</p>
               <p>Corss-examined by Mr. Barrow. What are you? - A. An engraver and printer to the Bank.</p>
               <p>Q. Has it ever been any part of your duty to study chemistry? - A. It has not been my duty, I have studied it a little.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of blue is this you have been speaking of? - A. There is a cake of Scott's blue.</p>
               <p>Mr. Winter. That is a cake of blue that I found in the same place, at the same time.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mr. Terry.) You have already sworn, that this imitation has been effected, first, by laying on a coat of blue, then the Indian-ink, and then the common ink? - A. I cannot say whether the Indian-ink, or the common ink is put on first.</p>
               <p>Q. At any rate, you think there must have been a foundation of blue? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How then came you to say, that the materials, by which this was effected, must have been of the same sort as this which now appears before the Court? - A. I did not say so; when I said the contents of the cup, I spoke of the blue which then laid in the cup, the mixture is only of India-ink, and common ink, the blue is in the cake, there may be a small quantity of blue, I cannot say, I am rather doubtful, whether there is any blue in it or not.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you have analysed it? - A. Yes; you may separate them now with a brush.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us, in general terms, what you mean by analyze? - A. I took a very fine clean hair pencil, upon very white smooth paper, and being able to distinguish the two articles, the writing and the India ink, and having got them separate, I took a little of each on the point of a brush, and made a wash, in that which I supposed was the Indian ink; I found a body, an opaque body, for Indian ink is made principally of a kind of soot, the common ink I found transparent of a light nature, capable of staining which India ink does not do, besides which, I perceived, belonging to each, the common ink has always a blue cast, on account of the logwood with which it is made; the India-ink has a body, being made of lamb-black, and oil of vitriol.</p>
               <p>Mr. Barrow. Q. I thought you said it was made of soot? - A. Is not lamb-black soot.</p>
               <p>Mr. Barrow. Q. I do not know? - A. I know it is, and nothing else; therefore I concluded the contents of the cup were common writing-ink, and Indian-ink united with a very strong gum.</p>
               <p>Q. Among chymists, the usual course is to separate the articles? - A. Yes; if you can separate them.</p>
               <p>Q. Indian-ink is a compound of itself? - A. It is a compound of soot, oil of vitriol and strong gum together, with water, common writing-ink is compounded of gall, logwood, and either vitrified cockle, or vitrified oil.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179802140012"></xptr>Q. And I believe gum? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any known process in chymistry, by which you can divide these compounds? - A. I do not understand you; I found them at the side of the cup ready separated, and at the bottom they were blended.</p>
               <p>Q. Such was the process you made, that you can say upon your oath, you separated each of them? - A.When Mr. Winter gave me the cup, there was at the bottom, a cake of blue water colour on the sides of the cup; I found what I still believe to be, in streaks, and separate from each other, two articles, the one writing-ink, and Indian-ink, but at the bottom these two articles were blended together.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q. Have you made any experiment upon any piece of paper? - A. Yes, (produces two papers;) this is the bottom of the cup mixed with common writing-ink, to see whether the colour agrees with what I apprehend it to be.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you ever amuse yourself in drawing or painting in water-colours? - A. Yes, sometimes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it any thing extraordinary, that those persons who do employ themselves in drawing, should have camel hair pencils, and compositions of this sort? - A. Yes; when people draw and paint much, they have those sort of things.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not essentially necessary? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>

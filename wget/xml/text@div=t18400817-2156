The prisoner was in my service as collector of orders and monies—he had authority to collect money for me, and should account to me the same night or next morning—Mr. Fisher is a customer of mine in the Soho round—in January this year he owed me money for coals—the prisoner did not account to me for having received any money from Mr. Fisher on the 16th January this year—that was the day on which I forgave him, in the morning, and he received this money about six hours after—I did not know at the time I agreed to take the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week from him that he had received any money from Mr. Bignell on my account—it was not included in the arrangement—it was not even in his collecting book—it was omitted altogether—he did not account to me for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. received from Mrs. Bignell in January—on the 27th of May he accounted to me for 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from Mr. Gobbett, instead of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., leaving a de<lb></lb>ficiency of 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

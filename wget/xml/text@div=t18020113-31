             sworn. - I was in the public-house when the prisoner was brought in, they searched him; I saw him drop something into the fire, I thought it was a pistol, and said, there is a pretty rogue, he has thrown a pistol into the fire, but it was a dark-lantern. (The constable produced the goods stolen, the dark-lantern and pen-knife.)</p>
               <p>Ridgway. Three pieces of cloth are marked D K, another D L, and three more are marked C K; they were removed from the place where they were in the shop to the bags on the floor; the cloth was in one bag and three pair of overalls, and four coats in another.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I have nothing to say, but as I was coming by, Ridgway said he had been robbed, and struck me immediately; I tried to get from him, for I saw nobody near; I was going promiscuously along, when he accused me of robbing him, threw me down and called out murder; what those people have sworn is false; before the Mayor, he said, there were three people in the shop, and that he took me as I was going along.</p>

I am a compositor, of 12, New-court, Farringdon-street, and work for Mr. Higgins, of Fleet-lane—on Wednesday, 2d December, the prisoner came there and asked for some work—he stopped some little time talking to the men at the machine—I watched him, and after Mr. Higgins had gone up to tea, he walked round the shop again, from one to the other talking, and as he passed some shelves on the left-hand side, where the type is kept in pigeon holes, he took up two packets and put them in his pockets—he spoke to Mr. Higgins's daughter while putting them in his pocket—he afterwards came and talked to me, and when he left I followed him, and asked him, in the street, if he had got something which did not belong to him—he said, "No"—I said, "Will you allow me to feel?"—he said, "Yes"—I felt his left pocket, and there was nothing; I felt his right pocket, and said, "You have got something there; you must come back"—he said, "Do not take any notice; come round the corner"—I took him back to the shop, where Mr. Higgins was, and took two packages of type out of his pocket, worth 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he was given in custody.</p>

I am a type founder, of Fleet-lane—the prisoner came to my shop, on the afternoon of 2d December, and asked for work—I declined to employ him—after I had gone up to tea, I was called down, and saw the prisoner at some distance from the house being brought back—Ford asked him to take the type out of his pocket—he did not do so, and Ford took it out—I should say that he was sober—this is my type—I gave him in custody.</p>

On the Saturday night previous to the 17th of August, I saw the prisoner on the Pavement, near Finsbury-square - he was a stranger; he asked me where I was going, and whether I would take a glass of anything to drink; I went with him, and had a glass of gin- he then went home with me, and there he gave me 1s. for drink; he asked me if he could stay all night; I said he might if he thought proper - he asked what he must give me; I said a sovereign - he said he could not afford so much, he would give me half a sovereign; he gave me a sovereign, and I gave him half a sovereign in exchange - I put the sovereign into my pocket; I slept with him that night - we got up about seven o'clock in the morning, and walked out; he breakfasted with me - I provided the breakfast; we dined together, and after dinner I went up stairs - he came up after me; I took off my pocket, with my sovereign in it, and put it under the pillow; my brother called on me, and I went down to him - he gave me two half-crowns and two shillings; I changed one of the shillings, went up stairs, and put the remaining silver into my pocket; I laid down, and went to sleep - when I awoke the prisoner was still there; I heard a voice below, and came down, leaving him up stairs washing his hands - he came down in about two minutes; he had agreed to stay with me, and to go out walking, but he came down, and went straight to the door; I asked where he was going - he said he should be back in a few minutes, by the time I was dressed; I ran up stairs, found my pillow turned over, and the money and pocket all gone; I had a penknife in my pocket, with a white handle and two blades, and a bit of gold on one side of the handle; I looked out of the window, and saw him just turning the corner - I called my brother, and told him I had been robbed; I saw the prisoner again on the Friday following - I caught hold of him, and told him he was the man who had robbed me, but if he would give me what he took from me, I would do nothing to him; he said he would see me d - d first - I had put the money by towards my rent, which I pay monthly.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did not he say he had taken no money, and he would return you none? A. He certainly said he had not robbed me, but he offered it afterwards; I told him I only wanted my money, and he refused to give me any - no persons had come into the house while we were up stairs; there was a man and his wife in the parlour - it is not an improper house; I only go out sometimes when work is short - he went out in the morning, and came back for his handkerchief, but not after he had robbed me; no property of mine was found - I cannot tell how many young men had been there in the course of that month; I will not swear there had not been ten that week - it certainly was nothing but shortness of work that induced me to go out. He did not say that he would go before any Magistrate; there was a gentleman I knew, whom I happened to stand talking to - I do not know whether he heard the conversation; I had left him - he might be a yard from me; I spoke to the prisoner directly - the gentleman was near the gutter, and we were up against a shop; I still kept talking to the prisoner, and the gentleman accompanied me down to the Mansion-house - I suppose he might hear me talking about it as we were going along; he is not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110113"></xptr>here - he knows my friends in the country, and is very respectable; my money was not in a purse - I paid for the breakfast and dinner.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What time at night did you meet him? A. About eleven o'clock; we got up in the morning about seven - he went away about four.</p>

            . I live at No. 7, Waterloo-street, St. Luke's; the prisoner has been my lodger for six weeks - I saw him on the Tuesday before he was taken into custody; he was cutting a piece of leather off his shoe with a small knife that had two blades, to the best of my knowledge, and as far as I could see, a white handle - it appeared to correspond with the description I have heard from the prosecutrix.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Could you swear to the knife? A. No, but when the officer came I told him what I had seen - I had seen a knife in his hand on another occasion which his wife was trying to get from him, and he said"That is a knife I received from a young woman, and you shall not have it."</p>

I am a painter and glazier, and live at No. 97, Whitecross-street; the prosecutrix is my sister - I went to her house in the City-road on Sunday, the 17th of August; I gave her two half-crowns and two shillings - between four and five o'clock, she came down stairs to speak to a young person who was there; the prisoner came down about five minutes after, and went to the door - my sister went up stairs and complained of being robbed; I went after him, but could not see him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you the least notion how your sister was getting her living? A. No, I had not; she has held herself out as living by her industry - she is between twenty-four and twenty-five years of age; and is married, but lives apart from her husband.</p>

I found myself sleepy, and laid down in the room on the floor, and went to sleep for twenty minutes, and on awaking missed my money. I mentioned it to all the company, and all denied it, and were all searched, but nothing found; the prisoner then said, he had lost his pocket-book, the constable went into the cellar with Mrs. Lambert, and found the pocket-book; he then told the prisoner to pull off his coat, which he did, and as the constable took it from him, he turned it over, and three shillings fell out of the sleeve, and 13 s. 6 d. was found concealed in the coat-facing; he then said Willis gave it to him - Willis denied it. I had told the constable before it was found, that it consisted of nine shillings and three half crowns, and that money was found. I believe two of the half-crowns were the last coinage.</p>

Willis and the prisoner both lodged at the King's Arms, public-house.</p>

I lent Lee a pillow to lay on, I awoke him to give him his breakfast, and he said he had lost three half-crowns and nine shillings, the prisoner immediately asked where the privy was and I told him. When he said he had lost his pocket-book, I said I knew he had it when he came in - it was found in the privy. I saw him searched the second time, the constable took his coat tail upwards, and out fell three shillings and in the facing the rest were found - he said Willis gave it him. Willis said,</p>

            . I am a constable. I was fetched, and searched all the party - I did not notice the prisoner's coat-facings. I found the prisoner's pocket-book close to the privy door. I came up and told him to pull his coat off, he rather hesitated. I turned it over and three shillings fell out, and between the facings I found six shillings and three half-crowns.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a long written defence, stating that Willis gave him the money, and forced it into his coat collar.</p>

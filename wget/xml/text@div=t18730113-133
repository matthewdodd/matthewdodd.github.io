                  </hi>. I am a brick-maker, and live in Brickfield Cottages, Hendon—Thomas Prince, the deceased, lived next door to me—the prisoner lodged in my house, and on 28th December, before 10 o'clock, he was there—I had requested him to leave my house for a reason, and I accompanied him to the door, and saw Prince come by with a mug with a litte beer in it which he had taken in for Christmas—Prince said "Go to work Holling shed"—he said "What has that to do with you?"—they had a little bit of a scuffle and a fight—the prisoner hit Prince, but I cannot say where, it was nothing of a blow—he struck at him—the beer was knocked out of his hand, and then they had the fight, and Prince hit Hollingshed very heavily several times—there was a struggle between them, and Prince caught hold of the prisoner and threw him very heavily—they fell twice, and the prisoner was underneath each time—as soon as they got up Prince went into his own house.</p>

                  </hi>, M.R.C.S. I live at Hendon—the deceased's brother called on me, and told me that he had retention of urine, and wanted something for him—I did not see the deceased, but my partner saw him next morning—I was present at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—he had suffered from severe <hi rend="italic">peri tonitis</hi>, caused by a rupture of the bowel on the right side, from which faecal</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187301130031"></xptr>
               <p>matter had exuded—in the case of such a rupture forty-eight hours generally passes before death—it might have occurred from a severe blow, or from the man falling on some prominent point, such as the knee of the other man, if the bowel was in a state of distension at the time—he was in other respects healthy—the <hi rend="italic">peritonitis</hi> was occasioned by the rupture of the bowel, it was set up as a consequence of the rupture—the faecal matter being exuded, would set up <hi rend="italic">peritonitis</hi>, and the man would die in about forty-eight hours.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">PRISONER</hi>. Do you think it possible that it could have been done at his work, digging and wheeling in a brick-field? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not unless he met with some accident at the time from over exertion, or a blow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. Then the rupture of the bowel would precede the <hi rend="italic">peritonitis</hi>? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; the injury would not make him suffer pain at the time, but it would cause sickness, and the brother complained that he was sick—I thought the injury was to the bladder; I ordered warm water, and he was better.</p>

                  </hi>, M. D. I attended the deceased on Sunday, the 29th—I found him in a state of partial collapse—I was present at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem—peritonitis</hi> was the cause of death, and that was caused by the extrusion of the contents of the bowels—that was quite recent, and must have been caused by some sudden blow—it could not have been the result of disease, as the viscera were healthy, and there was no indication of chronic disease—it might possibly be caused by a struggle, and falling on the ground.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. I suppose it must have been either by a blow, or a kick, or a fall. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, or the man's body must have been in a state of tension at the moment he fell on some prominent object—there is nothing to show that it was not done by a kick, and it is quite consistent—it is consistent with either—the probability is that it was not from a kick, because there was no external mark.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Could it have occurred from throwing a man down? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I do not think it possible—it could not have occurred in a mere struggle unless there was some projection—there must have been two factors; the man's body must have been in a state of tension, and there must have been some projecting object, such as the knee or some projecting stone on the floor; I do not think it could have been done by merely throwing—I understand that the prisoner was underneath and the deceased on the top, therefore it would be more likely for the knee to have done it—I think it quite possible that death might be produced in a struggle—whether the deceased was under or above would be quite immaterial; both those positions would be consistent with death being produced in the struggle.</p>

On Sunday the first of July I got up about 6 o'clock, and opened my backdoor. I heard a groaning . I had occasion to go into my own necessary house. The time I was there, I heard this groaning continually. Then I went near. I heard a person speaking to the prisoner who was in her necessary house. The prisoner said, I have been prodigious bad all night with the cholic and pain in my bowels. I don't take upon me to swear to the voice ; but I think it was the prisoner. I thought no more of it till a child was found on the Wednesday morning in this necessary house. Then there came

            , to my house, and desired I'd let them go into my back yard, to see if there was a child in that vault. I had flung a great heap of dirt to keep the filth from coming through. They dug that away. Then they saw a child, I did not go with them; they came and told me what they saw, and desired I'd lend them something to get it out. I lent them a garden how, with which they took it out, and brought it to my house. There was a bruise on one side of the head. It was a female child. It was reported about the town, the prisoner was with child before this.</p>

            . I live under the same roof the prisoner does, I was going to the pump this Sunday morning. I saw the prisoner sitting in the necessary house. She groaned, and said, it was a sad thing to have her bowels so bad. I said, so it is. She got off and went in a-doors. I went out about my business. When I came back again about 8 o'clock, I found the house very still. Some time after her mother came home. I asked her how her daughter did. She said, she was indifferent. After that, I observed the necessary house clean washed. On the Wednesday morning I got a candle and looked down the necessary house, and there I saw a young child lie, then I made it known</p>

            . I am a Surgeon, and live at this same town. Hearing a female child was found in a bog house, on Friday the 6th of July, I went to see the child. I did not observe any marks of violence on it. It was a fine full grown child. I opened the chest of it, and took out the right lobe of the lungs, and put it into Water. That induced me to believe the child was born alive ; for that swam. Had the child never breathed, the lungs would have sunk.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it possible a woman might be deliver'd of such a child as this, by a sudden surprize, while she is sitting on the necessary house?</p>
               <p>Stevens. It is very improbable.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it possible?</p>
               <p>Stevens. I think it is next to impossible.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a man-midwife ?</p>
               <p>Stevens. No, my lord, I am not.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never heard of things of this kind coming by surprize?</p>
               <p>Stevens. No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose a woman should be taken with violent pains, while sitting in that manner? whether or no a child may not come from her immediately?</p>
               <p>Stevens. It is very improbable.</p>
               <p>Q. Does not such sort of disorder occassion the person sometimes to want to go to stool?</p>
               <p>Stevens. I never heard of such a thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never hear of a woman going cross a room, and, upon some sudden surprize, bring forth a child directly?</p>
               <p>Stevens. I never knew an instance of it.</p>

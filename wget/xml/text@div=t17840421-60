               <p>I was the patrol belonging to Aldgate within, and as I was going down Bevis Marks, on Saturday the 16th of April, I heard the cry of thieves! thieves! murder! murder! and at the corner of Castle-street,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178403270104"></xptr> I saw two men, which are the prisoners; they never was out of my sight, I saw them stand at the corner of Castle-street, all in a timidating affair.</p>
               <p>Court. How? - As if they had been doing something amiss.</p>

               <p>Describe what you mean? - Seeing me come up, they stood in a sort of posture of defence, Hawes made a blow at me with his cutlass, without my speaking a word; I had a bludgeon which I carry, says I, are you good at that, then I made a blow at him with my blugeon, as hard as ever I could, then he and I missed him; I found myself in danger, and let my bludgeon fall, and drew my cutlass and attacked him again; when they found I was so resolute they ran away; I immediately cried out, stop thief! as loud as I could, and followed them very closely; Hawes the prisoner struck at me with a cutlass, I ran after them about three parts of Castle-street, but the short one, Hawkins, fired a pistol, not at me, it was directed forwards: Hawes was my object, because he made a blow at me, and just as he had got to the kennel, a gentleman tripped him as he run, and he fell down; another man assisted me and stood over him; I was afraid he had some fire-arms, he said he had not, he said for God's sake spare my life I did not fire the pistol; the other I never saw afterwards; I took Hawes, he never was out of my sight five yards, the other got off at that time.</p>
               <p>Do you know that the other prisoner was the man that was with Hawes? - I did not see him till he was brought to the Compter, I cannot swear to him: when Hawes was taken, he was searched, and nothing was found upon him; when I returned again from the Compter, I came back to go my rounds as usual, I saw Mr. West as I came to the spot where I attacked them first, and I said, Sir, you was not one that was robbed? and he said, yes, it was me that was robbed; when I came to the watch-house, I told the story to the constable and several others, and they directed the watchman to look for a pistol and a watch chain, that that gentleman had been robbed of, and he found the chain, as he told me, close to the place where they attacked me; they first attacked me the corner of Castle-street, in Bevis-marks; Kelton gave me the chain, I have had it in my possession ever since; this cutlass was found in Castle-street, when we came from the Compter.</p>

                  </hi>. I am secretary to the Office of Works—the Right Hon. Gerard James Noel is the First Commissioner of Works—in the ordinary course I constantly open the letters that come addressed to him—he has been First Commissioner nearly two years—he succeeded Lord Henry Lennox—I produce a letter dated 12th May, 1877, signed "George Edward Pearson;" it is addressed to the Right Hon. G. J. Noel <hi rend="smallCaps">M. P. HENRY MASON</hi>. I am secretary to Sir John Kelk—I am very well acquainted with the prisoner's handwriting—this letter is his writing.

(<hi rend="italic">Mr. Mason proved this and the subsequent letters to be in the prisoner's writing</hi>.) This letter renewed the application for employment, and concluded "Should you not appoint me to a surveyor's or clerk of the work's place, I shall split on Sir Henry Hunt and others as to the Foreign Office contracts and other jobs. The Foreign Office was Mr. Kelk's job, and Mr. Hunt, the surveyor, was bribed, I can prove it." I also produce this letter of 8th April, with the envelope, addressed to myself; it has the Bury St. Edmund's post-mark—I received it and opened it. (<hi rend="italic">The enclosure, a letter to Sir Henry Hunt, referred to the writer's disappointment in not having been engaged by the Office of Works, and contained the following words</hi>:—"I con<lb></lb>sider that I have not been fairly treated by Sir Henry Hunt in this matter, and as I hold the secrets as to the Foreign Office contracts and other matters implicating Sir Henry Hunt and others, if I am not appointed to an assistant surveyor's place, or as a clerk of works, I shall split, as it is no interest to me to hold my tongue and to be humbugged by Sir Henry as well.") I produce a letter of 12th April, which came to the Office of Works. (<hi rend="italic">This was addressed to Sir Henry Hunt, and contained a similar threat to split if he was not appointed to some post, such as clerk of the works at Kensington Palace</hi>.) I produce a letter of 13th April; the envelope is addressed to Lord John Manners at the House of Common!—it was forwarded by his Lordship's private secretary to the Office of Works, and opened by me—inside it is addressed to the Right Hon.

M. Office of Works, the former with tendering a bribe of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the latter with accepting the said bribe of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on the occasion of the delivery of the builders' tenders for Gilbert Scott's Gothic plans for the proposed Foreign Offices, with intent to conspiracy.") I produce a letter of April 26th, and envelope, addressed to Mr. Noel. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Right Hon. Sir,—I have received a summons to attend at Bow Street police-court on Tuesday next as to an alleged libel on Sir Henry Hunt. I certainly fail to see any libel. I shall subpoena witnesses who can prove I am correct. There were, I think, only seven builders ten<lb></lb>dered for the original Gothic design of Mr. Gilbert Scott, and I saw Mr. Joseph Taylor, Mr. John Kelk's foreman, give a cheque for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Mr. Henry Hunt in Hunt's office in Parliament Street. I was present at the conversation about it in my private office at Mr. Kelk's, at South Street, between Mr. John Kelk and Mr. Joseph Taylor. I saw Mr. George Kelk, the cashier, hand Mr. Taylor the cheque. Mr. Taylor was sent by Mr. Kelk to Mr. Hunt's office with it and the tender, and I saw Mr. Taylor give it to Mr. Hunt, and I had a glass of sherry with them in Mr. Hunt's office. Mr. Kelk, Mr. Taylor, and myself made out Mr. Kelk's estimate. I shall stand my ground; at the same time my letters are private to the Office of Works among yourselves.")</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner</hi>. It was not in Mr. Hunt's power to get candidates Government appointments, not directly—some of these letters are marked private—it is legal to hold a Government appointment and do private business as well—there is nothing illegal in applying for a Government appointment—as regards the Civil Service competition we should know nothing whatever of anybody but the one successful candi<lb></lb>date.</p>

I am a practical office man—I do not know anything of the practical part of the business—I speak of your abilities from what I saw of you when with Mr. Kelk—you only assisted with the estimates very terrifyingly—Mr. Taylor made the estimates—I never knew of your doing so—you moneyed them out, anybody could do that—you might sometimes make, the plans—I don't consider that you assisted generally in the business—you were there to attend to visitors, to introduce them to Mr. Kelk or whoever they may have come to see—I have seen you make a plan or two, but nothing to speak of.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been a surveyor for nearly 50 years—in 1856 I was engaged as consulting surveyor to the Government—I was entitled to attend to my own private practice as well—I had to attend at the office about once a week to give my opinion upon any matters in which the First Commissioner or other Government officials required assistance—I have seen the prisoner once only, that was in 1866—he was then applying for an appointment in the public service—he was not</p>

               <p>employed—there is not one word of truth in the letters that have been read so far as the imputations upon me are concerned—I was never bribed directly or indirectly by Sir John Kelk or by anybody else with reference to the Foreign Office contracts, or any other public matters—Sir Gilbert Scott prepared designs for the Foreign Office contracts, and Mr. Kelk's firm tendered in 1859—Mr. Kelk's tender was the lowest, but I do not think it was accepted—the plan was never carried out, Lord Palmerston would not have it—fresh plans were prepared, because the Gothic design was not approved of—the concrete foundations were put in by Mr. Kelk by the recommendation of Sir Gilbert Scott, who was the architect—he recommended that course should be adopted, and the First Commissioner by my advice consented to have it done—it was done at a price that was satisfactory to Sir Gilbert Scott—the new designs were tendered for, and Messrs. Smith and Taylor, who succeeded Mr. Kelk, were the lowest tenderers—that was in August, 1863, and they carried out the work—as far as I was concerned, everything that was done with respect to the Foreign Office was done in the ordinary course of business—I have known Sir John Kelk for a great many years, and have been engaged by him as a surveyor very largely—in 1858 I was engaged to buy the land and to build the large station and make the great works at the Victoria Station, Pimlico; that was a work that required the outlay of some hundreds of thousands of pounds—I was engaged by him to buy the land, value it, and assist in that matter, and I was paid in the ordi<lb></lb>nary way by him for those services—if anybody desires to inquire into it I can give the particulars.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner</hi>. Smith and Taylor's contract for the Foreign Office was by a lump-sum contract, by tender—10 or 12 builders were invited to tender, Smith and Taylor amongst them—Mr. Kelk ten<lb></lb>dered for Sir Gilbert Scott's Gothic design—I believe Mr. Taylor was I Mr. Kelk's foreman—he did not deliver Mr. Kelk's tender to me—the I tenders to the Office of Works are sent in before a certain hour in the I day, and they are deposited in a box by the messenger, which is locked, and after the time has expired they are taken out of the box and delivered to the secretary—they were opened by him in my presence—I don't know who delivered Mr. Kelk's tender—Mr. Taylor did not on the occasion of delivering it give me a cheque for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in my office in Parliament Street in your presence, saying, "Here is a little piece of plum pudding for you"—I did not say"500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," nor did Taylor say "Yes, he might as well have made it 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. while he was about it"—I never saw you in my office, and I do not think Mr. Taylor was ever in my office—I did not say to Taylor "2,000 would not be much in a job of this magnitude"—I did not open the tenders—Mr. Austin did not complain to me about the tenders being opened by somebody—Lord John Manners did not open them—Mr. Austin did, I saw him open them—they had not been pre<lb></lb>viously opened by me—I hold a public appointment to the Office of Works, and do private business as well—I am not a lawyer, but if such a thing is illegal I have been 22 years breaking the law—I do not know what the regulations are with reference to others; all I know is that I hold my office with the understanding that I should carry on private business—I am paid a settled salary of 1, 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, which appeared in the esti<lb></lb>mates and is voted every session—since my appointment I have not been paid for any works—Mr. Kelk never gave me a 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque himself—</p>

I keep the King's Arms, Regent's Park—on 26th January, about 11. 40 p. m., the prisoner asked my barman for half a quartern of the best rum, which came to threepence—I was standing close by—she threw down a half-crown to make it ring—the barman picked it up and handed it to me—I examined it, and the prisoner said, "Do you mean to say that that is bad?"—I said "I have not spoken"—she then. threw down threepence, and said "If the half-crown is bad you can break it up, and I will take it away"—I went round to prevent her going out, and sent for a constable—I told her I had been watching all day for some. one passing bad money, as I had taken one that day and one the day before—before the prisoner was removed Mrs. Williams came into my shop, she lives three doors from me.</p>

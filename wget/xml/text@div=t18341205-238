                  </hi>. In November I was in the service of Mr. Lovell, of Pentonville—the prisoner Smith was servant there for five weeks—I was down in the kitchen on a Sunday morning about three weeks ago—I came up into the parlour, and saw Smith there—she told me she had got half a dozen of her master's wine-glasses—I told her she would get found out—she said no, she should not—the wine-glasses had been kept in the parlour</p>

I know Smith by seeing her come to and fro from Mr. Lovell to Wilkins, during the time I lodged there; and last Monday week Wilkins brought home half a dozen of wine-glasses, which she brought wrapped up in a piece of brown cloth—she had asked me to go to Mrs. Lovell's to bring home six wine-glasses, as she was going to get some coals, and she thought she should break them; but I would not go—she went, and returned in about ten minutes—she said she had been to Mr. Lovell's, and some person gave her them over the area rails.</p>

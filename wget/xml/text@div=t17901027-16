               <p>I am a constable. On Wednesday, the 13th of October, about half past one, the two prisoners were coming through Checquer-yard, Dowgate-hill; I watched them; and at the corner of Elbow-lane, I missed sight of them in an instant, and did not see them till about ten minutes after two; they came back again; they were conversing together; they went by my door, and went to Hand-court; they stopped there, and I took hold of the biggest, Patrick, and asked him what he had got there; he gave me a blow across the nose; he asked what it was to me? he dropped the handkerchief out of his hand, and one of the goblets fell; he got away from me, and proceeded into Checquer-yard; he fell down there; I never lost sight of him; he ran into Thames-street, and I cried stop thief! he fell down, and I took him in Thames-street; when I laid hold of Patrick, the other ran away; and I missed him and the handkerchief, and the other goblet; I kept the goblet that I picked up myself; the other goblet was brought to me by a gentleman; he is not here; I was in Hand-court, and had Patrick in my custody at the time; I have kept the goblets ever since: (produces them): they were advertised; and I found out Mr. Armiger, and carried them to him; he knew them to be his.</p>

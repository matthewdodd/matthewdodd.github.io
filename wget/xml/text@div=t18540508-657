                  </hi>. I reside at Thompson's Cottage, Poplar; I am a mast and blockmaker, in the present service of Messrs. Dunbar. I had been previously in the service of Mr. Mayer, the shipbuilder—I know the de<lb></lb>fendant, he was in Mr. Mayer's employ as chief draughtsman, and is so now as far as I can tell—about four months ago I lent him a book of prices worked for by the majority of the trade—I had only applied to him for it once before to my knowledge, that was four or five days before 11th April; his answer was, "Send your foreman and you shall have your book, and I feel very much obliged to you for the loan of it," referring to my late fore<lb></lb>man—on 11th April, hearing that the defendant was on board the <hi rend="italic">Adding<lb></lb>ton</hi>, which was lying in the East India Docks, I went to the vessel and ascended the ladder reaching from the quay or wharf of the dock to the vessel, and when I had got my head sufficiently over the deck I could not see Mr. Waterman; and while I was hesitating whether I should go on board to see if he was down in the hold, or whether I should go ashore again, Mr. Waterman lifted his head up, he having had occasion to point out some work to a man named Miller, and was hid from my sight—when I saw him, I descended the short ladder from the bulwark to the deck, and waited till he was disengaged, when he came to me—he spoke to me first, and in the most pointed manner said, "What do you do here?"—I said, "I want my book, if you please"—his answer to that was, "Go on shore, go on shore," in the most peremptory manner—I did not offer to go on shore, and he called to his assistant, a person named Miller, who I before men<lb></lb>tioned—he said, "Miller, put this man on shore;" Miller said, to the best of my belief, "The main is quite capable of walking on shore himself"—the defendant then twice ordered him to go and fetch a policeman, and he left the vessel—while this conversation was taking place, the defendant was standing on an elevated position, two feet high; on a piece of timber, per<lb></lb>haps not more than six feet from where I was standing, perhaps not quite so far as you are from me—when Miller had left, the defendant began to apply very abusive epithets to me; I can really assure the Court that I am not able to give the exact language—he called me a b—r, and damn his eyes, if he would not do something to me, and all that sort of disgusting language; I had a pretty good share of it—my answer to that was, "It seems to be your object, Sir, to frighten people, but you will not intimidate me"—with that he became more excited, and made a spring at me from the piece of timber he was standing on, and aimed a blow at some part of my face, with his clenched fist, I believe; but I partly warded it off—his fist touched me by the mouth sufficient to draw blood, and that was all—he then sprang back and seized at a caulker's mallet, which is a piece of lignum vitae about twelve inches in length, and two inches or two inches and a half in diameter, with two thick iron ferules at each end of the head—it was in a man's hand; the man held it very tightly, and he was unable to obtain it, and sprang to another which was rove through the ring of the caulking box, and not being able to extricate it, he seized this adze (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which was lying alongside on the deck—I believe he made a blow at the lower part of my person; I cannot speak to that positively, but I know he had it in this form (<hi rend="italic">holding it at arms length over his head</hi>)—he then made a second blow in this manner (<hi rend="italic">describing it</hi>)—I believe he aimed at my head, but while he was holding it up, I sprang forward to seize some part of the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185405080095"></xptr>
               <p>handle, or his person; I cannot say what part, but just as the adze was in the act of coming down, he was seized violently by the waist by the wit<lb></lb>ness Coombe, who drew him violently back, and from my seizing the handle it swung round like that, and struck me below the knee—the result was that it drew blood, and laid me by from my employment spine two or three days—when he had done that he swooned away on Coombe's knee—he appeared in a state of very great excitement and passion—I had not said or done the least thing to provoke him in any way—I have not said all that passed, but all that I should like to be on my oath of—I went ashore and so did the defendant, a few minutes afterwards—when he came ashore he looked at me, and, to the best of my belief, made use of some of his former bad language—there was a stage round the vessel where some of the riveters were at work, and there being a similar hammer to this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), the handle of which was lying over the stage in this form, he made a spring at it, but being unsuccessful he did so again, and when he had got it he held it over his head, and said, "Now, you b—r," and he said he would beat my b—y brains out—I believe the hammer was coming down, and I should have got it on my head if I had not sprung back—two officers came up, and he said to one of them who was remonstrating with him on the im<lb></lb>propriety of using such weapons, "If you do not stand back I. will serve you in the same way;" and he said to me, "If I had a loaded pistol, I should think no more of shooting your b—y brains out than that," heaving the gravel up with his feet.</p>

MONTAGUE CHAMBERS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe at this time you were not in Mr. Mayer's employ? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was not, I had left it two or three weeks previously—Mr. Waterman is Mr. Mayer's draughtsman and architect of the ships—his office is from 100 to 200 yards from where the <hi rend="italic">Addington</hi> was lying—when I previously asked him for the book it was at his office; I left it there with him, but I believe he gave it into the custody of his foreman, Mr. Greenyard, who acted on the works in the building, about the same distance off as was the <hi rend="italic">Addington</hi>, only in another direction, not in the East India Docks, but in Mr. Mayer's ship-yard.</p>

               <p>was injured; I felt my leg stiff—I am a mast and block maker, a working man—I am moderately strong—I work with an instrument like this—before it was held up in this way there was a blow struck, I believe, at the lower part of my person—I believe I have mentioned before to-day that that was my belief; it is all a matter of belief—I have been between three and four years in Mr. Mayer's employ—it was Mr. Waterman's duty to superintend the repairs in the building of the vessel—I am told that there are something like 3,000 or 4,000 men on Mr. Mayer's premises altogether; they are liable to fluctuation—we all go to be paid on Saturday night, but the premises are so contrived that you can scarcely see a twelfth of the men at one time—they do not all come to be paid at one office—Mr. Waterman is not the general superintendent of the whole, only of that part relating to the ship building—the men begin work at 6 o'clock in the morning—the day's work is over at 6 o'clock at night, but sometimes we work over hours.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a caulker, in the service of Mr. Tindal, and live at Poplar. I was at work on the <hi rend="italic">Addington</hi>, on 11th April, in Mr. Mayer's employment—we are situated so that we work for anybody now and then—I recollect Mr. Winn coming on board the <hi rend="italic">Addington</hi> on 11th April, and asking Mr. Waterman for a book—Mr. Waterman said, "Go ashore"—Mr. Winn said, "If you will give me my book I will go ashore"—after that Mr. Waterman was standing on an elevated bit of wood, above Mr. Winn, and he jumped down, and said, "If it was not for making a blackguard of myself I would knock your b—y brains out"—after that Mr. Winn said, "Give me my book, I will go ashore again"—Mr. Waterman said to Mr. Miller, "Go for a policeman, and take this man ashore;" and Mr. Miller went away directly, over the side, and after that the defendant turned to my mate, who was working on one side, and made a snatch to get his mallet out of his hand, but he held it tight, and he then turned to get my mallet—I kept it away from him—he then took up an adze, which was lying on the gunwale of the boat, and swung it this way (<hi rend="italic">over his head</hi>), and then he had it in the act of coming down on Winn's head, who was in front of him, and the words he made use of were, "I will cut the b—r down"—I <hi rend="italic">catched</hi> him by the arm, put my left arm round his waist, and by the jerk of my arm the adze fell on Mr. Winn's knee—I laid the prisoner on my knee, and he shed tears a bit, and then went off into a fainting state—(the axe went round, and fell just below his knee)—he remained in that state two or three minutes—when he came to, I said, "What a pity it is, Sir, that you let your temper overtake you in this manner; some of these days you will do some<lb></lb>body an injury, and you will be hung for it"—he said, "Let me go," and of course I let him go, and he looked over the side, and saw Mr. Winn standing there—he got up, ran down the ladder, swearing and blaspheming most awfully—there is a stage there, where the riveters were riveting the side of the ship; a hammer laid on the stage, and he made a <hi rend="italic">grab</hi> at it, and said, "I will knock the b—r's brains out;" but the officer stopped him, and I believe he dropped the hammer—after the dock officer had got hold of him he said, "I wish I had a pistol, I would think no more of blowing your b—y brains out than I would of that," and he kicked the dust in front of him.</p>

The prosecutor left a mes<lb></lb>sage at my house, and I went next day and examined his leg—the skin was abraded at one part, and there was an effusion of blood under the skin at another; it appeared to me that there had been a slight effusion of blood—he remained in, two or three days in consequence, but I had no occasion to attend him—there was no serious injury done.</p>

               <p>two expressions, the cuticle and the cutis; this was an ordinary abrasion of the cuticle—if the cuticle is abraded the true skin is exposed—the cuticle is the scarf skin; the next skin to that is the true skin, the <hi rend="italic">cutis</hi>—all there was, was an abrasion of the cuticle so as to expose the true skin to view—next to the cutis is the flesh, the cellular tissue; in fact the true skin consists of cellular fibres—I know what the cellular membrane is—there is cellular tissue under the cutis—there may or may not be cellular tissue under the cutis; cellular tissue pervades almost every part of the body—cellular membrane is not an expression we commonly make use of; I know what cellular mem<lb></lb>brane is, it is a thin tissue—I did not see what you call the cellular mem<lb></lb>brane, not if you mean that structure which lies beneath the true skin—there was an abrasion of the cuticle only; there was no damage to the cutis, it was simply exposed.</p>

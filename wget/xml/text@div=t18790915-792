Martin sold them to me"—I said, "Have you any bill or entry in your books relating to that transac<lb></lb>tion?"—he said, "No. I never made entries, because they were ready<lb></lb>money transactions," and then Mr. Warden said, "Have you any entry of a sale to Wheeler's at 10 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>?"—he said, "Yes"—on the way to the station he said, "I had a note from Martin this morning, telling me to keep away from Castle Street"—I said, "Yes, and you also sent Martin a note"—he said, "Yes, I sent him a note, telling him I wished to see him in reference to some money"—at the station I shewed him the 50 gross, and Martin said, "Yes, they were the goods you had"—Watford said, "Yes, for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a gross"—Martin said, "No, I was compelled to have what you would give for them."</p>

               <p>beginning of this year—about 6th July last, I received a letter from the prisoner, with respect to a robbery that had taken place—he is a jeweller in 322, Oxford-street—in consequence of that letter, I went with some other creditors to Oxford-street—I there saw the prisoner—he was lying on the sofa in the front sitting-room; they make it a sort of general room I think—he looked very ill, as though he would not live many hours—he was asked a variety of questions—we could not get any direct answer from him—then the books were produced—he was asked about them, and on my examining the books, I formed an idea that they were books <hi rend="italic">made up</hi>—there was another creditor there—we were looking at the window, and at these books for little things, and the prisoner flew off the sofa and wanted to know whether we suspected him of anything dishonest with regard to the books—I saw that it was likely to be a very noisy meeting, and it was suggested by one that the books should be taken home to my place and exa<lb></lb>mined by my clerks, to see exactly how his case stood, because we could get no direct answer out of him relative to his affairs—he did not seem to know what he owed—the books were not taken away; he would not hear of it at all—he was well enough at that part of the time—he agreed to the books being sealed up, and then to attend a meeting, if it would be possible, at my counting-house on the following day—the books were sealed up—this sale<lb></lb>book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is one of the books, and there was a red book as well—there were three books I think—the creditors came to my counting-house for this meeting—I will not be positive whether it was the following day or the day after that—the prisoner did not come—he sent me a letter half-an-hour before the meeting, to say he had consulted his solicitor, and I should hear from him in the course of a few days to attend a meeting at his solicitor's—a meeting of the creditors was called at the office of Lewis and Lewis in Ely-place—I attended there, and Zucher the bankrupt attended—10<hi rend="italic"> s.</hi> in the pound was offered at that meeting by the bankrupt, and that was refused by the creditors, unanimously I think—there was a sheet of the sales made out by an accountant employed by the bankrupt I think—it was not satisfactory, and the creditors insisted upon Zucher signing a declaration of insolvency, which he did.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you mean to say positively it is? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I can, by comparing it with the impression that I took with the dandy roller—I sup<lb></lb>plied the dandy roller to Messrs. Greer—they had not had a dandy roller before from me, with that mark on—this is an impression I myself took from the dandy roller in question, previous to sending it away (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—this is not a very convenient place to compare the two—there were six sheets on the dandy roller, and this impression was taken only from one sheet—I have not any doubt that these impressions were taken from our dandy roller—here are already six different impressions from the dandy roller—I wish to identify the one sheet with the impression that I took from the roller—I have no hesitation in saying that the impression in that sheet (<hi rend="italic">pointing it out</hi>) must have been made from that impression, from that very roller; not only from that very roller, but also from that very sheet on the roll.</p>

               <p>March, 1857—we received the first portion of paper so ordered on 10th July, 1857—on 31st August, a person came to order some ruled paper, with double money columns and head line—I got it done—it was machine-made paper, and with that watermark—I saw the person twice—I think the prisoner is the person, to the best of my recollection—six quires were bought—we have counted the paper in this book, and there is just six quires—it is ruled according to the pattern which the man ordered—we keep paper in single money columns, but not double—these six quires were ruled especially with a head line, according to the direction of the person that ordered it—the cover to this book is an old cover; the lining is not the same as the book, as it is in all books we have ever bound, and I have been in the trade thirty-five years; and there is no heading, which leads me to think that it was a new book, put into an old cover; and upon examining it, I found the old marble paper underneath.</p>

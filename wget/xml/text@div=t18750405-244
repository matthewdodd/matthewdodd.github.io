               <p>shilling—I bent it and gave it back to him and told him it was bad; he made no answer, but put his hand in his pocket, pulled out a handfull of money, and gave me a good one—the bad one grated in my teeth and I bent it—the second one on 10th March bent easily—it had not been bent before.</p>

                  </hi>. I was ten years old last February—the pri<lb></lb>soner is my father—we live at 1, Carlton Terrace, Kilburn—I go to school in the day and leave about 4.30, I then do my lessons for the next day and go to bed about 9 o'clock—I sleep in the same room as my father and mother—during the week before my father went away in custody he was at home every night except Friday—I do not know at what time he came home on Friday—he was taken on a Wednesday.</p>

My mother has one other child, a baby—we live and sleep in the back room first floor—there are three persons in the house—I cannot tell you how many days my father was away the week before the one I have spoken of, or the week before that—I only recollect about this one week—I have not been talking to anyone about my evidence—a person who lives in the house took me to Bow Street because I did not know the way, because my mother could not bring me—I talked about it to my mother.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I never was out after 9 o'clock any day that week except Friday; on Monday night I took home some tripe which I bought, at 7.50; I went to bed; on Tuesday I went home early; on Wednesday I re<lb></lb>turned home at 8.30, and we had some beefsteak pudding, on Thursday and Friday I did the same.

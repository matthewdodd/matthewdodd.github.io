On Saturday night, the 8th of March, I left my house at twenty minutes after eight o'clock, leaving nobody in it—I left it all fastened up—I returned at ten minutes to nine—I found my front gate unbolted, which I had left bolted—all the doors and wint as✗ were fast as I had left them, but when I got in I found a lucifer on ✗ mat—I know nobody could have been in the house when I went out—it is a cottage all on one floor—there are hangings to my bed, but a person could not be concealed there—I went to light my candle, and found it was gone out of the candlestick—I went into my kitchen and found a mahogany caddy laid there broken open—it had been taken from under my bed in my bed-room—my box was open, and four gowns, two shawls, a cloak, an apron, a pair of shoes, and a pair of boots taken out—they had dropped one boot by the bedside—I saw all my property again, except the candle, the same night at the station—it is worth 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

I live at Walworth, a quarter of a mile from Mr. Harris—on Saturday night, the 8th of March, from a quarter to half-past eight, I saw both the prisoners together, nearly opposite Harris's house—Power went up against the door and came away from it again—I stopped for ten minutes watching them, and they came by me, just before I got to them, Power said to Abbott, "It is no use stopping here any longest is too late now, they won't come yet awhile"—I went into the Rose pub<lb></lb>lic-house, and spoke to a young man, then came out, and went up George-street to see for a policeman—I saw the prisoners standing under the win<lb></lb>dow of the Rose—I could not find a policeman—I came back, went into the Rose, and they were over by a shop window—they came acoss again, and stood under the Rose window—I met Davis, a policeman, and told him what I had seen.</p>

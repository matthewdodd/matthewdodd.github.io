                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Wm, Walker, Lavender Dock, Rotherhitbe—on 6th November, between 8 and half-past in the morning, I saw the prisoner go into the dock, and take four sheets of metal—another man was with him, who was caught, and got six months—I saw King give two sheets to the other man—I was about ten yards from them—the sheets of metal were on the stage in the dock—I called out to the men to put them down—they said they wouldn't, and that they would hit me on the nose—the prisoner said that—I couldn't stop him, and he got away—I have seen him about before—I knew his name, and am sure he is the man.</p>

I am under waiter at Mouflet's Hotel, Newgate Street—on 8th June, about 11.30 p.m., I was called to turn the prisoner out—a man named Wallace assisted me—I got the prisoner to the door, but could not get him any further, he came back three times—he was drunk—I eventually got him out, with Wallace's assistance—he then turned round, took Wallace by the hips, put his head down, threw Wallace over his head, and ran away—I ran after him, and caught him, and he was given in custody—Wallace's head was cut open, and he was smothered in blood, he was lying on the ground insensible.</p>

                  </hi> I am a brass finisher, of 23, Henry-street, Hampstead-road—on Saturday evening, 29th October, between 7 and 8 o'clock, I met the prisoner at the corner of Milk-street, Cheapside—she touched me on the shoulder, turned me round, and asked where I was going to—I said home—she said, "Can't you take me home with you"—I said no I could not—she was talking to me a little while and then said, "Will you treat me to a glass of ale before you go,"—I said I did not mind, and I treated her to a glass at a public-house close by—she came out with me to the corner, asking me a few questions—I said I could not stop any longer—I turned round to make ray way home, and felt my watch go out of my pocket—it was perfectly safe when I was in the public-house, attached to a guard—the prisoner directly ran away; two men came up and asked me some address, trying to stop me from running after her—I ran between them and went after her—I fell down, got up again and pursued and caught her—I called her a b——, and with that she gave me my watch—she then blackguarded me and called me everything, and ran away again—I ran after her again and gave her into custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were you sober? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Perfectly—I had been down to Whitechapel on business, and left there about 6—I treated the prisoner because she asked me—the first time I saw the men was after coming out of the public-house—at the time the watch was being taken, I had not been taking any liberties with the prisoner—she did not say, "Here is a policeman coming," and then go away—I saw the watch in her hand—she returned it to me before the policeman came up—I had not taken it out of my pocket.</p>

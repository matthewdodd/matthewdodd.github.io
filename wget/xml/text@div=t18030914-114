             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Alley. I am a widow, and live in Paul's-alley, Aldersgate-street; I know all the three defendants: On Monday the 31st of January, Mrs. Edwards came to my house for eight shillings to release Edwards out of prison from an execution.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she state any reason why she had a claim upon you for eight shillings? - A. No; she told me if I did not give it to her, it would be worse for me or other people that I should be sorry for before the week was out; she did not mention the name of any body; I told her I had not eight shillings to spare; I knew of no right that she had to ask for it; nothing farther passed; I saw Mrs. Bromfield, the defendant, on the Sunday after; she came to my house at ten o'clock in the morning, and asked for Mrs. Lyne's; I told her I was the person; she told me then she came to relate that there was a warrant against my sister for a little-go; I told her it was impossible, for I knew she was not guilty of any such action; I asked Mrs. Bromfield her name, and she told me her name was White; she said she lived in Short's-buildings; she had only been three weeks in town, she should be in London a few days; if I did not come forward with a handsome sum of money for Mr. Edwards, he would pull me out of my house and my sister too in the morning; I asked her where I was to go to see Mr. and Mrs. Edwards, to carry them the money; she said, to a chandler's-shop in the Broad-way, St. Giles's, turning up by the Black Dog; then she went away, and in the afternoon I went there, and saw a young person who passed for Mrs. Edwards's daughter; I was directed to go to a public-house opposite, and there I saw Mrs. Bromfield and Mrs. Edwards sitting together in a box, but nothing particular passed; Mrs. Bromfield said to Mrs. Edwards, she had had the pleasure of seeing me once before; Mrs. Edwards then asked for a private room, and I saw no more of Mrs. Bromfield; when we came into the room, I asked Mrs. Edwards what she wanted; she said, she had got a warrant against Mrs. Booker, my sister, for a little-go; I said it was impossible; she said it might be settled for a sum of money when Edwards came; some little time after Edwards came in, and said he would settle it for five quids; I asked him what that meant; he said five guineas; he said he acted under Mr. Wood, and the next day he said Mr. Wood protected him on the Sunday; I told him I had not so much money, or any thing like it; he then said he would call upon me the next day, and appointed his own time in the morning at ten o'clock; nothing more passed that night; the next morning Edwards and his wife both came to my house; I asked them if they would not drop it without that sum of money; he said, what could I give him; I told him it would be the destruction of my brother and sister if such a thing should occur.</p>
               <p>Q. In what situation of life is Mr. Booker? - A. A very genteel one; he is an enameller, and has got many houses at the back of his own; Mrs. Edwards said to her husband, come along, if it cannot be settled, we will go to Worship-street, and follow them up; I then gave him a twenty-shilling note for fear of his going to do that against my sister which was wrong; he told me it was not enough; unless I promised him some more on Friday, he would not be satisfied; I told him I could not give him any more on the Friday, but I would give him another note on the Monday; he then said he would go and get Armstrong to file the warrant, and then both went away, and I saw no more of them till that day week; I met Edwards in Chiswell-street, and they said they were going to my house for the remainder of the money; Mr. Edwards said so in the hearing of his wife; I told him I should not be at home for two hours; they said they would not wait above an hour; I returned in an hour and a half, and they were at my house; I then gave them another twenty-shilling note; Mr. Edwards then said the warrant was done with.</p>

               <p>Q. What was it induced you to give first one note, and then the other? - A. For fear they were taking my sister on a false accusation.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they threatened to take her on a false accusation? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You never saw Mrs. Bromfield after the Sunday? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you had the conversation with Mrs. Bromfield, was any body with you? - A. Nobody but my own children.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you recollect about the beginning of February having any conversation with her upon the subject of a little-go, or about Mrs. Booker? - A. On Friday the 4th of February, I had some conversation with her about Mrs. Booker; she came into my house, No. 6, Steward-court, Clerkenwell-green; she said, who do you think is taken up; I said, I don't know; she said, mother Booker; I asked her what she had done; she said, oh, she had done nothing; she said, she was sworn<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180309140092"></xptr>against, and that was enough for her; she must pay 100l. or go to prison.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say at whose instance she was to go to prison? - A. I asked her what was the matter, and she said, it mattered not to me; she said, she would go, and seek about it; she came back in about an hour, and said it was all settled, they were to pay 100l. she said, the poor wretches, without mentioning any names, were in a starving condition, and she would go and see what she could do for them.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you mentioned the names of Edwards or his wife to her? - A. No; she said the informers, but did not mention any names; she said, they had a hundred a year from Government, and she called them informers; she came again in the morning, and said, they had settled it; she said, we have settled it, and got ten guineas; we asked her who had got it, and whether it was settled before a Magistrate, and she said, no, it was settled among themselves; Mrs. Bromfield said, she had got interest at Hatton-garden; her word would go further than half the parish; she said she had been at Hatton-garden.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she mention the name of either of the Edwards's? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember having any conversation with them about a Mrs. Booker? - A. Yes, at my own house sometime after Christmas, but I cannot say how long after; I asked Edwards with what view he took out the warrant against Mrs. Booker; he said, he took it out for the purpose of drawing five guineas from Mrs. Lynes, the sister of Mrs. Booker; I said, I was sure that Mrs. Booker lived in too much credit to do any thing of the kind; he made answer immediately, no, I never did any thing with her; I did it on purpose to draw her sister in for five guineas, and he told me Mrs. Lynes promised him five, but he said he had got two out of the five, two one-pound notes; if he had not got that he should have got nothing; I said, if she had not given you any thing, what would you have done then; he said, I would have wrote it down, and his pal, Mrs. Knight, would swear it.</p>

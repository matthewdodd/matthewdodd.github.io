            's farm at Edmonton, the prisoner was in his service. A man, named Head, lived about a quarter of a mile off. There was a quantity of potatoes in the barn, which was boarded. Foster is our private watchman, and bought to come on duty at nine o'clock at night, and leave at five in the morning. On Sunday, the 13th of December, I was in town, but returned at night. On Monday morning Foster gave me information. I found three boards of the barn had been pulled down and put up again - there was room to get in and take the potatoes out. On the 15th of December I went with Austin, and took the prisoner. He said it was the first time he had robbed his master, out Deller often had.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. REYNOLDS. Deller was in my master's service. He never was discharged to my knowledge.</p>

            . I live with Mr. White, and have one so four years - I attend the pigs. On Sunday, the 13th of December, about half-past six o'clock in the morning, I went on the premises to feed the pigs. I was in the privy, and heard a noise against my master's he potatoe-barn. I went to the door, and saw the prisoner come out of the window of the barn. I saw him half fill a sack with potatoes. I then saw a man, named James Head, put out another half-sack - Head lifted one sack on the prisoner's shoulder. I went up to them, and said,</p>
               <p>"Who is here? - is it you, George? Is it all right?" He said Yes. I said,</p>
               <p>"It is right enough for me, if it is for you." He said,</p>
               <p>"Here is a shilling for you." I said,</p>
               <p>"I don't want your shillings." He said Take it," which I did, and put it into my pocket. They then took the potatoes over the place. Head went back his quantity, and put both of them on the wood-stack, out ten yards from the barn - they then took them into the road, and then into a field where Wiggins had been hedging the day before, and put them under some wood which they had cut up for the hedge. It was moonlight. I went and told the watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you tell the watchman - A. About nine o'clock at night. Nobody was at home before that - my master was absent - I told nobody of it before. The watchman and I went to the field - I showed him the potatoes. We watched them all night, until seven o'clock in the morning - nobody came for them - in about three hours after they were gone. They must have broken the boards down to get at the barn, as the doors were locked and bolted. I saw Wiggins stick the boards up again as I was in the privy.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long was he in putting the boards up - A. About five minutes. I watched them after I received the shilling. I returned to the privy again to watch them. I knew the prisoner well.</p>
               <p>Q. The full moon was on the 12th, at four o'clock in the morning - it would be down much sooner than when they came - A. It was full moonlight. The privy is about ten yards from the barn.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you at White's house during the day - A. Yes, and saw the maid. I inquired for the bailiff. I did not think it right to tell the maid.</p>
               <p>Q. After you left off watching, what became of you - A. I went to bed. I did not move them.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not surprised at Wiggins's giving you a shilling - A. I was afraid of Head, which made me take it, as he had several times threatened to shoot me when I was watching in the fields. I was once discharged from my place for a week, as the foreman and I fell out - I do not remember what it was about. Wiggins came to his work as usual, and was taken.</p>

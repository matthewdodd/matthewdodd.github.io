                  </hi>. I am butler to the Honourable Morris Frederick Fitz<lb></lb>harding Berkeley—he is one of the Lords of the Admiralty Some coals were to be delivered to him—they came, and we began working at nine o'clock in the morning, and finished about, one or two o'clock—they were placed in the cellar of the Admiralty—Sloane was the person who carried them—the mode of delivering them, is by bringing, them up the river to Scotland-yard, and then sending me down to see them weighed in bags of a hundred and half each—they are then sent up to the Admiralty on men's backs, and I give them tickets, which the trimmer, I think takes of them.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 10, Great James-street, with my father and mother. On 16th April I saw the prisoner behind the counter in our shop, which is a little trimming-shop—he had a roll of calico under his arm, which was lying behind the counter—I asked him what he wanted—he said, "A halfpenny skein of silk"—I asked him what he wanted with that calico—he said his halfpenny had rolled down behind the counter, and he went to pick it up—he had this calico under his arm, and there were a lot of bindings under it—he was turning them over—it was about five minutes after eight o'clock.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's wife. I came into the shop and saw the prisoner there—my son said, "I saw him behind the counter, with the calico under his arm; I will go and get the policeman"—I said, "Do," for I had often seen the prisoner there before—he came for a half-penny skein of silk and I said I did not keep it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 20, Sun-street, Woolwich—a few minutes after 12 on the night of Saturday, 16th September, I saw the prosecutor in Church-street, sitting with his back to the wall, tipsy, and I saw the prisoner with his left arm across him, pretending to get him up, and his right hand went under the old man's coat on the left side, and he pulled something from under his coat—I then heard some halfpence drop—I told him he was picking the old man's pocket—he did not say anything, but walked down the street—I met a policeman, and the prisoner was taken into custody—the policeman turned his bull's-eye on, and I saw him pick up a purse and twopence from the ground, about two yards from where the old man had been sitting—he was still there—the policeman brought the prisoner back to the spot.</p>

On this Sunday morning, about twenty minutes past 12, the last witness pointed out the prisoner to me in Church-street, Woolwich—I went after him and told him he was wanted for robbing the old man who was lying in the street—he said, "Pooh, nonsense"—I took him back to the place and picked up 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and a purse containing 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. near the spot where the old man had been.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of the late Edwin King, of 3, Chapel-street, Woolwich—on this morning, about 12, I saw the old man in a sitting position on the ground, and the prisoner leaning over him with one of his hands near one side pocket and one the other, apparently at the coat pocket—the old man said, "What do you want with me, you have nothing to do with me, let me alone, I know what you want"—at that time Mr. Isted was close behind me—I went into a shop, and while there I heard money drop—I afterwards went to the station, and then straight home—as I was going along, passing the spot where I had seen the old man, I kicked against something—it was very dirty, and I did not notice it—a lodger of mine after wards brought this pocket (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) indoors, and I said, "Take it to the Police."</p>

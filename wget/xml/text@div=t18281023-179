            . I am a constable of the Thames Police-office. On the 17th of October I was coming on shore from a vessel, a little before six o'clock in the morning, and met the prisoner coming out of <placeName id="t18281023-179-crimeloc1052">Somerset-house</placeName>

            . I am head-messenger at the Navy office - the prisoner was one of the messengers there; there is an allowance of candles during the six winter months; the housekeeper supplies them to get the coals and other things to be used in the house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is there any pretence for saying, that in any of the Government departments, any of the messengers or other persons, can use, off the premises of the King, what is allowed them to use there? A. No; I have no doubt about that - I have been there about seven months.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM WHEATLY re-examined. Q. How long have you been in the Navy office? A. Nearly twenty-six years; I have heard that a certain quantity of candles and brown paper is allowed to messenger to light the fires, and if they can save any thing of it, they take it away - I believe it is done, but not from authority, but that does not apply to such paper as this.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The candles and other things are allowed from October to March, and if I can save any, I take them home; with respect to that white paper some time ago Mr. Vinal's room was altered, and a desk put away - I believe, to tell the truth, some of the paper, that was in the desk, may be there. Mr. Smith's room is very hot in the summer time, and the drawers smelt very much - I was ordered to clean them, and some of that paper was in them.</p>

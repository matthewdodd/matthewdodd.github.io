            . I am an officer. On Sunday, the 26th of April, I apprehended the prisoner, Smith - I neither threatened or promised him. I told him it was a sin to rob a poor widow. He said he should never have thought of robbing Mrs. Savage, if it had not been for Holland. I took him to Hatton-garden, and then went and took Holland at Mrs. Savage's house, and told him what Smith had said; he denied it at first, but afterwards said Smith got in at the window, and that he was very drunk, or he should not have done it. I asked Smith what he had done with the money? he said he had bought a new hat and two pair of stockings; and that Holland bought a snuff-coloured coat with his money. On the Monday following I examined the place, and saw footsteps in the garden, and in the chair under the window. I went to the House of Correction and got Smith's shoe, which fitted to the marks in the garden and on the chair-there was a mark where a piece had come off the toe, and had been mended, I could see that mark in particular. Smith said that Holland stooped down, that he got on his back, and got in at the window. They both told where they sold the property. I went to the place, but found nothing.</p>

             re-examined. The 1l. note belonged to my brother Edward. On the Monday, when Limbrick was taking Holland to the office, I heard him say that he was very drunk, and he should not have done it if he had not been persuaded by Smith, and that they sold the things to a man in St. Giles's for 5l. I said, "You surely did not sell the five guineas?" he said, "I do not know what there was, I was so drunk."</p>
               <p>HOLLAND'S Defence. On the evening of the robbery I was at the Duke of York, public-house, Somers'-town - I came home about eleven o'clock-my wife told me I was suspected of the robbery. Next morning I was going for some porter, and met Smith in Hart-street; next night I heard he was taken. I was much agitated, hearing I was suspected. I might have escaped if I had liked. I was taken on Monday, and told Savage I was innocent.</p>

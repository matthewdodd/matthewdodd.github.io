                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Kain, plumber and glazier, of No. 14, Bethnal-green. On the evening of 7th Aug., I was at the Stratford station of the Eastern Counties Railway—I had three 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England notes in a piece of paper, and was on the platform waiting for the train—the prisoner came up and asked me what time I thought the train would go—I said that I had inquired, and it would be half an hour—she sat down, and then said, "My boot has <hi rend="italic">busted</hi>"—I made some remark—I did not have any drink with her, or go to Cobb's with her—I am a stranger in Stratford—I sat still, and when she saw the train just on the stand still, she seized my left hand, and fetched me a blow on the right side of my face—one of the servants of the Company took me, or I should have been under the rails and killed—she took the notes out of my hand—there was a genteel boy there who I did not think was with her—he said, "Dear me, you will have a black eye to-morrow"—whether she passed the notes to him, I did not see—Wicks went away, and got a policeman, and I gave her into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a porter in the service of the Eastern Counties Railway Company. On the evening of 7th Aug., I was on the platform of the Stratford station, and saw Mrs. Kain and the prisoner there—I saw the prosecutrix walk as fast as she could after the prisoner, who was going to<lb></lb>wards the end of the train, as if she was going to get in, as quick as she could—she was collared by the prosecutrix, who said, "Stop this woman, she has robbed me"—the prisoner said, "If you tell me that, I will knock you off the platform;" and <hi rend="italic">up</hi> with her fist, and hit her in the face—I prevented her from striking her again—the inspector came up, and she said, "You may search me; I have not robbed the woman"—he said, "It is not our place to do that"—I left her in charge, and fetched sergeant Addington—Mrs. Kain said, in the prisoner's presence, that she had robbed her of 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not notice any boy at the station, because several people <hi rend="italic">bolted</hi> into the train, and I was in a hurry shutting the doors—whether there was anybody near her while she was being chased, I do not know.</p>

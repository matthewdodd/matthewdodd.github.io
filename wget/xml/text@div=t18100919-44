I weighed the silver out myself to him, and when I met him in Long-lane, I told him he had robbed me, and what piece he had about him, he took it out of his pocket, and said it was mine.</p>

            . I am a constable. Mr. Metham called upon me two or three days before, and wished me to remain in his house while the prisoner went out to his dinner, for him to weigh his work. On the 12th I was there about one o'clock, the prisoner came down from his work with another of his shopmates, I watched him into Long-lane, he there went into a cook's shop. Mr. Metham came after the prisoner, and saw him, he appeared as if he was going back to his work. Mr. Metham took hold of him, told him that he had robbed him. We took him back, and searched him in the parlour; I took some silver out of the prisoner's breeches pocket.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have done several jobs for myself, and the silver I had upon me for a long while. I had a private job, that was the silver that I was a going to make it with.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

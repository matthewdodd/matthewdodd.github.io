I went with Sarah Howard, I left the prisoner Smith with Sinden; I went into another room with Howard; I did not see Thompson until I went out of Howard's room, then she was standing against Smith's door; when I went in Smith's room and found Sinden's pocket turned inside out.</p>

No; I was undressed ready to go to bed; she went down to get something to drink; I thought I heard two women go down stairs by their petticoats touching the stairs, I did not hear their voices. Howard did not return until she came with the watchman to shew him who had been robbed. As soon as I went to Sinden to ask him where his money was, Thompson went down stairs.

These women were brought to the watchhouse by the watchman,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181010310062"></xptr>they were fighting in consequence of not dividing the money they had robbed the man of in Cross-lane, that was the charge he gave; the prisoner, Howard, then addressed the constable of the night and me, she said, Smith had robbed the man, she would not divide the spoil and she would have her share of it, the man was at Smith's apartment, and if I would send the watchman with her she would take him to the man that had been robbed; I ordered the watchman to go with her, he brought Sinden and Howell with him to the watchhouse; Sinden pointed out Smith as the woman that was with him. Smith and Thompson were both searched carefully, no note or dollar was found on them, only a shilling and a few halfpence. Howard insisted Smith had it, or she had fenced it, as she termed it. I searched her again, I only found a few halfpence on her.</p>
               <p>Smith's Defence. I am quite innocent. I met this man in Holborn, he had got his friend with him and another woman, he took us in to drink, he had no more than two pence halfpenny about him, he said he would get money in the morning; his friend was to sleep with the woman in the adjoining room. I went down stairs to get a candle. I met Thompson, she said she would shew me where to get one. Howard came down, got me into Eagle-street watchhouse, she said I had robbed the man; I was let out and afterwards taken to St. Giles's watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Howard's Defence. When I was taken I was very much in liquor, I did not know what I said.</p>
               <p>Thompson's Defence. I had been out to a day's work; coming home I went up stairs, I met with that young woman, she asked me if I would go with her and buy a candle; we had not been out five minutes before this woman came and tore her clothes.</p>

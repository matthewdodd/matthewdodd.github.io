                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Glover, a chemist in George-street, Tottenham-court-road. On the 20th of October, about eight o'clock, the prisoner came and asked for a pennyworth of ointment—she offered me a shilling, for which I gave her a sixpence and 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., in halfpence—after she was gone, I discovered the shilling was bad—I told Johnson of</p>

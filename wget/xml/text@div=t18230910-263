I was in the act of getting up, and they snatched at my ribbon, which broke, and they got my seal and key, and ran across the square - I immediately ran after them, calling Stop thieves! and the patrol stopped the prisoner. I had never lost sight of him, and am certain he is the one who snatched at my watch. We took him towards the watch-house - he said he was innocent, and made a spring to get from the watchman; but I caught hold of him - an officer came to us. I have not found my seal.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to think he was intoxicated - A. Because he dropped his head down, and made no answer to them. I thought it was all a lark.</p>

I had stopped late, and ran as hard as I could; and in the square I heard somebody halloo Stop him! I turned round, and the gentleman stopped me; they almost throttled me, and being faint with running I fell into a swoon. I never stop out late.</p>

                  </hi> I am a chemist and druggist, and live in High-street, Camden-town. On the 15th of Feb., about seven o'clock in the evening, I received this prescription from Miss Collyer (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—it is "Compound spirit of ammonia, two drachms; tincture of opium, sixteen drops; prussic acid, Seheeles' strength, four drops; compound strychnine powder, two grains; bitter almond water, six ounces; make into a mixture, of which take two spoonsful three times a day—Feb. 3, 1847. Miss Collyer. Signed, D.C."—the Latin for the words <hi rend="italic">spoons full</hi> is <hi rend="italic">cochlea</hi>—it does not state any particular size—there is also a prescription for pills, but that was not made up—when I re<lb></lb>ceived this prescription I saw I had not got the bitter almond water or the compound strychnine powder—I wrote an order, and sent my boy to Mr. Morson's, a chemist of some eminence in Southampton-row, and told him if he could not obtain it there, to go to Mr. Bell's, in Oxford-street, who is one of the first chemists in London—the boy brought me back a twelve ounce bottle full of bitter almond water—the directions that I gave to the boy and the article which he brought back were precisely in accordance with the bitter almond water named in the prescription—the boy did not bring me any compound strychnine powder—I could not obtain it, and I made up the pre<lb></lb>scription without it, with the other ingredients—I put in six ounces of the bitter almond water—I filled the bottle up with it, and gave it the witness Johnson—I have been a chemist and druggist twelve years—I never made up such a mixture before—in my experience I had never seen the compound strychnine powder and bitter almond water named as ingredients to be used in medicine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You say you had never made up such a prescription before, that is, you never prepared one with six ounces of bitter almond water concentrated in a pint bottle? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never prepared one with bitter almond water in my life—I did not know the properties either of the strychnine powder or the bitter almond water—they are not named in the "Pharma<lb></lb>copæia," and therefore I could not—I have never seen in the <hi rend="italic">Pharmaceutical Journal</hi> a prescription by Mr. Bell as to the mode in which the bitter almond water is to be prepared—it is not named in any recognized "Pharmacopaeia"—the last edition of the "Pharmacopaeia of the London Physicians" was</p>

               <p>published in 1836—I believe that is what is called the "London Pharma<lb></lb>copaeia"—I believe that with eleven years of experience there has been no recognized edition of the "pharmacopoeia" since—I have read of professor Baron Liebig, and have seen some of the discoveries that have been made in medinal science during the last eleven years—I do not know the purpose or property or compound strychnine powder at all—if it had been for the pur<lb></lb>pose either of partially neutralising, or in any way dealing with any other portion of the prescription, I should know nothing about it—I left it out, and never mentioned it, but Mr. Bell sent me a private recipe for making it up, and I am sure, if made up according to that, it would have no effect at all—I did not send Dr. Cronin's prescription to Mr. Bell—he did not know whether that which I wrote for, and which was prescribed, was for external or internal use—I wrote precisely in the same words that were ordered—we never send the prescriptions—if I had sent it, he would have seen from it that the bitter almond water was a mere vehicle for the administration of the medicine—I do not know that I put in enough concentrated bitter almond water to kill a horse—I have seen Mr. Gray's "Supplement to the Pharmacopaeia"—I have not seen bitter almond water named there as a vehicle—there are instruc<lb></lb>tions, there for persons who take upon themselves to mix physician's prescript<lb></lb>tions or to prepare distilled waters from oils, but we never prepare them from the "supplement"—I do not possess it—I do not know Dr. Periara's <hi rend="italic">Selecta<lb></lb>e Prescripta</hi>—I do not think that is a book of authority—I have never heard that it is—I have been in a great many chemists' shops, and have never seen it—when the word <hi rend="italic">cochlea</hi> is written in a prescription for a half pint or pint mixture, then we consider it means a table-spoon full, but if in a small phial, it would mean a tea-spoon full—I should have thought that in a bottle of this capacity the physician meant a table-spoonful—I do not know whether anybody in his senses would have doubted it—this is a prescription of a variety of compounds, some of which I think would neuturalize the others—compound spirit of ammonia decomposes prussic acid—I believe the ingredient known by name of <hi rend="italic">aqua amygdalarum amarum</hi> means the water of bitter almonds—I was not aware that that was prepared in a variety of ways, or that it was prepared at all—I did not know that there were five different characters of it—I did not know that in one way of mixing it it was a most deadly poison—if the prescription was <hi rend="italic">aqua amygdalarum amarum concentra,</hi> that would mean the concentrated water, a strong water, of course—it appears on the face of this prescription that it is to be taken internally—it is ordered here as the vehicle for compounding together the different materials of the prescript<lb></lb>tion; to fill up the bottle—it was filled up with six ounces of the bitter almond water sent to me by Mr. Bell—it was not labelled "concentrated," nor even "poison"—I did not smell it before I put it into the prescription—I poured it from Mr. Bell's bottle into the other—it did not produce on my nerves the slightest possible sensation of the bitter of almonds—it was a twelve-ounce bottle, and held about three-quarters of a pint—the bottle I sent to Miss. Collyer was a six-ounce one—it contained six doses—I think compound spirit of ammonia would decompose prussic acid of Scheeles' strength—it is apparent on the face of this prescription that the bitter almond water is intended merely as a vehicle for taking the medicine.</p>

                  </hi> I am a chemist and druggist, residing in Oxford-street. On the 15th of Feb. I received an order upon a paper, on which Mr. Corfield's name was printed, for some bitter almond water and compound strychnine powder—I had no compound strychnine powder—there is no authorized formula for it—I had none myself—I referred to several books for it, and I sent Mr. Corfield the bitter almond water, and a copy of the formula for the powder, which I happened to find in a book, mentioning the authority—I have not recollection of ever having seen bitter almond water ordered in a prescription as a medicine internally—there are formulae on the Continent for it, but I have not seen it in England—I think I have examined about twenty-two formulae since this case came before the public, in the foreign Pharmacopoeias—I have looked at this prescription of Dr. Cronin's—if it were sent to me I should not know what to put in it—I should think it requisite to ask the physician which kind of bitter almond water he meant, or how it was to be prepared—there is nothing in the prescription that tells me of what strength it is to be—any kind of bitter almond water would be equally correct, according to the order—I have known bitter almond water or<lb></lb>dered externally—the vehicles for the mixing up of medicines are endless—some may be harmless and some poisonous, but if poisonous, their strength should be defined—the strength is not defined in this prescription—the omission of the strychnine powder would have no effect, whatever chemically, on the mix<lb></lb>ture—it would be the omission of a poison, therefore, it might be rather less poisonous—strychnine is an alkaloid prepared form nux-vomia—the compound strychnine which is intended here is made with a mixture of sugar in that alkaloid, and is perfectly harmless—the strength intended here would be quite harmless—it would not have any effect in qualifying the other ingredients.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you published in the "Pharmaceutical Journal" a formula for the preparation of medical almond water? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was a formula sent to me by a chemist at Brighton for publication, which I put into the Journal, but it is no authority—it is a proposition, the same as a great number of articles which are published, they are simply proposals for improved me<lb></lb>thods of preparation; but it does not follow because they are published that they become authority, unless they are authorised by the "College of Phy<lb></lb>sicians"—I published it—it was made from the cake by a particular process (<hi rend="italic">referring to the Journal</hi>)—the proportions were two pounds of bitter al<lb></lb>monds, having the oil expressed, distilled with eight pounds of water—that would be perfectly innocuous in a proper dose, and so would that which I sent, but this would be nearly as strong as that which I sent—the meaning of "<hi rend="italic">aqua amygd amar concent.</hi>" is concentrated bitter almond water—I sent a bitter almond water which is prepared in distilling the oil.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you send the concentrated bitter almond water? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I know of no preparation which is under any authority designated by that term—it was a concentrated bitter almond water, but it was not so strong as it might have been made—I have examined some twice as strong, of course that would be more concentrated—the word "concentrated" is a comparative term.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Gray was a man of very considerable science, was he not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He may have been—he was in his day—Gray gives it that term—he gives a preparation of his own—physicians of the present day frequently order articles not mentioned in the "Pharmacopoeia."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you undertake to say that you have not yourself compounded simply from the term <hi rend="italic">aqua amygd amar</hi> the innocent bitter almond water? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am certain that I have never used any bitter almond water except that which I sent out on the occasion under consideration—I have no recollection of ever having before me a prescription directing the internal application of the inno<lb></lb>cent bitter almond water—I will undertake to say that I have not known of it—I do not know Mr. Brew, of Brighton.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would there have been any difficulty in putting the strength of this bitter almond water in the prescription? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; it would have been very easy to have stated how many drops of oil and how much water—in cases where there is no authorised formula, it is usual to state the strength—sometimes harmless liquids are used to make up medicines—it does not follow that they should be always harmless—when deleterious ingredients are used it is usual to mention the strength, if there are various infusions—there would have been no difficulty in mentioning the strength that Dr. Cronin intended this bitter almond water to be of—I conceive if it was in<lb></lb>tended to be taken to any chemist, the strength should have been mentioned—if it were to be made up at his own dispensary it would be perfectly safe, but a chemist not having any understanding of that sort would not know.</p>

                  </hi> I am a dispensing chemist, and live in Tich<lb></lb>borne-street, Haymarket—I keep two English preparations of bitter almond water in my shop, according to "Gray's Pharmacopoeia," and three foreign sorts, one French, one Italian, and one German—I am in the habit of making up many prescriptions—I have made up prescriptions with bitter almond water—when certain ingredients are to be made up there is very often some liquid put in that is not intended to be operative, but to mix up altogether and make up the quantity—bitter almond water is sometimes prescribed as the vehicle, but I cannot say it is usual—six ounces are ordered in this pre<lb></lb>scription—I should take it according to "Gray's Pharmacopoeia," and I should take the weak preparation—there is no "concentrated" put against it; if it is meant to be concentrated, it is usual to put "con." against it, that is the way to distinguish it.</p>

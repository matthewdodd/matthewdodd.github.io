On the Monday morning when he came again, I asked him how Mr. Potter liked his coat, he said he had not seen him, he was gone to church, I said is it not paid for then, he said no. A few days after I went out and when I came home I was informed that Mr. Potter had been to our house, I asked the prisoner if Mr. Potter had paid him, he said no, he only went over the way with him and had a glass of liquor to drink with him, he said on the following Sunday he would go and ask Mr. Potter for it. On the Saturday night I asked the prisoner if he would go, he said no, he should not be able to go, he had appointed to dine with his mother and sister; on the Monday he came again to the shop as usual and on the Tuesday, on the Wednesday he did not come. I understood by our boy that Mr. Potter was coming by our door, I addressed Mr. Potter, he said he had paid for the coat. I never received the money for the coat. Then on the Thursday when he came to the shop I had him apprehended.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the coat to cost. - A. Two pound five shillings.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. This is what you call a felony and embezzlement in the indictment. - A. Yes.</p>


               <p>Q. This man being a likely man you employed him to invite the customers in. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You gave him a tester in nine. - A. Yes, in nine shillings one sixpence, that is usual in the trade, he had lived with me a year and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. This man at Walthamstow was a stranger to you and a friend of the prisoner's - A I knew he was a stranger to me. I found afterwards that he was a friend of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181112040024"></xptr>Q. I ask you upon your oath when your barker produces a customer to you, do not you allow that he shall enter it as a matter of credit to his own account. - A. By no means, our shop is in the ready money way. He took the coat from me to bring home the money on the Monday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he after your enquiry for the two pound five shillings, tell you that he had unfortunately lost the money, but that you should be paid. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe he was going to quit your service. - A. Not as I know.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath had not he given you warning that he was going to set up in business, and after that you had him apprehended. - A. Not before I sent for an officer to take him</p>
               <p>MR. POTTER. I live in Walthamstow in Essex, I am a mealman and corn-dealer. On my coming down Houndsditch from the corn market, I saw the prisoner at the front of the shop, upon my seeing him, he being an old acquaintance of my brothers and my friend. I thought I wanted a coat, I asked him if he could suit me for one, he answered me, walk in Sir, I will suit you with one of the best. I tried on several coats, but I did not approve of them, he persuaded me to look at a piece of cloth a remnant, which he could recommend me. I looked at it, and he as a friend persuaded me to have a coat made of the same piece, he took measure of me, and we agreed for the piece five and forty shillings, that is all that passed then. On the Sunday morning the prisoner brought the coat to my house, I gave him two one pound notes and a dollar. When I went to the next Wednesday's market I did not see the prisoner, on the Wednesday week's market. I accosted him Old Friend you owe me sixpence, he replied Oh yes Sir, I know I do, we will drink it out, we went over the way and had a glass of rum and water and a biscuit. On the next Wednesday's market I was accosted by Mr. Benson, how do you do Sir, how does your coat fit, I told him I hardly knew, I only put it on when my Old Friend brought it, he followed me to the end of the shop like a bailiff, I was afraid of a touch on the shoulder, I said I have paid for the coat, he said have you Sir, I said yes I have, he said he had heard nothing of it. I went home, on the Thursday night he came down to my house with an officer, to apprehend me, I suppose I was not at home, he left orders for me to appear before the Lord Mayor on Friday morning following, I was prevented by business, I could not attend. On the Friday night I was coming home, Mr. Benson's brother and an officer accosted me and said they had a summons for me. In the discourse between Benson's brother and the officer, I heard Benson's brother say he is a going to live with Mr. Smith that has opened a shop down our street, and we must banish that.</p>

               <p>Mr. Alley. You would not have gone into Benson's shop for a coat except for your old friend Britten. - A. I should not have gone into the shop except for him. I thought he was one of the firm.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

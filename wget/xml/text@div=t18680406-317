My husband keeps a confectioner's shop, in Tottenham Court Road—on Wednesday evening, 19th February, I was at the other end of the shop when the prisoner came in—I did not serve her—Mary Taylor gave me a bad sixpence next morning, which was put on the shelf by itself—on the following Monday, about the same time, the prisoner came in, and I served her with a penny bun—she gave me a bad sixpence, I told her it was bad, and sent for a constable—she said that a gentleman gave it to her—Mary Taylor said, "That is the same person who gave me the sixpence last week"—I gave the two sixpences to the policeman.</p>

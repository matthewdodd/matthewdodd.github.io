                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Ives, a baker, at Crouch<lb></lb>end. On Monday, the 20th of January, the prisoner came about four o'clock in the afternoon, and asked me to go with him to sell a spoon—I refused—he came again on the Wednesday, and said, "Where we sell the bowl we must not sell the G; we must take the G where it will get melted down directly"—I refused to go, and on the Thursday he came at night, and said that all through that spoon he had got the <hi rend="italic">sack</hi>—I did not see the G on the spoon, I only saw the bowl of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Ives, a baker. The prisoner came to our shop on the 22nd of January, with part of a spoon, and wished to have it weighed—he said he thought it would fetch 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and that it would serve for drink for him and the gardener—he came again next night, and wished me not to say any thing about it.</p>

Q.</hi> Who was in the shop? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> My husband passed through, but he did not stay in the shop—I thought it rather odd, but the prisoner told me he found it in the garden, and it was very much bent—I knew Mr. Grant, Mr. Smith's predecessor—the part that I saw was the bowl of a spoon—I spoke of this directly I went in-doors—it must have been after the prisoner was taken that I named it.</p>

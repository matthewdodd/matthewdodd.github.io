               <p>John Motelowe. The prisoner was detected in my house, but I was in my bed at the time, my wife can give a better account of it than I can.</p>
               <p>Eliz. Motelowe. on the 25th of April the prisoner came to my house and a boy with her, she called for a pint of beer, there was a half pint pot stood in the corner; a man in the house told me the boy had given that pot to the prisoner. I went to the woman and went to pull her, she dropt the half pint pot from under her arm. I claped my hand to her pocket and felt something, and in her pocket I found a pint pot of mine, her boy ran away immediately. In searching her room, two other of my pots were found under her bed. (Produced in court and deposed to.)</p>

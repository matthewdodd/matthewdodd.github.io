                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q</hi>. I believe when you were applied to, to sell out 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., to let my son have, you said you would not consent to it without I could get him away from London, as he was going on at a random rate, and disgracing himself? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I advised his leaving London, and said if he would, I would consent to advance the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I blamed you as much as him for leaving him in possession of the money—I was not aware, when that settlement was made, that your son was not of age.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi>. The prisoner produced a document to me about his son's age—before he produced it, he told me his son would be of age in Dec. 1838—I would not act upon his statement, and then either the prisoner or Mr. Carpenter Smith produced the document—the prisoner told me his son was of age, before he executed the deed, and it was on the faith of that that he got my check.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. It is exactly the truth that has been stated; it is of no use in me to make a wronng defence, there was no intention of fraud; one of the executors under the will, said that he would throw the estate into Chancery, and he would have nothing to do with it, as they were married without consulting him; of course we did not like that, as my son had no means of supporting his wife, and I had no means of supporting them; I told him to agree to any proposal rather than do that; accordingly, everything which was proposed was agreed to, but the deed required execution before my son was of age; if be has been ex<lb></lb>travagant, and spent the money foolishly, I can't answer for that; this was done six years ago, and no person has ever been called upon to repay the money, and never will be; nothing was done on my part with the intention of depriving any person of their just rights; had my son applied for the money, I should then have said he had acted in a most rascally manner, and it would be an attempt to rob; but Mr. Shepherd will never be involved in any difficulty, nor the Bank of England, nor any one—(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

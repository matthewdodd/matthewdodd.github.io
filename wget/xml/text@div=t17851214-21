               <p>Did you see what it was they poured into the pail? - I did not, I could not, the prisoner had the frying-pan in her hand, the constable took the metal out of the pail, and has had it ever since; I am sure it was not the prisoner that put it in the pail, the prisoner opened the door to me, I had no suspicion of her.</p>
               <p>You did not know there was any pot missing? - Not till I was told.</p>
               <p>Was she at your house that day? - Frequently.</p>
               <p>Had she a pot at home that day? - I cannot say, she might.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. My Lord, it was only two drunken women taking a little gin out of the pot.</p>
               <p>Court. The Jury must be satisfied whether it was taken in a felonious way, or only taken with some liquor.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do not you think this pot was melted by warming a drop of comfort? - It is possible, we have frequently been served so.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you ever seen a pot at your own house melted? - I have.</p>
               <p>Jury. I have seen them run by heat down the middle, but never saw one melted in this way.</p>

               <p>Did she see you? - She did.</p>
               <p>What did you think she was going to do with the pot? - She put it under her apron and had some liquor and went away.</p>

               <p>I am constable, the prosecutor came to my house, I went with him to the prisoner's door, and knocked at the door, she would not open the door, I forced open the door, the prosecutor charged the prisoner with stealing the pots, and I found the metal very hot, in a pail of water just by the fire.</p>
               <p>What did you see? - I saw the metal that is now here, except what stuck to the frying pan, some is on it now. (The metal produced as picked out of the pail, being part of two pint pots.) The two women interceded for mercy.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called eight witnesses who had known her several years, all of whom gave her a very good character, and said she was not a woman likely to steal pots to melt, but that she was given to drinking.</p>
               <p>Court to Edwards. Did the prisoner appear to be in liquor when she came into the house? - I did not take notice, she might or might not.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. She was generally intoxicated, I wish lenity to be shewn her, they begged mercy from me when the constable came to the door.</p>

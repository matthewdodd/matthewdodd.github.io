                  </hi>. I belong to the Army Reserve—on 5th February was drinking in the Green Gate public-house, City Road, with some men—from there I went to the Red Lion, in Bath Street, and saw the prisoner there and four others, two of whom were Hart and Sweeney—from there we all went to the Greyhound at the comer of James Street—I had had a drop of beer but I was not drunk—I pulled out a little paper bag containing 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from a pocket inside my tunic and took out half a sovereign to pay for a pot of ale—they could see the other money in my bag—they all drank of the ale, and Hart, who I knew before, said "Will you have a drop of rum?"—I Said "Yes," and I had no sooner drank it than I felt dizzy and sat down and fell off the chair—Hart and Sweeney picked me up—I cannot say whether the prisoner helped, as I did not know what was being done—I was taken outside and knocked down and kicked on my side, and my face was grazed, and I lost my money—I did not see anybody do anything to me or feel anybody—I do not know who took my money—it was Sweeny, but I did not see him do it—all I know is that I found the money was gone, and when I came to, I was lying on the side of the kerb in James Street—I saw Hart and Sweeney next morning, 6th February, at the police-station and identified them as two of the men who had been with me—I afterwards gave evi<lb></lb>dence against them, and they were convicted at this Court—the prisoner was one of those who came out of the public-house—he followed behind—I did not see him outside the public-house as they <hi rend="italic">mixed me all up</hi>—I afterwards saw him on 10th February, I think, at the police-station, and picked him out of a number of others as one of the men who had been with me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am barmaid at the Greyhound, Old Street—I saw Newbury there on 5th February, about 5.30 P.m., with the prisoner and five or six others—Hart and Sweeney were both there—Newbury called for a pot of ale and paid for it with a half-sovereign, which he took out of a little brown-paper bag which he took from his jacket pocket before all the other men, and I heard the rattle of money—the beer was passed round, and after that Hart called for a half-quartern of rum—I gave it to him, but did not see what he did with it, as he turned his back to me—I saw Newbury drink the rum; he was sitting when it was given to him—Hart filled the glass twice and gave it to him twice, and then he slipped off the form on the floor—Hart and another one picked him up—they caught hold of each arm and sat him on the form again for a short time—I cannot say whether the prisoner was one of those—New<lb></lb>bury sat there a few minutes—my uncle came in and I went in to tea, but I had hardly got in before my uncle called me out again, and they all went out directly after, two of them holding Newbury by his arms—I can't say whether the prisoner was one of those; but they all went out together—I had made a communication to my uncle after the rum was given to Newbury and before tea—my uncle went out at another door—I saw Hart and Sweeney next day at the police-station—I afterwards saw the prisoner at the station and identified him; he was placed with others.</p>

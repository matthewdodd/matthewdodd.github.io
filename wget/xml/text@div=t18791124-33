I am manager to Mr. Bankhouse, who trades at Roberts and Co. at 76, New Bond Street, Chemists—I was with then in the Paris house three years, and only knew Blunt as an assistant when I came to manage the London shop about seven months ago—his salary was 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year and board and lodging—in consequence of suspi<lb></lb>cions I saw Sergeant O'Dee at Vine Street Station, and he marked some coins in my presence with a letter-punch—I received from him live half-sovereigns marked "J," which I placed in the till at New Bond Street just before 11.30, removing all other money except between 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver unmarked—I had sent Blunt upstairs—we keep this cash-book (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>) at the shop, and also a cash-sheet—the assistant who receives money for shop sales enters the amount and the article sold, on the cash-sheet, and puts the amount in the till—while Blunt was upstairs I made a fictitious entry in the book, so that he might not suspect that the half-sovereigns had been put into the till—the page was blank—the sheet was in its place by the till—the entries are in pencil; there were three, and I had marked the last—Blunt came down in a few minutes—it was his duty in my absence to serve customers and receive moneys—I had communicated with Mr. Williams, the other assistant—I then went away for about half an hour—Detective Sergeant O'Dee was near the shop by arrangement when I returned, and Blunt Was serving—I do not remember if Williams was there—I stood at my bureau, and saw Blunt write the last entry in the cash-book "1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., Miss Stuarton"—"Pinto" is the fictitious entry—the 26<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. is Blunt's, and "Sands "is mine—"Sutton "and "Stuarton "are his writing—"Livier "and "1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. cash-book "are mine—I then cleared the till of all the gold, viz., five half-sovereigns marked "J," one half-sovereign marked "F," and three unmarked—there was about 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. silver—I found three entries had been written in the cash-sheet by Blunt "Anti-fat, 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; Mrs. Ellis, 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; Maddison, 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—after communicating again with O'Dee, I came back to business and waited for him—I said nothing to Blunt—O'Dee came in about ten minutes and spoke to me in a private room—Blunt was then called in from the shop, and O'Dee asked him if he had any money; he produced two half sovereigns—after examining them, O'Dee said "These are marked coins; I caused them to be paid over the counter"—he replied "You have me"—I give him in custody—I had seen the two half-sovereigns stamped "T "by the officer.</p>

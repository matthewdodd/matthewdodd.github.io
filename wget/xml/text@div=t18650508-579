I am a plasterer, of 1, Brown-street, Wyndham-road, Camberwell—I was with Jefford—I saw the prisoner driving a cart full of bricks—I knew the deceased child, his name was William Saxby—I saw him in the Liepsic-road, from twenty to twenty-five yards from the corner, where the Wyndham-road runs into it, I should think—he was standing still, with his back to the horse—before the cart got up to the child I halloaed to the prisoner, and he got down and tried to save the child—I think he got down from the back of the cart, and before he got to the front, the wheel went over the little boy—the horse trod on his foot and threw him down and the wheel went over him—before that, the prisoner was sitting in the behind part of the cart on his left side—he had his face turned towards the side of the cart, away from the child—I don't believe he could see the child, the way he was looking—I did not notice whether he had any reins or not—I can't say one way or the other—he was going at about three miles an hour—he was quite sober.</p>

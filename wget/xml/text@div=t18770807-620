                  </hi>. I live at 11, Abingdon Street, Kensington—on Saturday night, 17th June, I went to bed at 10.30—the house was locked up and the windows closed—I then heard the bell ring once or twice when the laundry boy brought something home; I then heard a noise and got out of bed—I was sleeping on the drawing-room floor—I went to the door and listened and heard somebody coming up the stairs leading from the break-fast room; I saw the prisoner coming up the stairs and ran out and secured him—he had this bundle in his hands containing a writing desk, and several articles of children's clothing which were safe when I went to bed—he asked me if I had seen a boy in the house—he walked towards the door with me, took his coat off and tried to get away—I followed him into the street and gave him in custody—I found the breakfast room window open at the top, this blind torn down and the room in confusion.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Mr. Turner's servant—I shut up the house at 10 o'clock, the windows were shut, but I cannot say whether they were fastened—these pinafores, petticoats, and frocks were in the breakfast room when I went to bed, they were not in a bundle but on a box ready for the children in the morning.</p>

The prosecutor called me and I found the prisoner detained by him—I told him I should charge him with breaking into the house and stealing a bundle, he said "Very well"—I examined the house, the window was then closed; two blinds were torn down—I found on the prisoner a skeleton latch key, which had been filed, I have opened several doors with it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I saw a boy run out of the house and ran after him 200 yards, but could not catch him. I returned to the house, took the bundle, and made as much noise as I could on the stairs, which I should not do if I was going to commit a burglary. I had nothing to break in with, and I could not take the things and" the them up in the dark all in ten minutes after the bell rang. I am as innocent as a new born child.</p>

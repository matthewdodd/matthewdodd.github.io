            . I am shopman to Messrs. Sewell and Cross, of Compton-street, Soho. I know the prisoner, and saw her at our shop on Wednesday, the 11th of June, about nine o'clock in the evening; she came in and asked to look at some plaid ribbons - I showed her some; she bought two yards at 1s. 7d. a yard, and paid for it with a 5l. Bank of England note - it came to 3s. 2d.; I gave her the change - she gave me the name of Miss Keene, 19, Frith-street, Soho; she said it was for Miss Keene - I gave her four sovereigns and 16s. 10d., and made a bill out; I took the note to the desk and marked it - I afterwards delivered it to Avis on the Thursday morning; when we take money we always take it to a cashier at a desk in the shop - he gives change and stamps the bill; I marked the note myself.</p>

            . I am a constable of Marlborough-street.

            . I am servant to the prosecutor. On Wednesday evening, the 11th of June, at eleven o'clock, I found a paper parcel in the coal-cellar, containing two 5l. Bank notes, some sovereigns, and some silver; I cannot say how much there was - they were altogether, notes and all; I took it up, and gave it to master immediately - the coal-cellar is on the same floor as the kitchen; you go out of the kitchen into the cellar without going into the air - the cellar is under the street; the area is between the kitchen and the cellar; the area is not covered with a roof - there is some wood over it; I did not open the parcel - I saw master find the notes, some sovereigns, and some silver in it.</p>
               <p>Q. What made you take the parcel to your master? A. We were all in search of the money, and I could feel there was money in the paper.</p>

             re-examined. There is a door from my kitchen into the cellar without going into the area; the witness is mistaken - the kitchen is on the basement story; there is no way from the area to the cellar, it goes right under the stable-yard, not under the house: here is the paper the notes were found in - here are two 5l. notes, three sovereigns and a half, and 4s. in silver; there is written on the notes the name of the person I took them from - the note paid to Griffiths is the other one; it has the name of Clement's on it, which was on it before I lost it - both of those in the paper have the name of Lord Clifton's coachman on them; he had pointed it out to me when I took them of him - I took the note with Clement's on it of a person in Bond-street; I have made no mark of my own on them - I swear these are all my notes, and what I dropped from my lap in the bar; this is the ribbon I picked up as I followed her to the watch-house - the sweepings of the house are never put into the cellar; nothing is kept there but coals and fire-wood.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My master sits there every morning counting his money; I went into the bar and began to sweep; he put his money up - I found the saw-dust too clean to throw away; I gathered it up, and put it on the top of the kitchen stairs - I went and scoured the bar out, and swept the parlour; leaving the saw-dust where it was - we had breakfast - the work was all done; I was going down stairs, and seeing the saw-dust on the top of the stairs, I said, "William, what is the reason you have not cleaned this away?" he said, he was not going to clean away my dirt; I went and threw it behind the fire - William saw me do it; between ten and eleven o'clock my mistress ran down stairs, and said,"What have you done with the saw-dust?" I said, I had thrown it behind the fire, she said, "Oh! your master has been so careless, he has lost some money among it;" I said, I saw nothing but some pieces of newspaper - master sent for a constable and stripped me, but nothing was found - on Tuesday, master came down, and said,"I don't care who finds the money. I will give a sovereign to find it;" I said, I should be glad to find it without the sovereign, or anything - nothing more passed till Wednesday afternoon; I went up to my mistress, she gave me 6d. to fetch some sheep's-trotters - I went to the bar to master, and said, I was going out for mistress; he said, I could not go; I went up to mistress, and she said, I was a fool for telling him I was going; so I slipped out, and master fetched an officer and took me; a gentleman said, I had thrown a bit of ribbon in the street; but I declare I never saw the ribbon - it is said the bill was found on me, it might, or might not, I cannot say; next morning the shopman came to the office, and said, he did not know me - the officer said,"Is not this the woman who bought the ribbon last night?" he said, "I believe so;" the officer said, "You believe, say you are sure" - I am innocent, I never saw him before, and he did not know me.</p>
               <p>RICHARD GRIFFITHS re-examined. I am positive she is the woman who paid the note to me; I had not seen her before - I did not say I believed her to be the woman.</p>
               <p>One witness gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

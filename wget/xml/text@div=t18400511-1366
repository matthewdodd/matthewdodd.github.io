                  </hi>. I am housekeeper to Mr. Richard Eaton, a butcher, in Featherstone-street; Martin was his shopman. On the morn<lb></lb>ing of the 26th of April I concealed myself in the parlour, and could see into the shop—I saw three persons come in—one of them bought some pork of the prisoner—he went to the top of the cellar-stairs, and called to my daughter, "Mary Ann, are you there?"—she did not answer—he went and put the money on the desk—he then went to the door, beckoned, and Copeland came in—he gave her some beef and mutton—I ran into the shop and said, "Where is the money for the meat?"—he made no answer—I ran out and found Copeland next door—I brought her back, and met Mr. Eaton at the door—Martin then said, "There is the money," pointing to the desk—I said, "No, John, that is not for this; I have been watch<lb></lb>ing you ever since six o'clock this morning"—he then begged forgiveness, and said it was the first time—Copeland said then that she was his wife, but at the office she denied it.</p>

                  </hi>. I was called down about eight o'clock that morning—the witness brought Copeland into the shop, and said, "Here are the two pieces of meat that John gave this young woman"—Martin begged for mercy, and said it was the first time—Copeland followed him into the par<lb></lb>lour, and prayed very much for me to forgive him—she said he had a wife, and I understood she was his wife, but since that she denied it.</p>

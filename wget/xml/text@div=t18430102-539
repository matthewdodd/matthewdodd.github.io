                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. William Laff, a pawnbroker, in Crown-street, Finsbury. About seven o'clock, last night, I was minding the goods outside the door—a lady was by the side of me, and I saw the prisoner standing by her side—he looked about, and picked up this salt-cellar, which was exposed for sale, but I did not see him take it up—he was looking about, and asked me what I wanted for a Prayer-book that was there—he then went away about twenty yards—I missed the salt-seller—I went after him, and said, "What have you got there?"—he said, "I put the Prayer-book down"—I said, "I am not talking about that"—I felt something hard at his side—I brought him back—he got the salt-cellar out to throw it down, but I prevented it, and got him into the shop—I saw him take the salt-cellar out of his pocket, and put it into his trowsers, then put it into his coat, and when Mr. Laff went to the door to clear the mob the prisoner concealed the salt-cellar in his trowsers again—he was given into custody—this is the salt-cellar.</p>

               <p>Q. Did she say they were her own? - A. She did not say whether they were or not, but that he had taken the money from her; accordingly I took him to a little back room to search him, and he put his hand into his breeches pocket and pulled out eleven guineas, and sixpence in silver, and two-pence in halfpence; I took them both before the Magistrate, when she swore that the coachman had robbed her of 15 guineas; the prisoner was present at the time.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. When the girl made the charge against this hackney coachman, she was drunk? - A. Yes; and he both.</p>
               <p>Q. And when you went into the room, he, instead of avoiding the search, pulled out the money from his pocket? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. She did not attempt to say the money was her's, she could not swear to the money? - A. No, she did not.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Was her examination taken down in writing or not? - A. This was not before the Magistrate that I am talking about, but it was not in the presence of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. (To Longden.) Q. Did the prisoner give any account how he came by this money? - A. I did not hear it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear from any body that he gave an account that it was his master's money? - A. Yes; from the man's wife; she was examined before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner present? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was the examination of the wife taken in writing? - A. Yes.(The prisoner left his defence to his Counsel, and called seven witnesses, who gave him a good character.)</p>

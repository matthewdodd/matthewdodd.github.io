                  </hi> I am a shipping agent in Mark Lane—on Thursday, 20th June, I sent Stewart down to the docks to fetch some goods which had been cleared—it was too late, and the Customs would not pass them—I then sent him down to my house, 85, Southampton Row, Russell Square, with sixty-eight boxes of cigars, and one box which contained one bottle of wine—he left Mark Lane at half-past four—I got home at half-past five—I waited for him till nine o'clock and then gave information to the police—I have seen some pieces of wood since, they form part of one of the boxes—I know this bottle (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>. to be my property—Stewert came to my office at Mark Lane, six or seven days afterwards—he said he was very sorry for what he had done—the value of the property was 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Policeman</hi>. Stewart was taken into custody on 26th June—from information I received I went with another officer to Lower Thames Street, and saw the prisoner; I took him into custody, and charged him with stealing a case of cigars—he said he knew nothing about it—he said that Stewart had had his truck without his permission—I took him to the station and placed him at the side of Stewart—the inspector read over the charge, and asked if Stewart had anything to say in reference to the charge, and he said, "Yes; I will tell you the whole truth. Mr. Magnus employed me in the morning to get some cigars from the docks; I was afterwards instructed to take them to Southampton Row, and I went to Brennan and borrowed his truck, and told him what I was going to do. He said, 'I know where to get rid of those cigars.' I refused to have anything to do with it at the time, but I got the cigars from Mr. Magnus. When I was passing Mark Lane Brennan met me, and said, 'The old man,' meaning Mr. Magnus, 'has gone up Billiter Street.' I went, by the desire of Brennan, up Fenchurch Street and Bishopsgate Street to Artillery Lane, where I remained outside a public-house, and Brennan went away and came back with three other persons. They gave me something to drink at the public-house. After that Brennan took hold of the handles of the truck and we went together to Hoxton, the three other persons following on the other side of the way, where the cigars were taken to a small beer-house; they were left there. I came with Brennan back to 1, Hackney Road, where 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid for the cigars; I received 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I and Brennan went in company to East Smithfield, where I got drunk; and we separated, and did not meet again till the next day." Stewart said, "You know very well it is true what I say"—Brennan was then detained at the station, and I took Stewart with another officer to find out the beer-house at Hoxton, which is kept by a person of the name of Rothschild, where we made a search and found nearly the whole of the case broken up in pieces, and there were a lot of things which had reference to Rothschild, but not to the prisoner—Stewart has pointed out the public-house where the money was paid; it is 1 or 2, Hackney Road.</p>

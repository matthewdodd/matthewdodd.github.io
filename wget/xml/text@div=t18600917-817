                  </hi>. I am a waterman, and live at 18, Parson's-hill, Woolwich—I went to bed at 11 o'clock on the night of 24th August last—I sleep in the front parlour—the house stands back some twenty yards from the street, and there is no thoroughfare past that way at all—there are only four houses stand there, and there is a pathway up to those four houses—a person coming up the pathway can touch the window outside—I can't say that that window was fastened when I went to bed that night; it was shut—I took my trousers off, and put them on the sofa by the side of the window—I had in my pocket three sovereigns and a half, and five shillings, or fifteen shillings, I can't say positively which, in a brown leather bag, and two or three halfpence in another pocket—I got up about half-past 6 o'clock next morning—my trousers were in much about the same place as where I had left them—the first thing that attracted my attention, was, I could not find one of my stockings—it was iu the window, with a small portion of it jammed under the sash—I had left it on the bed—the window must have been moved during the night, or else the stocking could not have got there—a person could get into the room by opening the window—I examined the pockets of my trousers—I found nothing there; the bag and money were all gone—I was not disturbed at all in the night.</p>

               <p>that week—we were living together on the night of 24th August—he had not any money before that night—he had a shilling or a sixpence in the daytime; he had none in the evening—I remember going on that evening down one of the streets, down a footpath that leads to four houses—I saw the prisoner at a window of one of those houses—when the prisoner left me he told me he was going on business, and I walked up and down the road; and he came back with half a bag of money, and he said, "Come, Ellen, we will go down to the coffee-shop," and we did so, and'there he spent 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I do not know the name of the coffee-shop, or the name of the people there; I had never been there before—it was very nigh 4 o'clock in the morning when we got there—he did not show me any of the money he had with him—he had it in a leather bag—when he came from the house, he took the money out of the bag, and threw the bag away—he changed two sovereigns at the coffee-house, I believe—I did not have a farthing of the money.</p>

                  </hi>. I have made a plan of this house—I am the prose<lb></lb>cutor, and am a carpenter and joiner—I live at 6, Copperfield Road—on Saturday night, 3rd July, I left the house at past 10 o'clock, leaving a long in my room securely locked—I returned about 12.15—I found the box with open and the things thrown about the floor—I had left the door of the house latched, not locked—there are other lodgers—the lock was all right—there were two drawers in the box—the one I kept my money in was drawn out and thrown in the middle of the box empty—I had left in the drawer a watch, a puree, two five-shilling pieces, a shilling, an America coin, and a gold ring—I missed altogether 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and a watch—I found the purse in the fireplace next morning with the American coin in it—the prisoner used to lodge with me in the same room—I have gone to the her daily in his presence—I informed the police on the Sunday morning—I went with a detective to the Globe Inn, Mile End Road, and saw the prisoner there—the constable asked him if he had been in the Copperfield Road that evening—he said "No"—he said was he sure—the prisoner said "Oh yes, perfectly sure"—the constable said "If anybody said he saw you there would he be telling an untruth?"—the prisoner replied, "Yes, he would"—I saw a hole in the window large enough for a man's hand to be put in—I put my arm in—the window looked out into the back yard—the room is on the ground floor, looking on the back—beyond the yard is the canal, and the towing-path on the same side as the house—I took these two keys from the prisoner's box—one of them fits my box—this is the lock of my box (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this plan is correct, and is 1 1/2 inches to the foot.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant</hi>). I went to this house on Sunday evening, 4th July, about 7 p.m—I found the bottom pane of the back window broken—there was a hole large enough to admit a person's hand, and on the dressing-table inside the window was a cloth or cover, on which I found a footprint—there were no footmarks in the garden, the ground would be too hard, it is used as a playground for children—shortly after<lb></lb>wards I went with the prosecutor to the New Globe public-house, Mile End Road—after the prisoner saw him I called him on one side—I said to him "I am a police officer; were you in the Copperfield Road last night?"—he did "No"—I said "Are you sure?"—he said "Yes, I swear it"—I said "If any one should say you were there, would that be an untruth?"—he said "Yes"—I said "You will be charged with stealing a watch and 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver from No. 6, Copperfield Road, last evening"—he said "What time was it?"—I said "Between 9 and 11.30 p.m."—he said "I was in Mile End Road with a friend till 10.30, I then went into the New Globe public-house," meaning the same house he had been called from—I said "What compartment were you in?"—he said "The same compartment you have just called me out from"—I said "Were you with any one?"—he said "No, I went in and had a glass of ale and was talking with the manager till about 11.30"—I said "I believe you know me?"—he said "Yes, I how you very well"—I was in plain clothes—I said "I went there about 10.30 p.m., and remained about 20 minutes, and was talking to the manager in that compartment; I know you by sight, if you had been there I must have seen you"—I had not seen him there—I took him to the station—he made no reply when he was charged—the prosecutor gave me these two keys—I showed them to the prisoner—I asked him if they were his—he said "Yes"—one of them unlocks the prosecutor's lock, and the prosecu<lb></lb>tor's key unlocks the prisoner's lock—I was present when the prosecutor removed the lock from the box, and it has been in my possession ever since—a wall 5 feet high divides Mr. Jeffrey's house from Mr. Coulthard's—there is a lamp 18 yards from Jeffrey's house—it would be 80 yjirds from the front door to the back window by the towing-path, or 58 yards deducting the 18 yards from the door—the New Globe public-house is 4 minutes' walk.</p>

               <p>Your sister had been in service at that time? - Yes, she was a year at this Mrs. Tuthill's house; I expected she had more money than that by her considerably.</p>
               <p>Court to Snow. How much in fact do you know, of your own knowledge, the prisoner was ever possessed of? - She had forty pounds and upwards when she came away from Chatham, I know that myself, I sold all the things off myself, and I know she received the money; besides she received interest money at the Bank, and there is a house let for four guineas a year, and here is her wages still increasing, which she must in the whole have upwards of sixty pounds.</p>

               <p>How long was it after she received the forty pounds, that she came to London? - In the course of three or four days, she had then her own private property of twenty pounds, or upwards; she remained at this Mrs. Tuthill's house, where I was a lodger, I believe she lodged there near a twelvemonth; I do not suppose it cost her one shilling a week, I found her every thing myself, except bread and lodging, then you may judge; two shillings a week at most.</p>

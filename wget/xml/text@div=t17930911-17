            . The prisoner came home from the fair with a great parcel of toys, which I have in my hand here, the 5th of September, and coming home from the fair she came into landlord's house who is here; and she came down into the cellar, and she brought a great big doll down into the kitchen, that I suppose cost a shilling; she brought all these things in, and put them on the table; with that I went up stairs, and I saw all these lay on the table and I suspected her in a minute, that she had taken the money.</p>
               <p>Q. What money? - My money.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you lost any money? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How much? - Seven guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. When? - I did not see it since the 25th of last month, they were in a box under the prisoner's mother's bed, and the key was by my side; I put them in the box in a nutmeg-grater.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you miss them? - The very first day of this month I was at this box.</p>
               <p>Q. On your missing them what did you do? - I cried and roared when I missed it out of the box, and I suspected nobody but the mother; I suspected the mother all along till I saw the prisoner come home from the fair; and when I see these things on the table, I said she took the money; she said I told a lie, she did not take it, so with that I called the watchman, and I gave her up in charge to the watch, and he took her to the watch-house that night, and she owned it there before me, that she had taken the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you present? - I was.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the person's name she owned it to? - Rumley.</p>

               <p>I keep the house where this robbery is supposed to be committed, it is a publick lodging house, the mother of the prisoner at the bar rents an apartment of me, and the prosecutor is a kind of a lodger of her's. On Sunday week last there was a rumour that the prosecutor had lost seven guineas out of a box that was locked; I would wish to remark that at the same time there was another box of the prosecutor's,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110024"></xptr>on the premises which stood open always unlocked, in which was contained a number of articles of wearing apparel, besides a watch, every article of which was safe, not the least thing missing. Accordingly there was nobody could give an account how this money went, or when it went, nobody could be suspected, but the mother of the prisoner at the bar, because she had a key that opened the box; nothing more transpired than on the Thursday following I was standing at my door, and the child, the prisoner at the bar, came home from Bartholomew fair, she had got a parcel of toys in her pin before, she told me what she had got, I desired her to let me look at them, I said there was a great many more than she could come by as she ought; I immediately took her in doors, and began to take her to task, how she came by these toys, she first told me that she got them by a whirligig thing; while I was interrogating her about the toys the prosecutrix came up into my apartment, she cries directly that these toys were purchased with her money.</p>

               <p>Court. And you told the child she had better tell the whole? - Certainly. Then the prosecutrix seemed dissatisfied and she insisted on the prisoner being charged with the watch. And I must say that where promises failed there were threats used to get her to confess.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable on duty at the South London Palace not in the police force—at 12.45 on the morning of the 10th August I was leaving my duty—when I got down as far as Meadow Row I heard the scream of a woman—I proceeded to the spot, when I saw the prisoners and seven or eight more men quarrelling with two women—I cannot say whether there were any blows before, but there was no blow afterwards—I took no part in the disturbance—Brooks turned round to me and asked me for a match—I said I had not got one, when he asked me for a bit of tobacco—I said I had not got any, when he put his finger in my side <hi rend="italic">fob</hi> pocket and took out my tobacco and threw it behind him—I asked him what he had done that for, when he deliberately struck me on the nose with his fist, say<lb></lb>ing "That is what I done it for"—I fell on the ground—I then put up my arms to stop other violence, when I was struck from behind, by Moss, in the back of the neck—I know it was Moss, because I turned round at the time and saw no one but Moss behind me; he was drawing back his arm to hit me again, I got up and seized Brooks, when Moss caught hold of me and struck me again—I then kept hold of him and Brooks till a constable came up and I gave Brooks into custody—the other went away—I saw Moss again, I should think, about two minutes after in the Falmouth Road, when Brooks was in custody, as we were proceeding to the station—I then charged him with the assault and gave him into the custody of another constable—I had known both prisoners before, so I could not be mistaken.</p>

This occurred at 12.45 in the morning—there might have been thirty or forty persons at the corner of Meadow Row; there was a quarrel with some women, and a woman's scream attracted my attention—I did not return, I was going past, straight along New Kent Road—I dare say there were ten or twelve persons near at the time the request for tobacco was made, there might be a few more, no other person joined in applying for tobacco or spoke to me, nor I to them—I struck nobody whatever—I might have touched him in warding off the blow—I had given no provocation whatever—I have been in the Metropolitan Police—a complaint was made against me for assaulting a woman while in the police; I was not fined, but discharged—my super<lb></lb>intendent gave me a good character.</p>

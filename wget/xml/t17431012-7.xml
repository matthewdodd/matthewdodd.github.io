            . On the 28th of July last, our House was broke open by the taking up of a Plank which goes down into the Cellar; the Prisoner confessed it was between twelve and two; - I found it out by the Watchman who came and told me that the Cellar was broke open, and that they had taken the Prisoner with some of the Goods which are mentioned in the Indictment. I saw the Cellar fastened, as usual over Night; they got in by slipping back a Plank, so as to put in an Iron Crow to raise it up, - it was 12 o'Clock the Day following before I heard of it, and by the Description which the Prisoner gave the Watchmen of the Place, I thought it must be my House; there were five Pieces of Oznaburgh stole, and two Pieces of Fear Nothings; these three Pieces of Oznaburghs are my Goods, the rest I have not heard of.</p>

            . I am a Watchman in Aldgate Ward's; I thought I heard two Men quarrelling; they proved to be Jews, I thought their Language was quarelling. I saw the Prisoner with two of these, Pieces upon his Back in a Sack, and his own Garters tied round it; and the other walked Cheek by Jole along with him; He dropped the Goods, and endeavoured to get off, but I secured him, and brought him to the Watch-house; I run after the other but could not overtake him; says I, If he has got such a Load as this upon his Back he cannot run away with it, and at Surgeon

Yes, said I, Why then, said he, turn down by the End of the Street, and there's a Court with an Alehouse in it, there I got them; I went to Mr Beate's House in Talbot-Court, and told him he was robbed; robbed, said he, and laughed at me; but when he came to look into the Warehouse he found he had been robbed: The Prisoner owned that was the the third Time they had robbed that Gentleman in that Cellar; Mr Beate desired me to go into the Cellar; I went down and saw a great many Pieces of the same sort of Goods, and I told him what I took from the Prisoner were the same Sort, with the same Mark; and when he shewed us how they got in, we found it to be very easy to get in.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Harlington, Middlesex. On the 12th of April, about three o'clock in the afternoon, I was walking with my daughter Harriet Julia from Harlington to Hounslow along the road—I saw the two prisoners sitting on the edge of the path, with their feet over the dry ditch—I walked along the path, and when we got near them, the prisoner Wil<lb></lb>liam arose, and asked the other to come on—the other said he was not ready—he was in the act of lacing his boot, and a piece of bent wire or hook laid by him—William took the hook up, and said, "Come along"—Joseph said, "I am not ready to come"—I went on, and patted Joseph, sitting on the bank, and came up to William—he turned round, and asked me to give him some halfpence to help him on the road—I said I had none—he said, "I must have some money"—he then snatched at the child's bag, which hung on her arm, but did not get it from her—he got hold of it—I think it tightened on her arm—he laid hold of her arm, and drew her towards himself, from me, and she fell down—I struggled to save her, and in doing so was thrown down myself—I screamed "Murder," and then ran away with the child—I do not know whether any body followed me—the next thing I am conscious of was finding the child hang heavily on my arm—on turning round I observed the prisoners on the path—William had a atone in his hand, and said, "Murder? ay, I'll murder you;" (not meaning to murder me, but as a threat at my having called "Murder")—I do not know that they had thrown the stone—some carts were coming towards us, and they both, ran away—Joseph did nothing whatever to me—they ran away together—I had never seen them before.</p>

                  </hi>. I was going from Cranford to Hounslow, and saw Mrs. Edwards and her daughter walking—I saw the two prisoners on the side of the bank—I saw William get up a few minutes before Mrs. Ed<lb></lb>wards got to them, and walk on before her—he turned round at the time Mrs. Edwards overtook him, and said something to her—I do not know what—I saw him catch hold of the child's bag, but he could not get it off her arm—he caught hold of the child's shoulder, and threw her down—Mrs. Edwards fell on the top of her—she then called "Murder" several times in the middle of the road, and scrambled away—Joseph did not do any thing then—after Mrs. Edwards ran into the middle of the road, call<lb></lb>ing "Murder," William ran after her, and said, "Murder? I will murder you," and took up a stone and threw it, but it did not hit her—I saw Joseph get up, take up a stone, and have it in his hand—William put his arm up to prevent his throwing it, and he did not throw it—Joseph said, "If I had been in your place I would have made her halloo louder."</p>

               <p>I know the prisoner; I had no acquaintance with her before she assaulted me, which was on the 8th of May, about twelve at night: I went out for some liquor for a woman that was very ill; it was in <placeName id="t17900526-27-crimeloc133">High-street, Whitechapel</placeName>

               <p>Court. Did she take these things from you by force and violence? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was not I standing in a woman's room: the person that did rob her, is now in the gaol, come for another affair.</p>
               <p>Are you certain, with respect to the person of this woman? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You have only occasionally seen her; you have no acquaintance with her? - No; I am sure that is the body.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I was in bed: I heard the prosecutrix cry out murder; I looked out at window, and saw the prisoner run away; I had no acquaintance with her, only talking with her, and seeing her; she lived in the same street; I know her person; but I cannot swear she robbed her, because I was in my own room.</p>
               <p>Did you know from whom that cry of murder proceeded? - No, I do not; only I heard murder cried, and saw the prisoner run away; that is all I have to say.</p>
               <p>Was it a light night? - It was a moonlight night.</p>
               <p>Are you sure it was the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>In what situation was she? - When the watchman came up, she ran away.</p>
               <p>You are sure it was the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>JOHN - sworn.</p>

               <p>I apprehended the prisoner on the Monday morning; I searched the woman at her lodgings, and found nothing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I will take it as a great favour, if you will let me speak two words before I make my defence?</p>
               <p>Court. You are called upon to speak as many words as you think proper.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Sir, I take it as a great favour. That gentleman was not the officer that took me: and before Justice Staples, the prosecutrix said she lost a silver locket and a handkerchief; but never mentioned any thing else: and the person guilty of it, is now in the prison for another affair.</p>
               <p>How do you know who was guilty?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was standing in a room right facing her room; and the prosecutrix came and said, Bet King, my name-sake, had knocked her down.</p>
               <p>Jury. How do you live? - Please you, I am an misfortunate girl at present; I used to get my living in the street.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, this case depends intirely on the evidence of the witnesses on the part of the prosecutrix.</p>
               <p>Jury to Prosecutrix. Do you know the other person that the prisoner mentions, that she says robbed you? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. I do not know whether you know, gentlemen, that there is a reward of forty pounds in this case; the articles she has lost are very trifling; but it is for you to consider, whether you think that woman would be induced to give a false testimony, for the sake of the reward.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I wish you would seek into the prosecutrix's character; she is a misfortunate woman like myself.</p>
               <p>Court. You are at liberty to call any witnesses to your character; but you seem to have no character of your own.</p>

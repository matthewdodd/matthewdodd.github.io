               <p>Prisoner. I wish to know who it is indicts me, or where it is committed; I never was sworn till before this honourable court; as to the time I was examined I was overcome with confusion, not sensible of what I said; Sir Sampson Wright had two purses in his hand when he asked me those questions, I was much confused.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. She is indicted for what she swore in this court, and Mrs. Fellows prosecutes her.</p>
               <p>Court to Hughes. Where there two purses? - There were, one was a silk one.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was she sworn before the magistrate? - No, she was committed as a receiver.</p>
               <p>Court. When the two purses were taken from her, was the conversation about the leather purse or the silk purse? - Mrs. Fellows described she had been robbed of a leather purse.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Was the question before the magistrate confined to that leather purse described by Mrs. Fellows? - Quite so, the other purse was not at all the question.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness to her character.</p>

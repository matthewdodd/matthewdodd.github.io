                  </hi>I am a tailor, and live in Anchor-street, Haymarket. On the 19th of May I went to a public-house, and had some brandy and water—about one o'clock at night I was coming from Gloucester-place, New-road, and met the prisoner in Mary-le-bone-lane—I had six sove<lb></lb>reigns in my waistcoat-pocket, and a ₤10 note in my trowsers pocket—I missed the six sovereigns—I did not go any where with her to my know<lb></lb>ledge—I did not see her take the sovereigns—the policeman came up and found me with her down the mews—I had not given her any thing—I was drunk.</p>

No—the policeman saw me in the mews—I do not recollect going there—I did not go into any house I am certain—I had an umbrella—I do not recollect leaving it at any house, and the prisoner going and fetching it—I gave her no money—I might have gone to a house and not remembered it—she told me she had lived at so-and-so, and I thought she was a person I knew, and we got into conversation—I did not say I had got a keepsake for her, nor feel in my pocket for one—I do not recollect going to any public-house with her—before I met her I was drinking with a butler where I had been to receive some money—I parted with him in Gloucester-place, New-road, and after leaving him I went to a beer-house.</p>

                  </hi>I am a dyer. I was passing down Mary-le-bone-lane, and saw the prosecutor very drunk, with the prisoner on the opposite side of the way—bearing money jink, I thought it was not altogether right—the prisoner saw me, and threw down some money on the step of a door, and said, "That is all, there is four"—she took it up again, and she and the prosecutor went round the corner into the mews—I saw a policeman, and told him what I had seen—we went down to them—the policeman asked what they did there, and said to the prisoner, "What money is that you have in your hand? "—she handed out four sovereigns to the</p>

"—he felt in his pocket, and said, "Yes, I have"—the prisoner was reluc<lb></lb>tant to go to the station-house, and so was the prosecutor, and in moving her cloak off going to the station-house, another sovereign dropped out of her hand.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q</hi>. Are you quite sure it did not drop from him? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. Yes—he was not near her—they were not many yards apart—as they were going to the station-house one sovereign dropped from her hand, and on re<lb></lb>moving her further, another dropped, as she acknowledged herself—I should say it dropped from her—she said he had dropped them from his pocket, and she had picked up the four—I do not recollect her saying she picked up the other two in the mews—she might have said so at the station-house, but when in the mews she said she bad picked up the four she gave the policeman.</p>

                  </hi>I am a police-sergeant. In consequence of what Lee said to me I watched for about two minutes, and saw the prisoner feeling about the prosecutor's breeches pockets—I directly went down to them—she said, "It is all right, policeman, we are fellow-servants toge<lb></lb>ther, and live at 19, York place"—I said, "I suspect you have robbed him, what have you in your hand? "—she said, "Four sovereigns, " which I took out of her hand—I turned to the prosecutor, and asked if he had lost any thing? —he said, "No, it is all right, it is not my money"—I said, "Have you any money about you? "—he said, "Yes, 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd"—I said, "Feel in your pocket, and see if you have lost any thing"—he said, "Yes, I have not a farthing, " but in his pocket he found a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—the prisoner's hands were under her cloak—she refused to take her hands out—I was going to take her cloak off, and in moving she dropped a sovereign which I took up—she made a sort of stumble towards the prosecutor, and another sovereign dropped, which Lee picked up.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q</hi>. Did she stumble twice or once? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. I do not feel positive—she did not fall against the prosecutor, but stumbled towards him—I think she said she had picked up the two sovereigns in the mews—she did not tell me she had picked up the first four—I said, "What have you here? "—she said, "Four sovereigns" and gave them to me—the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note was in his trowsers pocket among some loose papers—he was not very drunk—he became collected, and was able to sign the charge.</p>

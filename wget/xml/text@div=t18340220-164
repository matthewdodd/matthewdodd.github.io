               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. The accounts were made up weekly, were they not? A. No; every night the money taken in the day-time was given to me - this is the daily account - the milk business is only a trifling concern, and I settled that account every night, and the carman's business was settled every morning - there was an account settled on the 6th of January, between me and the prisoner - that was not a weekly account, but a day's account - nothing was said about settling accounts on Tuesday, the 14th - he had accounted to me every night until the 14th, according to the book - there was no weekly account independent of the nightly account, settled up to the 14th - there was no weekly account at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember, on Wednesday, the 15th of January, the prisoner asking you for the book the accounts were made up in? A. Yes; I had left it at home, and given him another book instead - I have that here - the book he asked for was the book I have produced - and here is the one I gave him, when he asked for the other - both of them are in his handwriting - the book was given up to me every evening, and I took it home to enter the settlement - I had left it at home, and bought him a new one to go on with, and gave it him on the 15th - he never said he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183402200098"></xptr>would pay me the balance - we had no quarrel as to the mode the entries were made - he did not offer that anybody should make up the books, and say he would pay me - I did not take the key out of his desk - I was not at home when he called on the 17th.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. I see, by the book, the sums received are in small amounts of 2s. and 3s. each? A. Yes, here is what was paid for, and what was on credit - I never heard of any claim from him until I was before the Lord Mayor.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have been fifteen months in his employ, and every day I had property of his in East India Company warrants, to the amount of some thousand pounds- every thing about the premises was left entirely under my charge - if you look at the books, you will find I rendered him an account up to the 6th of January, of all bills owing from his customers, every day - I ought to have made out another account on the Wednesday following - it was a weekly account, and during that week I had received this money - he came to town on Wednesday - I said, "Sir, where is the book, that I may make up my accounts for the week?" - he said, "I shall not give it to you"- I said, "Why, how can I make up the accounts?" - he said, "Make them up as you please" - and about twelve o'clock he brought me the new book - on Thursday, I asked him again for the book - he said, "Go on with the new one, you shall not have the old one again" - I said, "I cannot tell what the people owe without the old book" - on Thursday night, he said, "What have you received from the milk people this week?" - I said, "15s. of Gilliman, but the account was 19s. 3d. - I have also received 2s. 9d. from Atkinson, and 2s. 8d. from Jewson" - I said, "As I am about leaving you on Friday, and there is some little dispute between us, if you will appoint any third person tomorrow (there was a trifle of difference between us about coach hire), I shall be glad to meet your friend, and settle every thing" - he said, "I will see you d - d first," and walked out - after he was gone home at night, I missed my key out of my desk, and could never hear about it - I went next morning, about a quarter to eight o'clock, and found his nephew in possession of my desk, which was open - he said his uncle had ordered I should not have the key, nor the books, any more, and he must do as he told him - I said, "Well, give me a piece of paper" - I wrote my direction on it and said, "When your uncle comes to town, I will settle everything with him, whenever he likes" - I have subpoened his nephew here.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's nephew - I am employed in my uncle's business - it was usual for the prisoner to make up the accounts every week for the milk business, either on Monday or Tuesday - to the best of my knowledge that account was made up weekly - I remember the prisoner coming to me on the 17th - I was at the desk at which he was usually seated - he said, "John, I know your orders, will you deliver the key to me?" - I said, "I will not" - he immediately took a piece of paper, and wrote his direction down, "George Thompson, No. 1, Portland-street, Stepney," and said, "Tell your uncle, if he wants me, that is where I am to be found" - I did not go to look for him there - I believe he has stated to me, that he was ready to settle his accounts with my uncle, but never to my uncle.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he offer to deliver his accounts, saying he was ready? A. Not to me, nor in my presence.</p>
               <p>MR. DOANE. Q. Did not he ask for the book? A. I never heard him ask for the book.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you know to what amount he received money for Mr. Punter, every week? A. I do not - I have seen him settling with the men.</p>
               <p>Mr. ADOLPHUS. Q. Is this the book in which he kept his accounts? A. Yes; these are daily accounts - when the man comes back, from taking out the milk, he settles with him - there are two columns, one for paid and the other for unpaid - Mr. Punter took it home to Clapham with him every night.</p>

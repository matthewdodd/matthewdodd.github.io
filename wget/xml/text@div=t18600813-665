                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman G</hi> 209). On Tuesday, 19th June, between 7 and 8 in the morning, I was in St. John-etreet-road—I saw a coal-van there, loaded with two tons of coal, twenty sacks—it stopped at the corner of Raw<lb></lb>storne-street, and another van came up to the side of it, containing coke—I there saw the prisoner Lamb throw five empty sacks out of the coke-van on the top of the coal-van, and then drive off—Charles Wells and Wilson were with the coal-van at that time—I followed them to 10 Myddleton-square, the residence of Mr. Millaret—on arriving there Wells knocked at the door or rang the bell; the door was answered, and he went in—I then saw the iron plate shoved up—five empty sacks were then placed down alongside the wheel of the coal<lb></lb>waggon, one over the other; the men then commenced shooting the coal out of the van—they shot down fifteen sacks; after that they delivered the coke—the coke-van went with the coal-van—they shot some of the coke I believe—the servant came out first and counted the coal-sacks—Wilson and Lamb counted up twent sacks, she looking on—they the unloaded the coke, counted the sacks, and then went in and had some beer, and then left the house—I told anther constable to watch the van, and not to lose sight of it—I went to the house, had some communication with Mr. Millaret, and then went after the van—I found it at the bottom of Rosoman-street—I afterwards went to David wells, in King-street, Compton-street—in going there I asked Wilson where he was going with the coals he had got in the</p>

                  </hi>. I am a watchmaker at 10, Myddleton-square—just before 19th June, Jones called on me—he said he had come from the Great Northern Coal Company, and he requested me to give him an order for some coals, and I did give him one for two tons of cdals, and one chaldron of coke—I asked him, "What Company, what agent?" and he said, "Mr. Clarke;"it was then I gave him the order—I think I had once before given an order to the Great Northern Coal Company—I believed the statement that Jones made to me; if I had not believed the statement, I should not have given the order—that was all that passed between us—on the 18th, the coals came and were not delivered, because the coke was not with them—on the morning of the 19th, I was told by the servant that the coals and coke had come—I was up stairs, I saw nothing of the delivery of the coals myself—after the delivery, I told Charles Wells I would settle his account; I gave him a cheque for it—the servant brought me the bill; this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I gave this cheque for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—this stamp, "Paid, W.

I am a coal inspector in the employ of the Great Northern Railway Company—I understand the different qualities of coal and their prices—I went to Mr. Millaret's, 10, Myddleton-square, and examined some coal there—they were what is termed Elseca No. 2—the price of the best Wallsend at that time was 21<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per ton to dealers—I afterwards went to Mrs. Gompertz, in Keppel-street, and examined some coal there; it was Elseca No. 2; that is a refuse coal which is generally used for steam engines, furnaces, or anything of that description—it requires a very great blast to make it burn—Silkstone coal at that time was, I believe, about 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per ton to dealers—the paper I am referring to is the report I made upon examining the coals—I also went to Mr. Kirk, 2, Bretts-buildings, Walworth-road—(<hi rend="italic">The Court intimated that there was no evidence to go to the Jury upon this charge, or upon those referring to the case of Sowton, Groves, or Anderson.</hi>)</p>

On the 7th of December about ten o'clock in the morning the two women came into my shop to purchase cotton for a gown, eleven shillings and six pence was the purchase, they left six shillings and the parcel and were to call again. they returned within the hour, paid the rest of that money and took that parcel; they bought some other things and paid for them, bought another gown which they had put by paying part of the money as before. I waited on them at the upper end of the shop, a young man at the door saw them coming down the shop and were going out, Carney wore a long cloak and the wind parted it in the front as she came down the shop, the young man came to me and gave me information, I followed Carney and found two pieces of print upon her, I took one piece from under her right arm and the other piece was falling, the young man catched it before it reached the ground; I detained them both and sent for a constable.</p>

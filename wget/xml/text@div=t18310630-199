            . I am the prosecutor's son; I had the care of his till and the bar before he got up. The prisoner first came to me about three months after last Easter twelve months; he said he knew all the transaction between me and Stapleton, and if I did not give him money, as well as I had Stapleton, he would tell my father that I had robbed him - the first time I saw Stapleton he came,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183106300104"></xptr>and said he was in great distress: I lent him 1s.; he said he would pay me again, and told me not to tell my father of it; he came the next morning, and said if I did not let him have another 1s. he would tell my father what I had done; I gave him another 1s. - he came the following morning, and said if I did not give him half a crown he would tell my father; he continued to come for about three months; sometimes every morning in the week, and sometimes he would omit a day or two - the smallest sum he ever had was 1s.; the prisoner afterwards came, and had money in the same way; I remember giving him a sovereign, about the 27th of February; he said if I did not give it him he would tell my father I had robbed him; I got that sovereign from the cash-box, when I went with the key to get change - I gave the sovereign to the prisoner in Princes-street; I did not tell him where I got it - he had come in the early part of the morning to my father's house, and asked for it; I took it out of the cash-box, about nine o'clock - I met him about six in the evening, and gave it him, about three hundred yards from my father's; I was to meet him on the pier-head, but as I was going on an errand I met him in Princes-street; he asked if I had got it - I told our pot-boy, who was with me, to step aside, and I gave the prisoner the sovereign; the potboy was not near enough to see what passed - there was a boy named Lewis at the end of the street, right opposite to us; the prisoner always knew where I got the money from.</p>

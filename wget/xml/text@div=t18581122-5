                  </hi>. I am the wife of Edward Barnes, a solicitor, in Essex-street, Strand. On 4th November, about half-past 4 o'clock, I was passing through Endell-street—when I got to the corner of Wilson-street, the prisoner <hi rend="italic">dodged</hi> in front of me—there were three others with him—I jumped on one side to get out of his way, and he pushed his head into my chest, and pushed me with great violence—I staggered back and gasped for breath—he then made a pull at my bag; he did not succeed in getting it, because I had the chain twice round my arm—I then distinctly heard a <hi rend="italic">click click</hi>, and he ran off with my bag—the other three made a way for him to pass the corner—I succeeded in passing through them, and pursued him, running in the road so as not to lose sight of him; but I lost sight of him in Charles-street—the other three persons were round him when he was</p>

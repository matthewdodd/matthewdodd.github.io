On the 12th of August, I went to bed about eleven o'clock at night - I was not the last person up, and do not know whether the fastenings were secure. I heard a noise below inside the house, about one o'clock, but thinking the servants had got up to wash, it did not alarm me. Between four and five o'clock the watchman alarmed us, and said the back garden gate had been forced. I found it so - the thieves had then got down the area, and cut a pannel out of the kitchen door, at the side of the house, and entered. The wine cellar door was forced, and a bottle of brandy, and half of another bottle drank, and some cold duck and lamb eaten. There must have been more than one man. There is a door on the kitchen stairs, which kept them from the upper part of the house. The pannel of that door was partly cut out. I missed the property stated in the indictment, which has never been found. I saw the prisoner in custody in about a fortnight.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Hayman. We were to wash on this morning. I went to bed after eleven o'clock, and am quite sure the house was fastened then. I left nobody below. The watchman alarmed us a little before five o'clock; it was daylight then. I heard no noise in the street. I missed four tea and one dessert spoon from the kitchen closet, which was not locked. I also missed three breakfast and a dinner cloth from the kitchen, three table napkins, and a basket containing blue china. The cellar door was forced open, which was locked overnight. The shutter of the kitchen door was completely shattered, and the fastenings undone. The stair-case door was cut, but not cut out. The provisions were taken from the pantry - some eaten, and the rest left in the kitchen. They eat half a duck, part of a leg of lamb, and drank some liquor; they must have been some time in the house.</p>

            . I am a sail-cloth weaver, and work for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182209110093"></xptr>Mr. Scott. I was going to work about half-past five o'clock on the morning of the robbery, and saw the prisoner bring a basket with blue china in it across a boat-builder's-yard, about 300 yards from Hayman's house. He put the basket down by the gate, while I passed him; another young man was with him, and both appeared intoxicated. I passed by and stood at a distance. The other man came up to me and asked who I was looking at? I said, Not at him; he was a young man - he went back to the prisoner. They stood wrangling about a flower which the prisoner had in his mouth. I am quite certain of him. I passed them again - they said nothing then. I told a person who had been a constable of my suspicions; he went to the prisoner, who then put the basket on the top of the rails. I do not know what passed between them; but after that, the prisoner and his companion followed me, and threatened how they would illuse me, and asked if I thought they were thieves. I said I did not know, and they left me. I saw the prisoner in custody about seven weeks after, and am positive he is the same man.</p>

            . I am a shipwright; I have been a constable. About half-past five o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner with another man - Watts told me they had a basket, and he suspected them. I went up to them, and asked if the basket was theirs; one of them asked what was that to me. I looked at it, and saw Mr. Hayman's name on it, on a label, and in it was some blue ware; they said they were employed to take the blue ware somewhere; and I did not trouble them further; they were both in liquor; they followed us a little distance, and threatened to beat Watts, and used ill language to him. I was fetched to the watch-house last Monday week, and saw the prisoner, and am certain of him; he was a stranger.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 17th of September, about five o'clock in the morning, I took the prisoner on this charge; he had nothing about him. I told him the charge; he denied it. I put him into a room among fourteen men; I took Watts in, and desired him to look round, and he singled the prisoner out. I had said nothing to him. Adams saw him, and said he was like the man, but could not be positive to him; it was not quite light at that time; but when he saw him in the office, he spoke positive to him.</p>

               <p>MR. HAYMAN. The basket was full of crockery, and had my name on a paper sewed on it - it had brought some preserves from Devonshire.</p>

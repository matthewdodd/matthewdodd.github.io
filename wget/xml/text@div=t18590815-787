On the morning of 30th June I was on duty at the back of Park-place, Camberwell, at a little after three o'clock—I saw the door of the prosecutor's house open, and the prisoners came out and threw away this hammer—I caught hold of Bland and held him; the other two slipped away and escaped across the fields—I had an opportunity of noticing Bland's countenance and the other two also—Bland broke from me; but Phillips stopped him before I lost sight of him—the other two got out of my sight; I saw them again next day—I found this hammer—I examined the premises; I picked up this syringe just inside the garden gate—a pane of glass had been broken in the conservatory, and the door was open—by breaking the glass, persons could put in their hand and open the door—you can get from the house to the conservatory without going into the air—the door comes out of the passage into the conservatory.</p>

On the morning of 30th June I was coming out of Grove-park, Camberwell-grove, about half-past three o'clock—I saw Howard and Fletcher pass me, walking very fast—I heard some one cry, "Stop thief!"—I turned, but I lost sight of the prisoners; I then saw Bland running up Camberwell-grove—he went down a turning—I followed him, and said, "You had better come out, you can't get away"—he said, "I mean to have a try for it"—I ran into the shrubs, threw him on his back, and my brother officer came and took him—I went back to the Mews, into which the back gate opens—I saw my brother-constable pick up this hammer, and he said, "I saw three of them come out of the gate"—Bland said, "You did not see me come out; I was watching"—I picked up this handkerchief in the Mews, and I said to Bland, "Is this yours?—he said, "Yes," and he took it and put it on—I got on the top of the wall of No. 6 and found these shears on the wall—the lock of the garden-gate had been broken—I went in and found the glass of the conservatory had been broken, and the door was open—I saw Fletcher and Howard taken, and I identified them as the persons I had seen running in the morning—I am quite sure of it—Howard was brought out of a public-house by Sergeant Bell; and-Fletcher was standing in company with three or four others.</p>

I am servant to Mr. William Jones, No. 6, Park-place, Camberwell-grove—on the morning of 30th June I was roused by the police at a little before 4 o'clock—I went down stairs—I found a pane of glass had been broken in the conservatory in the night-time—if you wanted to get into the conservatory from the house you could do so without going out of doors—there are two doors leading from the hall to it—one is a glass door, the other wood—the glass in the conservatory was whole in the evening when I went to bed—any one by breaking the glass that I found broken could open the outer door and get into the conservatory—you could get into that from the outside without going into the house—this syringe and these shears are my master's property—they were in the conservatory the night before; the tools are kept there—I saw these when I fastened the place up—this syringe was hanging by a piece of string.</p>

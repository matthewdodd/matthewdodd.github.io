            , on the 21st of August, at about ten o'clock in the forenoon. Mrs. Field was just coming out at the door. I went in and saw Mr. Field sitting in a chair at the bottom of the stairs, near the window in the lower parlour; he seemed to look earnestly at me, seeing me a stranger. I said, old acquaintance, how do you do? He fell back in his chair, and made no answer. I said I had an information, that some coining implements, were concealed in that house. He said, the Lord have mercy upon me, I am a dead man! I said, where is the money is it above stairs or below; and your tools? He made no answer, but his wife endeavoured to get up stairs. I prevented her, and passed just above her. I found these bags lying upon the stairs.</p>
               <p>Were they on the steps of the stairs? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Perfectly open? - Yes; the prisoner could not fit where he did without seeing them. These two bags (producing them) contain finished shillings. I counted them, but I do not exactly recollect the number; there is about 5 l worth, I believe, in one bag, and about 6 l. in the other.</p>
               <p>Where did you proceed to search afterwards? - This bag (producing it) I found likewise; these are unfinished. I believe there are 500 shillings, and more. Here are some bags of jet and of silver. I believe these were in the large bag on the stairs; I do not remember that they were separate, and here are the patterns (producing them.)</p>
               <p>Where was it you proceeded to from the stair-case? - I went up the two pair of stairs; there I found two pair of flasks.</p>
               <p>In what room? - In the fore room; there are no back rooms. I found two pair of flasks, about five or six and forty crucibles; a trough of sand for the casting; a lathe; three dutch stoves; some sieves; two bottles of aqua fortis; files and metal, and copper. These two crucibles were in the fire-place; there is a shilling in one, and some metal in the other.</p>
               <p>Was the fire alight? - No.</p>
               <p>This lathe was fixed, I believe? - Yes; it was fixed upon two blocks, with just space enough for a shilling. This paper (producing it) lay under to catch the filings. This file lay by it; it has the appearance of having been used. The filings are base metal, a mixture of copper and silver. There was a large quantity of scowering-paper lying on the bench in the room, and this one shilling, which is not finished; it has been edged but not rubbed with the scowering-paper sufficiently. There were three or four large pans of pickling for the finishing of money.</p>
               <p>What is that pickling? - Aquafortis and water; here is some that has been used, and some that has not been used.</p>
               <p>Who was the person that laid hold of Field to secure him? - He was very quiet, and did not need any body to lay hold of him at first. We desired M'Donald to take care of the prisoner below, while Hyde and I went up stairs. While we were up stairs we heard a noise below. I came down and saw Field and M'Donald lying on the ground in the yard.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177909150046"></xptr>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>If I am rightly informed there are but three rooms in the house? - I believe there are but three and the cellar.</p>
               <p>The ground-floor where the prisoner was, another room, and the two-pair-of-stairs? - Yes; the two-pair-of-stairs was hung round with blankets and ruggs, that a hole should not be made to look through.</p>
               <p>He was at breakfast, I believe? - No; he was sitting by the stairs.</p>
               <p>There were preparations for breakfast? - I heard that his wife was going out for the rolls for breakfast.</p>
               <p>How near was he to the door of the house? - The stairs is a very little way from the door, and he sat by the bannisters, with his elbow on the bannister; the steps were on his left hand, and he was leaning on his left elbow.</p>
               <p>The steps of the stairs were on the same side he was leaning on? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The things found were all in the highest room, except the bags on the stairs? - Yes.</p>
               <p>All you have yet told us of were found in the two-pair-of-stairs? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That is the highest room in the house? - Yes. This pot (producing a bell-metal pot, with brick-bats and charcoal in it) was standing on a chair in Mr. Field's bed-room, and these tongs across it.</p>
               <p>That pot is for coining I suppose? - It might be used for it.</p>
               <p>It may be used to make broth, I believe? - Yes; but they do not make broth of brick-bats and charcoal, I believe. There is another bag that was found in the two-pair-of-stairs room.</p>

               <p>When you came there where did you see the prisoner? - He was sitting at the window just by the stairs; he might lay his hand on the stairs where he sat. The breakfast things were set. I took charge of him while the others went up stairs. He and his wife offered me 50 l. or 60 l. to let him go. While his wife was gone to get some money he jumped out of the window, and I jumped out after him; she laid hold of my coat, and tore the flap. We were on the ground. I called for Jack and the rest. He said often, before he went out of the window, and afterwards, Lord have mercy upon me, I am a dead man. When they were up stairs he begged me to let him go several times. The room where he worked was all hung with rugs and clothes.</p>

When we came there I staid in the coach with that person, and Dixon brought the prisoner to me in the coach. We did not meddle with any thing till we came back. On the side of the room where there were any houses there were rugs hung that nobody might bore holes; there was no occasion to hang them on the other side, because there were no houses.</p>

             was in the premisses before.</p>
               <p>How long before? - I believe five or six years; I understood him to be a jeweller.</p>
               <p>Was you there when they found the things in the house? - I was in the yard, and being landlord, they asked me to go in.</p>
               <p>Did you see these things in the house? - I saw things of the same kind; I cannot swear they are the same.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177909150047"></xptr>- NEWTON sworn.</p>
               <p>You were, I think apprehended yourself upon the 21st of August by some officers, as being suspected of coining or practices of that sort? - I was.</p>
               <p>Have you had any dealings or transactions with the prisoner, of what nature, and when? - Yes; it may be six months or more ago, I cannot speak exactly to the time; there were some shillings and sixpences found in my house which I believe to have been part his, and part we had taken which we put by.</p>
               <p>How did you come by those shillings and sixpences? - Mr. Field brought about three pounds worth to me; I returned most of them back again, because they were so bad I did not know what to do with them.</p>
               <p>What did he bring them to you for? - To pay away I suppose.</p>
               <p>I ask you for what purpose he brought them to you? - To pay away, to sell them to me.</p>
               <p>Had you any other dealing with him besides that? - Yes, I believe the farthings produced to day I had of his wife.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>You received the money from him about six months ago? - That or more, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Whether they were good or bad you did not know? - I did not know much about it then.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the crown. Do not you know whether those shillings he brought you were counterfeit or good ones? - I did not know at that time; I imagined them not to be good.</p>
               <p>You returned some back that were not good? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner. Have you received three pounds worth of silver from any man in which there has not been a great many bad ones? - I have received money from several people, and I dare say eight or ten or more bad.</p>
               <p>How did the prisoner bring them to you? - I understood I was to have twenty-seven or twenty-eight shillings for a guinea.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Crown. Do not say what you understood, but what he said to you? - He said if I had twenty-six shillings for a guinea it would be so much profit; but I did not like such sort of money.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner. What sort of money do you not like? - Not bad; I returned it back.</p>
               <p>How much? - Not all, I had a guinea's worth I think.</p>
               <p>How much is it that you call a guinea's worth? - Twenty-six shillings for a guinea.</p>
               <p>Do you usually get twenty-six shillings for a guinea? - Never but that one time.</p>
               <p>Just now you said some of the money they found in your custody you believed to be Mr. Field's? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Are you not sure of it? - I am certain some of it was for it never was paid away.</p>
               <p>So he put off twenty-six or twenty-seven bad shillings upon you once? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you know them to be bad at that time? - No, not at first; I knew it afterwards.</p>
               <p>At the time you took them did you know them to be bad? - They must be bad because I did not like them then.</p>
               <p>But you would have liked them if they had been good? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then you would have given a guinea for twenty-six shillings if they had been good; and did you understand that they were good when you gave a guinea for twenty-six? - No, I believed them to be bad and told him so at the time.</p>
               <p>And you agreed to have twenty-six for a guinea? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And you took them knowing them to be bad? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And returned them all but a guinea's worth? - Yes.</p>
               <p>But those you passed away? - My wife I believe did.</p>
               <p>So you intended to put them off for good? - I kept them by me.</p>
               <p>So you gave a guinea for twenty-six shillings in order to keep them as a matter of curiosity? - They laid by.</p>
               <p>But what did you intend to do at the time? - If nobody would take them I could not pay them away.</p>
               <p>But did not you intend it? - I had no intention to intend it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177909150048"></xptr>Then you intended not to pass them? - No they laid by.</p>
               <p>Do not tell me what happened afterwards. Now Mr. Newton you look like an exceeding honest man; I never saw a better looking man in my life, now did you when you took them mean to pass them as good money or to keep them? - I might have passed them.</p>
               <p>But you altered your opinion afterwards? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then your design at that time was to be a very great rogue? - That might be.</p>
               <p>But did you mean to be a rogue? - I did not pass them after I found them so bad.</p>
               <p>But did you mean to be a rogue, and to cheat the world, or what, when you took them? - I do not know what you mean by that.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you mean to pass the money? - I did not know any other but that they were good to pass.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner. Then that is an answer. You swear upon your oath that when you took them you did not apprehend they were bad shillings? - I do not say so, I knew they must be bad.</p>
               <p>Then when you gave the guinea for twenty-six shillings worth you knew them to be bad; now did you mean to pass them or not? - Yes, if they could have gone.</p>
               <p>You meant to cheat any body that would be cheated? - Yes, If they could have been passed.</p>
               <p>Then you meant to be a very great rogue, but could not accomplish it by their being too flagrant? - I do not know what you mean.</p>
               <p>I will tell you what I call a great rogue; a man that takes bad money, knowing it to be bad, intending to pass it, to cheat the world. Now is that your case? - I cannot say what you please to call me; I wish there were nobody greater rogues in that than me. If Mr. Field had not brought them to my house I should not have gone to his house for them.</p>

               <p>Do you know one Turner? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you know Mr. Field's house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who lived in that house? - I do not knew.</p>
               <p>Any servant? - I do not know. I never was in any part of the house but the lower apartment.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Crown. Did you give him the guinea at that time or not? - I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Mr. FLETCHER sworn.</p>
               <p>I am one of the moniers of the Mint.</p>
               <p>Is that silver good or counterfeit? - Some of these appear bad, and others are doubtful.</p>
               <p>(Several were cut that were in the bag. Then Mr. Fletcher said they were all bad.)</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>My lord and you gentlemen of the Jury, I am perfectly innocent as to the knowledge of any money being coined in my house, or any implements for that purpose being there in. It is now near six months ago since I entered the garret, having no use for it whatever, but to place lumber therein, and since which period it has been occupied by a person who calls himself by the name of Turner, and who had hired that room of me to make buckles there. The morning of the search in my house, the said Mr. Turner came in in a great hurry about eight o'clock, and left something in bags on the stairs and ran out again almost instantly with a large bundle, declaring he should soon return again, but unfortunately for me it is not in my power to find out or learn where he can be met with, nor do I know the contents of the said bags, it was then I began to fear my own person was in danger from such a discovery, and I have a witness in court to prove what I have above set forth.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>- PHILLIPS sworn.</p>
               <p>Are you acquainted with Mr. Field? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You know his house well? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How many rooms does his house consist of? - A room on the ground floor, a chamber and a garret, and there is a cellar.</p>
               <p>What does he do with the garret? - I do not know that he made any use of it.</p>
               <p>Did you ever know any body a lodger there, or whether it was let out to any body? - I will give you to understand as<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177909150049"></xptr> far as I can recollect of the matter; I was at Mr. Field's, the prisoner's house, about six months ago; a man came there and said he had heard there was an apartment to let.</p>
               <p>A man you do not know the name of I presume? - He said his name was Turner. The prisoner asked him what business he was? he said a buckle-maker.</p>
               <p>Then he was a stranger to him as you understood at that time? - He asked who recommended him; he mentioned some name which I forget.</p>
               <p>Do you know what price was agreed to be paid for the lodging? - They went both up stairs, and were there some time; I cannot say as to that.</p>
               <p>Then all you know is that he came there to ask whether any room was to be let; he said his name was Turner; being asked his business, he said a buckle-maker; and being asked who recommended him, he mentioned a name you do not recollect; and then they went up stairs? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What passed there you do not know? - No.</p>
               <p>You did not hear any bargain made? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you frequently go to Mr. Field's and see him and his wife? - I have been there three or four times a week.</p>
               <p>You was very intimate with him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see that Turner in the house coming up or down stairs? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long did he continue there? - I had seen him within a few days of the prisoner, Mr. Field, being taken into custody.</p>
               <p>What are you? - A widow.</p>
               <p>Where do you live? - In St. John's-square, Clerkenwell.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Do you follow any business? - My husband was a gilder, he is dead; since his death I have employed journeymen to carry on the business.</p>
               <p>In what street? - Facing the printing-office, St. John's square.</p>
               <p>Have you the whole house to yourself? - Yes, but I let out part of it.</p>
               <p>What is the number of your house? - No. 5.</p>
               <p>In St. John's-square? - Facing the printing office; there is a passage that goes up from St. John's square into Red Lion-street.</p>
               <p>In that passage is it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How many journeymen may you employ? - Two generally; I have but one at this time, because business is rather slack.</p>
               <p>You was very intimate with Field and his wife? - Yes.</p>
               <p>So intimate as for your visits to lead you there three or four times a week? - I did not go at any set time; my business led me that way; I have customers in Moorfields, and I made it my business to call and ask them how they did when I went that way.</p>
               <p>What sort of a man was this Turner? - A tall thin man.</p>
               <p>Did he wear his own hair? - Yes, black curled hair, a little bald upon the top of his head.</p>
               <p>Mr. Field did not know him at all? - I do not know that he did.</p>
               <p>From what passed it is clear he did not, for he did not know his name nor who had sent him there? - I do not know that he did.</p>
               <p>Did he ask him if he would let him a lodging? - If he would let him a place to work in.</p>
               <p>Mr. Field has but one bed in his house has he? - There is one bedchamber, but there are two beds in it.</p>
               <p>Only one sleeping room in the house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>All that this man wanted was a room to work in, that was a singular thing; did he assign a reason for wanting a room to work in; had he a number of journeymen or why did he not work in his own room; he must lodge somewhere? - I did not hear any reason.</p>
               <p>Did Mr. Field say he would let him have this room at once without saying he would enquire of the gentleman who recommended him? - They went up stairs; I cannot say.</p>

               <p>What is the trade of the prisoner? - My knowledge of him originated in his applying to me for foil, which is a branch of my business and I have served him ever since I first knew him.</p>

               <p>That is an ingenious business and known to but few? - But few practice it.</p>

               <p>That is an art that requires some ingenuity? - An art that is kept mostly among ourselves.</p>
               <p>It is not by any means generally known? - No; we are extremely careful of it.</p>
               <p>Do you suffer any body to see you when at work? - No, we are very careful of that.</p>

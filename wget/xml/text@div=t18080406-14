Briggs one of my comrades had given me his money to take care of; when I came into the bar White the other comrade gave me his money; Butler and Moore<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180804060011"></xptr>were coming in at the time I was tying White's money in the handkerchief; they never passed no farther than me; as I was standing at the bar I put the handkerchief into my right hand pocket; I was talking to the landlord of the house. Butler told me to hold my tongue; Moore was standing close behind me. I kept on talking to the landlady for a minute or two; they had quitted the house. I put my hand into my pocket and immediately missed the handkerchief; just afterwards a woman of the name of Chapman told me that they were the men that picked my pocket. We went down to Butler's house, he was not at home all night.</p>
               <p>Q. How much was the money. - A. Thirty one pounds eleven shillings and sixpence; I have never recovered one halfpenny of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he is the man. - A. Yes, he is the man that stood close behind me, and Butler was of the side of me.</p>

            . Q. You are a soldier in the same regiment. - A. Yes; I gave Gadsby a ten pound note and two one pound notes, I gave it him before the landlady of the Thatched House, Field lane, he tied it up in a pocket handkerchief, along with the other young man's money that he had; he put it into his right hand breeches pocket just before we left the house; we were going to have a glass of something at the bar, Moore and Butler came round Gadsby; Mrs. Murphy said, young man, you had better take care of your property, you do not know who you have got about you; he held it up in his hand and shook it before that; while we were taking a glass of liquor a young woman came out of the house to talk to one of our comrades, Gadsby desired her to go about her business; Butler and Moore were behind Gadsby, and Butler desired Gadsby not to make a noise; we were going to leave the house, the landlady said we will accommodate you with another room; we were going up stairs to another room to have a pot or two of ale, Gadsby put his hand into his pocket and missed his money.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any body else been near Gadsby before. A. No, they could not get near him, because one stood of one side of Gadsby and the other of the other side. I am certain he is the man.</p>

            . I am an officer of Hatton Garden office. On the night of the robbery I was in company with Stanton and the beadle of St. Andrew's; we called in at the Black Dog, St. Giles's, we saw Butler and two other men drinking; I think it was rum and water; I cannot say whether one of the other men was the prisoner or not, they were strangers to me. Not knowing of the robbery I did not take so much notice as otherwise I should have done. After Cartwright apprehended the prisoner I received him; he said he was innocent of the charge. I told him it was very well if he was innocent; he said they can do nothing with me, they can only give me a seven pennyworth.</p>

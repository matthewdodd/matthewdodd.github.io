The Prisoner desiring he might be ask'd if they did not drink together in the Cellar, the Prosecutor answer'd, No, she would fetch no Drink, saying, she did not care to be seen by the Publicans; that she was all for dry Money, and she, and None but she, had his Fifty Pounds, for save only him and her, there were neither Man, Woman, nor Child, nor Dog nor Cat in the Cellar.</p>

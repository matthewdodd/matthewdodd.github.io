            , the deceased, about some wood.</p>

               <p>Q.Were the workmen allowed the waste wood and chips, or were they allowed beer in the room of it? - A. Lyne charged Houghton with giving the old wood away; and he said, as he had given away the wood he would take off his allowance of the beer; Houghton denied that he had given any away; Lyne said, he would knock his d-d old head off.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Houghton an old man? - A. Fifty-five years of age, and rather hard of hearing; Houghton said, then let it be now; Lyne stripped off his coat immediately, and his hat, and they fell to blows immediately; it did not, altogether, last above two minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any particular effect from any particular blow? - A. I observed one particular blow, which did not seem to affect the man much, it made him stagger; Lyne was first down; Lyne said, do not strike me when I am down; Houghton answered, I will not; Lyne then got up again, and they had another round; Lyne was driven into a corner, in a leaning position, that he could not well move, rather inclining to fall; he said, Bruce, I have got the rheumatism, I cannot strike; Bruce went to part them, and said, come, come, here is enough of this, put on your coat again; they parted, and the man went to the bench, and statted the heads of some nails.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they part friendly then? - A. Yes, quite so; I thought the deceased had the best of it; he took the nails and went into the next house, where his work lay; about five or six minutes after that, it could not exceed ten minutes, some person came to me, and said, your partner is very ill; I went to him, and spoke to him, but he made no answer, he seemed to be quite ill; and I took him to St. Bartholomew's Hospital.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he live after that? - A. About a quarter of an hour.</p>

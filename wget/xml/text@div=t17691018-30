I was returning on the 18th of last month from town on foot. Shoreditch clock struck eight as I past it. I left the road facing the Nag's Head, and went over the field. The moon shone that night exceeding bright. I was upon a full run, when I was met by the prisoner in <placeName id="t17691018-30-crimeloc171">London-fields</placeName>

There was another man in company with him; he had a piece of black silk, or crape, over his face. I delivered to the prisoner eighteen-pence. I told him I was but a servant, and had not a great deal of money. The other man discovered my watch; he said I had a watch. The prisoner took it out of my pocket. I held up my waistcoat, to give him room to get it out, as there was a button to my breeches. He said if I made any resistance, he would blow my brains out. He took also a five-and-three-penny piece from me. When they left me, I believe I gave notice to about a dozen of the patrol upon the road of them. I got home about nine o'clock. I went next day to Sir

               <p>Court. He did not demand your money? - He did not, all that he said, was, make haste; I gave him half a guinea, a new shilling and a six-pence; he took it; it was quite day light; I saw no arms of any sort.</p>

               <p>Did Poynton cover his face? - I did not observe that he did; I saw them the same evening, about a quarter of an hour after, in Kentish-town, where they were taken; a gentleman came up the road, in a one horse chaise; and Miss Atkinson said, them men have robbed us; I was so frightened I could not speak; the gentleman called out, stop thief; I went on to Kentish-town.</p>

               <p>Did you see the men leave the women? - I saw them get over the rails, I suppose, as soon as they saw me; and they ran all across the fields, when I hallooed thieves; I stood in my chaise, and looked after them; I saw them make a stop in the field, before they took the road; I turned my mare about, and drove round the corner of the houses as hard as I could drive; a witness you will see presently, had got Poynton, holding him by the collar; they were one on one side of the gate, and the other on the other; I could not see them while I was driving back, on account of the houses; I said, hold him fast, for there has been two ladies robbed; I said, where is the other; that man said, he is gone across the road; up comes the other witness, and Waters had taken Poynton; when this was done, I said, secure them fast, I will turn back and meet the ladies, that they may see them; immediately, I got into the chaise, and drove back, and met the young women; I took them to the public-house, and gave the prisoners in charge to the constable; there we searched them, at the publick-house; and I found upon Poynton, the cock of a pistol, and some gun-powder, and some monies; I cannot say particularly; but I took particular notice of that: Price was searched; and, upon him there was found a silver four-pence, a silver two-pence, and a silver penny, and about a couple of shillings; there was a crown-piece which they said was dropped in the road, which I did not see picked up.</p>
               <p>You did not know that they were the same people? - If they had not been pursued, and taken as they were; I did not know that they were the people that committed the robbery; I was not near enough to see their faces.</p>

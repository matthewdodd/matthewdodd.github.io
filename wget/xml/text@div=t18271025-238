I saw the prisoner there, and swore clearly and positively to him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHER. Q. Be so kind as to recollect exactly at what time this was? A. About nine o'clock, rather before than after - it was was very near nine - it was dark, of course - it had been raining, and was a damp dirty night.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe the lamps do not, on a damp night, give so much light as on another? A. I believe not; there was a gas-light at the bottom of the court, which is about sixty yards long - that was not the light I saw him by; there is a light at Mr. Yarrow's, a grocer, at the corner of the yard- I was rather flurried.</p>
               <p>Q. You are rather a nervous man? A. That made me nervous; I have never been right since; I saw him as plainly as I do you, Sir; the moment he seized my arm, I was convinced I had seen him before - it did not last more than a minute, I suppose, or a minute and a half; I was not looking at him entirely; when I attempted to pursue the man, the prisoner stopped me - he came breast to breast to me; I had rather passed him; he came and stood before me - I was between the two men, and the light was, as it were, overhead, a little distance behind me - it was only the little distance they had driven me down the court.</p>

            . I live in King-street, Snow-hill, and am a grocer. On the night of the 22d of September my attention was called to this yard; I was in my own shop, and saw a scuffle at the top of the yard - I went out; when I got to my door, which might take me about a minute, the parties had dispersed; I went down the yard, on hearing a cry of Stop thief! from a faint voice, and met two men coming up the yard - one was in a white smock-frock, the other had plain clothes of some description; I spoke to the man in the smock-frock, as he was the nearest of the two to me - he was quite close to me; I asked him what was the matter - he said a gentleman had been robbed of his watch; I inquired if the thief was taken - he said, "He is not taken; we have been pursuing him, and he has made his escape through these courts."</p>
               <p>Q. Did this pass in such a light, that you could well see the features of the person in the smock-frock? A. Yes; I firmly believe the prisoner to be the man - I had not seen him before to my knowledge; I did not recollect him at the time; I have no doubt about his being the man.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you any doubt of him when he was taken into custody? A. No - and I have now no doubt.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHER. Q. Did you not express a doubt? A. No; I said I had not the slightest doubt he was the man, for he resembled him as much as two men could resemble each other; I knew him by his face and figure - but I was more positive to his face, as he had at first a smock-frock on.</p>
               <p>Q. When two men are dressed very much alike, may they not be easily mistaken in a dark night? A. This was not a very dark night; I cannot remember whether I heard him speak at the Mansion-house.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you take a very accurate inspection of him at the Mansion-house before you swore to him? A. Yes; I said I should know him better with his hat on - it was put on, and I had no doubt of him.</p>
               <p>MR. CHURCHER. Q. Could you have sworn to him without his hat? A. I think I could; the robbery happened between half-past eight and nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you see Mr. Stapp there? A. No, not at that time; but in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, one of his men came to my house to borrow a candle, to look for the watch-case - that was the first of my hearing that it was Mr. Stapp who was robbed.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you believe the story the man in the smock-frock told you? A. Yes; and returned to my house; there was a very good light - there is a gas-light at the top of the court.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. What induced you to go to the Mansion-house? A. Mr. Stapp came with his man, and told me what had occurred; he knew me as a neighbour; I observed to him that a very able man ran after the thief, and he would have been of use - I said he was a very able man, in a smock-frock; Mr. Stapp said, "That is the very man:" he appeared extremely agitated - Mr. Cope fetched me to the Mansion-house.</p>

               <p>MR. CHURCHER. Q. When you heard the description of the man, you said you did not think the prisoner was the man? A. I said there was another person very similar to him: that man has been apprehended since - he is not quite so stout; the prosecutor said the other was not the man - there is a resemblance between them.</p>
               <p>Q. So great, that a person in great agitation might mistake one for the other? A. That I cannot say.</p>

            . I live at Mr. White's, the Hope and Anchor public-house, Hereford-street, Paddington - I am pot-boy there. I remember the night of the 22d of September; the prisoner was there the best part of that day - I cannot say at what time he came; I first saw him about two or three o'clock in the afternoon; he was there, in and out, till a quarter after nine - he then left; he was there at a quarter-past nine; he was there, with others, on account of a man stealing some sheep; they were drinking beer, and were in and out, watching for the man who had stolen the sheep, to take him: they had some mutton-chops for supper.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long had you been pot-boy there? A. About three months: three other persons were with him - one left in the afternoon, but the prisoner and the two others remained; I did not serve them with every thing they had - I served them with porter - they had nothing else to my recollection; I took in nothing but porter, they paid my master - I was then standing at the tap-room door - I cannot say how much it was; there was no dispute about it, and I did not hear what it was - they all divided it, and paid their share. Thompson, a police officer, was with them - he is not here to-day; he was only once in the house; he was after the man; I saw Thompson there in the afternoon once; they did not dine there - they did not have any thing till he evening; the butcher in our neighbour<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182710250097"></xptr>hood brought the chops, I took the frying-pan in to them, and they cooked them themselves - it was on a Saturday.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a day was it - it did not rain, did it? A. I was in the house, and do not go out; I did not notice whether people came in wet or splashed; I cannot tell where I was on the Saturday before, or what company were there then, there are so many people come to our house; I did not know the prisoner before: I can tell who came on the Saturday night afterwards - it was the prisoner's brother and Mr. Broom; they took me to the Mansion-house.</p>
               <p>Q. What makes you particularly remember that this was the 22d of September? A. I do remember it, because the prisoner was there, and we do not have any cooking in our tap-room on Saturday nights; but I told master they had been there all day, and wanted something to eat.</p>
               <p>Q. Why does that make you remember it was the 22d? A. I cannot tell - this is the 22d of October, I think; I do not know what date last Saturday was.</p>
               <p>MR. CHURCHER. Q. Are you in the habit of observing your master when he takes people's reckoning? A. No; the officer was there in the afternoon; it might be a fine or a damp day for what I know; I observed the day very particularly; I attended at the Mansion-house on the Monday week, I believe - my attention was then directed to the day.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you know Thompson before? A. Yes; he came in once; he was once with them about sheep; that was about the middle of the morning; he went out looking for the man, and they were in and out; he was not with them afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by saying he was with them? A. He brought them in; they all came in together - he did not stay more than five minutes; I only saw him once- that was about two or three o'clock; our door is kept open; I serve in the tap, and go to the cellar; I do not think it was wet; I do not know what occurred on the Saturday before - the prisoner's brother came on the Saturday after, and had conversation with me and my master; his brother was not there with him - I did not know him before.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Is it your duty to serve in the bar, and go up and down stairs? A. Yes; I very seldom carry out beer or collect the pots; I do when there are a great many out; I then go out with the man.</p>

            . I am nothing particular - the last place I lived at was a bake-house. I was at the Hope and Anchor on Saturday, the 22d of September; I went there about seven o'clock, and staid till about nine. I saw the prisoner there; I left him there at nine, and found him there at seven; they had mutton chops and roasted potatoes for supper.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What is your business? A. I am nothing particular; I went to assist at the baker's, Mr. Wells, Great James-street, Lisson-grove; I was about four months with him, and have had no place since; I was third hand with him, and carried out bread; I do not serve at the Hope and Anchor; I never saw the prisoner before; he sat in a box on the right hand side as you go in at the door; I was in front of the same box as the prisoner and his party - there were three of them. I had no share of their porter; there were three when I went in, and three when I left.</p>
               <p>Q. What made you take so particular notice of the prisoner as to come here, to swear you knew him again? A. Because a man who was with the prisoner talked about some stolen sheep. I did not see the Police-officer - the chops were cooked in the tap-room; a man came in with the potatoes, and they bought them; I saw nobody else buy any; I went to the Mansion-house on the Tuesday; I do not know the date. I am certain of the 22d; I do not know what day of the month this is.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be so well assured this was on the 22d of September? A. Because it was on the day I left my place; I was dismissed about the time I went there - I had been out that day with bread; I cannot say whether it was rainy or fine - there was no quarrel in the house while I was there; I live at No. 2, Union-street, Paddington; the prisoner's brother came to me, not to my house. I came into the Hope and Anchor while they were there, and they asked me if I was one who was there; I am sure this was on the 22d of September.</p>
               <p>MR. CHURCHER. Q. It was Saturday night? A. Yes; I never saw them there before or after; the people of the public-house know me; I am the last witness' brother.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Who do you work for now? A. I have been out of place ever since - I had no mutton-chops - I saw them eat them; they were broiled; one of the men who is here cooked them, with a gridiron - I think it was a gridiron - I did not get up to look - I cannot say whether it was a gridiron or saucepan - I was in the same box with them; there was a box between me and the fire-place - I could not well see the fire without getting up; a man sat at the end of the box - I saw no frying-pan or gridiron brought in; the potatoes were roasted; a man brought them in to sell, just as the chops were ready - they did not give me any - I was not known to them - I was with some other young men - I could not see the fire.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. How was the prisoner dressed? A. In the same dress he has now, except that he had a red handkerchief - I swear he was never out of the tap-room from seven to nine o'clock - I know the time I left the house, because I was going to the Crown and Apple Tree public-house, in Berwick-street, to see somebody - I slept at home - I have been there several nights since, and staid there a good many hours together - I usually go home about ten o'clock - I was there last night for about five minutes; the prisoner's brother was not with them, but the men who came with him were there, the night they had the chops, and those men asked me if I was there; they had sat in the same box with me; they asked if I was not the young man who was there - I was not surprised at the question.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you know they were looking after sheep? A. I heard them talking about it - I did not know where they were stolen from; they were looking for the man; they knew him; he was a butcher up there - I did not think it strange they should remain so long in the house.</p>

There was a fourth person, who was rather in liquor, in the afternoon, but when I returned he was not there - I had left him there at four o'clock - I am sure, when I returned at seven o'clock, these three men were sitting drinking and talking to one another - I sat on the prisoner's right, in the same box, and on the same side - I saw George Weller right opposite me - I was near the window; he was opposite; there was a fire - I sat facing the fire; the chops came from Nicholl's, a butcher - Broom went for them, and the butcher brought them - Broom was one of the three - he went for them about eight o'clock, or a little after; they were cooked in a frying-pan - I do not know where it came from; there were a good many people there the latter part of the evening - I cannot say how many - I believe there were people in all the boxes - I knew one Farns, who was there - I cannot say at what time he came- he was there at four, and between seven and nine o'clock; he left before me - I lodge at No. 9, Bond's-place, Edgware-road.</p>
               <p>Q. How came they to find you? A. I was coming into the public-house when his brother, and the other men were there; that was just about dark - I had been looking for a place on the 22d of September; it was not wet - I am not certain whether it was fine - I was not wet through, and therefore did not notice whether it was wet at all; the men who sat by me had some roasted potatoes - George Weller had some and Broom, and a man named Elgar bought a penny-worth himself, I believe, and the prisoner and his party had some; a man brought them in - Broom paid for some, but not for all - we had the remains of their potatoes, after they had done; the potatoe-man went to the other boxes, but whether he sold any more I cannot say; he is not here - I did not notice them talking about any thing but the sheep; the man who went away first was tipsy - I saw these men come in about two o'clock; that man was tipsy when he came in; four persons came in, and one was tipsy; they came into the tap-room; the prisoner had a fustian coat and blue apron; he was dressed something like he is now; he has no apron now- I do not know whether the others had aprons; but he was next to me, with a little dog in his arms.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of the three cooked the chops? A. A deaf man - Broom, or some such name.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Who sat next to you on the other side of the prisoner? A. John Elgar.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You saw a great deal of them? A. Yes; I went home to tea, from four to seven o'clock; I did not set in the same box with them in the afternoon, but I was in the tap-room from two to four o'clock; I will not say I did not step to the door; I only saw four in the party.</p>
               <p>Q. If any body else had come to talk about the sheepstealers, you must have seen them? A. Very likely.</p>

            . I am a drover, and remember the 22d of September - I saw the prisoner that day, at the Bull's Head, public-house, Smithfield. I went with him to the Hope and Anchor, Paddington: we were in and out there the best part of the afternoon - I did not leave till half-past ten o'clock; the prisoner left about twenty minutes past nine - I supped with him, off mutton-chops and baked potatoes; the chops were fried by a man who was with us. I am certain the prisoner did not leave till after nine o'clock, and am certain as to the day - several persons were in the tap-room whom I did not know; I was never there before I appeared at the Mansion-house to give evidence, and so did some others who are here.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What time did you go with him? A. About half-past twelve o'clock; three of us went together; there were four of us at the Hope and Anchor; the fourth man was a drover - he joined us near Baker-street - a young man named Alby, who was one of the four, was tipsy - he is not here - we lost him there; I do not know where he lives; Thompson, a Police-officer, was there - I went for him about three o'clock; we got there about two. I did not go in with the rest, but left them a few minutes before, and then they went with me to a person named Watkins, a few doors from the Sun public-house, where we called first; I staid at Watkins' a very few minutes. I left the officer with Watkins, and he followed us to the Hope and Anchor; we were in and out between two and four o'clock, and staid out five or ten minutes; we might have gone out half a dozen times; we dined before we left town - we had some porter, and I had some gin and spruce at the bar - I do not know whether the others had any; we sat in the left side box when we first went in, and then changed to the right side; the young man left us about half-past four o'clock; we heard of Watkins, and all went out together, and in the course of that walk lost the tipsy man.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it is not true that he got up and went away himself? A. No, we lost him in the walk. The prisoner was dressed the same as he is now, except a handkerchief; he had a kind of blood-red handkerchief - there was no other difference; I am certain he had not a smock-frock; he had no apron on, I am sure. The officer belongs to Bow-street - he was here yesterday, and would have come to-day if he was wanted; he was not at the Mansion-house - I met with him at his own house, No. 5, in the same street as the Hope and Anchor; I semember seeing Seller there very well - I cannot say when I first saw him - he was a stranger to me; I saw him in the tap-room; I first saw him in the left-hand side, and then he turned to the right; I think I saw him before four o'clock, but did not notice him till after that. I saw him in the evening; he was drinking porter in the tap-room - we did not drink to each other - I believe he was in the same box towards the evening. I am not able to say how many were in the box - it is a square box; my face was towards the fire - I do not recollect who sat next the prisoner; we had some muttonchops - Nicholls, the butcher, brought them; the prisoner and myself went to order them - I am sure of that; we cooked them by the tap-room fire -

               <p>Q. When you came away did you all pay and settle it afterwards, or did one pay? A. We paid between us; I cannot say how much it was, or what my share was; I spent 4s. 6d. or 5s. in the course of the afternoon; I paid part for the prisoner; I do not know whether he paid any; I asked him to walk with me from the Bull's Head, and did not wish him to pay much; the sheep lost I had to pay for, if I could not find them; we found the man, but he ran away from the officer, saying he would go and get the money; I got the money for them next morning; I am sure it was on the 22d of September; I made no memorandum of it; I was questioned about it at the Mansion-house on the Tuesday week; it was rather a heavy day; it mizzled a little as we walked there; it was heavy a great part of the day.</p>
               <p>MR. CHURCHER. Q. What time did Thompson go away? A. About ten minutes to six o'clock; he was not there afterwards; I told him he would not be wanted; I have known the prisoner some time in Smithfield, but was never in his company to spend an evening before; I never heard any thing against him; I considered him to bear an honest character.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long have you known him? A. Four or five years by sight; I was never in his company before; I never heard of his being in a Court before; I have heard of his being in custody for getting a little tipsy; I never heard any charge against him.</p>

            . I am a waiter at the Hope and Anchor. I have seen the prisoner; he was at our house on the 22d of September till twenty minutes past nine o'clock at night; two other persons were with him, a man with one eye, and another man deaf.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What time did they come? A. Between one and two o'clock; I am sure two more came with him; we understood they were in search of a butcher about some sheep; I saw an officer there between four and five o'clock; I do not know when he left, as I had my business to mind; I only saw him when he came in with the three men, between four and five o'clock; they were the only men who came on that business; they were the officer, the prisoner, Broom, and Hill; I cannot say either of them were tipsy; they might be a little in liquor; I saw no tipsy man come in with them - they went in and out, and had mutton-chops in the evening - there were two or three bakers in the tap-room, George Weller and another baker - a great many people were in the tap-room - Saturday is generally a busy night; this was not particularly a busy night - I know it was on the 22d of September, because when they came in they were talking about some sheep, and about Watkins, and I said I had parted from him not five minutes ago - they did not go after him then; this was between two or three o'clock - the officer lives in the same street - he was here last week, and said he had no objection to come forward - they sat behind the door at supper - they had before sat in the opposite box - I cannot say when they changed - they went out between four and five o'clock, then came in, and sat behind the door - Elgar sat in the same box, and partook of some of the victuals - he had some potatoes - I do not know whether any body else sat in the same box - I could not attend to my business, and notice every thing - I cannot say where Weller or Seller sat - Broom sat close to the prisoner - the prisoner had a frock on under his coat - I believe it is called a smock-frock - it is a loose linen garment, which went down low, and covered his breeches - I cannot say what colour it was, but am sure he had one on - he had a red silk handkerchief round his neck - I believe it was a fine day - I did not pay particular attention to it - I go out with beer, but cannot recollect whether it was fine.</p>

            . I am a baker. On Saturday evening, the 22d of September, I was at the Hope and Anchor; I saw the prisoner there that night, sitting with two more men; he wore the coat he has on now, I believe; and I think a red handkerchief - he had a fustian coat and a dog. I think it rained a little in the afternoon; I saw him eat mutton-chops; I went away a little after ten o'clock; he went out, as near as I can tell, at half-past nine o'clock; I am certain he was there.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Are you certain of the day of the month? A. I recollect it was the 22d, because I read the paper that afternoon - I read the paper yesterday - I have not seen one to-day, and cannot tell the date of to-day; I was working for Mary-le-bone parish that day; I have been with a cabinet-maker, and then a cheesemonger, and after that with a baker; I was never employed as a drover- I suppose I have not been at Smithfield market above a dozen times in my life; I believe the prisoner had a blue apron on, but will not swear it - he had a frock on under his coat - I am sure of it - I saw it under his coat - it would prevent my seeing his waistcoat - I think it was a short-frock - I am not quite certain that he had an apron - I think the frock was blue.</p>

            . I am a milkman, and live at No. 16, Harrow-street. I was at the Hope and Anchor on Saturday night, the 22d of September, and saw the prisoner there - he had a sort of dirty drab handkerchief on, and a sort of fustian jacket; I did not much notice his dress.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What time did you go there? A. About seven o'clock, and left about eight - I think it was a fine day.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What makes you remember that it was the 22d? I did not make any particular remark, but the indictment was read to me, which stated it was the 22d, and I recollected the night I had seen him there; I think this is (hesitating) the 31st day of the month - I am sure he had a dirty drab handkerchief, to the best of my recollection.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not blood-red? A. I think not.</p>
               <p>Q. You have a red handkerchief, was it as red as that? A. No; it might be a mixture of red and drab - it was dirty; he had a great coat on the table before him; I did not notice his having a smock-frock - he had no apron; I did not see his shirt frill; I sat alone in a left hand box, and they on the right; I did not see them eat any thing.</p>

               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS, Q. Did you enter it in your book? A. No; but on that day I had a goose sent up out of the country; we eat it on Sunday - it was not sent for Michaelmas-day, and we were remarking that we should have goose before Michaelmas-day; I had seen the prisoner before in Smithfield.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you observe his dress? A. I think it was the same as he has now, except that he had a coloured handkerchief.</p>
               <p>COURT, Q. You were there but a short time? A. Not a minute scarcely; Broom paid me 1s. 1d.</p>

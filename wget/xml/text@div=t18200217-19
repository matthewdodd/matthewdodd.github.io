On the 8th of February, about eleven o'clock in the morning, I was in my back parlour adjoining the shop - the folding-doors between the shop and the parlour were open; I saw a boy run out - nobody was in the shop. I followed the boy, and as I ran through the shop I missed five silk handkerchiefs and one cotton one; he must have crept under the counter to the end of the window to take them - they could not have been reached without creeping under the counter; I had put them there that morning. I followed him into the street, crying Stop thief! and Rickman secured him. I saw him all the way up the street till he turned the corner. I am sure he is the boy; Rickman was pursuing the boy who ran out of the shop. He brought the prisoner back, and the handkerchiefs were found in his hat - they cost me 5 s. each.</p>
               <p>TIMOTHY RICKMAN. I am constable of St. Marylebone. I was standing in my shop, which is about thirty-six yards from Blakeman's, heard the cry of Stop thief! and ran out - the prisoner ran by my door. I pursued, and secured him about six yards off. I found the handkerchiefs in his hat.</p>

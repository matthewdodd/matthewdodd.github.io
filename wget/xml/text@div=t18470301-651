In consequence of information, I watched the teams coming out of the prosecutor's premise on the 9th of Feb.—the prisoner had one team, and there were two others—I stopped the team the prisoner had, and found on the top of the load between two trusses, this sack, containing four bushels and a peck of oats—I could not see them till I got on the load, because they were concealed—I asked the prisoner how he came by it—he said he knew nothing about it—I told the prosecutor what had happened—here is sack and a sample of the oats.</p>

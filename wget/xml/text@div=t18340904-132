            . I am a painter, in the prosecutor's employ. I was working at the same wine-vaults - I saw the prisoner come out of a pawnbroker's shop - he showed me the duplicate of a dusting brush - he had owed me 6d., and paid it me - on the 1st of August, I saw him take a handpot full of lead away, and some dryers - I gave information on the Saturday night.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When did he show you the duplicate of the brush? A. On the 31st of July, at dinner-time - I had lent him sixpence that morning before breakfast, that he might stand a drop of gin - I and two or three more had asked him to do it - he said, if I would lend him 6d., he would stand some gin - I told him he must let me have it before dinner, as I seldom brought more money out than was necessary to carry me through the day - I had no idea he was going to pawn his brush.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your solemn oath, did you not say, "D-n it, pawn your duster; you can take it out again?" A. No - I did not go with him to the pawnbroker's, and take the 6d. from his hand - I waited outside of Mr. Weller's till he went home, as I understood, to get the money - I was surprised when he came out of the pawnbroker's, and I asked him what he had been up to - I told him he had better not have done that - I did not mention that to the magistrate - I was not asked it - Mr. Sowter was not going to turn me away on the Saturday night afterwards.</p>

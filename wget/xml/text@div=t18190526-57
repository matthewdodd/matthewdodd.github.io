            . On the 10th of May, about half-past ten o'clock in the evening, I had been out on an errand - I returned and stood at my master's door in <placeName id="t18190526-57-crimeloc306">Aldersgate-street</placeName>

               <p>"Yes." He said,</p>
               <p>"No, mistress is in the country." I said,</p>
               <p>"No, they are at home, and I will thank you to let me go," for I was afraid I should break a glass pipe, which I had in my hand; he put his hand round my neck, and took my brooch; I seized him, and held him till the watchman came and took him - we could not find the brooch - he wished to pay for it at the watch-house, but my master would not let me take the money. I am sure it was safe before he took hold of me.</p>

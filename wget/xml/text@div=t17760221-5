I replied I did not know: the prisoner turned his face to me, and said, Is that young man in your company? I said, No, Sir, I never saw him before: nothing farther passed till I left the house, then I came into <placeName id="t17760221-5-crimeloc26">Bow-street</placeName>

               <p>Did you and the prisoner come out together? - He walked on the other side of me with other people: as I was crossing the way he said, Sir, would not you choose something to drink after the heat of the house; I replied that it was my intention, and immediately I walked into a public house just straight before me in Bow-street, I cannot say exactly the house, I was never in it before; the prisoner came in directly after me, I called for a pint of porter, I drank what I chose of it, and asked him if he would take the rest; he said, Thank you, Sir, your good health, Sir; when he had drank the beer he set the pot down upon the table, and turned himself round to me with a kind of grin, and asked me,</p>
               <p>"What I meant by the liberties I took with</p>
               <p>"his person when we were in the playhouse?" I answered I knew of none; he replied,</p>
               <p>"D - n</p>
               <p>"you, Sir, but you did, and there were persons,</p>
               <p>"reputable merchants, in the house, will</p>
               <p>"take their oath of it:" alarmed at this, I replied I did not understand what he meant, and rose up in haste, called for the waiter, paid for the porter, and then hastened into the street: the prisoner came out directly after me, and at about eight yards distance from the public house halloo'd out.</p>
               <p>How long had you been in the public house? - Ten minutes perhaps.</p>
               <p>The prisoner came out immediately after you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>By that time were the croud from the playhouse dispersed? - The people were not all come out of the playhouse, there was a great crowd coming down the street; he halloo'd out,</p>
               <p>"D - n you, Sir, stop, I'll raise a mob about</p>
               <p>"you if you offer to run;" he immediately came up to me and seized my arm, and said,</p>
               <p>"D - n it, Sir, this affront is not to be put</p>
               <p>"up with, such an insult is not to be borne,</p>
               <p>"you have offered me an indignity, and nothing</p>
               <p>"can make me satisfaction:" in my fright I asked him what he wanted; what would you have me do, was another of my expressions: Do, the prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"why you</p>
               <p>"must make me a present;</p>
               <p>"a present of what I replied? he answered,</p>
               <p>"Come, what money</p>
               <p>"have you got about you, how much can you</p>
               <p>"give me?" I said I had but little money about me.</p>
               <p>At this time had he hold of you by the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177602210009"></xptr> arm? - All the time - But what I had he must take, and accordingly put my hand in my pocket and pulled out about three guineas and some silver, to the best of my remembrance, which he took from me.</p>
               <p>How much silver do you think there was? - About twelve shillings, as near as I can guess: he said,</p>
               <p>"Is this all you have?" I said it is all indeed; he said,</p>
               <p>"D - n it, Sir, this</p>
               <p>"is not enough, I must have a farther sum:" I then attempted to leave him, but he kept hold of my arm and made me stand still, which put me in much fear; I was fearful he had a design of mischief upon my person, but soon after I walked on and he walked with me, still holding me by the arm.</p>
               <p>Were the crowd there when all this passed between you? - The crowd were going by when he said he would raise a mob about me; I believe there was no crowd when he took the money; I walked across Russel-street down Bridges-street, he had me by the arm the whole time; he said on entering that street,</p>
               <p>"I believe I know you, Sir, you live twenty</p>
               <p>"miles from town; I replied I was sure he did not know me, as I never saw him before; advancing nearer to the Strand, he said to me,</p>
               <p>"Come down to the bottom of this street, Sir,</p>
               <p>"I have some friends at a coffee-house there,</p>
               <p>"and we will go and settle this affair." I told him I should not go near his friends nor with him, as I knew nothing of them nor him: I turned back and came through Vinegar-yard.</p>
               <p>Did he then let you go or keep hold of you? - I twisted out of his arm on turning back, and came through Vinegar-yard: he followed me, and in about ten or twenty yards, he took hold of me again in the way for Great Queen-street: as we were going down Queen-street, he asked me,</p>
               <p>"If I would meet</p>
               <p>"him at a coffee-house," I can't recollect the name of it, near Temple-bar; I replied I should not come to him or any of his friends; he said</p>
               <p>"D - n it, Sir; if you are not ashamed of</p>
               <p>"any thing you have done, you need not be</p>
               <p>"afraid of meeting any man:" I answered, I was not ashamed to face any man, but would not meet people I knew nothing of: he asked me just afterwards where I lived, and what was my name, which I refused to tell him; then he said,</p>
               <p>"He would see me to my lodgings," and he asked me</p>
               <p>"what time I should be out</p>
               <p>"in the morning:" I replied, it was uncertain, perhaps it might nine o'clock; he said,</p>
               <p>"Very well, I shall see you." Nothing more material passed, but being late I hastened to my lodging; he went with me to the door: it was then near twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Court. In all this time did you ever call out to any body to help you to get from him? - I was in such terror I had not power.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Crown. The threat, as I understand, was that he would raise a mob on account of indecencies? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Your terror was for fear of being charged with an unnatural crime? - It was.</p>
               <p>And you was afraid any body should hear what passed, as it would touch your character? - I was.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>All the transaction of his laying hold of you, and your giving him the money, was in Bow-street? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long might you be in Bow-street? - About ten minutes.</p>
               <p>People were passing and repassing the whole time you was there? - People were passing; I cannot say I observed, the whole time I was so much frightened.</p>
               <p>Did you at the time this happened, look upon it to be a robbery? - I looked upon it as money forced from me.</p>

            's and told the whole story? - I did.</p>
               <p>There are other indictments against the prisoner, I believe? - Yes, for an assault and conspiracy.</p>
               <p>They are for the same fact? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The next day he came to you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you take him up for the robbery then? - No, I had not recovered strength of mind to think of it.</p>

               <p>From the time he took hold of you, till you got to your lodging, you did not call out to any body? - I don't remember any body passing us after we came into Queen street.</p>
               <p>How came you to remember so particularly the expressions made use of? - They made a very strong impression upon my mind.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177602210010"></xptr>Did he pretend to have any arms about him? - No.</p>
               <p>The reason why you gave him the money, was on account of this accusation? - It was.</p>

               <p>When he so threatened you, was you so frightened as to consider yourself in his power? - I did, I should have given him any thing I had to have got rid of the accusation.</p>
               <p>Did he, give you any intimation of such an imputation before you went into the public-house? - He did not.</p>
               <p>Did you say any thing to him before the porter came? - Not a word; as soon as he put the pot down, he turned to me in the manner I mentioned.</p>
               <p>Was there any body in the room at that time? - I believe there were two people in a box at a distance.</p>
               <p>Did he when he spoke this to you in the house, speak loud enough to be heard by the people at a distance? - No, he did not speak loud enough for them to hear.</p>

               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I was at the playhouse near six months ago, the prosecutor came and sat by my side, and asked me how I liked the entertainment, which was the Padlock; when I came down stairs he followed me and tap'd me on the shoulder and asked me if I would go and drink? I said I was very agreeable; we went to a public house in Bow-street, directly over the way; we staid there about three quarters of an hour; he called for the waiter and paid for the porter; I offered to pay for it, but as he asked me in, he said I should not pay for it; coming out he asked me my way home: I said I was going to Chancery-lane; he said he was glad of it, because he was going that way and would accompany me: as we were going along that part of Lincoln's-inn-fields next Holborn, he behaved very rude to me, and wanted to kiss me; I pushed him from me, and asked him what he wanted? he said he did not mean to affront me: we had not gone many yards farther before he wanted to force his hands into my breeches; I called out watch several times; he had then ran away, but hearing me repeat the call so often he was afraid he would be stopped, so he stopped and said, he was very sorry he had offered the thing to me that he did, and said, if it would be any satisfaction he would go on his knees to beg my pardon; he told me he was a gentleman living hard by, and begged I would not hurt him; that I should see where he lived, and begged I would see him home to his lodging, which he said was not far off, and if I would be so obliging to call in the morning, he would make me a present for the affront he had given me. I being poor, and not having wherewith to prosecute this man, if I had taken him up, I went to a friend and told him the affair, and asked him what I should do; he desired me as the gentleman had told me to call in such a time to go, and that he would go with me; we went at the time, which was between nine and ten o'clock, and Mr. Newman was ready to meet me below stairs; he called us into a back room, and bid me and my friend sit down; we had not spoke any thing at all then, but he went to a person in the shop and spoke to him; he came back into the back room from the shop, and said, he wished us to go along with him into the city; we went into the city, and just going up Ludgate-hill, he begged of me and my acquaintance to go to the London Coffeehouse, and that he would wait upon us in about a quarter of an hour's time or a few minutes; we went and he came there in about a quarter of an hour's time with a bit of paper and some money, as it proved afterwards, inclosed in it; he laid hold of my hand and put it in my hand, and at the same time told me, that was in token of my shewing him the friendship the night before, in not exposing him as I should have done; he gave me a 10 l. bank note, and the rest in money, to the amount of 40 l. I did not ask a farthing of him; we staid about half an hour after drinking a dish of coffee; as we were coming out he said to me, if I may rely upon your conduct, if you are in any necessity you shall never want; this was the day after<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177602210011"></xptr> the affair; so we parted; I know no more of the three guineas than the child unborn; he endeavoured to suck my blood like a vulture. I know nothing about it; the man that went with me is gone into the country; his name is Hopkins.</p>
               <p>To the Prosecutor. What day was the prisoner taken up? - On the 5th of January.</p>

               <p>You saw him the next day after the affair happened? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was there any one with him the next day or with you? - There was nobody with me, there was a man with him I did not know.</p>
               <p>How came you not to take him up then? - I did not know how to act; I should have taken him afterwards when he came to my house, but I did not think I had proper authority.</p>
               <p>When did he come to your house? - On the 18th of November.</p>
               <p>Before that, had you told the story to any body? - I had intrusted a friend with it; upon the 18th of November, I got the prisoner's name, he wrote it down on a piece of paper, and I went to Sir

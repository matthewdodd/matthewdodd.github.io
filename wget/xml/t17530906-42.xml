            . I live at Mr. Pearson's a pawnbroker in Castle street; (he looks at the watch:) the prisoner is the person that brought this watch to me, he offered to pledge or sell it, I asked him how he came by; he said he bought it, and that it cost him six pounds, and that it had laid at a house in Russel-street, Covent-garden, some time, for three ou.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he bring it you ?</p>
               <p>Stevens. On Monday the 13th of August; I said I should be glad to be better satisfied about it, and should stop it till I was, then said he'd bring a person the next day to prove it his property, and went away, he came again the next day, and brought a man with him, but that man said he knew nothing of it; I advertised it on the 15th of August, and the same day it was advertised in the same paper, by the prosecutor; he came to me, and I delivered it to him; after this the prisoner came, and then said he found it in the Hay market, and wanted the reward, be voluntarily went before justice Fielding, who committed him.</p>
               <p>Q. to the Prosecutor. Was you sober when you lost your watch ?</p>

                  </hi> I am an attorney, and reside at Ryde, in the Isle of Wight. I am concerned for a family named Charsley, and for Miss Mary Ann Charsley, in the receipt of some interest money, payable to her half-yearly—on 23rd Jan. I enclosed this bill of exchange to her—it then had no indorsement or acceptance—it was a ten days' bill—I put a note from my wife into the enclosure, addressed to Miss Mary Ann Charsley—I also wrote a letter when I enclosed the bill—I afterwards heard that it had miscarried before I heard from Miss Charsley, and wrote to the authorities—in conse<lb></lb>quence of what I learned, I saw the prisoner, William Edwards, on 4th Feb., the day the bill became due, at the Portugal Hotel, in custody—Rowe and Tucker were with him—they told me he was come to explain about this bill—I told the prisoner at the first to take care what he said, because if it should prove hereafter that he did not satisfactorily account to me, I should take advantage of anything he said; and in the course of this conversation, with respect to Miss Charsley, he said that she had gone by the name of Underwood, that she had represented that she expected some money from a Captain Butt, and had requested him to get this bill changed for her; that he had done so, and taken back the money—he asked whether he might not arrange with Mr. Tucker—he would give him any security he liked, and that of course he die not know whether it was all right—I saw Charlotte Edwards the day after, 5th Feb., as I was coming out of Guildhall, from the examination—she stopped me, and said, "Captain Butt, I believe?"—I said, "No"—she said, "I thought I had seen you"—I said, "My name is Butt, not Captain Butt"—that was all, and I walked away—I was present at the examination, and acted as attorney for the prosecution—after I had made a statement, and asked for a remand, the Alderman asked Edwards, "What have you to say?"—he said, "I received it of a Miss Mary Ann Charsley, who lived at our house"—his Worship then said, Have you any witness?"—he said, "Yes, I have two, my mother and the servant"—they came forward—Char<lb></lb>lotte Edwards was examined—no note was taken of her evidence—the ser<lb></lb>vant, Mary Leeson, was then examined by his Worship—after I had cross-examined her a considerable time, my evidence and that of another, sufficient for a remand, was taken, and it was remanded to the 12th—the case was then gone into at considerable length, and his Worship again adjourned case to the 19th, with directions for the mother and Mary Leeson to be summoned, as they were not present—on 19th, I brought more witnesses, and Mary Leeson was produced and put up—I asked her some questions, and in the course of them Mr. Charnock, who then acted for the prisoner, objected to my ques<lb></lb>tions, because I was cross-examining my own witness—I never heard of such a person as Captain Butt—I should say there was certainly not such a person in Ryde.</p>

                  </hi> I am clerk to my father, who is a discount agent, carrying on business at 37, Nicholas-lane. I know both the prisoners—the male prisoners is a cattle-dealer—I have been at his house—I was not intimately acquainted with him—I met him casually in Cheapside, I think on 25th Jan.—I do not know the day of the week—it was about two o'clock—he said he had got a check, which he had been to the City to collect, but found it was not payable for several days—I desired him to let me see it—he did so, and I found it was this bill—I told him it was not a check, but a bill, which had to be accepted by Jones, Lloyd, and Co., and afterwards endorsed by Miss Charsley, and if he would get it so endorsed I would give him the cash for it—I then desired him to return with me to Jones, Lloyd, and Co., as I was passing there—he did so, and he saw me put it into the acceptance-box—I wrote out a copy for him to present next day to the clerk for it, and told him to get it endorsed, and then bring it to me—he did so the next day, the 26th, and I gave him the money for it—he did not bring it me after it was accepted, and before it was endorsed—I am quite sure of that—I asked him what he would <hi rend="italic">stand</hi> for it, and he said, "Anything that is usual, Miss Charsley will pay for it"—laughingly said to him, "Well, will you give me a sovereign?"—he said, "Yes, certainly"—I took it to messrs.

                  </hi> I am a solicitor. On Friday, 28th Jan., I, by Miss Charsley's direction, called at 51, Brompton-square, and saw the pri<lb></lb>soners—I informed them that I came, as Miss Charsley's solicitor, to inquire for a letter from Ryde, which was intended for Miss Charsley, but which had been taken in there by mistake and improperly detained—the mother said she had no information to give me respecting i, she had told the inspector all she knew about the matter; that Miss <hi rend="italic">Chesley</hi>, who occupied the parlours of the house, had received the letter, and had left the house the preceding day; she did not know what had become of her, and she wished to know what I meant by asking her questions—the male prisoner said he would not allow his mother to be cross-questioned by me, and asked for my card, which I gave him—one of them (I do not remember who) remarked that Mr. Pavey was Miss <hi rend="italic">Chesley's</hi> solicitor whom she had spoken of, and I had better apply to him for any further information I wanted—as I found I could get no further satisfaction, I left with the policeman—I did not put any question to the made prisoner as to where the bill was—I mentioned, before I left the house, that they were withholding information, and they might render themselves liable as accomplices.</p>

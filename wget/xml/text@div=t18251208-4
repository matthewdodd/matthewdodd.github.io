On Sunday, the 20th of November, I went out about one o'clock, leaving nobody in the house - I fastened all the doors and windows; the door fastens with a spring lock. I returned a little before eight, and found the door still locked; it would lock by being pulled too; the windows were still fast; I missed six or seven pairs of stockings from the ironing-board. I missed a counterpane that evening, and all the articles stated in the indictment (enumerating them); they be<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182512080005"></xptr>long to people for whom I wash - I was answerable for them; some were my own. I have known the prisoner from a baby, and frequently saw him.</p>

            . On Sunday, the 20th of November, about a quarter to eight o'clock, I saw the prisoner coming out of Dean's-place with a bundle of linen; I said, Halloo! and tried to stop him; he shoved me aside, and ran off, and I after him, but lost sight of him - I went back, and found Mrs. Frewin was robbed. I went with Morris, the officer, to different public-houses, and found the prisoner at the Pomfret Castle. I had known him for about six months. There was a gas-light, and I had a full view of him.</p>
               <p>MICHAEL MORRIS. I am an officer of Mary-le-bone. - Griffiths came to me; we went and found the prisoner at the Pomfret Castle, sitting in the tap-room. I called him out, and said I wanted him; he said, "What for?" I took him out, and in his coat pocket found two pairs of stockings; he had some pieces of cloth, which he said he had found. I found five pairs of stockings in his hat, and in his coat pocket a skeleton key, which I tried to the door; it opened it. I asked what he had done with a sheet and shirt - he said he knew nothing of the sheet, but had left the shirt with a person whom he would not get into trouble, for he had trouble enough himself. I was taking him to the watch-house - he said, "It is a pity she should lose all her property - she has behaved like a mother to me - if you go to Haystack-lane you will find the counterpane among some shavings in a shed." I went with Griffiths, and found it among shavings, in the place he described.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met two young men, who gave me the key, and told me to go and open her door - I was over-persuaded, and went with them; I could not open it- one of them called me a fool; he opened it, and made me go in with him, and take some things; he left me there - they have since sent her back the other things.</p>
               <p>Three witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

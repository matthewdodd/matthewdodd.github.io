             the constable clapped two of them on the shoulders, and said what do you do here; then I put my hand into my pocket, and missed my box with half a guinea in it, and a little bit of a receipt for an illness, this is the receipt and box; I swear to the box, I had it when I went to church.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt of the prisoner being the woman? - I am sure the woman that was committed was the person.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt, Prisoner's Counsel. There were a great croud round you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>She was the person that was taken in custody? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did you say about this? - Just as I say now, when they went to search her, I said it was not she that had the hat on.</p>
               <p>You said before the woman she was a pockfretten woman? - That was the person the man found the box upon; but that was the woman that said I pulled her cloak, I did not particularly mind the other woman.</p>
               <p>- ISAAC sworn.</p>
               <p>I attended this charity sermon, I happened to go into the church, just at the time that the hymn was beginning to be sung by Mrs. Wrighten, and I saw a shuffling piece of work between this lady and this woman, I took out two women, one with one arm and one with the other, and the box lay down just by the prisoners feet, I cannot pretend to say from which the box fell, I said before the Justice, I believe it fell on her side, and that it might drop from her.</p>
               <p>Court. What did you take the prisoner for? - This lady said they were about her picking her pockets.</p>
               <p>Jury. You knew them before? - I have seen them, Sir, I cannot say how often.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. If I understand you right, it was only a conjecture of yours, that it dropped from that woman? - That is all.</p>
               <p>That is what you said before the Justice? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You did not directly charge the prisoner? - No.</p>
               <p>Court to Isaac. Had not you seized these two women for something, before this lady made a complaint? - Yes, when I heard the noise, I took them both out together.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three women with whom she had worked, who all gave her a good character.</p>

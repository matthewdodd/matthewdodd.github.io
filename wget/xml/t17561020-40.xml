My servant came to me the day before yesterday, and told me there was some gold lace taken off two hats that were sent to dye and turn. We suspected it might be some of the carpenters. I asked him whom he suspected. He said, the prisoner; because he only had been at work in that part of the shop where it was missing from. His master was acquainted with this suspicion. He talked with the prisoner, and he denied it. I took him up into my lodging room, and there he denied it stiffly. Having no other way left, I told him my maid saw him take it. He then began to make a bargain with me to promise not to prosecute him. I replied I'd be tender if he'd come immediately to a plain confession of what he had taken. Then he confessed he had taken the lace and carried it home, and after much difficulty he confessed his having taken three pair of worstead stockings. I then call'd up some people of the house. He gave the key and a written order to one of the men to go and bring the things. I went with the man, and left him in the care of others. I could not find the things. Then I brought a friend to the prisoner, and he confessed the same before him. The things were found afterwards, but I cannot give an account of that.</p>

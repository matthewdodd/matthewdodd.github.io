                  </hi>. I now live at 10, York-street, Portman-square; I did live in Gloucester-row, in the parish of Paddington; I removed about three months ago. The prisoner was in my service—I think in March she went into the country with her mistress—I have a sister who left some boxes with me, and two carpet-bags—I have no doubt the boxes were fastened—I did not go to look at them—I do not know what was in them—in conse<lb></lb>quence of information from a policeman, I went and looked at the boxes—they seemed to be placed as they ought to be, but when we took away the covering which covered all the boxes, we found the deal boxes had been broken open, and the more solid boxes had had their locks wrenched off, and then clumsily fastened on—the boxes were not full, and the things that were in them were turned <hi rend="italic">topsy-turvey,</hi> not as they would be packed up—the prisoner had been my cook, and Macklin was in my service.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in the service of Dr. Tilt, both in Gloucester-row and in York-street. I recollect the boxes; they were in a top room in Gloucester-row, and they were brought down into the kitchen in York-street—I know the prisoner—I recollect when they were in Gloucester-row, at the latter end of Feb. or in March, it was before I went out of town, one of the boxes was opened at the back by me and the prisoner—I believe it was the prisoner said that we had such small wages that she did not see why we should not have something out of them—her wages were 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—we raised the box-lid up at the back with a nail—it was a very thin deal box—I believe it was nailed down, or fastened with a wire—we took three cameo stones out of it—this is the one of them that I had (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—the others were of the same character as this, but I suppose they were better; there was more workmanship in them—the prisoner took them and brought them into the kitchen, and after that they were taken up-stairs—I have not seen them since—that was all we took out of that box—there was another box opened by both of us; it was not broken—the four nails were raised with a hammer—there was a Roman scarf taken from that; this is not it—this is a worsted scarf that I took out of the second box—I had this one—we were together when we took them—there was some linen taken from the second box; I do not know how many yards; I think it was a piece—this is it—I was taken into custody on 6th June—I pawned the linen and the shawl, and gave the prisoner the duplicate—she said, as I could make no use of the linen, she would have the ticket of it—I pawned them at one place, in the Edgware-road; I do not know the name of the person; I believe it was Smith.</p>

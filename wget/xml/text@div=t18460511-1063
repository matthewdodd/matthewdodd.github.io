               <p>as he has correctly stated—I perceived they had been recently plugged—I drew a sample from each of the puncheons and delivered them to Mr. Hampton, the Customs' gauger—there were twelve of those puncheons which had the same marks on them, dipped by the Custom's gauger—they averaged a defi<lb></lb>ciency of about four gallons each—Nos. 815 and 819 were dipped also—one of them was five gallons deficient, and the other six gallons—between the two there was a deficiency of three gallons more than the average deficiency of the puncheons.</p>

After I told Mr. Bailey I thought he went down the stairs, I went and looked among the butts but could not find him; there was a mob in the street; they hollow'd out there was somebody on the top of the house; I went there but could not see him; I described to Mr. Bailey his dress and apparel. On the Tuesday about six in the afternoon I was at Mr. Bailey's house, and a person came up and told Mr. Bailey he thought the man I had described was at the corner of Gee's-court, Oxford-street; that is one turning from Mr. Bailey's; Mr. Bailey called me up to go to look at Ashby; I went and saw him; he answered the description I had given of him; I said to him there is a person at Mr. Bailey's would be glad to speak to you; he blasted his eyes, his limbs, and mine' and the house, and said no one wanted to speak with him there; I said he must come; he said he would not; I took hold of him by the collar, and said I apprehended him for robbing Mr. Bailey's house, for I saw him on the one pair of stairs landing place; I took him to Mr. Bailey's house; he said he was innocent, and that he was at the Nag's-head in the Ambury at the time the robbery was committed; when I came back again I took him to the watch-house; when I took him into the watch-house he said d - n me, you took me up for the sake of the forty quid; the meaning of that word I did not know; then he turned round and looked at me with a venemous look, and said are you a man; I told him I was; then he said that in case any thing happened to him I should be in danger of my life as I went about my business; then I was ordered to go before Justice Welch. After I was examined, Ashby confessed that what I swore was nothing but truth.</p>
               <p>Q. to Bailey. You had before advised him to turn evidence?</p>

I am beadle of the parish of St. Mary-le-bone: I and Hartley, a constable, were applied to, to search for the persons that had robbed Mr. Bailey; we went down to Westminster; when we came back we found Ashby was in custody at our watch-house; the next day from the information we had from Ashby we went in pursuit of M'Donald, and found him at a public house in the Ambury, Westminster; we took him out and hand-cuffed him; he said he was sorry he was taken by such a country booby as me, that he should not have minded it if Sir John's m en had taken him and got the forty pounds, and that he wished he had his pistols about him for to shoot such a country flat as me; when we came to the watch-house I searched him, and found nothing but a knife upon him; I laid it down while I went to pay the coachman; when I returned to the room I found the candle out, and the knife was gone; I searched him again, and found it in his pocket; this is the knife (producing it). There are several marks upon the box and the drawers of the instrument with which they were broke open; I asked him how he came by the knife when I found it upon him; he said he had bought it that night.</p>

               <p>- Parrot. I went to take Latimer; I know no more than the last witness.</p>
               <p>Q. from Ashby to Lucas. Why, if he saw me, did he not lay hold of me?</p>
               <p>Lucas. I told Mr. Bailey to lock his doors immediately, and the people were so thick about me I could not get up.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how could you distinguish me?</p>
               <p>Lucas. By the light of the candle.</p>
               <p>Court. How far is the bar from the landing place?</p>
               <p>Lucas. Opposite; the bar is at the foot of the landing place; it may be about two yards, or two yards and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Bailey. Is that so?</p>
               <p>Bailey. It must be more than three yards I think.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it four yards?</p>
               <p>Bailey. I cannot justly say it is, I believe rather more than three yards.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Jury. Do you think it was light enough to discern him?</p>
               <p>Bailey. There were two lights in the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Jury. Is there any drinking room up stairs?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177309080006"></xptr>Bailey. No.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. Why did not the people lay hold of me? if there were so many round him how could he see me?</p>
               <p>Lucas. There is a shelf by the end of the bar where the pots stand; upon that shelf there were two candles, which commanded a prospect above the people's heads; I saw him over the people.</p>
               <p>Q. The landing place is higher than where you was?</p>
               <p>Lucas. Yes; and he was the highest upon the stair case.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. He says he bid the prosecutor fasten the door, which way then could I get out?</p>
               <p>Lucas. I look upon it before Mr. Bailey could get to lock his door that he made his escape out of the back door; the back door goes with a spring lock.</p>

               <p>Q. Might he have done so?</p>
               <p>Lucas. Yes; he might.</p>
               <p>Q. to Bailey. Which door did you lock first?</p>
               <p>Bailey. I was so confused that I do not know that I fastened one of them.</p>

               <p>I said I was in the man's house and drank share of a pint of beer; that was all I said.</p>

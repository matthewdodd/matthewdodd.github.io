On the Saturday a basket of linen came from the mangler's, I did not look at it till Monday, the 19th, and then missed a shirt - I then looked into the prisoners' box, and there I found the pieces of leather; they had but one box between them; I sent Froud out on an errand, and sent my little girl up stairs to see if she could see any thing of the shirt; she found the leather and told me - I went and found it there; I took it up to my husband, who was ill in bed, and asked if he knew any thing about it; when Froud came home he brought the money from the place where we sent him to, and went up to his master - and when he came down I asked him if he knew any thing of the leather in the box; he said "No; I know nothing of that in the box, I know of that behind the box," where I had found some pieces, and nearly a whole calf-skin; he said he had put them there; I asked if he had ever done any thing of the kind before; he said Yes - that he took a pair of soles and a pair of half soles down to his father's, and Robinson took a pair of soles and a pair of half soles to his mother; Robinson was not at home, but he came home about half-past nine o'clock; my husband asked him if he knew of things being put there- he said No, then he said "Yes, I did; and I took the calf-skin for a patch for my shoe;" my husband said, "Did you take a pair of soles to your mother's?" he then fell down - I went to his mother's residence at Merton, where we found seven pairs of soles, seven pairs of upper-leathers, and some other things - these are the articles, and these are what I got at Froud's father's; Robinson used to come to see her son, and I treated her like my own mother.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Robinson only said he took the bit for a patch for his shoe? A. Yes - we were not speaking of a whole skin; the calf-skin was not there then - the officer was present; it was a whole calf-skin except three quarters which had been cut out of it; they are all my cutting and my marking - the box was not locked - I would never allow them the key.</p>

On the 20th of January I and Groombridge went to Mrs. Robinson's house at Merton; I said, "I believe your name is Robinson?" she said Yes - I said, "Do you know Mr. Groombridge, I believe your son is apprentice there?" she said Yes; I said I believed there was some leather there; she said, "So help me God there is nothing here;" I said,"He has good grounds to think so - if you will let us search that will settle all;" she went into the other room -I pushed the door open, and saw her go to some drawers and pocket something, but I could not see what it was - I asked for a candle, and she said there was none in the house - I sent Mrs. Groombridge for one; Robinson tried to get out, but I detained her - I then looked and found a candle; when Mrs. Groombridge came back, I told her to see what was in Robinson's pockets - she struggled away, went behind the bed, and threw something out of her pocket - I stooped down, and found this parcel of upper-leathers; I said she had some more - her pocket was searched, and I found two pairs more in it; I then went into the other room, she said there was nothing there, but I went in and saw a bedstead case, I pulled it round, there was no bedstead in it, but in it I found this bundle of upper-leathers, which have Mr. Groombridge's mark on them.</p>

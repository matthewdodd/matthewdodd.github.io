               <p>the green oil-silk and some catheters, about two dozen, which he said was a sample of what he had bought of the Frenchman—he never told me the name of the person of whom he bought them; he said he did not know it, or the address—on the evening of the inquiry at the police-court I went to his house to fetch something, and I saw him and his wife, and I saw Mrs. Pettit come to the door—I took the prisoner into custody after the trial last session, and after taking him to the station, I, accompanied by Mr. Jonas Laing, the prosecutor's brother, went to the prisoner's place to search it, and found all this property (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), the whole of which was identified; here are 29 trusses, 37 dozen bougies, 39 dozen catheters, 3 dozen urinals, 21 cupping bottles, 24 pairs of cotton surgical stockings, 15 pairs of silk stock<lb></lb>ings, 2 pieces of green silk, 6 1/2 lbs. of gutta percha tissue, and one piece of silk netting—some were in the workshop up stairs, and some in the shop; the trusses were in the sitting-room—I asked the prisoner on the first occa<lb></lb>sion what property he had, and he said he had none except the oil-silk and the catheters—I asked what he gave the Frenchman for the oil-silk; I am not certain whether he said 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. the piece—I think Mr. Laing said, "You know that was under the price"—he said to me, "Oh! Laing would sell it himself for 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—I asked if he had made any entry of what he had bought of the Frenchman—he said, "No," he did not enter things which were bought, only those which were sold out.</p>

               <p>each other all the time they were in the shop—I did not take particular notice what passed between them—I have given you all the conversation I had with the prisoner—the prisoner accused Mr. Laing of buying stolen property; he was very angry—I do not think I have mentioned before to<lb></lb>day that he said he did not know the Frenchman's name—that was on the 12th February—I don't know why I did not mention it before; I did not think it material—I have been a detective about six years—I named it to Mr. Wontner; I can't say when—I think this was at the time I asked him if he had made any entry in his books—he said nothing about keeping the invoices—I took away about thirty invoices after he was taken into custody—I was in plain clothes on the 12th, as I am now—when I went in I said, "I am a police-constable; I have come for two pieces of oil-silk, or two parcels, that you received from a Frenchman yesterday"—Mr. Laing was present when I said I was a policeman.</p>

                  </hi>. I was apprenticed to the prisoner, and worked at his shop—I went to him first on 1st September, I believe it was 1860, to learn the trade of a surgical-instrument maker—the prisoner had a work-shop, but he did not teach me to make articles there, though there was work going on—he discharged all the workmen except his own brother at Christ<lb></lb>mas, 1860—I very often saw Bruneau there—I have identified him in Holloway Prison—the first time I saw him at the prisoner's shop was twelve or fourteen months ago—the first goods that I saw him bring were some elastic stockings—the prisoner bought them of him, but did not ask his name or address—I do not remember how much he gave for them—after that, he came very frequently—at the beginning of this year he sometimes came twice a day, and sometimes only two or three times a week—he always brought goods with him; elastic stockings, knee-caps, anklets, catheters, bougies, and French urinals—he generally came in the afternoon, but some<lb></lb>times in the evening—I have seen him bring yellow silk like this—this continued till his arrest—I did not know his name till I saw it in the paper—he always passed at the shop as The Frenchman—when he brought the things, either Mr. or Mrs. Wolloms received them, and I have seen them paid for—12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a gross was paid for bougies—I should think the least that the same kind of bougies could be got for would be 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a gross—I have seen the prisoner give 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pair for cotton elastic stockings, and silk 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I saw these red bougies lying on the desk or table in the shop-parlour—the Frenchman had been there half an hour before, but I was ordered out of the shop when he came in—that was about six weeks before the men were taken—I was sent up stairs when he walked in, and was up stairs for twenty minutes—when I came down he was gone, and the bougies</p>

               <p>were lying there; I had not seen them before he came—I was frequently present when he first came—I was first sent out about two weeks before the men were taken; that was the first time that I noticed it, and after that I was generally sent out—for a month previous to the arrest I was always sent out when the Frenchman came—I had a pocket-book, in which I made memorandums of the goods bought of Bruneau a week previous to 31st January—I remember writing in my pocket-book one evening when my mistress was there, and I went out and left the book on the kitchen table—I found it still lying there when I returned; but after I had been in bed some time I heard my bedroom door open, and saw the prisoner walk in; he came to the side of the bed where my clothes were lying, took my trousers and went outside the room-door, which he pulled to after him, I then heard him tearing over the leaves of a book, and afterwards tearing up paper—he then brought my trousers back and placed them where he took them from; that was on 31st January—on examining my pocket-book, I found that the leaf containing the memorandums about the goods bought of Bruneau was torn out—I had not been writing in the pocket-book; I took it out to take out a pencil, and that leaf was there then—I had made six entries in it, one for every day in the week, from Monday to Saturday—I remember there were bougies put down, and oiled-silk, with 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. put to it—I believe that was for two pieces of this green; but I will not be certain whether it was two pieces or one piece—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the pocket-book—here is where the leaf was torn out, the last leaf—I gave this piece of paper (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>) to the officer—I tore it from the wrapper of a gross of bougies which the prisoner bought of Bruneau for 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., five or six weeks before the men were taken; it is still in the same state, except that it is a little torn—I saw that there was writing on it, that caused me to tear it off—during the first twelve or eighteen months after I went there, Falleau used to come very often, but for eighteen months previous to November we had not seen him—he used also to bring goods—the last time he was there he brought two enemas, a parcel of trusses, a quantity of silk webbing, and some buckles—I have seen a person named Gregory there—Mrs. Wolloms gave 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for three enemas—Mr. Wolloms was in the country.</p>

Q.</hi> Will you swear it was not 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was not—this was on 31st January; I took notice of the date and remember it—I did not put it down in my pocket-book, but Mr. Wolloms might pay me another visit, and then he would see it, and that would make it serious—this "January 31st" in my pocket-book may refer to it—he would not know what that was, but if I put down "Mr. Wolloms tore a leaf out of my pocket-book," he would know what it was—I do not exactly remember what this "February 4th" is—I believe I put down this "January 31st" on the next day—I ran away from my articles twelve months ago last January—I went and begged to be taken back again, and promised to behave well and be obedient—he forgave me and took me back—he complained of my being with a boy named Hunter—Hunter was taken in custody in my presence for stealing one silver catheter, and two pocket knives—he did not say that I gave him the catheter, nor did I say, "What a fool you are for making up two different stories"—he first said that he found it in the dust hole, and after<lb></lb>wards that he bought it of a student at King's College Hospital—I said, "Why do not you tell the truth, you will not be believed now you have told two stories?"—I was not in custody for stealing the catheter and two knives—the prisoner endeavoured to charge me, but the policeman would not take the charge—Hunter said that I gave him the catheter and one of the knives,</p>

               <p>and then the prisoner endeavoured to charge me with it—this was Saturday night, and he told the inspector to lock me up till Monday, but the inspector would not—Hunter said this directly he was charged in the shop parlour—I did not say that Hunter did not charge me with giving it to him; you asked me if he said that I gave him the catheter—Hunter admitted selling a silver catheter to a silversmith in Holborn, but until then I knew nothing about it—it was immediately after Hunter accused me of this—I was prevented being in the shop by myself—the principal part of the stock was kept in the shop—I lived with the prisoner till he was taken in custody, and on the day that he was first brought up at Guildhall, I was fetched away by a policeman named White—I have been living with the officer Hann ever since—I have two or three uncles alive, they did not refuse to have anything to do with me after Hunter was taken—I was with my uncle last night at his house in Bloomsbury square—the uncle who had previously supplied me with clothes, has not since refused to have anything to say to me—he has supplied me from that time, and did so last week, at least his wife has by his direction—I have not applied to the prisoner since that for clothes, on the ground that my uncle will no longer supply me—the prisoner gave me one pair of boots at Christmas—I wrote these things in my pocket-book, because the prisoner bought them so cheap of Bruneau, that I felt convinced they must be stolen or not paid for—I believe there were six memorandums in the book—they were all on one page—to the best of my recollection, I did not tear any leaf out of my pocket-book—the first time I communicated with the police was on 1st March, I think—I should not like to swear that I did not tear out a leaf for the purpose of a memorandum—I only miss one leaf, and that is the last—I believe one side of it was red, like the colour of the book—the memorandums I made were only one side, but I cannot swear that it was not white on both sides, or it might have been marble on one side.</p>

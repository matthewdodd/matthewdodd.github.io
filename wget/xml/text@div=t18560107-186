                  </hi>. I reside with Messrs. Back and Barker, drapers, at Birmingham. I have a sister living in Maiden-row, Hamptead-road, London—on 20th Dec. I sent a letter to her, enclosing in it a half sovereign, sewn up in some flannel—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a part of the enve<lb></lb>lope and letter in my handwriting, and this is the flannel I sent—the half sovereign is now in it—these needles were in the flannel, and after putting in the half sovereign I sewed it round—it is now exactly in the same state in which I sent it on 20th Dec.—I placed it in an adhesive envelope, and closed it, and posted it myself about 8 o'clock in the evening.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of letter carriers at the General Post-office. The prisoner was a letter carrier in Dec. last—he delivered letters in the district of which the Hampstead-road forms a part—a letter posted on 20th Dec. at Birmingham at 8 o'clock at night would arrive at the General Post-office on the morning of the 21st, for the morning deli<lb></lb>very—the prisoner was on duty at the Post-office on the morning of the 21st—a letter addressed to Maiden-row would be sorted to him, it is a part of his district—he was the principal letter carrier in that walk—he had an assistant—this letter would be for his assistant to deliver, but it would paas through his bands first, and he would deliver it to his assistant for delivery—for some reason I had that morning, after the prisoner left the Post-office with his letters, I went up to the neighbourhood of his walk, and got there about 9 o'clock—I saw him on his delivery—I remained until he had com<lb></lb>pleted it, and then brought him back with me to the Post-office.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable attached to the Post-office. On 21st Dec. last I searched the prisoner in the solicitor's office at the Post-office—in his right hand coat pocket, behind, I found some torn pieces of paper, along with a quantity of other papers—they have since been pasted on this piece of tissue paper—he was asked by the solicitor, in my presence, how he accounted for them—he said they were a quantity of papers which he curled his hair with and so forth—Mr. Peacock called his attention to these fragments, and he said they were fragments of a letter that he had received from his uncle in the country—I proceeded to search him further, and in the same pocket I found this piece of flannel with the needles, in the same</p>

               <p>state it now—the half sovereign was not discovered at that time—he was asked how he accounted for the needles and the flannel—he said, one morning, after his delivery, he bought them of a man in Tottenham Court-road, near the New-road—he was asked if they were in the same state as they now appear—he said, "Yes," at first—it was then discovered that it contained coin, and he was asked again what he gave for them—after a long consideration, I believe he said 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he had not had an opportunity of seeing the half sovereign at that time, but I believe he heard it mentioned that there was a half sovereign in it—I think it was said loud enough for him to hear—he was asked again if he bought them in the same state as they now appeared—he hesitated for some time, and then said, "If they were in my pocket, I know nothing about them, I don't know how they came there"—at that time we could make nothing of the fragments of the letter, no more than "No. 2," and the letters "Ba," of "Barnes," and the "Ha," of "Hampstead-road"—the prisoner was allowed to go, and I went and made inquiry, and returned to the office the same afternoon—the prisoner was then called upon by the solicitor, to know if he wished to give a further account of the needles—he said, "No, I don't know that I am bound to say anything unless I choose, but I tell you, as I said before, I bought them in Tottenham Court-road"—he was asked if they were in the same state as they were then—he said, no, when he went to bed at night he sewed the half sovereign in the flannel with the needles, with the intention of sending it down into the country to his mother, but on account of the mails being so late that morning he had not had time to write his letter, and so he had not sent it—next day I went to the Hampstead-road, in company with a letter carrier who had been on that walk previously to the prisoner—we went to several No. 2's, until we came to No. 2, Malden-row, and found Mrs. Barnes—the prisoner was then taken into custody.</p>

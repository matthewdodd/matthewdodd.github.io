                  </hi>. I reside at 7, Bucklersbury—on 24th March, between 7 and 8 in the evening, I was passing along Blackman-street, Borough, on the same side as St. George's-church—I was suddenly seized by somebody round the waist—the person tried to catch my throat—my dress was torn open, and every fastening broken—my watch was taken from inside my dress—it was worth 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there was only one person who attacked me—there were a number of people passing, but I think at that instant then were fewer than usual—when I lost my watch, a man ran across the road and down Lant-street, which is just opposite—I called out "Stop him," and he was pursued by somebody else, but I did not see him stopped—I believe the prisoner is the man—I saw him pretty clearly; we were face to face—he first seized me from behind; then he seized me round the waist, and when he made the attempt at my throat, he was before me—the next morning I went to the station-house—I then saw the prisoner mixed with other men, and pointed him out as the man I supposed had done it.</p>

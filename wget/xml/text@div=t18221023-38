I saw the prisoner in the crowd; he struck a boy named Blake, on the left breast, with his right hand; I saw nothing in his hand when he hit Blake; it was a front blow. I heard a cry that he had stabbed him; the prisoner ran off; I overtook him about one hundred yards off, and took hold of his right hand, in which I found a pen-knife, I put it into my pocket without noticing whether it was bloody. I said,</p>
               <p>"You rascal what has become of the knife?" he opened his hand and gave it to me. I told him he had stabbed a boy; he made no answer. I took him back to the place, and found he had stabbed two boys. A surgeon was sent for, who said Blake's wound was dangerous; the prisoner was detained; he said he would never carry a knife again, and then he could not use it; that the boys had beset him, and he had said he would strike them with it if they did not leave him alone; that they had been following him, and beating him.</p>

            . I am about twelve years old. I was in the crowd; a good many boys were fighting with the prisoner - I was one of them; he said,</p>
               <p>"If you don't keep away I will run the knife into you;" we did not keep away. He had the knife in his hand at the time he stabbed the other boy, then walked away, and we followed him.</p>

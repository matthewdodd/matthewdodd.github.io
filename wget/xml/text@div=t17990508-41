             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Abbott. Did you find any bag of letters at Bristol, on the 31st of December? - A. Yes, in the Quay-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you happen to know at what house the Mail-coach stops? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Quay-street situated near the Post-office? - A. It is in the way that the Mail-coach usually goes from the Post-office to the stables.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, upon looking at it, know what bag it was? - A. No; I took it to the shop, and asked a shop-mate, and he could not tell me what it was; then I took it home, and kept it for two or three days, till my master told me what it was; and then, on Wednesday the 2d of January, I carried it to the Post-office; my master told me it was a mail bag.</p>
               <p>Mr. Abbott. (To Fry.) Q. Do you remember a bag being brought to the Post-office on the Wednesday? - A. Yes, the bag from Worcester to Bath, of the 30th of December.</p>
               <p>Q. That is therefore the bag that should have been delivered on the Monday morning? - A. It should.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. In the course of business at the Post-office, does it not occur that a letter intended for one place is sent to another, by mistake in the sorting? - A. Very frequently.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore a letter which might be directed from Worcester to Bristol, might get to London and not come to Bristol? - A. It frequently happens.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Is Clifton a place where persons resort for amusement as well as ill health? - A. It 
is a watering-place.</p>

               <p>Q. And change their residence pretty often? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore, gentlemen of that description might have one place at Bristol, and another at Clifton? - A. Very probably.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing more likely to recommend a man to business than his being civil? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And if a gentleman, with his servant, should ask him to take in a letter, is there any thing more likely than that he would grant it? - A. Nothing more likely.</p>
               <p>Q. And he said this man seemed to be a man of fashion, and likely to be a good customer, from his appearance? - A. Yes, he said he was a gentleman with a livery servant.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know of any thing more likely to engage a man to permit a person to have parcels or letters left at his house than purchasing articles of him? - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. This man himself represented to you, that this person, who assumed the name of Taylor, had bought some goods of him, and therefore he had permitted him to have letters left at his house? - A. He said, he had requested him to take in the letters for him, which he had agreed to do.</p>
               <p>Q. You have no doubt but he went to Clifton with the officers? - A. I have none.</p>
               <p>Q. This account, which he had given, was likewise confirmed by his wife, in his presence, upon the instant? - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Your enquiry, was respecting the name of a person which you suspected to be forged to this bill? - A. I had my doubts from the good character of the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Your enquiry, was respecting the person whose name appeared to be forged to that bill? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you could not find any such person as Samuel Taylor at Clifton? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. This man did not hesitate in giving you this account? - A. He did not hesitate much; he appeared a little struck at seeing me with the constables, which it was very natural that he should.</p>
               <p>Q. And you are a Magistrate too? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And this Taylor, he represented as having seen but twice, and once through a glass? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. However, he did not at all represent himself<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179905080066"></xptr>as a person intimate with him? - A. I doubted even whether he would be able to fix upon the man when he went to look for him.</p>
               <p>Q. This was on the 12th; the prisoner remained in his house, and in his business, and perfectly visible to all the world, from the 12th to the 15th? - A. Yes, he did, certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 15th you made fresh enquires of him, I believe? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take him into custody on the 15th? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was he taken at last? - A. I think at his master's; he was in his business.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore, though an enquiry had been once made, and that followed up three days afterwards by subsequent enquiries, still the man remained visible, and open to any steps that might be taken against him? - A. He certainly did.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time he was apprehended, he still remained in the employ of Mr. Snook, who is a man of character? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You say, he gave you an opportunity of comparing what you pleased with his actual hand-writing, for at your request he copied two letters for you? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. And he is taken up on a charge of forgery, writing that which he ought not to write? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet he actually copied just what you chose to dictate? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. So that he submitted his hand-writing to every investigation you could possibly make, of his character and hand-writing? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Though he was charged with forgery? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have spoke of the character of the handwriting, now, I would ask whether you have not, before you gave your evidence to-day, repeatedly, and repeatedly, compared the

             in the letter with the Samuel Taylor on the bill? - A. I certainly have; otherwise, I should not have given the evidence I have given.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you cause the prisoner's house to be searched, or assist in the search? - A. I caused it to be searched some days after.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the search, have you ever discovered the half ticket, or any one of the six quarters? - A. The officer told me he had found no such thing; he brought some books of his hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q. You have looked likewise at his own books, to form your opinion of the hand-writing? - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. This man has bore a very good character? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you put him to write, though he spelt some words like the person who actually wrote that letter, yet, in some words, or some word, he differed from it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe it happens with a great many people who make a fine appearance to spell very indifferently, especially these sort of gentlemen? - A. Very likely.</p>
               <p>Mr. Abbott. Q. His wife had often seen Taylor? - A. She had seen him often; and once changed a ten pound note for him.</p>
               <p>Q. My learned Friend has asked you a great deal about the company at Clifton; is it a probable thing, that a person residing at Clifton, should go to a house like the prisoner's, at Bristol, to buy huckster's goods? - A. I should think not.</p>
               <p>Q. And he had come to this house for a month or six weeks before, at different times? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the wife say that in his presence? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. From having seen that hand-writing upon the bill, and having seen him write, you form your opinion that it is the prisoner's hand-writing? - A. Yes; and seeing him write is the principal ingredient of my belief.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Did you state to the prisoner any motive for your wishing him to write two letters? - A. No, I did not; we gave him to understand, that we had no faith in his account of Taylor, and desired him to write these letters, which he complied with instantly.</p>

               <p>Q. What letter was it that he did copy? - A. He wrote this letter, (producing it), in my presence, from my dictation; while he was writing it, he asked me as to the spelling of the word price; he said, is it not spelt with a zad; and he spelt it with a z.</p>
               <p>Q. From having seen him write, and having been sent by Mr. Daubeny for that purpose, bearing that in your mind - I ask you whether the endorsement of

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I perceive there is another difference in the letter, which Mr. Daubeny did not mention; in the one it is return, in the other, ruturn; and in one, plase, and in the other, pleas.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hasselden. I am not certain whether the sum in the bill is 27l. or 28l. I believe it to be 28l. I have a doubt whether it is an eight or a one; I made a copy of it, and copied it as a bill of 28l.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. The indictment is a bill of 21l.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hasselden. I cannot say whether it is 21l. or 28l.</p>
               <p>Jury. We believe it is 21l.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Grose. That which makes it appear like an 8, is a streak of dirt.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jackson. (To Humphreys). Q. It was sixteen days after that he was taken up? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. He had been pursuing his ordinary vocation? - A. He had.</p>
               <p>Q. When you stated that Mr. Alderman Daubeny wished him to copy this letter, he did it instantly from your dictation? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen him write before? - A. No, I never had.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had not had this means of comparison, you would not have been able to form an opinion? - A. Certainly I should not.</p>
               <p>Q. He is a man of extremely respectable character? - A. I always considered him an honest, good kind of man, I never heard any thing against him.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fielding. Q. You live at Bristol? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner was your porter? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the usual hour of his coming to your house in the morning? - A. About seven.</p>
               <p>Q. How far distant is his house from your's? - A. Not near a quarter of a mile, about the half quarter.</p>
               <p>Q. You are in the habit of seeing him daily; what time in the morning did you generally see him? - A. We have a large yard behind the house, and he goes there to look after horses, so that I do not see him sometimes till nine.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you recollect, about the 30th or 31st of December, what time he came in the morning? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember whether he was or not correct in his attendance from the 30th of December? - A. From the 5th to the 14th of January, he was absent nine days; there were two Sundays, so that it was a week; he had received a fall, as I understood, that was the consequence of his being absent.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has he been in your service? - A. Four years.</p>
               <p>Q. He bore a good character while he was with you? - A. Yes; he has been intrusted with large sums of money.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course, you have seen him write frequently? - A. I never saw him write any thing but his name and signature to an order book, to prove the delivery.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he use to write his christian name at length? - A. No, Geo.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think from that, that you can form an opinion of the character of his hand? - A. I do not think I am competent to judge of his handwriting.</p>
               <p>Q. He goes from his house to your's the same way that the mail goes? - A. I should have thought not; but I have been told since that the mail did come round that way that day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You understood this absence was occasioned by some accident? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You found him a faithful and diligent servant? - A. O I should not have kept him so long.</p>
               <p>Q. You took him from a respectable house? - A. Yes, one of the first in Bristol.</p>
               <p>Q. And you have trusted him very largely? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And would trust him again? - A. Yes, I would; he bore a vere fair character.</p>
               <p>Mr. Abbot.(To Fry.)Q. What is the price of a single letter from London to Bristol? - A. Seven-pence; a double letter, one shilling and two-pence, a treble-letter, one shilling and nine-pence.</p>
               <p>Q. What letter, coming from London, would have been charged one shilling and seven-pence? - A. No letter at all.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Then there is a mistake of two-pence in the amount of the treble letter.</p>
               <p>The prisoner did not say any thing in his defence. <rs id="t17990508-41-verdict242" type="verdictDescription">

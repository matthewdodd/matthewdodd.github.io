On the 10th of June, I hung my gown out in the yard to dry between seven and eight in the evening, the lady that lived in the second door, asked me if I had taken my gown in; in consequence of what one said, I pursued the prisoner and took my gown from her. This is the gown; I am sure it is mine.</p>

             FIELD. I lived in the second floor in the same house. I was looking out of the window; I saw the prisoner coming out of the house; she was wrapping up something. I ran down stairs, and asked the prosecutrix if she had taken in her gown; she said, no. I immediately ran after the prisoner, and catched her in Greek-street, with the gown. The prosecutrix came up, and took her gown from the prisoner. I am sure the prisoner is the same woman. The prosecutrix fetched her master he took the prisoner to the watchhouse.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was at the watchhouse when the prosecutrix's master brought the prisoner in. I searched her. I found four shillings and sixpence upon her. She had pawned a gown before. She could not give any account how she came by the prosecutrix gown.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the evening I was taken into custody, I was enquiring for a lodging; a woman came up to me with a bundle she told me she would find me a lodging; she gave him the bundle to hold it for her. I did not know it was a gown until these two women came up, and told me I had stolen a gown. I have been a servant, and suffered great hardships; I am an hundred miles from home.</p>

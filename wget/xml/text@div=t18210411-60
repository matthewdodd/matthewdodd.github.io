               <p>"I will give you 2 l. 10 s. more for these things than I offered you before," they talked together about clothes for some time. I was behind the counter, he told the Jew to go about his business, he would have no concern with him. He and the Jew both stepped out, leaving the bundle on the counter; the Jew came in alone, and asked me to try to buy them for him, (the prisoner was dressed as a footman) he directed me to give him 7 l. for them, and gave me a dollar as earnest; the prisoner came in and met the Jew at the door, and said to him</p>
               <p>"Won't you let me have those things my good man," he said</p>
               <p>"No, begone about your business, you rascal;" the Jew went out, the prisoner came in and sat down behind my counter, he said,</p>
               <p>"I have come to sit down to get rid of that Jew, for if any of our family saw me with that Jew, I should be discharged directly, though I have been fifteen years in my place;" he then said,</p>
               <p>"My good woman, will you have these things, I had sooner you should have them for 7 l., than that rascally jew for 10 l." he said they were three superfine coats, that his master gave the butler, and the butler asked him to bring them out to sell, as his master had died suddenly. I never looked at them, but bought them of him for 6 l. 10 s. I took out of a chest, a pocket-book containing three 1 l. notes, which I gave him, and a single 1 l. note from my pocket; I then went to the further end of the room, and unlocked a tea-chest, and in taking out my keys, I took out a small red pocket-book, which I laid on the counter, near to where the prisoner sat. I gave him four dollars and the Jew's dollar, he went away - I then missed my pocket-book.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. You thought you were buying a bargain for the Jew - A. Yes, the Jew said he would give me 30 s. to buy them, but I said no, I would not take 30 s. for the use of my money. I did not offer to sell them to Mr. Cohen for eight guineas. I asked him the value of them, I asked him to buy them, but do not think I asked any price. I said I was afraid when my husband came home I should be murdered.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What did you say to Cohen - A. I asked him no price for them - my husband did not know I had the money.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. How came you to give him silver, if you had notes - A. I knew who I took these notes of, and therefore would not pay them to strangers - I kept the notes to pay the baker. I did not tell

I had occasion to go to the privy in the yard to throw some water down, on the Saturday before the Coroner's Inquest was holden; I observed part of a child's leg and thigh under the grating; it must have been put down the hole of the privy; the grating belongs to a drain which communicates with the privy. This was in the morning. When my husband came home, I informed him what I had seen; he went out; and brought in the body of the child; it was a male child. I observed that the navel-string was not tied as it usually is by medical men and nurses after delivery. The body was quite putrid, and must have been dead some time; how long, I could not judge. The people of the next adjoining house use this privy.

She complained of a pain in her bowels, Before that time, I had never been informed that she was pregnant. Upon her complaining of this pain, I went as soon as I thought the apothecary's shops were open, to get some castor oil, but the shops were not open. I did not at that time believe her to be in labour. I was gone about ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour. I found her worse on my return; her sister was sitting on the bed by her, and I sit down by her also, and she seemed very much agitated, and in a great deal of pain. She took hold of my hand, and grased it, and her sister's, and she said, God will help me, and has helped me. Then she said, I am better, for it has come from me; and I said, what come from you, in the consternation I was in; she made answear and said, I don't know mother; but I believe a child. On that account, I looked to see what it was, and on turning down the bed clothes, found it was a male dead child; it appeared like a child that had gone its full time; there were marks of recent delivery on it, and in the bed. When my son-in-law came home, he was very much surprised, and said, what should we do with it; I had put it into a dry chamber-pot, which stood by. My son-in-law said, mother, what shall we do; we must get a box, and bury the child; that was first agreed upon. I said, I did not know what to do; the best way will be to hide the child, and nobody will know any thing about it, to hide the shame of the girl. I don't know whether he saw the body of the child; he did not say what way to hide it. It was taken into the yard; I took it from the room, and carried it to where it was found in the privy; I put it down the privy. As near as I can guess, it was near nine o'clock. My daughter was not told what was done with the child.</p>



               <p>JOHN PARTRIDGE. My wife is not able to come out; she was brought to bed last Wednesday was a week. I got up just before five that morning; my wife told me to get up, and go call her mother, as she had heard

             all night; I proposed to them, and told them, that the child ought to be buried in a proper manner; I told them that it would bring disgrace on my own family, and they might do what they liked with it, and throw it down the privy if they liked. I did not see the prisoner after it was born. My mother took it through to the privy while I was at breakfast. I never suspected what was the matter with the prisoner,</p>

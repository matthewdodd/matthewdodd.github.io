The first Evidence was one that liv'd in the House with her, and that the Morning before she was deliver'd, she complain'd she had the Cholick very much; but being ask'd by this Deponent, whether it was not something else? She said, No. She further ask'd her, whether she had never known Man? She said, no, never in her life. Some time after that she ask'd her how she did? She said she was very ill. She then ask'd her again, if she was not with Child, telling her that she was not the first that had been drawn away; and if she was, her Mistress would take Care of her, that she should Lye in handsomely. She still deny'd it; and this Deponent farther said, that she gave her two Cordial Drams, and that about an hour after that she ask'd her how she did? she said she was much better; but desir'd her to keep the Candle out of her Eyes. Coming up a second time she found some tokens of a Delivery, she taxes her with having a Child, pulling down the Bed-cloaths to the feet, but did not see any Child. The next Morning this Deponent coming down, saw the Footsteps of a Person, and trac'd it, quite to the Vault; upon this she told her Mistress, who caus'd the Vault to be search'd, and there the Child was found. There was another Evidence, who was Clerk of the Parish, who saw the Child taken out of the Vault, and that it was a full grown Child. There was another Witness,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="17111205003"></xptr>who took the Child out of the Vault; and also another who was the Midwife, who searching of her, found she had been delivered of a Child.

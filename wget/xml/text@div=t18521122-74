On the Sunday following 20th Oct., I went to stay with Mr. and Mrs. Lapham, when the child was ill—on 5th Nov., I and John Underwood, Mr. Lapham's apprentice, searched the water closet, which communicates with the sewer—there is no pan to it—first of all some water was thrown down to clean away the soil, and Under<lb></lb>wood there found this phial first—it had not more in it than now—I took it out of Underwood's hand, took it up to my sister and asked her if that was the holy water bottle—she said, "No"—we then went and searched again, and Underwood found this other one—afterwards, on the same evening, I saw the bottle which contained the small quantity of liquid in Mr. Sewell's hands—there were cracks in both the bottles, the same as there are now—I am not aware of any vitriol being used at Mr. Lapham's, while I was there.</p>

I am the nurse who attended Mrs. Lapham in her confine<lb></lb>ment—I left some short time after, and returned again—I left on 19th Oct., and returned on the 20th—I had not been there constantly up to the 19th—she was confined on 13th Oct., and I attended her three weeks—I had left eight days, and was sent for again, as the child was very ill—I left on 19th Oct. for one day—the child was five weeks old when this happened—on 19th Oct. I missed a bottle of medicine from the mantel shelf in Mr. Lapham's bedroom—it was a sort of brownish stuff, in an ounce phial—it was used for the baby to have a dose of it every three hours—at the time I missed the bottle the child had only had one dose from it—I gave it two teaspoonfuls—there were a good many doses in the phial—I asked the prisoner if she had seen this bottle, and she said she had not, and I and the prisoner then together made a further search for it, and in the course of the search I missed her holy water bottle from her mantelpiece in her bedroom—this is the bottle (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—she had had the holy water bottle all the time I was there, until the last day—it always looked the same—the medicine bottle was smaller than this one—when I missed the holy water bottle I spoke to the prisoner about it, and she said she supposed them that got the one bottle had got the other—I asked her if she had taken the bottle away—I supposed she might have taken it down to wash it—she said she had not—I made a further search, but did not find the phial—on the evening of the next day (20th) I was sent for again, and went to Mrs. Lapham's—I got there about 8 o'clock in the evening—the child was then very ill, all foaming at the mouth—I noticed a mark on its mouth, and on various articles of linen—I know what oil of vitriol is; I never saw any about Mr. Lapham's house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and reside at Lambeth-terrace. I attended Mrs. Lapham in her confinement, and I attended the child subsequently—on the evening of 20th Oct. I was sent for—I sent my assistant first, and then went myself—I got there between 10 and 11 o'clock—I found about two thirds of the child's tongue, the whole of the right side covered with a thick</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185211220095"></xptr>
               <p>white fur, and the inside of the right cheek, against which the tongue was lying, was in the same state—the outside of the right cheek was burnt; the skin was destroyed, and of a bluish appearance all down the side of the cheek to the handkerchief, which I took off the child's neck—it streamed out at the corner of its mouth, and descended to the neck—when I took the handkerchief off the child's neck I found several holes in it, but not so many as there are at present, because the handkerchief was very damp—I put my tongue to it, and it tasted strongly of acid—it proceeded through the folds of the handker<lb></lb>chief to the bedgown which the child had on, which was also burnt through the holes of the handkerchief—judging from the taste and appearance, my opinion is that it was burnt by oil of vitriol, which coincided with my opinion in the first instance—it tasted to me like vitriolic acid; it was a corrosive acid—I was quite positive, in the first instance, when I saw the ehild, that it was a corrosive acid—the strings of the nightcap were burnt in two or three pieces by the same sort of acid, and the child's thumb was a little burnt in a similar way to the cheek, and the lips were similar to the tongue.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How far inwardly in the mouth was the tongue burnt? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> As far as I could see up the right side; I had attended the child since 10th Oct., for inflammation of the trachea—on 20th Oct., and for some two or three days previous, it was quite out of danger from the inflammation—it was weakly, from the effect of the inflammation, and the remedies applied—it had been able to take the breast freely for those two or three days—after the 20th I recommended its mother, in the first instance, to put it to the breast, with a view of endeavouring to heal its mouth—I thought the nourishment from the breast would be the most soothing thing to its mouth; but it had great difficulty, and could not take it freely, as it had before—whatever it was that produced it, no doubt it must have given the child great pain—it was not at all like the thrush; it completely covered two-thirds of the tongue, on one side—the thrush would have been in small white specks, and particularly on both sides of the cheeks, inside.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> To what cause should you attribute this want of power to take the breast? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> From the administration of the acid, it was so far deprived of the power of taking the breast as to exercise a prejudicial effect on its health; it could not take sufficient nourishment—I continued to attend it till its death—it improved gradually; the appearance of the tongue gradually wore away, but on 3rd Nov. convulsions and fits came on—I had never heard of or observed any convulsions before—I attribute these symp<lb></lb>toms to the administration of the acid; no doubt it was a great shock on the nervous system—the child could not take sufficient, nourishment for its sustenance; it was wasting away, and the want of proper nourishment increased debility.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Convulsions frequently come on in young children, do they not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, very frequently; it is one of the most prevalent disorders in the bills of mortality.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You continued to attend the child till its death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; and after that I made an examination of the body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I suppose the immediate cause of death was the convulsions and fits? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Unquestionably; increased debility might make a child more subject to them than before—convulsions very frequently come on from teething; that could hardly be the case with a child seven weeks old—children are sometimes taken ill, and die suddenly, from convulsions, without any apparent cause; it may be caused by a shock to the nervous system, or it</p>

               <p>might be caused by some other and independent matter; it is impossible to say.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">put it to the Jury whether, on this evidence, they could be satisfied that the death was caused by the unlawful act of the prisoner: in order to convict, they must be satisfied that the convulsions which produced death were caused by some act on her part.

            , sitting at the window facing the door, they stood sideways within a foot of each other; the woman was rubbing something in her two hands, and the man the same; I instantly seized the man, and what he was rubbing, he put into his mouth; I catched him by the throat to get it out of his mouth, till he foamed at the mouth, and then I let go my hold; we then struggled, and I threw him upon his back, and secured him by tying his hands; I was afraid of hurting him too much, I could not get it out of his mouth, he foamed at the mouth, and what came out of his mouth was very black; I drew him from the window, because in the window was a quantity of six-pences in saucers; there was another saucer with a quantity of sand in the window; there were some corks, some scowering sand, a file, a pair of scissars; I turned him round, that he might see what I did, I searched the room further, and there I found a file, and in a box in the room this wooden part of the flask; at his feet I found a bag with a quantity of sixpences and shillings in it, good money; here is a pattern six-pence, which I marked, No. 1, that will answer to a bad one, it was found at his feet among the rest; here is another six-pence which I marked, No. 2, that answers to another of the bad ones, that was found on the woman Allen; here is another sixpence that answers to some more, a good one for a pattern; here is one No. 5, that answers to some that are in the pickle; all these good ones were found at James's feet in this little bag; at his feet was a grate with a quantity of charcoal in it; this charcoal had been burnt and was warm, when I took it; by the side of the box, I found a quantity of damp mould, and a stocking with a quantity of sand, by the side of the mould; by the side of the fire-place I found this crucible, and some other broken crucibles in the room; on the mantlepiece I found these two phials, one contained about a tea-spoon full of aquafortis; there is a little of the aquafortis left in the bottle now; in the other bottle is a composition of something, what it is I cannot say, and in the room in different places were some cork and scowering paper; there were a quantity of six-pences in the window, which the other officers took; I found also this get, which I believe is what conveys the metal to the mould; here is another instrument which was found, which Mr. Clarke will describe, he was present when we found all the things; we called him up as soon as we had secured the man.</p>
               <p>Court to Treadway. Where did you find those finished six pences? - In the window.</p>
               <p>How many finished six-pences did you find? - There were five in a paper, and two in some water, a quantity in some pickle, they have never been counted; I found this sieve to sift the sand over the mould, and this brush, these bellows at his feet, and some grease, and some other things that were found in the room; after we had secured the prisoners, and carried them before the magistrate, Treadway and me went to search the room further, to take up the flooring; we searched for the iron flask, as we had every thing else, and over the head of the prisoner James and Heyland, where they were at work, there was a hole between the cieling and the tiling, where this was put in.</p>
               <p>Prisoner James. Please to describe that hole? - It was as nearly perpendicular as<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178804020071"></xptr>possible at the outside of the window, there is a hole made that goes through under the tiling, and between the cieling and the tiling that was put in; Treadway said, here is something more; hold me fast! (he was afraid of falling;) and I held him, he took out a quantity of metal out of that same place where the flask was; I looked and he held me; I got a candle and looked, and found a piece of cork.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Heyland. How was I dressed when you came into the room, had I a hat or bonnet on? - I forgot, but she puts me in mind of it; she had this apron on, her hands being at work, were black; as soon as we entered the room, she rubbed her hands on her apron; Mr. Clarke being present, observing the apron to be burnt with aqua fortis, told me to take care of that apron, and take it from her, and she begged very hard for it, but I would not give it her; the man begged very hard for the key of the door before the Magistrate, but I did not chuse to give it him; he said, all the things were his and were not Heyland's.</p>
               <p>Prisoner James. What was in the pocketbook you had? - There were some letters, from one friend to another in their line of business, which I took the liberty of reading; I thought they might have been of some service to him, and I returned them to him.</p>

               <p>We wish you to explain to the Court and Jury, the several uses of these things? - There are the flasks complete; whatever is cast in these flasks, are generally laid on a board; when they have so done, they put what we call a jet, something like this; they fill it full of sand, and that lays on the middle; they put the sand upon it, and squeeze it down, and that takes whatever may be cast, shillings or sixpences, fixes itself on the sand; they first take the impression of a good sixpence in the sand, the sand is moistened; this is some of the coarse sand; after they have squeezed it down, that makes one side; then it is turned upside down, and the other remainder is put upon it, and then it makes the other side; after they take a finer stuff, which they call facing, and that fills the pores of the coarse sand, otherwise what is cast would come out in little spotty holes, this is the fine sand; then they are turned upside down; the impression that is cast; after that, they smoke it with something in order to dry the sand, then the flasks are finished and put together, only they take a little bit of brass or tin, and lead the impressions to it, such a bit as this is; the same as boys cast dumps, as it runs down this channel, so it feeds each place it comes to; in short, here is the complete apparatus for casting; when it is screwed down it is complete; this is the jet that runs down the middle, that feeds each place where it runs; this is what makes the channel; here are some bits that seem to have been cut off that have missed casting; there is one that is nearly cast; this is white arsenick, and what they refine the metal with, by melting the metal or copper, and whatever they mix with this, it adds one degree of white, and brings it to what we call East-India copper, or tuteneg; here is a bottle where aqua fortis was in, there is a little, there was more; but using aqua fortis by putting it in any thing where there is any silver, it brings<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178804020072"></xptr>the silver on the surface and throws it white; these files, brown paper and cork, are used to make them fine; the cork is to smooth them; the crucible is for melting the metal.</p>

               <p>You was present when these things were found? - I was.</p>
               <p>Is there a complete apparatus for coining there? - Not a doubt of it; all that is wanting now is the remains of the aqua fortis; this saucer with the others were in the window taken by the officer; I desired him to take care of them, for whoever had been at work, must have been at work instantly, for they had not been long coloured, and two of them were in a pan with clear water; these are coloured now with aqua fortis, and by rubbing, though they are so black they will come white instantly.</p>
               <p>Were they in a fit state for circulation? - These two that were in the pan in the water when they were first found were; the others were not.</p>
               <p>Look at those five in the paper, are they fit for circulation? - Yes, they are; I bid the officer wrap them up directly; these were found on the prisoner Allen, and these are said to be good shillings that were found on the prisoner James; that is a counterfeit, and that is the pattern; you will find on the woman's side, a hole, which you will find on the counterfeit.</p>
               <p>Court. Does that correspond with any one that has been handed to the Jury? - No, it is not; these were handed to the Jury, as well as all the others.</p>
               <p>Did you find any corresponding patterns, to those that have been before handed to the Jury.</p>
               <p>Court. It is not worth while confusing the Jury with the corresponding ones that were found on the woman; here is one that was in this pot, and here is the pattern that was found by the side of the prisoner James.</p>

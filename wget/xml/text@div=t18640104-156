                  </hi>. I am a painter, living at 37, North-street—at a quarter past 10, on Monday, 7th December, I was in Hyde-park, between the Serpentine and the Marble-arch—I had two friends with me—we were assaulted by two soldiers—they took their belts off—I know very little about it myself being rather intoxicated—I was either pushed or knocked down, and, I believe, my watch taken from me.</p>

                  </hi>. I was with the prosecutor—I had been drinking a little—we entered the Park at Princes'-gate, and had got half across, when two soldiers, one of whom was Burry, the other I don't recognise, attacked me and my two friends—I had a struggle with Burry—he got up and attacked the last witness, and then they both ran away—I did not speak to Swindler.</p>

                  </hi>. I was with the two witnesses—I had not been drinking—I was quite sober—I can speak to Swindler—we were coming along the path, and the two soldiers met us and said, "You can't go across the Park to-night"—my friend was intoxicated, and said, "What is that to do with you?"—we then got scuffling with the soldiers—after a time Burry went round and assaulted the prosecutor, and took his watch—I don't believe Swindler knew that the watch was stolen at that time—I don't think he was acting in concert in stealing the watch, although he was with the other prisoner—I don't think he knew it till afterwards—I think the prisoners were slightly in drink.</p>

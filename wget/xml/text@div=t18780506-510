He went away gene<lb></lb>rally in the morning and left the place in my charge. The prosecutor talked about the landlady being a friend of his. The boy told me that the waiter had taken coffee into the landlady's room in the morning and remained there a quarter of an hour, and often saw him come downstairs from the bedroom. I have seen him neglect customers. I went there to speak to him about something which I had not mentioned. He said when cooks did not do their business, it was his duty to discharge them.

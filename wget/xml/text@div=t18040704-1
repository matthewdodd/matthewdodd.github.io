             sworn. - I am an officer: On the 7th of June I had a warrant to execute on this gentleman; the prisoner at the bar took out a warrant for an assault on her person; I went to Newington-green, and I informed the gentleman I had a warrant against him; he then asked where the servant was; I told Mr. Jones I believed she was somewhere about the Green, I would go and see for her; I found her, and brought her to Mr. Jones's house; Mr. Jones insisted upon her taking her boxes away, and begged of me to assist her in getting her boxes out of the room, which I did; I moved her boxes out of her room into the study; Mr. Jones then said, he would wish to look into the box before it was taken out of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the box locked? - A. It was, and the prisoner had the key; we got the key from the prisoner, and unlocked the box, and there were two handkerchiefs, and a quantity of soap and candles; the prisoner seemed very much alarmed, and said somebody must have put them in when she left the house; as I was bringing the box down stairs, she seemed very desirous that her master might look into her box to see that every thing was right.</p>
               <p>Q. What kind of a lock was it on this box? - A. It was one of the crooked wards, not a common lock, and it was a crooked key.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Prosecutor.) Have you any other servant in the house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a married man? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I unlocked the box up stairs before it was brought down; I had been ironing, I put some of my things into my box.</p>
               <p>Ray. You did look up some things that were about the room, but did not unlock the box.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Prosecutor.) Were the handkerchiefs marked? - A. They are marked in full length R. Jones, with ink, and there were some soap and candles in the middle of her box; they were exactly like what was in the house; I cannot swear to the candles and soap, the handkerchief had been rough-dried, and put by a month before in the wardrobe; I put them away myself, they are winter handkerchiefs; I put the key in the drawer underneath, and she must have got the key; I have exerted myself in enquiring her character, and never could find any thing to hurt her character.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I quitted Mr. Jones's service by his ill-usage of throwing water over me, and he marked me in my arm with the pail; I left my things some ironed, and some not ironed; they were bundled up in a heap, and my box was not locked, I put some of my things in, in a hurry; I do not know that I have all my things, my double handkerchief I left on the chair, I folded it up, and put it in my box; I know nothing of the things coming into my box, without I put them in by mistake.</p>

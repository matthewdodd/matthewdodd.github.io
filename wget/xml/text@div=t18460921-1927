                  </hi>. I am the wife of Patrick Ford, of Upper Chapman-street, Ratcliffe-highway. On the 5th of Sept. the prisoner lodged at my house—I served him with a written notice that morning, to quit that day week—he seemed very much displeased—he had lived there five weeks—he said he would have revenge for such actions—he returned about half-past one in the day, and had scarcely entered his own room, when he made use of very indecent language towards me—he said he would let the Irish w——know soon, the old sow—I stepped towards the street—door, hearing the expressions, and beckoned to a neighbour's boy to fetch a policeman—on my return to my apartment I said, "My good man, you had better mind what you are saying, or you may get into trouble"—he said, "What, you b——w——, have you got any boiling water to throw over me?"—I said, "Yes, I have; and if you interfere with me, you shall have it"—I went into my own room and shut the door—I heard a scuffle in the passage—it was his wife wanting to keep him away, but he forced my door open and struck me with his fist as I stood at the table—I turned round towards the fire-place, where there was a saucepan with some slops in it—I took the saucepan off the hob, and threw the water towards the door, where he stood—he rushed in on me, took the saucepan out of my hand, and knocked it about my head—some of the water reached him—it was not boiling, it was only warm—there had been no fire since half-past twelve—he closed the door when I threw the water—he struck me three times on my head, and it streamed with blood all over—(I went to the station-house, and Dr. Stock was called in)—the prisoner's wife dragged him out of the room, but he made his way in again, took an iron plate which hung before the fire, and made a blow at me—I put up my hand to save my head—he struck my hand, shoulder, and arm with it—it made me quite senseless—when I recovered I found myself alone, but the witness was calling "Murder!" in the passage—he kicked me on the thigh when his wife was trying to pull me away—that made me unable to move from the spot.</p>

                  </hi>. I lodge in the same house as the prosecutrix. On the 5th of Sept., about half-past one o'clock, the prisoner came home and used I very bad language to his wife, and swore if he could catch the landlord how I he would serve him—he then said if he could get hold of the landlady be I would serve her out—he asked her whether she had got any hot water to throw I over him—she said, "Yes, if you dare to insult me I will"—she went in and I shut her door—he jumped out of his own window, which is on the ground floor, I opened the door, and followed her into her room, he struck her in the face as soon as he opened the door, and then she threw the water over him which she I had to wash the plates and dishes with—he took the saucepan and beat her I about the head with it—she fell backwards towards the fire, as she had run I towards the fire while he was beating her—as she fell, he took up the iron I hanger that was before the fire—she had not the hanger in her hand—I do I not know where he got it from.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you not stated that she ran <hi rend="italic">to</hi> the fire to get the hanger to hit him with? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, but she fell with the blow he struck her on the head—I know she was going to get the hanger because she made the attempt, but falling prevented her getting it—he took it himself, and struck her over the shoulders several times with it—he struck her once with his fist—I went for a policeman—the hanger was found in the prisoner's room afterwards.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in King David-lane—I examined Mrs. Ford at the station-house—she had a cut on the back part of her head about an inch long, and a quarter of an inch deep—there was a contusion on her left shoulder and on her side, on the lower part of her back and the upper part of her thigh—I examined her person afterwards at my own shop—the appearances indicated considerable violence—a saucepan would account for the wound on the back of the head—the contusions might be from kicking or thumping—they were extensive, went all over the shoulder-joint down the arm, and a little on the fore arm, on her side and hip and on the upper part of the thigh and back—I saw her about three o'clock—the bleeding had stopped then—the wound on the head was a lacerated wound—a blunt instrument caused it—this saucepan would cause it.</p>

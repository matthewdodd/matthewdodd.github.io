                  </hi>. I am shopman to my brother Edward, a cheese<lb></lb>monger, in Drury-lane. On the 18th of Nov. the prisoner came to the shop—I think she asked for two ounces of butter—she gave me a shilling and I gave her change—I thought the shilling was bad, and I pot it into the till by a six<lb></lb>pence, which was all the money there was in the till—my brother soon after<lb></lb>wards came into the shop—he went to the till and saw the shilling—in cones<lb></lb>quence of what I said, he put the shilling in a piece of paper and locked it up in a cash-box—I went out the next day, and when I returned in the evening I found the prisoner in the shop in custody.</p>

I looked at a shilling which he had put in the till—I asked him to mark it, and I put it in a piece of paper by itself—I afterwards gave the same shilling to the policeman—on the 19th of Nov. the prisoner came to the shop again in the evening for half a pound of sevenpenny rashers—she gave me a half-crown—noticed it was bad—I told her so—she said, "Is it?"—there was a policeman passing—I called him—he took her, and I gave him the half-crown.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Queen-street, Greenwich, and am the wife of Joseph Midmer, a greengrocer. On Thursday, the 16th of September, I heard the prisoner scolding some children, and two of mine were among them—I saw her up with her fist, and knock my little boy down—he is three years old—I ran down to take the child's part, and asked why she knocked him down—she said she would do it, and she would knock me down afterwards—I said, if she did I would make her pay for it—I then went to my own room—I had not been there long before I went out again, and she was at her own door eating some meat and bread—she had a knife in her hand—she began to abuse me, and said, "D—you, and b—you, and your children too; all your children are b—thieves"—she aggravated me till I hit her over the head with my hand, but I did not hurt her—she then pushed me against the wall, struck me, and cut me on the lip and eye with the knife she had in her hand—it was done on pur<lb></lb>pose—I called her a b—h, for in my passion, and the blood pouring, I was frightened—she said she knew she had cut me, and she would, for she meant to do it, for she would have my life—I tried to get the knife away from her, and a young man passed me at the time—I asked him to help me—I fell to the ground—the prisoner was rather tipsy—I had quarrelled with her before about her conduct to my children.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer at Greenwich, and live in Hogg-court. On the evening of the 16th of September I saw the prosecutrix <hi rend="italic">blowing</hi> the prisoner <hi rend="italic">up</hi> for knocking the child down—the prisoner said her children were nothing but b—thieves—she had a knife in her hand at the door, eating some bread and meat—she aggravated Mrs. Midmer, who hit her—she <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> Mrs. Midmer against the wall, and struck her with the knife—she made a blow at her with it purposely—directly the knife came from her, the blood began to pour on the stones—the knife fell on the ground—the prosecutrix was taken to the doctor's—I went with a policeman to the prisoner's—the policeman could not get the knife—he went next afternoon and got it—the prisoner's daughter gave it to him—she had such a knife as this now produced in her hand at the time—I described it the same night.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. The prosecutrix was brought to me on the evening of the 16th of September—there was a small wound on the forehead, and a slighter one on the upper lip—the one on the fore-head was a clean cut wound, about three-quarters of an inch in length—a superficial wound—the wound on the upper lip was such as a table-knife would inflict.</p>

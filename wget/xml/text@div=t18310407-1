On the 25th of February, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came there, and asked for some fat; I told him it was ready, and he took away five sacks of fat - I heard it thrown into a cart, but I did not see it: I had known him before - he used to fetch Mr. Morgan's fat, and I thought he came from him then; there was another female servant at home at the time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. CLARKSON. Q.Have you always told the same story? A. Yes, Sir, as far as I could- I was examined three times; they asked if I heard it thrown into a cart, and I said Yes, that was on the first examination; I said I thought the person had a smock-frock on, but I was not rightly sure, and did not swear to that - he had a fustian jacket on, but I did not swear particularly to his dress; I do not know that I stated to the Magistrate that he had a shooting jacket on - I said a fustian jacket; I did not say it was a shooting-jacket - (he appeared to me to be in a smock-frock) but he had been in the habit of wearing such clothes; I did not say I did not know the man, though I believed him to be the prisoner, nor any thing of the kind - the gentleman asked if that was the prisoner, and I said Yes; I do not know how I came to be examined three times - I never said I only believed him to be the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, which had the man on, a fustian jacket, or what you have now called a smock-frock? A. I thought he had a smock-frock on; I will swear he had a fustain jacket on - I have seen a Mr. Colney; I do not know whether he was examined before the Magistrate - he took his oath before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Should you have given a stranger your master's fat? A. No, Sir; I had been about two months in the place, and during that time I had seen him come backwards and forwards for the fat several times.</p>

            . I am a tallow-chandler, and have had fat of Mr. Collingwood; the prisoner had been in my service, and was employed to get fat from there, but I had discharged him on the 20th of February.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.How long had he been in your service? A.Two months, or rather more.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM COLLINGWOOD. I am a butcher - this is my dwelling-house; it is in the parish of St. Faith, under St. Paul's. I had sold fat to Mr. Morgan for four weeks, but Messrs. Marshalls had had it before him, and they had it again for a week before the 25th of February, and should have had it that day - the prisoner used to come for the fat for Mr. Morgan; when I went out on the 25th of February I saw the five sacks with a note on them, and when I returned home in the evening they were gone; the fat was worth rather more than 10l. - the next morning Mr. Marshall sent to know why he had not had the fat, and I sent for my servant to inquire about it - I was present when the prisoner was taken - he did not deny it, but said it was a pretty go.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you state to the Magistrate that the prisoner said it was a pretty go? A. I did not- he was taken in a turning up Hanway-yard, a place called Pepys-court, I believe, in the first floor of a house in which he lived; the Policeman was with me at the time, and Mr. Morgan, to recognize him - the fat had been sold to Messrs. Marshalls for a week before the 25th of February, and they were to have it that day; there was a note on the sacks stating the weight - I went out about six o'clock in the evening, but left no orders whatever; it was left for Messrs. Marshalls, and booked in their names; I left Brassington in the house, and my family; in general my men are there when the fat is fetched, but they were gone then - the prisoner was examined before the Magistrate; he was remanded to give an opportunity of getting hold of the receiver if we could - we have no doubt who was the receiver: we searched the premises of Mr. Colney, and we summoned him before the Magistrate - I do not remember charging him with any offence.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know you examined him as a witness against the prisoner? A. I deny it - I do not know whether he was sworn; his examination was taken down - we have no hesitation in saying he was the receiver of the fat; I told the Magistrate I had no hesitation in saying that the fat went to Colney's - I did not see it go there; I never saw Colney before we searched his premises - Colney said no<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183104070004"></xptr>fat had come into his house for twelve minutes; we summoned him to answer before the Policeman, who swore he saw the prisoner delivering fat at Colney's that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it was as a criminal you took him there? A. I have no doubt he was one; I told the Magistrate my opinion of him; I did not have him examined on his oath against the prisoner - I believe his deposition was taken down, but I do not remember that he was sworn; he was not a witness of mine.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you not cause Colney to be taken before the Magistrate, and there examined as a witness against the prisoner? A.Certainly not, he was examined as a receiver - I cannot remember whether Brassington stated on the first examination whether the man had a fustian jacket or a smock-frock on; it is most likely that I had some conversation with her between the first and second examination- I think the officer had told me before the second examination that the man he saw at Colney's shop had a smockfrock on; I might probably tell that to Brassington - I do not know whether before I said that she said he had a fustain jacket on - I told her he had a smock-frock on, because the person where the prisoner lived said he had on a smock-frock when he went from the premises, which was a thing he never had on before; I think before that Brassington had said the man had on a fustain jacket, but I would not take upon me to swear which she said.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you summon Colney? A. He was summoned by the Magistrate, and appeared on the second examination - he was sworn, and the clerk was present, but I cannot say whether what he said was taken down - I have a doubt of it; I cannot say whether he was examined as a witness - the prisoner was not at the bar when he was examined - I swear that; it was on the second examination - the prisoner was examined first, and left the room in charge of the officer; then Colney was called up, and accused of receiving stolen property - I cannot swear that; he was accused of being a receiver, and then examined upon oath; I do not know whether his examination was taken in writing - I did not see him put his name to it: there was a third examination: Colney was placed in temporary custody for about five minutes - I am not the person who saw the prisoner take a cart of fat to Colney's house; Colney denied that any fat had been taken to his house - I do not recollect that he was present on the third examination, he might have been - I do not know whether there was any attempt on the part of any other officer to apprehended him.</p>

            . I was a Policeman, but have left. On the 25th of February, between half-past six and half-past seven o'clock, I saw the prisoner at Strutton-ground, Westminster, carrying a sack into Colney's shop - he had a white smock-frock on, and a white apron; I do not know what was in the sack.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Were you discharged from the Police? A. No, I left it to go after a situation which I have not got, but I shall have it; it is gardening at Mr. Appleton's, at Bromley - I left the Police about a month ago; I cannot say the day - I was ill at the time, and Mr. Appleton promised me a situation; I shall go to it, but I do not think proper till I have done my business in London; I did not hear that the Magistrate was about to discharge Colney till I was examined - I was applied to by an officer of the E. division to appear as a witness in the case; I believe the first time the whole of my statement was not taken down; they took a part of it - I was examined as a witness; Young came to our watch-house two days before the examination, and asked who was on duty there, and I recollected the circumstance of the prisoner carrying in the sack, and running against a boy; when I got to Hatton-garden I identified the prisoner as being the person who carried the sack - I looked in his face, and knew him - then a summons was issued for Colney to come; he did not contradict on his oath, every word I said - he denied that the prisoner had been there that evening - I do not know whether Colney was charged as a receiver; I was not present all the time of the examination - I did not see what he said taken down in writing; he was allowed to go home after it was settled- I only saw him once at the office; I have seen him several times at his shop in Strutton-ground.</p>

I received a summons to attend before the Justice when the prisoner was to be examined; it was a fortnight or three weeks ago; I cannot say whether I was summoned as a witness or charged with any offence; I do not think the summons specified that, it ordered me to be and appear before the Magistrate; I was not taken into custody - no charge was preferred against me - I saw Mr. Collingwood there; I do not recollect that he told the Magistrate I was the receiver - I was examined and sworn by the clerk; the prisoner was before the Magistrate at the time - I did not sign any thing after I was sworn; I heard the officer state that he saw the prisoner carrying a sack into my house on the night of the 25th of February, but I do not know what I was summoned for, and I think he was mistaken - it was not true; I told the Magistrate it was not true; I was allowed to go home - I did not see the prisoner on the night of the 25th of February, nor for twelve months before, or longer.</p>

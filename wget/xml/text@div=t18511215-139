                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, M</hi> 136). On 28th Nov. I went with Lane to 5, Paradise-row, Christ Church, Surrey—I went into the back room on the ground-floor, and saw the two prisoners—(I was in plain clothes)—the female was sitting very near the fire—when she saw me come in, she threw something into the fire—I went towards her, and she had a number of coun<lb></lb>terfeit sixpences in her lap—she took them in her hand, and attempted to put them into her mouth—I caught her hand, and some of the sixpences fell from her hand—I afterwards took five sixpences off the fireplace—I found on the table this pot (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) and three bottles—I took the woman, and Lane took the man—we handcuffed them together, and took them to the station—I afterwards searched the room and the privy, and under the seat of it I found a bag, containing 135 counterfeit sixpences and one counterfeit shilling.</p>

               <p>think I had one, under half-a-crown—I took her to No. 5, and in going along she said she had no family, and her husband was out all day—I told her I could show her a little room that I thought would suit her—she gave me sixpence in advance, and she came and occupied the room four days.</p>

On 5th Septmber I went into the Magpie at Harmonsworth, in the morning, and the prisoner came in in the afternoon—I had some beer and gin and the prisoner saw me pay for it—I had two bags, one in the other, containing 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; there was a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note and some gold and silver and copper—I felt the worse for what I had take, and went into a field and laid down, as I had done previously in the day—I was awoke in a quarter of an hour by the prisoner extracting the money from my pocket—I felt for my purse and it was gone, I had felt it safe not twenty minutes before—she ran away—I got up and gave information to the police, and they showed me this 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on the Monday following—I know it by this name of "R Spittle" upon it; I have not seen the gold—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the inside bag—I had no connexion with the woman and never gave her a shilling—I am a married man—it was nearly 8 o'clock in the evening when she awoke me; it was light enough for to me to see her, and I am sure of her—she had been in the public-house with me three or four hours—she came down the day previous with two men in search of reaping.</p>

I received information and went into the Golden Cross public-house, Colnbrook, and saw the prisoner there with some money—I asked her where she got it from; she said that she earned it in reaping—she became very abusive and I took her in custody for being drunk and disorderly—she handed to me out of her pocket a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, and 7 182<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper—I found this bag on her—I had not heard of the robbery, but she was showing a good deal of money.</p>

                  </hi>. I am barman to Mr. Milburne, at the Albert public-house, Victoria Street, Westminster—on Saturday evening, the 4th of January, about 5 o'clock, the prisoner was standing in front of the bar—after he had been served he was using obscene language—he was talking to a companion—at the request of my employer I went to him and asked him several times to give over using bad language, and instead of doing so he persisted in using worse—after he had continued for some five or ten minutes my employer requested me to put him out—I got over to do so—I merely took him by the shoulder with one hand and asked him to leave the house, and directly I did so he struck me three blows with a loaded stick—it made two wounds on my head—I bled very much—I put him outside the house and held him till a policeman came and I gave him in custody—I did not strike him or use any unnecessary violence—he was not drunk—that is the stick (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>)—he held it about half-way down and struck me with the loaded end—I had to go to the Westminster Hospital as an out-patient, and my wounds were dressed there several times—they are now quite well—he was leaning his elbow on the counter at the time.</p>

I am proprietor of the Albert public-house—the prisoner was in the bar on this Saturday evening, leaning against the gas-bracket—he had been using foul language—I requested him I believe more than once to leave the house—I gave the barman instructions to put him out, and saw him proceed to do so—he took him by the shoulder and tried to take him out, and the prisoner struck him on the head three blows with the thick end of this loaded stick—a customer took the stick from him—he cried out, "Give me my stick," and tried to get it back, but the customer held it till it was given to the police-constable—I saw the barman bleeding—the prisoner was sober, but had had a little drink.</p>

I am house-surgeon at the Westminster Hospital—the prosecutor was brought there about 7.30 on Saturday evening, 4th January—I found two lacerated wounds on the top of his head, the front one an inch in length, going down to the bone—the other two inches in length, from side to side—I dressed them twice or thrice—the injuries might be caused by the stick produced—he went on well.</p>

There were two wounds—it would have been impossible for the two wounds to have been caused by one blow with the knobs on the stick—they were some distance apart—they were not dangerous—they were caused by the smooth part of the stick—I am not aware the prisoner had been in the infirmary—he was no patient of mine.</p>

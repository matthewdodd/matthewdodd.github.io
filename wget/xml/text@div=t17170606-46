The Prisoner objected against the Legality of Holiday's Evidence, alledging that he had been convicted of Felony, and had not performed the Conditions of his Pardon. The former part of his Allegation was allow'd; but that he had not fulfilled the Conditions of his Pardon was not prov'd and therefore the Court accepted him as a Legal Evidence, Whereupon William Holiday deposed, That the Prisoner brought him first acquainted with Williams and Chessey , which was upon the 18th of January, and that he recommended them to him as stout Fellows, fit to undertake any bold Enterprize and that at that time they projected the robbing of the Bost-boy, he going with them to procure horses to put the Design in execution, telling him likewise he would borrow Pistols for him, but did not, but brought them Bags to put the Letters in, and that he was to have 6 Guineas a man of them for his Share, and that he came to Chessey's house the morning after he had robbed the Post, and that who' he did not come up, he saw him out at the Window. Mary Holiday deposed, that the night before, when her Husband was going away, he told her, that he did not know that he should come home that night, but if he did not, he should go out of Town, bidding her, if he did not, to go to Smith's Lodgings, and he would direct her to find him; and that accordingly she went to Smith about 7 or 8 of the clock the next morning, when he was in bed, but coming down to her underst , she lent him her lanthorn and candle, and he went up and dressed himself, came down to her, and went with her to Chessey's Lodging, in Fetter-lane, and seeing the Portes at the door, was angry they were not sent home, bidding her to tell them to seed the Horses home, left by them they should be betray'd , and that he would no go up to them, because he said it was scandalous house, and the noise of the fact would soon be all over the Town, and there they would be in danger of being apprehended; that she went up stairs, found her Husband, Williams, and Chessey, all over dirt, an like frighted men, busie in opening Letters ; that when she came in her Husband was very angry at her coming, ask'd how she came, she told them Smith had brought her; that then Williams reply'd Why did he not come up? she said, he would not, Williams reply'd, G - A - him ! What, has he put us upon it and now will not be seen in it? That then she went down to Smith, but he would not go up; she asked him what they had done; he answered her, taken the Mail; she asked him, what might be the Consequence (meaning the Advantage;) he reply'd 5 or 6000 l. and she being uneasy he said to her, What need you be uneasy? You will soon be made a Gentlewoman . She depos'd likewise, That he preposed they should carry the Letters into some empty House to open and telling her that he could not attend that Day because he most attend a Law Suit he had. She deposed likewise, that she afterwards saw him look upon a Note which she describ'd and was produc'd in Court, telling him it was a Chequer-Note of 100 l. and also another Paper which he said was as well, and saying he would likewise know the meaning of that too, The Prisoner objected against the Evidence of Holliday's Wife, saying that she was not his Wife, but that he had several in several places, and that Holiday had said, that he must have one in every place to swear for him in case he stood in need of an Evidence. This was return'd upon him that he himself had said, that as to what related to Evidence he could do as much as any body; that he had such Evidences that he could prove himself to be at while he was here. The Prisoner deny'd the Fact entirely, and pleaded in his Defence, That he was not with Holliday's Wife, as she depos'd and had Evidence at hand that depos'd he came to him between 6 and 7 that morning to draw an Affidavit and another that said she saw him in Westminister-Hall at 8 a clock. He made an Improvement likewise, that the Persons were not produced of whom the Horses were hired. He insisted on the Improbability that he should engage in such a Design and have no share of the Booty. He insisted likewise that the Prosecution was set on fact by some Adversaries whom he was suing as Creditor on account of a statute of Bankruptcy taken out against one

I live at 14, Methley Street—at the time in question I was in bed, and was aroused by a heavy footfall in the yard—I lifted the corner of my blind, and looked out, and saw the prisoner on the wall which divides the two houses, with a sack in his hand—I slipped on my trousers and a pair of slippers, and went down—I missed the landlady's whitewash brush—I went out and saw the prisoner in Mrs. Allen's garden crouching down by the flower bed—I asked him what he was doing in the garden that time of the morning, and he said "Nothing"—I said "You be d——d for a tale; you are doing no good in the garden this time of the morning"—he climbed over the wall, and I ran along the wall at the end of our garden, and running along Mrs. Allen's wall I did not notice the glass on the wall, and I cut my foot, and I had to take the glass out, and lost sight of the prisoner—I afterwards went to Kennington Cross, and spoke to a constable off duty by a coffee stall—we found the sack in one of the gardens, contain<lb></lb>ing bacon, dripping, butter, eggs, and several other articles, which the police took possession of.</p>

               <p>Q. What made you go into Lisle-street - A. That is my nearest way home from Piccadilly.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in liquor at all - A. No, I was not. I was by myself. I was coming along Lisle-street; the prisoner at the bar, two more men, and a woman, I saw in Lisle-street. I did not see them until the prisoner accosted me. They came behind me; the prisoner laid hold of me on the shoulder; (they had a woman in company) he said I promised to give the woman some money, and that I had been ill-treating her. There was no truth in that; I had never seen any of them before to the best of my knowledge. He said I had been ill-treating her, and if I did not make her some compensation, he being a constable of the night, he would take me to the watchhouse; I told him I had no money about me. One of the party began to abuse me, and charge me with an unnatural crime, and told me I was a well known character. I was very frightened. I told him I had some silver, and offered them a three-shilling token first. One of the party asked what I had given him; he said, a three-shilling piece The other man said, that is not enough; give it him back; if he does not give you more I will knock the b - y b - r in the kennel. The prisoner had hold of me all the while. The prisoner gave me the three-shilling token back. I began to be very much frightened. I put my hand into my pocket, and took out an eighteen-penny token and a shilling, and with the three-shilling token, I gave it to the prisoner at the bar. Then they left me, and I went away home.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner, you say, had hold of you - A. Yes, he had hold of me all the while. He was the first man that accosted me.</p>
               <p>
            
                  <persName id="t18140706-3-person81">Q. </persName>
            You did not part with any money voluntary - A. I was very much frightened. I gave it to him to get rid of them. I was under terror at the time; very much so. That terror was produced by their language, and their threats to me, what they would do.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the prisoner again - A. The 19th was on Thursday, I saw the prisoner again on the Saturday following, under the Piazzas, Covent Garden, near Mr. Robins's, the auctioneer's, door.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason had you for suggesting the prisoner to be the same person - A. He was holding<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181407060005"></xptr>me all the while; I had such an opportunity of observing his person, as to be sure he is the same person. I think it was moonlight. It was very starlight.</p>
               <p>Q. From first to last, how long were they with you - A. It might be ten minutes altogether.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner the person who principally spoke - A. No; he had hold of me all the while, and he took the money</p>
               <p>Q. You saw him on Saturday under the Piazzas - A. Yes. I went up to him, and spoke to him, and said, you are a constable of the night, are not you; no, he said. I then said, do not you remember the circumstance that took place in Lisle-street. He walked away. I followed him up James-street, Covent Garden. He said he was going home to his lodging. When he got into Cross-street, he ran away; I pursued him. He went into a public-house in King-street; he said, you may follow me in here; I am well known in here; I have lodged here some years. I followed him in, and saw him in the tap-room; then I came out and got the patrol, and had him apprehended.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did you go to get the patrol - A. The patrol, I believe, was at the door; he heard me call out.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner any opportunity of getting out of that house before you returned with the patrol - A. No. The patrol went in. There was a piece of work with the landlord and some of the people. This person came out; he was taken about half a dozen doors from that house.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any opportunity of getting away before the patrol came - A. I do not think he could.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is King-street from Cross-street - A. About fifty or sixty yards. King-street and Cross-street is in a line. He ran so quick I could hardly overtake him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you cry stop thief - A. No, I did not. I was so much agitated I did not know what to do hardly.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any body with you on this Saturday night - A. No. He was taken before the magistrate, and was remanded until the Thursday morning. In the interim I had this letter sent; I don't know who it came from. He was brought up on the Thursday following; he was remanded for another examination. He was taken ill in prison; it was three or four weeks before he was committed; he was never out of custody afterwards.</p>

            . I am patrol of St. Giles's and St. George's, Bloomsbury. All I know, I took the prisoner in custody on Saturday the 21st, about twelve o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you when Scotland spoke to you - A. I was in King-street, Seven Dials. When he called watch, I was near as I am to the bench. He called watch. The prosecutor said the prisoner had robbed him. I went and took the prisoner into custody. On Monday, the prosecutor gave evidence against the prisoner at Marlborough-street; the prisoner denied every thing of it, and also at the watch-house. The prisoner said, before the magistrate, had it not been for him the prosecutor would have been very roughly used.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have nothing more to say than what I said before the magistrate. I was coming along Leicester-square; I turned up Leicester-place; I met a woman; she said, see how I have been used by that person over there, in Lisle-street; he agreed to give me half a crown, and now he has had his will of me, he has given me nothing. I said, charge the watch with him; she called out watch immediately. He said he meaned to give her something, but she was very impertinent to him; he had but little silver in his pocket. He then gave the girl an eighteen-penny piece and a shilling. That is all the money I saw.</p>

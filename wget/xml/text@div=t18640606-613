                  </hi>. I am a labourer, of 3, Carr-street, Lime house—on 7th May, about a quarter to 7 in the evening, I was coming towards the Salisbury Arms, Limehouse, with my wife—a lad, who was sitting on the step and whose name, I believe, is Holmes, had insulted my wife, and out came Cave and the prisoner—they both struck me—my wife came up to see what they were doing and Bush gave her a severe blow on the nose—the prisoner Cave knocked me into a baker's shop—Bush then put his hand on my</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Portland-place, Clapham-road. I came up by the Birmingham rail-road on the 12th of Nov.—I got out at the station, with my umbrella and great-coat—the prisoner was at the door of bis <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—he opened the door of his <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I placed my great-coat and umbrella in it—I left him with the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, while I went after my luggage—I saw it put in—I got in, and went to my residence—we stopped at the door—I got out, and went to get change at the next door—when I came back he had put the luggage into the house—I looked into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and there was nothing in it—I went into the house, and found the luggage all right, but the great-coat was missing—I had got the number of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and I met the prisoner on the fol<lb></lb>lowing night—I asked him where the coat was—he said he had not seen it, nor got it—he said I could not take him up, because three days were allowed to take things to Somerset-house—I took him to the station, and he was. locked up.</p>

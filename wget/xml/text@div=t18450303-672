                  </hi>. I am a farmer. On the 28th of Jan, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I was going home with a friend—I went with him to Baker-street, for him to make a call—he went into a house, and left me sitting in my cart—while I was there the pri<lb></lb>soner Barrett came out of a house, and asked me to step in, as it was very cold—I said I could not, as I had a great-coat and some other things in my cart, and could not leave them—she said she would send her son to mind them, which she did—I went into the house, and into a room on the right hand side—I saw Fowler there soon after—Barrett left the room several times—I sent two or three times for some gin, and I think Barrett went for it, but I did not take particular notice—I took out my watch and looked at it several times—I said my friend was gone a long while, and I must go—I sat at the end of the table, and Fowler stood close by me—Barrett was there when Fowler stood by me—I dare say I staid there two hours, talking and drinking gin—I think we had three or four sixpenny-worths—I got into my cart, and went home, down the Mile End-road—I was going to Stratford—my friend had come to me at the house—as I went home I missed my watch—this is it, and this is the chain I had—Mrs. Barrett teot me this letter—I do not know her writing, only by her name being to it—in consequence of the letter, I went to her house, and she told me she had found my watch—I asked her how she came to suffer it to be pawned—she said the other young woman took it to pawn—Barrett said she sent me a letter, and asked if I had received it—she said she found my watch at the end of the table, up in the corner.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable K</hi> 366.) On the lst of Feb. I went to Mr. Folkard's, a pawnbroker, in the Commercial-road-my attention was called to Emma Fuller offering a watch—I went out, and brought her back—I asked her for the watch she had offered to Mr. Folkard—she said she had no watch—Mr. Folkard identified her as the person who offered the watch a short time before—I put my hand to her bosom, and found this watch there—she said she lived at No. 9, Baker-street, which was true—on the 6th of Feb. I apprehended Fowler—I told her it was for stealing a watch—she paid she knew that very well—I took Barrett the same day—she asked me what she was taken for—I told her she was concerned in stealing the watch—she said if she ever found a watch again, she would burn it, sooner than write as she did to Mr. Watkins.</p>

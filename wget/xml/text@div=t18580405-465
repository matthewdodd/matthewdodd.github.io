                  </hi>. I am a shipwright. On 20th Feb., I was coming down New Cross Road, Deptford—I met the prisoner between 11 and 12 o'clock at night; I accompanied her home, and went to bed at No. 9, Mill Lane—she locked the door of the room, and I tried it afterwards—the key was left in it—I went to sleep, and between 1 and 2 o'clock I awoke, and found three men in the room, and the prisoner was gone—I went to put on my clothes, and I missed my coat and cap, and my watch, and two handkerchiefs—Ihad left them safe in the room when I went to bed—my watch, was under my pillow—I went and gave information—I went with, the policeman to the same house, about half-past 1 o'clock—we could not see the men nor the prisoner at that time—I went there again about 10 o'clock on the following night, and found the prisoner in the same room, in the same bed—she was alone—I gave her in charge for stealing my property—she said, "I don't know anything about you"—I have not seen any of my property since—I had been that evening to see a friend, and was coming home quite sober—I had never seen the prisoner before—I walked wiht her to Mill Lane—we went to a public house first and had some gin—we might stay there about ten minutes—I afterwards walked with her about a quarter of a mile—I went to bed directly—I am sure she is the same woman.</p>

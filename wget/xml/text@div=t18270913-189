On the 6th of March I returned from the Contiment, and on the 7th. as I was walking over my premises, I missed some posts from the drying ground; he said he did not know they were missing - I left England again, and returned on the 6th of July. My gardener had before that discharged the prisoner - on the 20th of July I applied for a search-warrant, to have his premises searched.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was present at the execution of this warrant - I found this tailladder; these articles were all on the cart, which were found on his premises.</p>
               <p>REV. MR. JONES re-examined. Q. Have you examined the wood? A. I believe it to be wood taken from my premises - I am convinced the shafts must have been my linen-posts, because they are perfectly similar in the nature of the wood, and because the two ends of the shafts are very dark, in having been in the ground and there me some of the rails in the ladder - they are the same kind of oak with some that have, and I am inclined to conceise it to be mine - I have not the least doubt in the world of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You are a clergyman you state? A. Yes; I am chaplain of Whitehallchapel. This paint on the rails, exactly corresponds with the paint on the rails of my sheepfeld - and there are five in another which corresponds with the others I have lost,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182709130104"></xptr>and the nail holes correspond with the nail holes in my fold - I did not miss these rails till the cart was found - I remained in this country till the end of April. These things usually belong to carts; my carpenter told me that this is a foreign oak; he is dead. I bought them of a timber-merchant at Edmonton - I was not inclined to press the case, because I did not consider it sufficiently strong.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were you under recognizance to appear? A. Yes. The prisoner was to take care of my horses, cows and sheep, when I went abroad. The posts were fixed in the earth; they were not in sockets, but in the earth.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Messrs. Hunter, the father and two sons, Mr. William Hunter is the father—they have a timber-yard is Boyd's-place, Shoreditch. A day or two after the 21st of May William Reader brought to me two outside veneers—on the 2nd of June I dis<lb></lb>covered on our premises a whole parcel, exactly corresponding—I was able, on discovering them on the 2nd of June, to say, that these pieces of wood came from the same block with those that were brought to me by Reader—I can swear it—they were the property of Messrs. Hunter—these are the veneers—(<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>)—they are worth about 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—there are thirty-six of them—in consequence of the discovery I made, I went with Attfield to the house <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the prisoner Cowland—he and Francis were acquainted—Cowland had purchased some little articles at our shop once—after Cowland was taken I went to the yard, and took Francis—I said, "<hi rend="italic">Joe</hi> Cowland is taken into custody for having sold veneers to Mr. Reader cheaper than we could sell them at, and Cowland says he bought them of you"—Francis denied it, and said he did not—I said, "Well, if you are innocent go forward and prove your innocence," and we took him into custody—I after<lb></lb>wards went to the station-house—Cross the officer searched Francis, who said, "You may as well let me search myself; I shall very soon put some more policemen to work"—and he pulled out several papers—these were papers which are generally sent out from the saw-mill—they are in Court—and he said, "You understand these papers, Mr. Clampitt, just look at them; these deals have never gone to Messrs. Hunter at all, they have been sold"—he said "deals" or "planks," I will not be positive which—we took the papers—he said, "I "have sold them and spent the money"—he said that a man of the name of Devonshire, Cowland, and <hi rend="italic">Joe</hi> had drawn him into it when he was drunk, and he had been carrying on the <hi rend="italic">game</hi> for some time.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 32, Church-street, Bethnal-green, and am a cabinet-maker. I had no acquaintance with Cowland before—I knew him, as I had been to his yard, to inquire the price of sawing, and seen him at work—on Saturday, the 19th of May, he called on me about eight o'clock in the morning—he said he had a bundle of veneers, and did I want any—I said I was not particularly in want of veneers—I asked what kind of veneers they were—he said, "Firs"—he said, "I have a bundle for sale"—I asked him where they were—he said, "Lying in the bar of the Porto Bello public-house"—that is just at the back of my premises in Tunrille-street—he took me there to look at them—when I went there, they were lying on a seat under the window—I saw them—there were thirty-six—they are the veneers which have been produced—he asked a sovereign for them—they were cheap at that, and I bought them—I hesitated, on the principle that I really was not wanting them, and on the other hand I was not, strictly speaking, prepared to pay for them—I finished, by purchasing them at a so<lb></lb>vereign—when I was hesitating, the prisoner said, "It is no consequence—I can take them somewhere down the road"—but where he said I know not—I did not ask him where he got them from—he told me he was in the habit of going to a saw-mill to measure timber, frequently in the morning, that he bad been that morning, and had received these veneers for his morning's work—I appointed him to call at my house for the money that day after two o'clock—he called between two and three o'clock—I gave him the sovereign—we went to a public-house, and had some beer over it—he said he would not make a dry bargain—he offered me some other veneers—he said he had some he could sell me for less than I was giving for them—I told him the price I had paid Mr. Hunter for some veneers, which he, on that day, or some day previous, had seen—he told me he could sell them cheaper both that day and at the public-house—they were what we call "rowey wood," which has a strong feature all the way down the pattern—I never had a specimen, I showed him the wood I was working, some was worked and some not worked—in consequence of this conversation, I agreed to meet him on Monday, and go with him to Limehouse, to buy some waste timber—after I had left him, I reflected on this circumstance, and went to Mr. Hunter on Monday—I do not know Matthews—I never saw Devonshire till that Monday, when I went to meet Cowland at the Swan public-house, to go to Limehouse—I found the prisoner Cowland and De<lb></lb>vonshire there, and Cowland said that his friend in the bar was in distress, and as he had been offering planks to me at 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each, eighteen in number, he said, "Will you, in order to assist my friend, who must be at Somer<lb></lb>set house at four o'clock this afternoon, advance me 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on account?"—in the bundle of veneers, I purchased of Cowland on the 19th of May, I discovered on the 2nd of June part of the name of Hunter in chalk—it was on a waste veneer which had been outside, but it was placed in the centre—I could distinctly discover the letters "unter," but the "H" was partly obliterated—I showed it on the evening of the same day to Mr. Hun<lb></lb>ter's foreman, and delivered it up with the remaining portion to Attfield.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, of Green Hill, Harrow—on January 1st, about 9.30, I was going with a team of horses and a load of manure into a field at Green Hill, and saw something lying on the green sward by the side of the lane, which I thought was a bundle of clothes—I touched it with the butt-end of my whip, turned the wrapper over, and found it was an infant—I picked it up and took it to my master—it was dead—I took it to the station and gave it to a policeman—I afterwards went down the lane again with another load of manure, and at the same place, just where the child's mouth had been, I picked up something like a sugar teat—the lane leads into fields, and this spot was 400 yards from the road—one end of the lane, leads into the road—the child was dressed in a large bedgown with a wrapper over it, a sort of stuff thing something like linsey—I examined nothing—it was a frosty morning, very cold—it was New Year's Day—the child was entirely covered—I could see nothing of it—I had to pull the things back before I could see what it was.</p>

I am the prisoner's sister, and lived with her at 7, Stock Orchard Terrace, Caledonian Road—she is a single woman, and is nearly twenty-one—we both worked together at needlework—she was an inmate of Islington workhouse from 13th to 30th December, for the purpose of being confined—I knew she was pregnant—we live by our<lb></lb>selves, our parents are in the country—she came back to my place on the 30th, with a female infant, which appeared about a fortnight old—she stated to me that the child was hers—she stopped with me that night, and left next day about 3.30, taking the baby with her—she had told me the previous day that she was going to take it to the Hornsey Asylum to place it there—I said, "We will try and get it into the Foundling"—she said no, it was not necessary, she was going to place it in the Hornsey Asylum, and was going to take it there the following day—(my father had been to London, and he was very much put out about it)—she left with the infant, and returned to my place at half-past eight, and said that she had got her baby admitted at the Hornsey Asylum, that she found it required a cloak, and she took it in a check shawl, and while the gentlemen were consult<lb></lb>ing, she made a cloak from the under skirt which she had on—she then sat down by the fire and had some refreshment, and shortly after that she went to bed in the other room, and I went too—that was December 31st—I said, "You appear dull; do you feel parting with your baby?"—she said, "I do feel low-spirited, but I know it has gone to a good home"—I saw the body of a child on the 6th, which I believe was my sister's—when she brought the child to me I looked at it and said that there was a mother's mark on the back of its head—I mean a redness—I did not see any mark over the nose—I saw it at Harrow, but could not see the mark then, because it was in the shell—I saw it in the coffin undressed, and looked at the back of the head to see if I saw the mark, but there was not any mark—I saw some clothes at the Harrow Police-station, which were the child's, as far as I can tell—I made this roller myself—that is what is wrapped round the body, it is crochet work.</p>

                  </hi>, M.D. I live in the Harrow Road—on 1st January I examined the body of a female infant at the Harrow Station—it was about three weeks old and was quite dead and cold—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination next day; there were no external marks of violence, but I noticed a discoloration just above the nose, and at the back of the head—with the exception of evidence of thrush in the mouth and throat, the child appeared to be fairly well nourished—there was slight congestion of the lungs and intestines, the remaining organs were apparently healthy, the heart was contracted on the left side, and the right side contained no blood—in my opinion thrush was not sufficiently developed to be the cause of death—the effect of the exposure of an infant on a frosty morning in January would depend upon the time it was exposed, and upon the conditions in which the child had been previously placed as to its having had food some hours before—if it had been there all night with the temperature at a low freezing-point, and without food, I think the effect would be fatal—I came to the conclusion that it had not been fed for some hours, because the stomach was empty—if the child was exposed the whole night in that condition as to food, that would in my judgment be likely to have caused its death—the congestion would be sufficiently accounted for by the exposure—I believe the state of the heart was caused by the exposure—from the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> exami<lb></lb>nation alone I could not say that the child died from exposure, but the appearances were all consistent with death from exposure—I should not be able to come to the conclusion that it died from exposure without knowing how long it had been exposed, but knowing that it had been exposed all night, I came to the conclusion that that was the cause of death—its having thrush would render it more susceptible of the influence of cold.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Does the existence of thrush show imperfect nourishment? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—it generally results from manual treatment—I have heard that the mother is subject to fainting fits—if they came on suddenly, going along a road, they would be likely to deprive her altogether of the power to do anything, supposing the faintness was complete.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Would the fact of the child having thrush, render it difficult to be fed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The soreness would render it more difficult for the child to swallow than if it had not got thrush; the very act of sucking would be painful—the mortality is greater among children fed on bread and milk than among those fed on their mothers' milk—children often die from being deprived of their mothers' milk.</p>

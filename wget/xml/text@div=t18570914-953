                  </hi>. I am one of the constables of Leadenhall Market. I was in the market on 10th Sept., between eight and nine o'clock, and saw the prisoner picking the feathers off the breasts of seven ducks; he said that they were his own, and that he had killed them at Homerton at 5 o'clock that morning—they were warm, and I thought they were not fairly killed, as one had its leg broken, and another was bruised over the breast—going to the station, he said, "It is no use telling a lie, master, I bought them of a carman"—he gave his address at Tottenham Hatch.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a nurseryman. The seven ducks are mine, they were safe at half past 7 o'clock in the evening, in my garden, at South Hackney, and the next morning I found that some one had entered the shed and eleven were gone, and six running loose in the garden; there had been seventeen—I have only found the seven; I missed them at half past 7 o'clock in the morning, and at 3 or 4 in the afternoon they were at Leaden-hall Market.</p>

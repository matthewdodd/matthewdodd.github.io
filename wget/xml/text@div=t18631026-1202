                  </hi>. I am servant at 4, Whitfield street, Hoxton—on the morning of 26th September, about a quarter past 2, the prisoner came to the house with a man—I showed them into a room, and left a candle with them—in about ten minutes the prisoner called for a jug of water, which I took up to her—she afterwards called for a comb, which I gave her—the man left about two minutes afterwards, and about five or ten minutes after he was gone the prisoner came down, gave me the light, and left—she ac<lb></lb>cused the man of stealing an umbrella—as soon as she was gone I went up stairs and saw the bed furniture, at the top, all in flames—I called Mrs.</p>

               <p>Turner and we put them out as well as we could, and Mrs. Turner went after the prisoner, and gave her into custody—she had certainly been drink<lb></lb>ing, but she knew very well what she was doing.</p>

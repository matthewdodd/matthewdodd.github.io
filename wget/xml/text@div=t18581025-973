                  </hi>. I am a cheesemonger, of 58, Cannon-street—the pri<lb></lb>soner was in my service about ten days—he served one hour during the day, from a quarter past 1 till a quarter past 2 o'clock, and he occasionally went down—in consequence of something, I marked three shillings and a florin—I gave the three shillings to Amelia Owen—I returned to my shop soon after—Amelia Owen came in, and made a purchase—I saw her at the counter—she was served by the prisoner—at that time I was called out of the shop—I returned, and went behind the counter; I took the money out of the till, and found two of the marked shillings—the officer came in, and I gave the prisoner in custody—I examined under the counter, and found a quantity of butter or lard, fixed under the counter, by the side of the till—it would be impossible for the money to jerk out of the till to that grease; it would fall on the floor—in putting money into the till none of it could catch on that grease—that is not the place where butter would be put.</p>

I am in the prosecutor's employ, and have been so eight years—I was in the shop when Owen came in—I cut a quantity of cheese for her, and handed it to the prisoner to weigh it—he served her with some butter—I saw him receive three shillings—he put two shillings in the till, and one shilling he put under the counter by the side of the till—I saw that distinctly done—I made a sign to Mr. Lane, and he came in and gave the prisoner into custody.</p>

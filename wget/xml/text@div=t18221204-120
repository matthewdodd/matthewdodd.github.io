            , a clothes salesman, who lives in Rosemary-lane. On the 14th of November, about half-past five o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came and asked me to buy a timepiece and shirt. I said I was no judge of any thing of the kind, and asked how a sailor came by a time-piece; he said the shirt was his mother's, but he brought the time-piece from Hamburgh; he left the shop, and returned about a quarter past seven, with a bundle much smaller than what he had before; he still had the timepiece, and asked me to buy the things. I said I did not think he came by them justly; he pressed me to buy them; a man came to the door, and said,</p>
               <p>"Halloo, I want to speak to you;" and when he got to the door, I caught up the bundle, and said,</p>
               <p>"Take your bundle with you, but he ran off without it." I was alarmed, and threw it out of doors; I sent for

             the patrole, who took it away. The time-piece was in the bundle; it broke in falling; Mrs. Arnold came up in about half an hour; she claimed the time-piece before the magistrate. Barry is not here.</p>
               <p>MRS. ARNOLD. I saw the time-piece at the office next day, and claimed it in the prisoner's presence; he said he knew he had taken it.</p>

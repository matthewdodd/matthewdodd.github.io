                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry Robson, a gardener, in Shackle well-road, Hackney. I am a laundress. On Monday, the 8th of July, I was returning home from Wells-row, about half-past nine o'clock—I am a stranger in town—I have left Newcastle about three years—I had a bundle of linen on my head, belonging to Mr. Blain and Mrs. Hart<lb></lb>ley—I was taking them home to wash—it was a pretty sized bundle—when</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183908120029"></xptr>
               <p>I was about a quarter of a mile from home, in King Hemy's-lane, a person came behind me, and knocked me down—he hit me on the back of my seek with his fist—the blow threw me into the hedge—he kicked me, and used bad expressions, and said he would kill me if I touched my bundle—that was after I had got up and got hold of my bundle—he snatched it from me, got hold of my arm, threw me into the hedge again, and took the bundle away from me—he threw me into the hedge by a blow on my breast with his closed fist, it was not a shove—he hit me right on the left breast—I got up again, and got hold of my bundle—there were hedges on each tide—he got away about two yards with it, and when I got up I got hold of it again—I snatched it out of his hand, and offered him money or bread if he was in want—he used very bad expressions, which I do not like to repeat—it was what he would do if I touched the bundle—he said he did not want money, he wanted the bundle—I would not let him take it—I stood to my bundle—I hallooed "Murder" twice, and a policeman came up directly—the prisoner never got the bundle from me again after I snatched it out of his band—the value of the articles in the bundle was about 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was hurt on my thigh and my breast—he kicked me with his foot the second time I got up, which quite stunned me and hurt me—it did not knock me off my feet—I think he had hold of the bundle about five minutes, without my having my hands on it—I do not know why he did not run away, but he could not throw it over the hedge—I hallooed dreadfully for somebody to come to my assistance, and be hallooed "Policeman" after I cried "Murder"—he had moved two or three yards from me with the bundle—the back of my neck was very black for several days, and so was my breast—I was not hurt in any other part—I told him in the struggle, that I would rather lose my life than the bundle, and he made use of dreadful expressions, what he would do if I touched it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On Monday night, the 8th of July, about ten o'clock, I heard a scream of "Murder," coming directly from King Henry's-walk, Islington—it is a place much frequented by day, but very few pass that way at night—it is very lonely about that time—I only heard the scream of "Murder" once—I went up, and saw some fe<lb></lb>males before me—when I got up, the prisoner had just met the females—somebody called out, "Here comes a policeman," and another female called out for me to take him in charge—I immediately took him back to the prosecutrix—he was about six yards from her, and nearer to me than her—he was with the two women when I got up, but I had seen the women running before me, and he had met them—they were about twenty yards from where I took the prisoner when I first saw them—when I first saw him he was walking—the prosecutrix said, "Take him"—I took him back to her—her hair was very much disordered, hanging over her head,</p>

               <p>her bonnet off her head, and her cap also—she said the prisoner had struck her behind on her neck, and she fell forward, the bundle fell, and she scrambled for it—that he again knocked her down into the ditch, and again got hold of the bundle, and she offered him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and a loaf if he would give her her bundle—I then took him to the station-house—on the road he be<lb></lb>gan pretending to cry, and said he was an unfortunate fellow—the prosecu<lb></lb>trix, with assistance, brought the bundle to the station-house—I opened it, and produce part of the contents.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You say he pretended to cry? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He made a great fuss about it, but I could see no tears—he was sobbing, but I looked at his face, and saw there were no tears—I consider he was a little the worse for liquor—the prosecutrix stated what I have said in presence of the females and the prisoner.</p>

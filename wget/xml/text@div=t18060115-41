             sworn. I keep a pork shop in White-cross-street. On the 30th of December, about ten o'clock in the evening, as I was coming home, I met my wife about twenty yards from my own door, she told me that two girls had run away with all the dressed pork, which had just come hot from the bake-house; I told her that they had just passed me, laughing; I pursued them, I never lost sight of them at all, I stopped them just at the bottom of Chiswell-street; I asked them what they had got, they replied nothing; I told them I must see, I took the piece of pork out of the prisoner's left hand, it was hot (the other young woman that got away had nothing); I then brought the prisoner home and sent for an officer, he took her to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was your pork? - A. I have sworn to the pork and could swear to it.</p>
               <p>Q. How did she contrive to hold it in her hand? - A. By the knuckle, under her coat, the knuckle was not chopped.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she sober? - A. I believe she was sober when I got her home; I believe she is a horse-hair weaver; the tradesmen about where she lives have given her a good character.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went in the shop with this young woman, I did not know her intention, she bought two polonies, when she came out of the door, she put this piece of pork into<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180601150032"></xptr>my hands, I asked her how she came by it, she made me no answer.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave her a good character.</p>

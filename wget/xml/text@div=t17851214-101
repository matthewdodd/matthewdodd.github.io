               <p>Court. The prisoner, I think, did not ask you for any money, it was the other man? - Yes, I told him I had none.</p>
               <p>When was it that the prisoner first came up to you with the cutlass? - When I said I had no money, then he struck me with a cutlass.</p>
               <p>What did he say when he struck you with the cutlass? - He asked me if Mr. Bethell's family were at home or not.</p>
               <p>Did he say any thing to you about your own money? - No.</p>
               <p>Then the attempt to rob you seemed to be over before he asked you that; did he do any thing with the cutlass before he rifled your pockets? - No.</p>
               <p>After he struck you with the cutlass he made no more attempts to rob you, but asked you about Mr. Bethell's house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who came up to you first? - The other man knocked me down first, and this man came up next.</p>
               <p>Did he come up to you with the cutlass drawn? - I never saw it till he struck me.</p>

               <p>Did they come up to you afterwards when the other man knocked you down? - The one knocked me down and the other came up to me directly.</p>
               <p>Were they pretty close together? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Did they appear to be of the same company and of the same design? - Yes, this man came up immediately to rifle my pockets after the other had knocked me down.</p>
               <p>Did this man say any thing to you about your money before he struck you? - No, they both of them asked me for my money before I was knocked down.</p>
               <p>What did the prisoner say about your money? - He said d - n you, you rascal, I want your money, that was before he struck me, I said I was a poor labouring man, he made no answer but searched my pockets immediately, he struck me before ever he talked of stabbing me.</p>
               <p>Court. After he struck you the first time with the cutlass was there any thing said by either of them about having any money from you? - No, Sir.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a gun-spring maker, and live in Marmont-street, in the parish of St. George. The prisoner De la Salle is my wife's brother, and Mordaunt was my journeyman—on the night of the 3rd of July I went to bed at twelve o'clock, and left every thing safe—about two o'clock in the morning De la Salle came to me for a light, and said he was bad in his inside—about half-past five o'clock in the morning I went down, and missed a parcel of 350 springs, which I had done up the evening before for the Board of Ordnance, and some of the springs were lying about—I missed a great coat and the other things stated, to the value of about 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I went to the Tower, to make it known that I had been robbed of these springs—I was told Mr. Manton was at Birmingham—I wrote to him, that if they should be offered for sale there to stop them, as I knew that they could not be sold in London—the prisoners were taken at Birmingham—Mordaunt had worked for me for nine days—I took him from De la Salle's recommendation—this is the gown which the prisoner had pawned—the springs were delivered back to me by order of the Magistrate, as the guns wore waiting for them at the Tower—I have only kept a sample of them—the other things are gone.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police officer, and live at Birmingham. On the 11th of July, from information I received, I went to the proof-house, and apprehended the two prisoners for stealing springs belonging to Mr. Purdy—they said they had taken them, and left them at Mr. Aston's, but they had not sold them—they intended, if they got work, to send them back—I went to Mr. Aston's, and got 289 springs—I brought the prisoners to London—I found on Mordaunt this wedge, these two tools, and three duplicates—I found this gown at a pawnbroker's, and this handkerchief at another.</p>

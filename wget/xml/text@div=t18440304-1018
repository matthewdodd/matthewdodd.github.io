                  </hi>. I am the wife of Edward kempton, and live at No. 2, Cross-street, Bermondsey New-road. On Saturday, the 17th of Feb., be<lb></lb>tween three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I left the house, and returned between five and six—I found the back door and back window both open—I had left them shut and fastened—I found a large bundle tied up in my shawl at the bottom of the stairs, and placed in the clothes basket—it contained the articles stated, which were nearly all new, and worth quite 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had left them in a drawer in my bed-room—I also missed a great coat of my hus<lb></lb>band's, which I had left on the bedstead in the back room—five minutes after I entered the house the constable brought the prisoner to the house with that coat on his back—he said he had found it—this is it—my husband has had it two years, but has not worn it much—I know it by the make and colour—the persons had got into the house over a large ditch at the back of my pre<lb></lb>mises, then getting on the back parlour window, and from that to the bed-room window, which they could easily open—it slides back—I am sure it was shut when I went out—they would get on the roof of the next washhouse, which is close against the window—nobody lives in the house but myself and hus<lb></lb>band—it is in Bermondsey parish.</p>

On Saturday, the 17th of Feb., between five and six o'clock, I heard a cry of "Stop thief" in the Old Kent-road—I had not proceeded many yards before I met the prisoner running as fast as he could with this great coat on—I stopped him, and took him to Mrs. Kempton, who as soon as she came to the door said, "That is my husband's coat that fellow has got on"—he said he found it is John-street.</p>

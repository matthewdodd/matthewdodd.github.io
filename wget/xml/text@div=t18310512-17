            . I am a medical-student. I was looking in at Mr. Killick's window, about half-past eight o'clock on this evening; there was no day-light - I heard somebody come in behind me; I immediately heard the glass of the window crashed above my head, and on looking up immediately I saw the prisoner withdrawing his hand from the window - I distinctly saw his hand within the window; I am sure of his person - Mr. Killick immediately ran out; I pointed out the prisoner to him - he followed, and overtook him; they scuffled, and came to the ground together.</p>

            . On the 2nd of April, about half-past eight o'clock, I had been to Hammersmith - I live in the Strand, and am out of a situation; I was out of a situation then - I have been a Policeman, but was discharged for a piece of work with another officer at the station. A soldier passed me at the top of Sloane-street, very drunk, and as he was going across the road he made a stumble, and, I suppose, stumbled four or five yards before he could save himself; I went to him, and said, "Keep yourself up, you are very near the barracks;" I followed him till he came to a pawnbroker's shop - he then passed either a man or woman, I cannot say which - they met him; they struck off the road, and he went to strike the same way, to let them pass - he kicked his toe against his heel, and went sprawling right up against the window; he cleared himself from he window, and ran towards Hyde Park-corner - I went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183105120027"></xptr>up to the shop window; a young man came out, and followed the prisoner - another came out; I went up, and said, "You have lost nothing;" he said No; I said,"Well, I consider it is an accident - the soldier was very much in liquor;" I went on, and saw no more - he was walking before this happened, but was very much intoxicated; I do not recollect seeing Field.</p>

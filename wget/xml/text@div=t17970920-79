I here is nothing but coffee and cocoa in that warehouse, the heads of the coffee casks are many of them open.</p>
               <p>Q. How much is there of it? - A.Upwards of two pounds; I am no judge of coffee, but in my opinion it is very iferior.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it worth sixpence? - A. I cannot pretend to say.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I went into the warehouse and put my coat on, I found it concealed under my coat, upon the head of the cask; I concluded, when I saw the officer, that he would, of course, accuse me of it, and I endeavoured to conceal it between my thighs, and he searched me and found it there.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, R</hi> 48). On Saturday morning, 11th Aug., I was in Nelson-street, Greenwich—my attention was called to a sieve of potatoes, under a window, which projected over the path in Nelson-street—there were carts and barrows about—the prisoner was five or seven yards off, with a barrow—he was passing in and out of the market, which is close by—he placed some cabbages on his barrow, then went into the market again, and remained there till near seven o'clock—when the carts and barrows bad gone away, he looked round, drew his barrow a short distance into the road, returned, took the sieve of potatoes, and put it on his barrow so as the name on the sieve should not be seen—I followed him, and said I wanted him for having more potatoes than he had business with—he said, "I have not, I paid for them"—I said, "You have one sieve there you have not paid for"—he said, "Let me go back, and 1 will pay Mr. Williams for them"—I took him to the station, searched his house, and found five sieves with "R. W." on them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am employed by my father, and have a stand in Greenwich market. The prisoner dealt with me—on 11th Aug. he bought two sieves of potatoes of me, and a sieve of apples—I went with him to the Admiral Hardy, came out, and missed a sieve—I saw it under a window in Nelson-street, and the prisoner coming back into the market—I gave informa<lb></lb>tion—the sieve and potatoes are worth 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> He has dealt with you two years? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he paid ready money—the Admiral Hardy is in a contrary direction to Nelson-street—he left his barrow in Nelson-street—nobody was with it—he bought some potatoes of me after I missed these—those were also marked "R. W."—he had been purchasing of other parties in the market that morning—I do not lend my sieves to friends in the market—the prisoner would have a right to take the sieves home, but should return them—sometimes they are neglected to be returned—I had about thirty sieves that morning.</p>

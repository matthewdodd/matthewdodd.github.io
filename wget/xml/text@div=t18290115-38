               <p>JOSEPH SHICK. I lost a pair of boots about the first week in September, from my house in <placeName id="t18290115-38-crimeloc182">Rahere-street, Goswell-road</placeName>

               <p>SOPHIA BURNHAM. I live with the prosecutor. The prisoner came one morning about four or five months ago, and asked if Mr. Joseph Shick was at home; I told him No. - he said he came after a pair of boots that were to be stretched - I went up stairs, and asked my young mistress - she told me to give them to him; I gave them to him to be stretched: I had never seen him before, but I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>JOHN ANDREWS. I took the prisoner on another charge I found nothing on him relative to this.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming down Islington, and met the prosecutor; he asked me to go and take a glass - we went to a public-house: he there said he had got a pair of boots at his house which wanted stretching, that he was going out the following Sunday, and was afraid of being hurt with them; I went and got them stretched, and was returning - I went into the Blue Coat Boy public-house, and there was a large party at skittles; I laid down the boots, took off my coat, and laid it down over them - when I came to put it on, the boots were gone.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH SHICK. I never gave him authority to go and take them; it was mentioned that they wanted some alteration, and my sister thought I had sent him for them.</p>

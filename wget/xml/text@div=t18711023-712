                  </hi>. I reside at West Hill, High gate—I am Assistant-Judge at the Middlesex Sessions—the male prisoner has been in my service about twenty years, as under gardener—on 1st October, last year, I left my gold watch, chain, and locket, on my breakfast-table—I missed them on my return—the window of the room communicates with the garden—I next heard of my watch on 13th September, from the police—this is my watch and chain—there has been an attempt, to erase the crest from the watch—the watch, chain, and locket, were worth between 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I valued the locket, as it contained a miniature.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. Rowley, a pawnbroker, of High Street, Camden Town—on 13th September, this year, this watch was brought to my master's shop by the prisoner—he wanted to know if I would exchange a gold watch for a silver one, and said he would call again on the 16th, which he did, and brought the gold one with him—I noticed that there had been a crest on it, and questioned him as to how he came in pos<lb></lb>session of it—he said his father had given it to him four years ago—I told</p>

               <p>him I did not believe it, and I should detain it, and he was to call in the evening—Mr. Rowley came home during that time, and after a conversa<lb></lb>tion with him I handed the prisoner a silver watch, and communicated with the police, and wrote to the makers of the watch.</p>

From information I received I called on the male prisoner on 19th September—I said "Stevens, I want to have a little talk with you respecting a gold watch that Sir William Bodkin lost about twelve months since"—he said "What about it, I recol<lb></lb>lect it very well"—I said "Very well, then, Stevens, in the first place give me the silver watch that you received of a pawnbroker in exchange for a gold one"—he then said "You seem to know all about it, I will make a clean breast of it; I did not steal the watch, I found it in the shrubbery six weeks after it was lost; I could not have stolen it, for the morning it was lost I was at work at Farquhar House"—he then called up to his wife and said "Bring down the watch"—she brought down the watch—I said "How about the chain and locket, what has become of them—he said "She sold them; she got 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the chain, and 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the locket"—I afterwards made some inquiries, and found that the locket was sold to a pawnbroker at Kentish Town, for 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it was very much bent, and had been sold to a dealer, and the chain had been sold to another pawnbroker.</p>

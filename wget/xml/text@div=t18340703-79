The prisoner's father works for my master - on the 10th of June, I was desired to conceal myself, and watch the prisoner - I saw him open a drawer in our shop, and take out this waistcoat-piece, and put it in his hat - I gave information.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were you there when he came into the shop? A. Yes, he asked my master for some wadding - my master sent him out for something - he did not leave his hat behind him in the shop - my master sent me out with a pair of trowsers, and when I came back I saw the prisoner come in again, with his hat on - he came for his father's wages on the Saturday night before, and master would not give him them - he said he wanted to see his father - the prisoner said he would not go out of the shop until he had the wages - but master was not angry - I never saw him angry - the prisoner's father came at last, and went into the counting-house, and the door was shut - the prisoner worked under his father - there is a square aperture over the shop - I did not look up to see if there was any female there.</p>
               <p>EBENEZER MANNERING. On the 10th of June, I directed Ash to watch my premises, and, in consequence of what he said, I went to the prisoner, took off his hat, and found this waistcoat-piece in it - it had not been sold - I said to the prisoner, "You are the thief" - we had had strong suspicion before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you had any difference with the prisoner a little before, about a coat, which he did not make properly? A. He, or his father, had done something which I did not like - he was rather impudent - I gave him a shove, and he went into the street, but the force did not push him out - I was quite cool - this was at the time he came for the wages - there is an aperture over my shop - there was no female up there - I had sent the prisoner out this day - the waistcoat-piece was found in his hat - he did not say it had been put into his hat by some one.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS to LAWRENCE ASH. Q. What did your master say to the prisoner, when he found this in his hat? A. I do not recollect - he told me to get an officer, and asked if it was his waistcoat - the prisoner begged my pardon, and Mr. Mannering's - I am sure of that; and he said he would not do it any more - he said so in my master's presence - I do not know that my master heard it.(

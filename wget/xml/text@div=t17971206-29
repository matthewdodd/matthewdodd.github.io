               <p>JAMES ANDREWS sworn. - I am a turner, in Slaughter-street, Bethnal-green: I saw the prisoner take a pint pot, on the 28th of October, about half an hour past eleven o'clock at night: I was in a box at <placeName id="t17971206-29-crimeloc162">the Crown and Magpye, Mr. Henshaw's, in Skinnet-street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17971206-29-crimeloc162" type="placeName" value="the Crown and Magpye, Mr. Henshaw's, in Skinnet-street"></interp>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q.You say you did not perceive he was drunk the first time? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.But he was the second time; now do you mean to say that he had been out long enough to have got drunk? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.How long have you been in the habit of frequenting this public-house? - A.Some time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know a person of the name of Mackley? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.He had a sudden death, had not be? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He was hanged, was not he, for the murder of Mr. Fryer? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew Clinch, did not you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it possible for him to have taken this pot without your seeing him? - A.It might be possible.</p>
               <p>Q. It was just possible, if you shut your eyes, I suppose? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Not if you did not shut your eyes? - A. No. he could not.</p>
               <p>Q.Then as soon as the men came in the second time, you poured your pint into the quart pot? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.What might that be for? - A.Because I had some other liquor in it, and did not choose to drink out of two different pots.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not you, or some of your comrades, been playing tricks with that man, pulling his coat, and telling him he must give you some beer? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you not tell him, if he did not give you something, you would play a trick upon him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Upon your oath, did not one of your company put the pot in his pocket? - A.No.</p>

               <p>JAMES HENSHAW sworn. - I keep a public-house in Skinner-street; me last witness told me the prisoner had taken a pint pot; I went after him but could not find him; a little while afterwards the last witness informed me he had taken another pint pot.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you see the prisoner return? - A. Yes, I did; I immediately got up, and the prisoner was going out, he wished me a good night; I told him I believed he had got something belonging to me, and I stopped him, and took him into the parlour, I sent for the watchman, and the watchman said he could not search him; Sapwell, the officer, then came, and searched him, he found a pint pot in his pocket, and the key of his room, which is in Lamballey, in Bishopsgate-street.</p>

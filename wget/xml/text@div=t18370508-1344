                  </hi>. I am eleven years old; my father is a shoemaker. On the 26th of April the prisoner came to our shop for two<lb></lb>penny worth of eggs—I told him he could have three for 2 1/4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he took them, and offered me a shilling—I said I could not give him change—he said he would go to the public-house and get it—he came back almost directly, and said he could not get change, and he would have more eggs—he took nine in all, and a halfpenny-worth of milk, and I gave him 4 3/4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change out of the shilling—I put the shilling into the till—I am sure the prisoner is the person.</p>

                  </hi>. I am mother of the last witness. I got a shilling from her, which I gave the officer—I saw the prisoner on the 30th of April; when he came for 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of eggs, and offered me a sixpence—I said it was bad, and gave him into custody—I said I thought he was the same man—he said he was not.</p>

When I asked him at the watch-house to produce the brass which belonged to me, which he had about him, he produced it; he said he hoped I would have mercy on him.

             sworn. Q. you work for Mr. Penton? - A. Yes. In consequence of information from Mr. Penton I watched the prisoner; at about a quarter after nine o'clock, in Golden-lane, I was walking to and fro, by an old iron shop; there I saw

             step up the steps to go into this old iron shop; I said Miller what brought you this way this evening, he answered me he was taking a bit of a round. I laid hold of his arm, and requested him to walk back with me, and when we came to St. Bride's watch-house, Mr. Penton gave charge of him. Mr. Penton asked for the brass in the watch-house, he produced it.</p>

               <p>Q. (To prosecutor.) Do you remember these pieces of brass being in your shop? - A. I have no doubt of their being my property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. From nine years old I have been able to get my bread with honesty; I have never been guilty of any thing before. When work has been short with me, I never was against volunteering in his Majesty's navy; till the fourth time of my going on board, I had a very bad wound in my right eye, I worked with that with honesty to maintain myself until this present period. I have nothing further to say at present, I lay myself on the mercy of the Court and that injured gentleman, my prosecutor.</p>

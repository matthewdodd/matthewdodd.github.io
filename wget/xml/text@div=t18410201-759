                  </hi>. I am carman to Joseph Fletcher, of Wheatsheaf Wharf, Wapping. About five o'clock in the evening of the 22nd of Ja<lb></lb>nuary, I received from the wharf three hogsheads of sugar and this coffee, to take to my master's—they were put into my wagon in Bridge-street, Blackfiars—I stopped in Tower-street—the coffee and sugar were all safe then—the coffee was in the off side of the wagon, near the front—I then went on to Ratcliffe-highway, and received information, and found the coffee was gone—soon after the prisoner and a bag of coffee were brought to me—I cannot say whether it was the coffee I lost—it was not the same bag—I had taken two bags of coffee into the wagon, and one was gone.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable H</hi> 141.) I was on duty in Rose-mary-lane about seven o'clock that night—I went into Dock-street, and saw the prisoner sitting on the step of a sugar-baker's, with a bag of coffee behind him—I asked what he had got—he said, "Nothing"—I shook it and asked him what it was—he said he did not know that a man gave him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to mind it—I was taking him down the street, and met the carman coming up—I took him to the station—he still said he knew nothing of it, but a per<lb></lb>son gave him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to mind it—the next morning, between eleven and twelve, we found two empty bags in Dock-street, about ten yards from where I found the prisoner—it was about half a mile from Tower-hill—there were 104lbs. of coffee in the bag.</p>

I live at 17, College Street, Tooley Street—I know the prisoner; she is a single woman—in August last a girl named Bryant had the care of this child; she is a young woman of 21 or 22, living at 9, College Street—she came to me with the child; it seemed pretty well; I got an order from the relieving officer, and took the child to St. Olave's Workhouse, and left it there—next day the prisoner came to me; she cried very bitterly—I said it was wrong for her to leave the child—she was not in College Street that day, I don't know where she was—she said she had ascertained that the child was in the workhouse—I told her they would deliver it up to her if she went for it—she said she was frightened to go herself for fear they would lock her up, that she had no intention to desert it, would I go with her and get it away—I went with her, and the child was given up to her—I frequently saw her in the street afterwards with the child—I can't say where she was living.</p>

               <p>after 7 o'clock, I was sent for to the workhouse—I found the prisoner there, and the child was in the some room, the reception ward—I looked at it—it was dead, and it had been dead some time, I thought about three hours; but I could not say exactly—I said to the prisoner, "Where were you when you found the child dead?"—she said, "Sitting on a doorstep in College Street"—I said, "How long had you been there?"—she said, "Two or three hours"—I said, "That was sufficient to kill the child, to keep it out in such a cold night as it has been"—she said, "I could not help it, I had no place to go to"—she was quite sober—I think the child's clothing was off when I saw it—I saw the state of the body; there were no marks of violence; it was very much emaciated and dirty—I made a post-mortem examination—I found the organs generally healthy, with the exception of a little congestion of the lower part of the lungs; that was from exposure to cold—it could not have been of very long standing, 48, hours would do it with a child—there was no fat on the child—the stomach was empty, and the bowels, with the exception of a little water—I weighed the child, it weighed 6lb. 9oz.—the average weight of a child of that age would be quite 14lb.—in my judgment the cause of death was want of proper food and exposure to cold—a child poorly fed would be more susceptible of the cold—keeping it out in the street all night, I should think, would be sufficient to cause its death, even if wrapped up in a shawl.</p>

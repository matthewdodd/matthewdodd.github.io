                  </hi>. I am a pensioner of the 7th legion in Spain, and live at Southampton. On the 19th of Oct., about four o'clock in the afternoon, I was going to Mr. Gray's lodging-house, and saw the prisoners together, in Pear-street, Westminster—I knew them well, and asked Watson how be was—he said he was not very well—I said, "Well, let us go in and have something to drink between us"—we all three went into a public-house, and some more besides—I do not know whether I-drank any—I had had a drop before—I had some silver, and seven sovereigns, and two half-sovereigns, when X went in—I am not exactly certain where it was, because I took it out in the public-house, and do not know which pocket I put it into—I had ray coal under my arm—I think I must have put it back into my waistcoat pocket—I should say I must have put it into some pocket, but am not sure—I afterwards went to pay for some half-and-half and spruce I had had, and took a shilling out of my trowsers pocket, where I had my silver—I think the landlord gave me some halfpence in change—I was not sober, but knew what I was doing—I went out of the house, the prisoners followed me directly—Smith ran up to me, and said it was a shame I should take Watson's two shillings out of his hand, and not give it him back—I had taken two shillings, because I considered he owed it me—I said, "It is no use talking to me, I shall not give it you unless you take it from me; if you can; <hi rend="italic">here is, begin,"</hi> and hit Watson—I said, "I don't care for you two <hi rend="italic">chaps,"</hi> and offered to fight them both—we had three rounds—Watson said, "d—me if I don't hare my own, I don't care how it is"—I was down twice in two rounds—I knocked them down in one round—I lost all consciousness when I was down, and lost two silver watches, and all my money but a few shillings—one watch was in one pocket, and one in the other—one was an old-fashioned watch, silver turned—I could not have lost them in the house, therefore I must have Jost them then—I am sure I had them in my pocket just before I went into the public-house, but am not certain I had them when I left the house—I went to the police-office afterwards, and saw these watches—they are mine—I know I had them in the house—I pulled them out there.</p>

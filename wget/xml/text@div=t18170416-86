On the 6th of March, the prisoner applied to me to lend him some pattern rings. I knew him before. I lent him four, in a case. He said he was to go and measure some gentleman with them. He promised to return them the next morning. He came, and had another the next morning, which was Thursday, and promised to return them in two hours, but he did not. I found two of them in pledge at Mr. Cox's, and he was stopped at Mr. Sadler's in offering the others.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL SADLER. I am a pawnbroker, and live in Aldersgate-street. On the 8th of March, the prisoner came to my shop, and offered two rings to pledge. Having heard that Mr. Glover had lost some, I stopped him. He said they were his own, and that he did not know Mr. Glover. I asked him if they were Mr. Glover's, and he, at last, said they were.</p>
               <p>ROBERT UPSALL. I am servant to Mr. Chilson, pawnbroker, Shoreditch. On the 7th of March, I took a ring in pledge of the prisoner; he gave the name of Wilson, Old-street.</p>

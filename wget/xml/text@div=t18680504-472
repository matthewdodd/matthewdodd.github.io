                  </hi>. I am a hosier and general outfitter, at 32 and 33, Aldgate—on Wednesday, 22nd April, in the afternoon the prisoner came to my shop—I was sent for from upstairs, and came down, and found him there—he said he had just come from New Zealand, and he required an outfit—he said he had been out there four years, sheep-breeding—he required to go off to the country that night by the mail train, to see his parents—I said I should require a good reference before I could part with any of my goods—he said, "I can give you a good reference; I can refer you to my father's banker's agent in London; I have transmitted home large sums of money to my father from New Zealand"—I said, "That will do, no doubt"—I looked at the clock, and found it was past 4—he then stated that he had some friends in Croydon, and said, "If you like to go down there with me, if you do not feel satisfied with my reference,—I can give you another"—before this, he had written down his father's name and address; it was, "R. H. Davie, Solicitor, Wellington, Somerset"—I went down to Croydon with him—we took a cab, and we were going to a friend's house—he did not tell me the name at first—he pointed out a house after leaving the Croydon station—we were going in the direction of the house when we met a Mr. Hooper—the prisoner said, "Here is one of my friends; he will be able to satisfy you what I am, and that I am the person that I represented myself to be," and he called the young man by his Christian name—Mr. Hooper got into the cab with us, and we went back again—the prisoner said he would rather not go into the house, he was not dressed sufficiently well—I understood that he was paying his addresses to the sister—Hooper seemed to know him well, and was quite surprised to see him back from New Zealand—I was satisfied with what he said—we then went back to the shop, and he had the outfit he required, which came to 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. altogether—he asked me whether I could take him to a-place where he could get a good dinner, and I took him to the Bell, in Aldgate—it was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186805040076"></xptr>
               <p>then late, and I stopped with him—after dinner he complained of being dizzy in the head, and he said he would not go down that night, but would go early in the morning, and he asked the waiter if he could be allowed to stop all night—he came to me early the next morning, and said he had altered his mind, and he should not go down to Wellington that morning—he then had a suit of the clothes on, and he said he should go down and make a proposal of marriage to Miss Hooper—I did not feel altogether satis<lb></lb>fied, and I said, "I am going down to Croydon, and I will drive you down"—we went down to Croydon, and he asked me to meet him at the hotel at 4 o'clock—he had a riding horse on our arrival, and rode over to see Miss Hooper—I did not get back till 5 o'clock, and I found him sitting at the bottom of the gig, intoxicated and almost insensible—I drove him home—he said he should go down that night, that he felt very much better, and should go down by the mail train; and he left to go to Wellington, as he said—he wanted to buy more things of me before he went, and I said, "You have quite enough; if you require more when you get there, on receipt of your cheque I shall send them down to you," and I took his measure for that purpose—he wished me good bye, and instead of going Leadenhall Street way, he went down Fenchurch Street, and that excited my suspicion, and I sent a man to follow him—in consequence of what he told me I went at 6 o'clock to his lodging in Poplar—I said to him, "I thought you were at Wellington by this time"—he said he had altered his mind, or something to that effect, I forget the words he used—I then said, "You are deceiving me, I shall have my goods back again"—I said, "You have got into another suit of clothes, perhaps you will be kind enough to take them off, for you spoilt one suit in Croydon"—while he was taking them off he said, "I assure you it is all right, my father will pay the account, and if you like I will go down with you, and if you like to stop a few days I shall be very glad of your company"—I agreed to go with him—he said, "Will you be kind enough to take an umbrella I bought of you out of pawn," which I did for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., purchased of me the day before for 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I paid his fare down to Taunton—we telegraphed at Paddington for his father to meet us—I paid for it—when we got there his father was not there—he said, "I will go to meet my father, will you go over to the Royal Hotel and wait there till I have had the first meeting with my father, and then I will introduce your account"—he came back about a quarter of an hour afterwards, and stated that he had not seen his father—he went out again, and came back in a few minutes, crying, and he said that he had heard that his father was seized with a paralytic stroke yesterday afternoon; that he would never forgive himself, and went on more like a madman than anything else—he said, "It won't matter, the clerk will give me a cheque, and I shall come in for all the property"—we did not go to Wellington that night, because he said that his father seeing him might give him such a shock that it might be fatal to him—during the evening he said he had seen a gentleman who had seen his father, and contradicted the statement that his father was ill—the prisoner said that to-morrow was Saturday, and would be market-day, and his father would be driving that way—I did not see him, and I said I could not wait any longer, "I shall go over and see him"—he said, "If my father breaks his promise and does not pay you, I will pay you myself; as my father promised to give me this outfit, I would rather he would pay"—he went out and brought back a cheque for 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I took to the bank, but got no cash for it—he had all the goods at this time—I had not received any back—he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186805040077"></xptr>
               <p>made an appointment with me to go and see his father on the Sunday, and we hired a cart and went to Wellington—it was Monday I presented the cheque, he gave it me on Saturday—when we got to Wellington on, the Sunday we put the horse up, and he said he would go and get over the first meeting with his father, and would give him the account, and settle it—he returned in a few minutes, and said he had just met his father walking with a gentleman, and his father could not go into the account that day; and he made an appointment to meet me at the Castle Hotel, at 11 o'clock next morning—I went back to Wellington the same evening, and saw his father about 7 or 8 o'clock—I told him who I was, and what I wanted—the prisoner was not there—I did not receive any money from the father—I went a second time to his father with the same success, and on the Monday evening I gave the prisoner into custody—before I gave him into custody he gave me a note, which I took to his father on the Monday—this is it—I took it once and gave it him, but with the same success—he said he would have nothing to do with it—I then gave the prisoner into custody—I told him that everything he had stated from beginning to end was false.</p>

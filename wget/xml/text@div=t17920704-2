I asked what was the matter; he repeated I have been robbed; I could not fix upon more than one to speak to him, and that is not the prisoner; I went after the man up Tavistock court; I never had lost sight of him; I secured him, and in my return to Mr.

             I met the prisoner, who seemed to come out of the ruins of a house that had been burned; he struck me violently several blows, and the man I had hold of escaped; I then laid hold of the prisoner, and he struck me again; he retreated about 150 yards, and was close to the Queen's Head publick house, Covent Garden; the crowd knocked us into the door way; I seized him by the collar; Mr. F. made his way through the mob, and I took the prisoner; the prisoner denied that he had struck me, but I have not the smallest doubt of it; he was not out of my sight the whole time.</p>

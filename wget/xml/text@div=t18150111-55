               <p>EDWARD HUNT. I reside at Liverpool; I have a brother of the name of John Hunt, resident of London.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 17th of November last, had you occasion to transmit any bills to your brother in London - A. I had, I made them up into a letter.</p>
               <p>Q. How many bills did you transmit that day - A. Three bills of Exchange, and two bank notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that one of the bills that you transmitted that day - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the endorsement, you see the endorsement of the name of Coughland; was that endorsement on the bill at the time that you enclosed it - A. It was not, that endorsement was not on the bill at the time I lost it.</p>
               <p>JOHN ROBERTS. I am a clerk to Mr. Hunt. On the 17th of November last, Mr. Hunt gave me a letter to put into the Post office at Liverpool; I lost that letter out of my pocket when I came to the Post office it was gone; I lost it before I got to the Post office.</p>
               <p>GEORGE GALL. I am clerk in the house of Jones, Lloyd, and Company, bankers. On the 22nd of November, the prisoner called with this bill, he left it for acceptance; on the 23rd he called again, I asked him if he was the person that had left it; he said, he was. I asked him to accompany me to a person in Finch-lane, as there was some difficulty about the bill, which we must get rectified before we could accept it. I took him to Finch-lane, he accompanied me, and when we came to the door, there was another person joined us. The prisoner asked me if the bill was stopped; I evaded to answer him direct, and when we came to the house in Finch-lane, he desired the other person to go into a public-house, and to wait until he returned. We then went to Mr. Hunt's accompting-house in Finch-lane, that is Mr.

            , the last endorser, to whom he had paid sixty pounds, the amount of the bill, he pretended, he said, he was a respectable man at Liverpool, an agent he called himself, and he had commercial transactions in London, and at other places; the answers to the questions which were put to him by the prosecutor's brother and myself left the impression on both of us that he was an imposter, he did not satisfy us that he was the man he represented himself to be. Mr. Hunt gave him his opinion, that that man had the other part of the property that was lost, or connected with the people that had it. I refused letting him have the bill; he said, he would sue me for the bill. He stated that Coughland was a pedlar, and he believed he was gone to Ireland, he could not tell where he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body sent to the public-house after the other man - A. We took the prisoner into custody, and searched him; on him was found the memorandum of this bill in the name of Brown, Cobb, and Company.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I keep a boarding-house for seaman, at Liverpool; Coughland, of whom I took the bill, I had known him some time, I cashed this bill for him; I have got a witness to prove it; I took this bill knowing the man, I supposed it to be correct.</p>

                  </hi>. On the Thursday of the Coronation I was in Hyde<lb></lb>park fair. I was returning home between six and seven o'clock on Friday morning, with a female, who is not here—as I passed Pickett-place, Tem<lb></lb>ple-bar, near 8t. Clement's Church, the prisoner stood by a ginger-beef stall—I asked what it was a bottle—she told me a penny—I told her to open me a bottle, which she did—I put my hand into my pocket to pay for it, and found I had got but three farthings—I told her I had got but three farthings, and was very sorry, and was walking away—I did not drink it—she followed me, and asked if I was going to have it—I told her I could not, for I had only the three farthings, which I offered her, but she did not take it—she turned back to her stall again, and followed me, with a knife in her hand—sh made an attempt at my head, which I rose up my hand to prevent, and I received a very deep wound on my right hand—she took me by the throat and held me against some shutters which were not open—she stabbed me twice in my stomach and in my leg—I do not know how, but I found my leg was cut, and my shoulder, but that did not penetrate the skin—I heard somebody call a policeman—he presently came to my assistance, and I gave her in charge—I followed her to the station-hbnse, and she was detained.</p>

                  </hi>. On the Friday morning after the Coronation, I was in care of a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> near St. Clement's Church, and saw the prisoner behind a ginger-beer stall—my <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> was so situated that I could see—I saw the prosecutrix and another female about six o'clock, or a little after, go up to the ginger-beer stall—I was not near enough to hear any conversation that took place—I saw the prosecutrix talking to the prisoner, as if she was asking for a bottle of beer—I saw one bottle opened—I saw the female and the prosecutrix walk away—the ginger-beer was not drank—the pri<lb></lb>soner went after the prosecutrix—she did not reach her, but turned back and went to her stall again—she was about two steps from her when the turned back—I saw the prisoner follow her again, and saw her lay hold of her and stab her in the hand with a knife—she then stabbed her two or three times in the belly—I then went for a policeman—I got one, named Field, who took the prisoner into custody—I could not go with him to the station-house.</p>

I saw the prosecutrix and the prisoner—the prosecutrix was bleeding at the hand when I came up—I asked her who did it—she pointed to the prisoner, who was about two yard from the stall—I took her into custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You took the knife, I believe? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I in<lb></lb>quired for it, but it could not be found—they said it had fallen on the ground—there were between thirty and forty persons round when I got up, of rather a low class—I had just dispersed a quarrel at a brothel, and some of the people had come round—besides these persons, there were a great many rioters and low persons coming from the fair that night—I had seen the prisoner about ten minutes before this happened—I do not know that any persons had attempted to take her ginger-beer without paying for it.</p>

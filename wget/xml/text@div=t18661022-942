About half-past five on the morn<lb></lb>ing of the 4th October I saw the prisoner in Tower Street, Seven Dials—he was carrying this bundle (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on his shoulder—I asked him what he had got, he made no answer and walked on, I asked him again and he made no answer, I told him I should take him to the station, and he then said he had found it—I took him to the station.</p>

I was proceeding to my lodgings a little after five on the morning of the 4th October, when I saw a cab at the corner of St. Andrew's Street, Seven Dials. The cabman beckoned me and said, "Do you want to earn sixpence?" I said, "Yes." He said, "Take this into Tower Street, and I will meet you there and give you. the sixpence." I took the things on my shoulder, and as I was going along was stopped by the constable. I could not give him any description of the man, so I told him I had found them. The woman said at the police-court that she had lost other things.</p>

               <p>Oct. I apprehended the prisoner, on a warrant, for neglecting to pay money for his wife—I told him I was going to take him to Worship-street, to answer for neglecting to contribute to the maintenance of his wife—he had paid nothing for twelve months—I told him I understood he was married again—he said, "That is perfectly true, and here is the certificate of my second marriage," handing me the one from Islington—I have examined that with the register, and found it correct—he said he was very uncomfortable about it, and should like to have it settled, and said, "Mind, I surrender to you on the charge of bigamy"—I said, "Then, where does she live, your second wife?"—he said, "I will not tell you till I get to the office; she lives very near there, and then you can send for her"—when we got there, be refused to do so—we had to find her out—I saw the prisoner sign his name to this at the office, and know this to be the Magistrate's handwriting—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"The prisoner says, 'I admit I was married to my wife about eight years ago, at St. James's, Clerkenwell, and she is now present in this police court'")—his wife's name is Catherine Sarah Nye—she was before the Magistrate, and is present now—this certificate was given to me by her—I gave it to Coulson.</p>

She shewed us some shoes, and asked 3s. 6d. for them: McCarthy bid her half a crown, but she would not take it - she was then going out, and she called her back to try them on; I took up that gown from the counter and asked if it was to sell - she snatched it out of my hand, and struck me across the face, then took up a stool and struck me; I asked what was the reason of it - she gave charge of me, and said she had lost two blue coats, and if she could, she would hang us; she was very much intoxicated, and very violent.</p>

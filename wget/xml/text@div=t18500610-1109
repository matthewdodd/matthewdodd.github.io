                  </hi>. I am single, and live at 87, Piccadilly. I have known the prisoner about twelve months; she was residing at 5, Nottingham-terrace—I saw her there several times—I went there by Miss Goodman's request, and asked her whether she was going to remain there after her twelve months were expired—she said it depended on circumstances, and she wished to boy a house and furniture—I said I thought Miss Goodman would sell her that one—in two or three days I received a message from her, and went to her house on 15th Dec.—she told me to secure a hosiery and glove business for her in Piccadilly, which we had spoken of before—I was to offer the owner, Mr. Welbone, 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—about the latter end of January, I received this bill(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from her—I handed it to Rosa Goodman, about 27th or 28th Jan.—Charles Randolph is the acceptor—the prisoner said he was her cousin, and was a clergyman, residing at Andover, and owed her the money on a mortgage—I was to get the bill cashed—she said I should find no difficulty about it, as his name was good—I got it cashed by Rosa Goodman—I got from her 233<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash, 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. being deducted for rent, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for something else, and something for discount—I gave the money to the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a detective city officer. On 20th March, I was outside the Bank of England, at half past 10 o'clock—I saw a man named Oliver in the hall of the Bank, standing at the counter where gold is paid for notes; I saw him receive ten sovereigns in exchange for two bank notes—I saw the prisoner there in conversation with a brother officer in the passage leading to the hall; he passed, and I followed him, and said, "Do you know the young man you just passed in the passage?" he said, "Yes"—I said, "Do you know what he came to the Bank of England for?" he said, "No"—Itold him that he had come there to change two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England notes, and asked him whether he knew anything about them, he said that he did not—I returned with him to Haydon and Oliver, and in a few minutes I heard the prisoner say that he had picked the notes up in a shop facing St. Katherine's Docks, between 4 and 5 o'clock on the previous afternoon—Haydonand I then locked the prisoner up with Oliver, charging him with the unlawful possession of the notes which Oliver had tendered at the Bank of England.</p>

I was outside the Bank of England on this morning, about 11 o'clock or half past, and saw the prisoner and George Perryman go into the hall—I followed them and saw Oliver tender the notes, and receive ten sovereigns for the two—I can speak to this as one of the notes; I have had it in my possession ever since—the prisoner passed me and Oliver while we were talking in the passage, without, taking any notice of Oliver; he was brought back by Spittle, and I told him what Oliver had told me; he said that it was so, and that he had given the notes to Oliver to get change, having picked them up the previous afternoon in a barber's shop—I asked him why he had given, or directed to be given, a wrong name and address, showing him the address on the back of the notes; he said that that name and address was on both notes when he found them—I asked him if he had made any effort to discover the owner; he said that he had not—he first said that he lived in Gravel Lane, and had a shop facing St. Katherine's Docks, and it was there that he picked up the notes—he was then taken to the station—he also gave his address at a place in Upper East Smithfield, and I understood him to say at first that he picked up the notes there, but it may be a mistake of mine.</p>

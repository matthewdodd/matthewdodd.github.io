                  </hi>. I keep the North American Coffee-house, in the Minories. The prisoner came to lodge with me on the 17th of June—he brought me a paper, saying he came from the Danish Consul; that he was to get board and lodging for eight or nine days, and then they were to get him a ship to send him to his own country—another young man lodged with him who could not speak English—the prisoner paid nothing—he was to give me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a-week for lodging, and board, as he had—he continued to lodge from the 17th of the 21st—he left on Tuesday, and said he was going to the Danish Consul for money—he came back and said, "You are to go with me to-morrow"—I said, "Very well"—I gave them their tea—they sat down and drank it till nine o'clock, and then went to bed, as I thought—a person came to see me—I went up-stairs and found my drawers had been opened—I then came down and received information—we went</p>

                  </hi>. I live as servant with Mrs. Pryor. I remember the prisoner and another man lodging there—they went away—I afterwards found a pair of the prisoner's boots in the room—Mr. Sproull's boots had been in that room at half-past four that evening—I met the prisoner at Aldgate, at a quarter before two, on the 13th of July—I caught hold of him till the policeman came up—he had no boots on—he owned every thing that they had taken—I had cleaned Mr. Sproull's boots five times and the prisoner's once—I know them well.</p>

On Wednesday, the 6th of February, I was sleeping there, and about half-past three o'clock in the morning I was disturbed by the rats of my neighbour nibbling at the wall; I laid awake from then, and between that and a quarter to four o'clock I heard the handle of my parlour door opened, which door leads into the passage of the private part of the house; I afterwards heard footsteps, and saw the reflection of a light, as I sleep with my bedroom door open - I, imagining my servant had got up earlier than usual, said, "Ann, is that you?" (I saw nobody at that time;) a feigned voice said, "Yes, Sir;" I instantly knew it was not the girl's voice - I rushed out of my bed, and made a regular rush at the prisoner, who I saw retreating out of the parlour door - I was so near to him in the parlour that I might have caught him myself; I saw his figure plainly, but not his countenance- I got very near him, and should have caught him, but he slammed the parlour door in my face, and slipped a little bolt in the parlour door outside, which prevented my pursuing him that way; there being a door leading into the shop, (I slept with that open as well as my bedroom door) I instantly ran to that door, threw back the bolts and the chain, and got out into the street nearly as soon as the prisoner got out at the private door - when I came out into the street I saw the same figure in full flight; I did not see him come out of the door - he ran away; I ran after him in my shirt, as I had got out of bed, as far as a neighbour's door, and seeing a Policeman four or five doors below, I thought the prisoner must have run into his arms, but he shot by him; I was shouting Stop thief! all the time - the Policeman chased him, springing his rattle, and being undressed I returned to put on my clothes, and then two Policeman came in - I let them in at the back kitchen window; they undid the fastening of the back door, and then entered the private part of the house - when I got into the passage I instantly saw Mr. Thomas Devey's coat and hat on the mat in the passage; he lodges with me - I afterwards went into the drawing-room, and saw things were deranged there; the prisoner was brought to the house in the custody of the Policeman: I then saw his face - he is the man who was brought there in custody; I examined the house, and found he had entered at the stair case window, which I found thrown up; I was not the last person who went to bed the night before - I had seen that window about eleven o'clock the night before; it was merely shut down then - I missed nothing of my own: Devey missed property, and in the passage the Policeman, in my presence, picked up some phosphorus-matches; the prisoner's figure is like the figure of the man I saw in my house, and who I pursued.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. By the figure, you, mean the back of the person? A. Yes; I left Knight, the servant up - the window, which was opened, was between the ground and the first floor; I swear I looked at that window before I went to bed; I lost sight of the man when he closed the door, and the next thing I saw was the same figure in the street; it was a bright morning - the moon was bright, and was going down; it was not foggy - the man got twenty or thirty yards; I lost sight of him when the Policeman pursued him - I was alarmed, but not the least confused or in fear; I had no light but what the person brought in.</p>

            . I am a Police-serjeant. On the morning of the 6th of February I was on duty in Oxford-street, about twenty minutes before four o'clock, and within twenty or thirty yards from Mr. Buckle's door; I saw a man come out and slam the private door too very violently; in two or three seconds afterwards I saw a man come out of the shop door in his shirt and night-cap - at that time the first man was just passing me, and as the prosecutor called Stop thief! he said, "Oh, never mind him, he is a fool;" he was running at a brisk pace; I said, "Never mind that we will see about that," and we both ran as hard as we could; he ran down Oxford-street, and Orchard-street, into Portman-mews; I kept him in sight all the way till I came to the bottom of the mews; he turned down the mews - I was then joined by another constable, who is not here; I then went into Orchard-street - I then turned round, and saw him on an out-house at the back of Portman-street barracks; I said,"Come down, we have had a good run for you - come down, or I will shoot you;" the sentry, who was on the other side of the wall, said the same; two soldiers who were in bed got up, and one said, "Give me a firelock, and I will fetch him off;" he then jumped down, and I cut him on the head with my staff; he said, "You vagabond, what did you do that for?" I said, "I don't know, but I will take you back to the house you came from;" I apprehended him with the assistance of the constable, No. 40, who is not here - the prisoner is the man; he never got away - I tied his hands, in going down the mews he put his hand into his pocket, and flung out two knives and two half-crown pieces; Thomas Harrison, No. 22, picked them up before I left the spot - I am sure he picked up what the prisoner threw out of his pocket; I took him to Mr. Buckle; I searched him in Mr. Buckle's house, and this phosphorus-box was in his pocket; I was going to cut his pocket to get it out - he said, "I will get it out;" he took it out of his pocket, and gave it to me; these matches were with it - these other matches were found in the passage; I returned to the mews, as there was a shilling deficient, according to what the girl said she had lost, and I found these other matches, but not the shilling; it might be a minute from the time I lost sight of the man and seeing the prisoner on the wall.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you observe the prisoner stoop? A. No, I never said so; when he came from the shed he was coming down at me; I struck him on the head with my staff as he came down - I have known him some time.</p>

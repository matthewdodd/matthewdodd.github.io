                  </hi>. I am a baker, living at 407, Wandsworth Road—on the night of the 24th to 25-th December I went to bed a little after 12 at night—I left the door leading from the kitchen into the yard firmly closed, and the fanlight was covered with two sacks—I came down a little after 8 in the morning—I found the kitchen door wide open—I missed eight bottles of spirits, one of brandy, and one of German wine, and a sack from the front of the fireplace marked "H. Louden"—the yard outside the kitchen door is enclosed, and there is a gate 6 feet high, which is kept closed and barred inside—the sacks from the fanlight were thrown into the yard—I had employed the prisoner for one week about 11 weeks before this occurrence—</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman W</hi> 119). On the 25th December I saw the prisoner in Larkhall Lane, Clapham, about half a mile from the prosecutor's house—he was carrying this sack—I asked him what he had in it—he said, "Only bottles of gin"—I asked him where he got them—he said, "From my master, Mr. Vinerdon, a baker in the Wandsworth Road"—I asked him: if ho worked for him—he said, "Yes, on Saturdays and busy days"—I asked him to show me what he had in the sack—he did so, and I found two bottles of brandy and one bottle of gin—he said his master gave them to him to take to his cousin at Stoke Newington—Mr. Vinerdon subsequently came to the station, and said in the prisoner's presence that he knew nothing of the prisoner—the prisoner then said that he had been drinking with a man near London Bridge, and he gave him the sack and contents to carry to Clapham, and that he did not know the man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> At Christmas I went oyer Westminster Bridge. A man came to me and asked if I wanted money, and he gave me 48 farthings. He then asked me if I wanted to drink. I said I did, and he gave me some brandy. We went over London Bridge, and he gave me this sack to carry. He left me on London Bridge, and as he did not come back in an hour I wandered along Thames Street and I fell asleep. I went along the Wands-worth Road, and the constable came and asked me what I had got, and I told him a man had given me something to drink, and I felt very tired and I lost myself.</p>

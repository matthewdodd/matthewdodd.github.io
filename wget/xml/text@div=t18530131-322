                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the Custom-house, and live at Greenwich. The female prisoner was in my service for nine weeks; she left yesterday fortnight; she came to me after leaving Mr. Gull; she left my service of her own accord—during the time she was there, I saw the male prisoner twice, but I know he was several times in the house; he was allowed to come—I have spoken to him; on Monday, 17th Jan., in consequence of information I received, I went with the constable White, to No. 4, Newton-place, Greenwich—I went up into a room that was stated to be the prisoner's, and there saw some books of mine; one of them had my same stamped on the cover—there was a box in the room, which she said was her husband's, and he had the key—shortly after, her husband came in he produced to the policeman several keys, three I think; the policeman tried each of them, but neither of them was the right; she then produced the right one, and on opening the box there was a jelly pot of mine found, which I knew, and it is the only thing I knew to be mine—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I know it by its having a fish at the bottom—there may be other jelly pots with fish on them, but that was the subject of a family joke some months before, and that stamped it on my mind; I could not swear to it—the policeman found a coat on the bed post, in the pocket of which he found a white pocket handkerchief of my wife's, marked with my name in full, "Edgar, 6"—his wife said, in his presence, that the coat was his; at all events he owned to it afterwards; he said he had not worn the coat for three months—several nights afterwards a silk handkerchief of mine was found in my presence, in the pocket of a coat which was hanging behind the door of the sitting room below; the landlady said the coat was the prisoner's—he was then in custody—that handkerchief has not my name on it, but I had bought two; one I missed, and here is the other; it is exactly the same pattern; I believe it to be mine—some socks were afterwards found by the policeman, I do not know when.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, R</hi> 180). I saw a coat hanging on a bedstead, I asked the male prisoner if it belonged to him—he said, "Yes;" I searched the right-hand pocket, and found this handkerchief, which Mr. Edgar claimed—I asked the prisoner how be accounted for it—he said he had not worn the coat for the last three months, and did not know how it came there; I took him into custody that day—on a subsequent day, I think two days afterwards, I went again to the house, and saw a coat hanging in the front parlour, down stairs, and in the pocket found the other handkerchief, which Mr. Edgar believed to be his—I produce a pair of socks, which I got from Mr. Gull—it seems that the landlady of the house had them from the prisoner, to wash, and she took them to Mr. Gull—they have Mr. Edgar's name on them—I have never shown the silk handkerchiefs and socks to the prisoner.</p>

               <p>I have washed that once or twice for the prisoner—these socks, I found dirty in his box, when Mr. Gull came to see if there was any of his property there, and I washed them, and took them to Mr. Gull—I believe I had washed them once before; they are men's socks—they were in the same box that the other things were in—none of the female's things were in that box, they were men's clothes—I do not know anything about this white handkerchief; I bare seen him use this silk one.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> My wife gave me the socks one Sunday evening, and said Mrs. Edgar had given them to her; the white handkerchief I know nothing about; I told my wife I wanted some handkerchiefs, and she said she would buy a few, and I suppose she bought them; I was at Mr. Edgar's house time after time; if I had known these things had been stolen, I should not have been there.</p>

            . Between the 3d and 4th of February in the night, in the year 1766, I lost the tobacco mentioned in the indictment; Haines, Braine, and Smither were taken up for another fact; the two former were tried for stealing the tobacco, and convicted, Smither was admitted evidence; the prisoner did keep a tobocconist's shop; I had a suspicion of him; I know no more against him than what Smither told me.</p>

            . Betwixt the 3d and 4th of January 1766, Haines, Braine, and I, went to the Hamburgh Arms on Tower-hill, and from thence into Mr. Clay's yard backwards, and took out some tobacco, and carried it to the prisoner's house in a sack at divers times; he paid me 7 l. odd money for it; we shared the money in his house; after which I gave the prisoner a shilling to drink my health; this was all done within about two hours.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he give you a pound for it?</p>
               <p>Smither. He gave but 6 d. a pound.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the prisoner know how you came by it?</p>
               <p>Smither. He knew us all very well; Haines, Braine, and I, were all camen; he knew we stole it, and was up on purpose to receive it, at about twelve o'clock at night.</p>

               <p>Smither will swear any thing, he is one of the Saltpetre-bank evidences; I never saw him in my life before to my knowledge; I had two servants, were they here they could clear up my innocency, but by some means or other they are got out of the way; they promised faithfully to come, but they are not.</p>

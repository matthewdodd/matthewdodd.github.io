               <p>was on the Poplar side of the iron<lb></lb>bridge—Bryaut was with me—I met the prisoner, who I knew, with a bundle on his shoulder, and I have worked with him—one of my friends said, "There is old <hi rend="italic">Jemmy</hi> Donoghue"—I said, "What have you got here, Jemmy; have you got 10lbs. of beef?"and I touched it—I said, "Are you coming home, Jemmy?"—he said, "You are a b——y Garibaldi b——r"—I went to the gate, and saw the bundle lying down there—I asked him what he had got there—he said, "Leave that down, it don't belong to you"—he used bad language, and I thought he wanted to raise a quarrel and to fight, so I threw off my coat and went near him to a place where there was a toll-gate—I went in the attitude to strike him, but did not, and Bryant <hi rend="italic">sang</hi> out, "Mind, Solon, he has got a knife"—I got behind him to prevent his using the knife—my arms were in front of him—I felt something done to my left arm, and it dropped dead by my side—there were two wounds—he must have cut my arm down—I have been in the hospital four weeks and two days—he was taken in charge—as we went along, he said he was sorry he did not cut my b——y head off, and cut my bowels out and my private parts—I should be sorry to use the expressions. I have not got the use of my arm yet.</p>

                  </hi>. I was with Solon—some words passed between him and Solon, and Solon pulled off his coat—the bundle lay on the pay box of the bridge, and Solon took hold of it, but he did not go to take it away—the prisoner told him to put it down, it did not belong to him—he put it down directly and walked away—they were chaffing one another, but I do not exactly recollect the words that were passed—he took his coat off—Donoghue pulled his coat off, and said, "If you want fighting I will give you fighting, "and he out with his knife—I hallooed to Solon to look out, as he had got a knife—Solon got behind him, and caught hold of him round the arms, and the prisoner cut him twice with the knife on the left arm—he was given in custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house<lb></lb>surgeon at the London Hospital—Solon was brought there on 26th February, and I found two incised wounds at the back of his left wrist, one three inches long, dividing the tendons of the arm, and entering into the wrist<lb></lb>joint; the second was about two and a half inches long, four inches above the first wound; not so deep but sufficiently so to divide the muscle, also an artery, which was bleeding profusely, and which I tied—he was under my care a month, and is now discharged quite cured, but he will never have the full use of his hand again: this knife would cause</p>

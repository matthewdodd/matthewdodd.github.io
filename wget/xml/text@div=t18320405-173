On the 13th of February the prisoner came, and inquired what lodgings we had to let - I showed him our first-floor; he said he liked it very much, and he would have it if I would keep it till the Saturday following - I asked if he would not bring his wife to look at it; I then showed him our back cellar, which he was to have, and in going out he said was it not necessary to leave a deposit; I said as he pleased; he pulled out two half-sovereigns. and I laid 9s. 6d. down - he took up 9s., and gave me one half-sovereign; I then asked for a reference; he asked for a pen and ink; I had not one, but I gave him a pencil, and he wrote "No. 27, John-street, Chelsea" - he was then going away, and I said, "You have not told me your name;" he said,"Davies;" the next day I offered the same half-sovereign to my grocer, and he told me it was a gilt sixpence- I met the prisoner by accident in Piccadilly a month afterwards - the moment he saw me he run off; I gave an alarm - I should not have given him the 9s. if he had not represented himself as a person engaging my lodging.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Did you ring the half-sovereign? A. No, I laid it on the baize while he was writing the paper; I then took it up, and put it into my pocket - I had no other half-sovereign; I had not changed any half-sovereign after he came.</p>

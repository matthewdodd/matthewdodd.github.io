            . I am a constable. On the 19th of December, about seven o'clock in the morning, I was in Goulston-square, Whitechapel, and saw the prisoner walking with another man, whom I supposed to be in his company - I stopped the prisoner with a large bag on his back - he said he did not know what it was, but he had found it: I found it contained a quantity of tea, loose, and 2 ozs. of tea in a paper; the other man walked away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. It was quite light? A. No - it was getting light; he was a mile and a half from the prosecutor's.</p>

On the 18th of December, at eleven o'clock at night, I locked and barred the house up myself, My man servant called me at six o'clock in the morning, and I found the kitchen door, which opens into the yard, had been pierced through by some sharp instrument, and a square piece taken out, large enough to admit a person through; another door, leading from the back kitchen to the stairs (and which I had bolted at night) had a hole pierced in it, large enough for a hand to be put through it, to undo the bolt - the lock of the door between the parlour and the shop, was wrenched off. I went into the shop, and found three cannisters of black and green tea empty - the tills were both taken out of the counter; one of them had been locked the night before - I found one in the yard, and the other in the shop - some silver and copper was taken from them. I missed 19lbs. or 20lbs. of tea. The other articles were taken from the parlour cupboard.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What time were you awoke? A. I guess it was about six o'clock; the servant had a candle; it might be break of day; the bag contains black and green tea mixed - I cannot swear to it; the bag is not mine.</p>

            . I am a silk-dresser, and live in Spencer-street. On the evening of the 18th of December I was at a raffle with the prisoner, at the Ship public-house, from seven o'clock till half-past eleven; I walked home with him - he lives next door to me - and about half-past six the next morning, as I went out to go to work, I saw him come out of his own house - he had no bag, or any thing then - I walked into the Commercial-road with him, and left him at the corner of Bedford-street.</p>

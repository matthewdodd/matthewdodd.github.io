                  </hi>. I am assistant to William Evelyn, a linen draper, in Woolwich. About 23rd July I missed two de lane dresses from inside the shop—I had previously missed a piece of print from outside the shop—I cannot exactly say the date—one of the dresses was a blue, and the other a green, with a little red flower—the green one was rather a particular one, we only had one of that pattern—Mr. Evelyn serves in the shop, and a young lady as well—they are not here—they had not been sold—I had seen them safe half an hour before I missed them—they were taken from just inside the door—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are them.</p>

I found these two dresses in the pri<lb></lb>soner's room at the same time I found the other things—I asked Roche about them—she said she brought them from her mother's at Northampton—I told the Magistrate that—I took her away, and afterwards returned, and found Furness there—I told him his wife was in custody for stealing some prints—these prints were lying on the bed at the time—he said, "Why, she brought them from her mother's at Northampton"—he had set heard what his wife had said.</p>

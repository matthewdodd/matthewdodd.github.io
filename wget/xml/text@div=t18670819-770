                  </hi> I am a waiter at the Salisbury Hotel, Salisbury Square—on the afternoon of 21st July, about half-past three o'clock, I was in Holborn Hill—a boy had been bit by a dog and it attracted my attention, so that I crossed the road—I saw the prisoner take the watch out of my pocket, and saw it in his hand afterwards—he immediately made off—I followed him and caught him about thirty yards off—he gave up the watch—I still followed him through Brook Street into Fox Court, where some women tried to stop him—he got away and went into Feathers Court and into No. 2—I had not lost sight of him up to that time, but I then lost him for about five minutes—I had had him in view for about five minutes—I know he is the same man by his features—I had plenty of time to notice him—once he said he would knock my b----head off if I went after him.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Policeman</hi> 39). I went in search of prisoner at No. 2, and afterwards No. 10, Fox Court—I heard an altercation when I came to the first floor, and a man saying he lived there and the female persisting he did not—I found prisoner on the second floor and asked him if he had business there—he said, "No"—I told him to come down stairs, which he did, where prosecutor identified him as the man who had stolen his watch.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see him run away?</p>
               <p>Finly. No; I had enough to do to mind myself.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Greenapron's name?</p>
               <p>Finly. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Your are sure it is not Flanagan?</p>
               <p>Finly. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give the same account at the justices, as you have now?</p>
               <p>Finly. Yes; I believe so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you charge Flanagan with being one?</p>
               <p>Finly. No; I said there was one Greenapron.</p>
               <p>Q. Jones was one?</p>
               <p>Finly. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That you are sure of?</p>
               <p>Finly. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be taken?</p>
               <p>Finly. I went home to my mother; she heard my name was mentioned as being taken up with such a one; she said if I did not go before the justice I should be hanged; so I went and made information of it.</p>
               <p>Court. Recollect yourself; how many things did you give information of before the justice?</p>
               <p>Finly. Two more.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give information against Flanagan in either of the others?</p>
               <p>Finly. No; I never was along with him in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you did not tell the justice so?</p>
               <p>Finly. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is Greenapron, is not that the man?</p>
               <p>Finly. No; I know Greenapron very well.</p>
               <p>Q. Now this you are sure of?</p>
               <p>Finly. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. I will read you what you said before the justice.</p>

             stood without to watch."</p>
               <p>Court. Be so good as to explain this?</p>
               <p>Finly. They put down the wrong name indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew Flanagan was in custody at this time?</p>
               <p>Finly. No; I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not he before the justice?</p>
               <p>Finly. No;</p>
               <p>Pagett. Flanagan was the first man that was taken; he was committed to Newgate immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Flanagan before the justice at the time this man was?</p>
               <p>Pagett. No; he was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he talk about this man he calls Greenapron?</p>
               <p>Pagett. No; he said nothing then, but of Flanagan, Polland, and Jones.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know he was there of your own knowledge?</p>
               <p>Pagett. Yes; he was the first that met me as I was coming home, after the fact was done; I saw the prisoners Polland, and Flanagan, all together; Polland was in the middle, Flanagan on one side, and the witness on the other of the trees; when I caught them Polland started up and struck me; Jones was not within ten yards; there is another indictment, the prosecutor is gone to give evidence of today, against this Flanagan, from this witness's information.</p>
               <p>Court. I would advise you, without any regard of favour to any body, tell us the truth;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177107030012"></xptr> you see how it stands; it is pretty extraordinary that you should first charge Flanagan, and now say he was not there; if you charged him wrongfully before, you ought not to persist in it; if otherwise, consider what you are doing now to screen him, if by a false oath?</p>
               <p>Finly. No; I do not, I never drank with that man in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. The question is, whether he was not with you in breaking open this house?</p>
               <p>Finly. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to tell the justice so?</p>
               <p>Finly. I told him Greenapron, Polland, and Jones were.</p>
               <p>Court. I know you in another robbery spoke of Greenapron being concerned, besides Flanagan?</p>
               <p>Finly. Greenapron was concerned in both.</p>
               <p>Flanagan's Defence.</p>
               <p>I was not along with them; I was going out with some of my fellow workmen; I got drunk; I went to make water; I fell asleep at the door; I know nothing of the robbery. I am a stone mason.</p>
               <p>Polland's Defence.</p>
               <p>Pagett has got a spite against me, because I was an evidence last sessions, and wants to swear my life away.</p>
               <p>Jones's Defence.</p>
               <p>The night this robbery was committed, (I work at the plaistering business for my living;) being out of work, I got up to go to market; I saw it was day light; I found when I got up the market was not begun; I went to take a walk; I came back just as I came to the end of Church-lane; I met with Pagett; he stoped me and asked where I was going to; I said to get my hod and shovel to go to market; he stopt me; I asked what for; he said I was not to go by myself; he gave the watchman charge of me; and bid him hold me; he was gone for near five minutes; I heard him cry out, stop thief all of a sudden; he let go of me and run after some other persons; I walked up Church lane about my business; I had not walked far before the watchman came and laid hold of me, and carried me to the watch house.</p>

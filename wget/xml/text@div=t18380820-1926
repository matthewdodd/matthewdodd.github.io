                  </hi>. I live at Stamford-hill, in the parish of St. John, at Hackney—the prisoner has been in my service rather more than six months. On Thursday morning, the 26th of July, he came into my bed-room, about a quarter past seven o'clock, as was his practice, and asked me what time I should like to have some water—I said, "In about a quarter of an hour"—he went away, and I believe I fell asleep, for I did not hear him come into the room again, although I saw the water standing on the washing-stand about a quarter before eight o'clock—I got up imme<lb></lb>diately, put on my things, went to the dressing-table where I usually put my things out of my pocket at night, and missed my purse, which I believe was there when I went to bed-all my other things were there—I cannot be certain I put it there the night before, though I have no doubt of it, or I should have missed it with the other things I took out, it being my regular practice to empty my pockets before I go to bed—I know I had it in my pocket about the middle of the previous day—I recollect seeing it and putting it into my pocket—I rang the bell on missing it, expecting the prisoner to come up, but the female servant came in—I found he had quitted the house, and I did not see him again till the Monday following, when he was in custody—he never returned to the house—there was about</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I apprehended the prisoner on Sunday, the 29th of July—he was selling his waistcoat, which aroused my suspicion—I put several questions to him, which he did not answer satis<lb></lb>factorily, and I took him into custody, and took him to the station-house—he gave the name of John Arnold—I took him to Spitalfields, where he said his aunt lived, and found his name was George Bunney—I did not know he was wanted then, but I learnt that he lived with Colonel Grant, and took him to his house, and found there was a charge against him—he was given into my charge for stealing the purse and money—I used neither threat nor promise to him-in coming along the road he said, "I will tell you the truth about it, it was a green silk purse, I took it, and a man took it away from me in Shoreditch."</p>

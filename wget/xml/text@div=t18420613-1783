                  </hi>. I am shopman to Messrs. Thomas and John Venables, of High-street, Whitechapel. About seven o'clock, on the 23rd of May, the prisoner came into the shop in company with another woman, who bought something and paid for it—the prisoner asked to see some gentlemen's colored silk neck-handkerchiefs—I showed her six or seven pieces—I then showed her some figured black satin ones—while doing so I noticed the prisoner's hand under the handkerchiefs—I suspected, and pressed her to buy—she would not—she asked to look at some black ones—I went to fetch some black ones, and took the others up—I took particular notice of what I showed them—I got some at 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. then some at 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—she then thought she should like to look at some lower priced ones—I opened one at 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she said she would look at one lower, and I cut her one off—I thought I perceived her hand under the handkerchiefs, and in getting them up I missed one at 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I stated the case to Mr. Venables, and he accused her of it—she denied it—he told me to take her into the bonnet-room-as she was going up into the bonnet-room I saw her throw the handkerchief down at the corner of the bonnet-room—it was not the one I had cut off for her to purchase—I called out to Mr. Venables, and picked up the handkerchief—the prisoner still denied knowing anything about it—this now produce is it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I am quite innocent, and the witness knows that, if he chooses to say so—he found it in the shop, and ha said so. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> The moment it was thrown down I picked it up and said, "This is the handker<lb></lb>chief—the bonnet-room is at the back of the shop—the door is always open—this is a single handkerchief—all the others I showed her contained two, three, and more—I had not given her the one I had cut off for her—I had taken her money for it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> The gentleman came to me and said he had missed one which had a mark on it. <hi rend="italic">Witress.</hi> The mark was on it when I showed it, but it was off when I picked it up—I have not returned the money or the hand<lb></lb>kerchief she purchased—that handkerchief was given into the hands of the policeman, as well as this one.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was called into the prosecutor's shop on the 23rd of May, and the prisoner was given into my custody with the handkerchief—she denied taking it—I found another handkerchief in a basket which the other person had who was in company with her, the one</p>

            . I live at No. 2, White-horse-alley, Cow-cross; I am a silversmith. On the 14th of May last. I went to the house where the prisoner lodged, in Fleet lane.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the prisoner - A. A coiner. I found him at home, and his wife. I asked him, if he had got any paper, which I had spoke to him about before. Paper, forged Bank notes. He said, the party would be in town soon. I asked him, when he would let me have a pound's worth of shillings; he promised to meet me on the 19th of May, at the Red-lion, the corner of Plum-tree-court, Shoe-lane On the 19th of May, I went to the Red-lion, according to appointment. When he came in, he said, he should have been there before, but he had been busy finishing some money for people that attended the market soon in the morning. He and his wife, he said, in fact. He pulled a dirty rag from his breeches pocket, and gave me thirty-one shillings and six sixpences in paper; and I gave him a two pound note. He went and got change, and gave me twenty shillings in good silver. We drank a little gin together, and we left the house together.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the silver after you received it of him - A. I gave it to Hancock, the officer. I gave the very same thirty-one shillings and the six sixpences, that he gave me for one pound, I gave to Hancock, the officer. The other twenty shillings I kept myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner afterwards - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any other acquaintance with the prisoner than for that purpose you have been speaking of - A. No; only for notes and money.</p>

            . I am an officer of Hatton-garden.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of information you received you employed Herbert - A. I did; and I received from 
               <persName id="t18120916-136-person1162">Herbert</persName>
             the thirty-one shillings and six sixpences. I have had them ever since. He delivered them to me on the 19th of May. This is the parcel. I apprehended the prisoner after that. I think, on the 15th of July. There was an appointment made to meet him in the county at my desire. I met the prisoner at the Red-lion, Red-lion-street, Clerkenwell. I cannot exactly say the hour me and Herbert had agreed. I received information that he was gone out of the house. I followed him, and overtook him in the confines of the city. I told him, that his wife had fell down, and sprained her ancle; on purpose to get him in the county. I then searched him, and found the money I had given Herbert upon other occasions; and I found upon him a great quantity of bad money, shillings, sixpences, some three shilling pieces. I found twenty-seven counterfeit shillings, a cast pewter dollar, one metal Spanish dollar, cast. I also found upon him a stick, it had been described to me before; there was a little black grease stuffed in a hole in it. I also found a little quill that he picked it out with. He admitted the transaction of the 19th of May; he could not deny it.</p>

            . Q. You are the assistant of the solicitor of the mint - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. You are well acquainted with this sort of counterfeit coin - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that paper of thirty-one shillings and six sixpences - A. The thirty-one shillings are all counterfeit, and the six sixpences are all counterfeit. I saw them on the examination; they were much brighter then than they are now. They were new coloured, as if they had not been in circulation before; and I saw the stick on the examination. I firmly believe, that it had the composition which is used by coiners, on purpose to take off the freshness of the silver colour, to make it look as if circulated; and I saw all the unfinished money that Hancock produced on the examination.</p>

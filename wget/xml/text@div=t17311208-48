Put, my Lord, I has pin waiting ant attending here this three Tays, an pringing creat Charches upon myself, while I might has peen toing of Pusiness, ant ketting of Monies, which is ferry creat Hartships upon me; ant therefore I peck your Lordship to consitter of it, that I may has some Satisfactions for all my Pains and Trouples about this Concern. Well, my Lort, since your Lortship says, that this Case is tifferent from ciffil Cases, wherein a Man may temant Satisfactions, pefore he kifs his Effitence, I supmit to co on, put, I hope, his Machesty will consitter of it hereafter: And so, my Lort, ass I wass a saying, I wass in the Artillery-Grount , near the Wall, on the 17th of Aukust, ant there wass some Poys that cry't Smallcoal, Smallcoal. Nay, my Lort, kif me Leaf to tell my Story my own Way or else I can't tell it all, ant I will kif a full ant true Account of the short ant the long of the Story. The Teceaset stood within a Yart of me, ant the Prisoner was stanting Centry ofer the Arms, at the farther Corner; soon after, a Man came ant took up a Firelock, ant I myself hafing the Honor to pe a little acquaintet with Military Ar t, wass the Resson of my making Remarks upon what came in my Way; ant so I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173112080019"></xptr> took Notice that the Prisoner run after the Man, ant prought pack the Firelock. Then I gase myself farther Time to make Opsersations, ant a Poy cry't, Smallcoal, Two-pence a Peck; so I thought it ferry proper to make Enquiries apout the Smallcoal; ant somepotty tolt me, that the Prisoner wass a Smallcoal-Man; so when he heert em cry Smallcoal, he pecun to crin his Teeth, ant pe in a Passion, ant when I saw his Plut was up, I pecun to take more opsersations, as you shall hear py ant py. So the Teceaset hat cot a Pit of Mutton in his Hand, ant he sait, Who will lent me a Knife, to cut a Pit of Meat to stop that Man's Mouth, that he may'nt spoil his Teeth with Crinning ? Ant a Woman sait to the Prisoner, you should not pe so inriged, ant he struck her with his Hant, ant swore, Tam her Plut for a Pitch, what Pusiness wass it of hers? ant somepotty said, it wass a creat Shame, that a Man that cry't Smallcoal apout the Street for his Pread, shoult pe trusted with a naket Swort, when he cout not keep his Hants off of a Woman. So the Prisoner crint his Teeth, ant threatent to stick some of em. Ant I look't apout for more Opsersations , ant see two Trums fall town, put it wass not the Teceaset that mettled with 'em; ant then the Prisoner wass enrach'd, ant trew his Packenet, ant run ofer the Arms after him; and I fount there wass Mischief coint forwart, ant so I took creat Notices of efery Thing: Then the Prisoner struck the Teceaset with the flat Site of his Packonet, and sait, stand by; and then the Teceaset took his Fist a thuss'n, and went to the Prisoner - I think you call it Tarting, for I call it so in my Welch Way; ant then the Prisoner took his Swort so - and stapt him in the Left-side, ant then the Teceaset aimt a Plow at the Prisoner's Right-eye, ant sait ass how he woult fight him. No, Sir, says I, you shan't fight now, for you are a tead Man. The Teceaset was not among the Arms when the Prisoner run after him.</p>

             . When the Prisoner was set Centry over the Arms in the Artillery-Ground, another Centry was set opposite to him. The Prisoner went and struck the other Centry for not drawing his Sword. A Woman said, this is some busy medling Man; with that the Prisoner struck her, and said, D - n ye, stand of. I asked him if he was not asham'd to strike a Woman? and then he damn'd me, and bid me stand off. The Deceased stood at a little Distance, and said, This Man is a hungry, and that makes him so angry; give him a Piece of Mutton. The Prisoner crossed over the Arms, and said, stand off. The Deceas'd held up the Mutton, and said, Here, will you have a Bit or no? and withal made a Motion to fight, but I don't know that he struck the Prisoner, and then the Prisoner stabb'd him in the Stomach.</p>

            . The Arms were grounded near the Muster-Table; the Prisoner went to the opposite Centry, and struck him on the Arm (but not in an angry Manner) and said, Centry, why don't you draw your Sword? A Woman said, Smallcoal; several Boys took the Alarm, and ran about the Prisoner, crying, Smallcoal, Smallcoal. The Prisoner struck some of them, who in Revenge went round, and push'd down the Drums. The Deceased came up with a Piece of Meat in his Hand, and said, You look as if you was hungry, will you eat a Bit of Mutton?

            , Surgeon. I attended the deceas'd, and the first Week I thought he was out of Danger. I ask'd him if he was willing the Prisoner should be bail'd, and he said, Yes. In three Weeks the Wound appeared to be well; but he afterwards grew worse than before, and dy'd on the latter Part of October. On examining the Body, I believe the Wound was the Cause of his Death; tho' there was no Sign of it to be perceived before the Body was opened. The Wound entered just below the Breast-Bone, by the Cartilage ensiformis, and went obliquely upwards. I found the Breast full of bloody Matter. I believe there might be 2 Quarts. The left Lobe of the Lungs was wounded (as it appeared when dilated) and it had dropp'd till it was almost lost. The Case was very uncommon.</p>
               <p>Starkey Middleton. I am of the same Opinion with my Brother. I take the Wound to have been the Cause of the Deceas'd's Death. The left Part of the Thorax was full of corrupted Matter and Blood; and the left Lobe of the Lungs was almost entirely wasted. The deceas'd in his Illness was continually wasting away. As the Wound went upwards, it must rest on the Diaphragma. It was a very uncommon Case.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner. I was marching for my Master<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173112080020"></xptr> in the Train'd-Bands, and was set Centinel over the Arms. One took up a Firelock: I stepp'd after him, and made him bring it back, and lay it down again: In the mean time, Others took up other Firelocks, on purpose to teize me; then they called me Jack in an Office, and some threw Stones and Brick-bats, but I could not distinguish who they were: One tried to kick a Firelock out of its Place; and a Woman said, if she had the icking of me, she would make me know myself. I bid her keep off; but did not strike her. The Deceas'd came forward, and said, I was a Bread and Cheese Soldier, and if I behav'd myself well, I should have an Egg for Supper. He took a Piece of Meat and smear'd the Arms, and then kick'd the Dust on them: I went round the Arms (not over them) and told him, if he would not keep back, I would give him a slap, and struck him with the Flat of my Sword, upon which he struck me in the Face several Times, and I stepped back, and held my Sword thus - to keep him off; and whether the Mob push'd him, or he came forward of himself, I cannot say; but he run against the Point of my Sword, and received a Wound.</p>
               <p>Wiggan. As the Prisoner stood Centry, the Deceas'd went cross the Arms, and rubbed his Meat upon some of them, and said he would take one of the Pieces away; but I cannot tell whether he did take it or no.</p>
               <p>Ellis. The Deceas'd, and the rest of the Mob, were affronting the Prisoner, and carrying the Arms from one Place to another; the Deceas'd kick'd the Dust on the Arms, the Prisoner ask'd, why he did so? and the other answer'd, for Fun. The Deceas'd gave the Prisoner a slap of the Face; the Prisoner push'd him off, and then stood still, with his Sword drawn; and the Deceas'd advancing again, the Mob push'd him upon the Prisoner's Sword. I stood close by.</p>
               <p>William Saul. The Deceas'd at first insulted the Prisoner in Coleman-Street; and One said to him, Prithee, Fellow, go about your Business, or you'll come nastily off. In the Artillery-Ground , the Mob got about the Prisoner, and the Deceas'd was playing his Game with him, and moving the Pieces; the People, with crouding and shoving , threw down the Drums; the Prisoner then drew his Bayonet, but I bid him turn it on again, which he did, and held his Sword flatways with both Hands (one at each End) to keep off the Mob. The Deceas'd struck the Prisoner in the Face; the Prisoner retreated , and stood with his Sword in one Hand, but did not push at all. The Mob shov'd the Deceas'd upon the Sword.</p>
               <p>Mr. - There was a Tumult about the Prisoner, who was left Centry while the rest went to refresh themselves. The Deceas'd took up the Arms. push'd at the Prisoner, and struck him in the Face; the Prisoner did not push with his Sword, but the Mob push'd the Deceas'd upon it.</p>

               <p>the whole case being addressed to Mr. Eastley—this tobacco is mine—in consequence of hearing of the loss of this parcel I communicated with my solicitor and with the police—I received instructions from them, and made an arrangement, in consequence of which, on 2nd January, I went with Detectives Walsh and Harvey to 42, Harmon Street, Hoxton, Gill's house—I saw a man outside who said "This is the man who is going to buy the tobacco"—that was in Gill's presence—I said "Where is it?"—Gill said "In my house"—I left the detectives and went into the house with Gill, down stairs into a room—it is an eight-roomed house—Gill closed and locked the door after us—he had told me his wife knew nothing of it—he unlocked a side cupboard and brought out the tobacco on the table—it is all here—he said "I am not in the tobacco trade, I want 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a pound for it"—said "How much have you?"—he said "From 70lb. to 80lb."—we there estimated the quantity between ourselves by overhauling it—I offered hut 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the quantity of about 76lb. or 78lb.—he said "I cannot take that amount, as I gave 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it, and I have to share the profit with another man"—estimating that 70lb. odd at 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a pound in round figures, I said "You must have sold some, or else you will not have much to share," and I said as 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was not agreeable to his wishes, I would buy 4lb. weight—I then arranged to take out six packages from this box, which he put in his pocket, and I took this loose tobacco out of a 4lb. parcel, and put it in this box to make up the 4lb.—it is a 4lb. box—the bargain was then complete, except I I had not paid for it—he put the remainder away, and went with me to I show some to another party, whom I told him I was buying this for, after locking the door—I then told the detectives "This man has more of this tobacco belonging to me"—he was then taken into custody—I then heard somebody say "What's o'clock?" or some such remark—the value of the big parcel was about 34<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

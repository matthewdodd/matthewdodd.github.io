               <p>This woman took lodgings in April, about the same time as the other; I never troubled myself with the lodgers, she left it about the 9th of May, I believe they went away both in one day; on the 20th of May, my boy and I went down and opened the door and found a bolster and pillow missing, and some other things; I gave the boy a pair of sheets to take down, I know the sheets, they are marked, I know nothing else.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt, prisoner's counsel. How do you know the sheets? - One is marked with I, and the other with D, I only know them by the mark.</p>
               <p>There are a great many honest men of your name as well as you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>This house is in little St. Andrew's-street? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You keep a pawn-broker's shop in Broad St. Giles's? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you happen to know that your wife gave permission to this woman to pawn the things? - No.</p>
               <p>The things were not pawned at your shop? - No.</p>
               <p>If they had been pawned at your shop, would you have prosecuted this woman? - How could I.</p>
               <p>Did it ever happen to you that any of your lodgers pawned any of your goods at you shop? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then you are in the habit of receiving your things pawned? - Not knowingly.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of that Mr. Davis? - Yes, I am sure of it, I know nothing of what my wife does; you never saw me here before; the door was opened by order of me or my wife.</p>
               <p>Jury. Who marks your linen? - My wife.</p>

               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Mr. Davis, a person may very well without any fault have the misfortune of being robbed once or twice, but it is very extraordinary your lodgings should be exposed to these frequent robberies; if they really are true, take a little care of your property; you will not come with perfect credit before a court of justice, if you come so again.</p>

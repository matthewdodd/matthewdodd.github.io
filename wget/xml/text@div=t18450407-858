                  </hi>. I have been for fifteen or sixteen years an officer in her Majesty's Customs; I was formerly a tide-waiter, and am now a gauger, which is a higher situation; I live in Greenwood-street, Mile-end-road; I know the prisoner. On Saturday, the 15th of March, he called at my lodgings between four and five o'clock—I was not then at home—I saw him between seven and eight—he said he was employed as a private watchman by the London Dock Company, to glean what information he could for them, and if I would not give him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he would prefer a charge against me, and he said, "Sure, you are not going to lose 260<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I asked him what charge he could prefer against me—he said, "Ri<lb></lb>ley, the Dock Company's watchman, has heard that I gave you 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to give Birch for employing me in the dock"—I said, "And have you done so?"—he said, "No, I have not, but they are anxious to prefer a charge against you; they want me to support it, but I will not if you will give me what I ask you; but if you don't, I will"—in consequence of this I subse<lb></lb>quently communicated with Mr. Grayson, a friend of mine, and on the 17th of March I gave the prisoner into custody.</p>

               <p>prisoner to my lodgings—I met him at Fleming's beershop—I sent for him, hearing he had called twice at my place on Wednesday, the 12th—Fleming keeps a beer-shop in the New-road, and also works in the docks—I called on him the same evening, and asked him if he knew the prisoner—he said yes—I said, "He has been in the habit of calling at my place, I should like to see him, for I want to know what be wants there; I shall feel obliged if you will tell him to meet me here to-morrow, for I should like to know what brings him to my lodgings so often"—the prisoner met me at Fle<lb></lb>ming's in consequence of that message—I sent no other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Before this, had you not received a charge from the Custom-house of receiving bribes or money to get people employment? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say that I had—there was a charge made against Birch, and the papers were referred to me, and I reported on them—I am not aware that there is a charge hanging over me at the present moment—I have never received a charge from the Custom-house, nothing more than having to report on Birch—that is all I have heard of it since, and that is more than a month ago—I am not aware that I have any charge to answer—I do not know that there is a charge hanging over me of receiving money to get labourers employment—I am not required to give any explanation to the Custom-house—the explanation that was required I gave.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean to say that is all the explanation required of you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is better known to the Board of Customs; I do not know their intention—I swear that is all the explanation that has been required of me—on my oath, I did not send to Lee by Fleming to help me to get out of the transaction with Birch—I swear nothing of the sort passed—I simply sent to him to know what brought him to my place so often—Fleming works in the docks—I never had any money from him—I do not know that Birch had—I will swear that—I have not received half-a-crawn a week, or any money, from Mahoney and Johnson, as labourers for the London Dock—I went to Boulogne last year—I did not leave directions with Mrs. Foster to receive half-a-crown a week from labourers that came—I swear that, and that I never received any money from Mrs. Foster on account of labourers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you not told Mrs. Harms, your landlady, a night or two previous to this, that if Lee came, he was to wait for you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Such a thing might occur, but I have no recollection of it—if I did, it was with the same view that I sent Fleming to inquire what brought him so often—I never had any conversation with Rafferty about what Lee could state either to the Dock Company or the Customs, or about his not coming forward to make any statement against me—I have no recollection of it—I did not know that Lee had been discharged from the London Dock—I have heard it from Mr. Chandler—I did not know he had been discharged some days before this Saturday—I swear I did not know it before that Saturday—I know Michael Riley, a watchman in the London Dock—I met him one day in the Strand, with Lee and Fitz<lb></lb>gerald—I did not go with them or after them to Mr. Fitzgerald's, No. 35, Arundel-street, that I swear—I met them standing at the corner of Arundel-street, and we had a few words there—on my oath I did not know that Lee and Riley were going to Arundel-street about this inquiry—I met them quite by accident—I did not know before that Lee had stated to Mr. Chandler that he had not given me any money—I swear solemnly that Lee never gave me any money.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184504070098"></xptr>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not walk along the Strand together? As I was coming back to duty—Riley and Lee were coming down towards the Dock, and we walked part of the way together, by mere accident—I be<lb></lb>lieve Birch's taking money to get the labourers employment was the sub<lb></lb>ject of conversation—I believe we did speak of it—Riley never said a syllable to me about Lee's being discharged for not telling the truth about me, nor did he ever say I might be forgiven everything but arresting Lee in the vile way I had done—I swear that—I will tell you what he did say, I chanced to meet him at the Dock-gate, and he said, "That Lee is a complete scoundrel; and if you summon me I will prove it; he told me he never gave you any money; I blame you very much for arresting him, for I would kick his----"—I did not say to Riley, "God knows, the money I got I never put into my own pocket."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not know, before you gave the prisoner into custody, that he had talked about going to speak to Mr. Chandler? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That was one of the threats he made use of in order to get the money—since he first asked me for the money that was the mainspring on which he founded his demand—I never said anything about making compensation to Lee for losing his place, on account of his telling a falsehood for me—that I swear, and for the best of all reasons, for I never knew that he did lose his place—he said on one occasion, that if he got the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., he would get a licence as a hawker—he said he could not afford to lose a guinea a-week—I do not know that he was accused of not telling the truth with regard to myself—I swear I never had any communication with him as to what he was to state to Mr. Chandler with regard to me—I treated him to nothing on the Monday night, when I gave him into custody, but a cup of tea—when he came on Saturday, I asked him to come over with me to the Borough, which he did—that was for the purpose of seeing Mr. Grayson—I swear I did not call him my counsellor—I had no friend nearer that I could have spoken to about this—we went to a public-house—Grayson is a merchant in Mint-street, Borough—he retails potatoes and coals—he is not a chandler or green-grocer—he has a wholesale business besides at the water-side, under the firm of Harvey and Grayson—his wife is a relation of mine—I know he was discharged from the Customs—he was not exchequered that I am aware of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why did you not give the prisoner into custody at that time, for trying to extort money from you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I thought he would be intimidated by the fact of calling in a policeman, and that it would deter him from ever asking me for money again, but he came again—I did not send for Mrs. Murphy to come and meet the prisoner—Mrs. Murphy and her daughter or son called at my house on the Monday—I am not aware that Mrs. Murphy talked to the prisoner about not giving any evidence against me—on my oath she was not sent for for that very purpose—I was not really afraid that I should lose my situation, if he made any statement against me—I have no fear of it now—I gave him the money to catch him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you ever sent Grayson to Mrs. Foster since this indictment has been pending? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I heard that Mrs. Foster had made a very false state<lb></lb>ment about me; and not being on terms with her, on account of refusing to lend her money, I commissioned him to go and see if she did state what I had heard she did—I did not send him to tell her not to come here, or not to give evidence before the Customs—I have never asked Lee, since the disturbance with the Dock Company and Birch, whe<lb></lb>ther</p>

               <p>he could write a good hand, nor said that I could give him some work to do as a grocer in his own line—I never said, in the presence of other parties, "Lee, if you can write well, I will get you employment as a grocer; it will be better for you than labouring work"—I have no recollection of anything of the kind; nor do I know a grocer in London; nor did I add, "Come to my lodging to-morrow (Thursday)—I have something very particular to say to you"—since these charges have been made by the Dock Company, I have never talked to Lee about getting him employment, as something better than a labouring man—a Thomas Fitzgerald is my security, but not the Fitzgerald alluded to here.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a watchman in the London Dock. On Friday, the 14th March, I was directed to take Lee from the London Docks to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184504070101"></xptr>
               <p>Arundel-street, in consequence of an inquiry before the Dock Company as to persons taking money for getting labourers situations—we saw O'Connor at the corner of Arundel-street—we walked together along the Strand—I knew that Birch was suspended—O'Connor said in Lee's hearing, "God knows the money I got from them I never put into my own pocket"—Lee was an extra labourer—I discharged Lee in the Strand, and told him in O'Connor's presence, as we were coming back, that he was discharged for telling a lie about the money—on the 4th of April, after Lee was in cus<lb></lb>tody, I told O'Connor he might be forgiven all but arresting Lee in the vile manner he did—the prisoner called at my house in Ratcliffe-highway on Saturday, the 15th—I had no appointment to meet Mr. Chandler.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you say that the mode in which you should have treated Lee would be by kicking him in a certain part? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, nothing of the sort—I never said a word about kicking him, nor that he was a great scoundrel or great rogue—I never said he was a great liar, no<lb></lb>thing of the kind, nor that he had told a lie—since then I have said so—several persons had said that O'Connor had got money from them—I went up to a man named Fitzgerald in Arundel-street—he is a very slight acquain<lb></lb>tance of mine—I visited him at the time of inquiring into these matters—I have not given him my evidence in the case—he knew principally what I had to say—I never told him anything that I was going to say here to-day, but the was in possession of everything I knew—I was subpoenaed by that party—he and I did not talk of what I was to say here—Fitzgerald was listening to the admissions that O'Connor made—he was present when this conversation was going on—Fitzgerald brought me the subpoena—I have known him, I suppose, between nine and twelve months—I have not seen him here to-day or about the Court—I did not see him here yesterday—I have not seen him for these two days—I was subpoenaed, I think on Friday, in the London Dock, not by Fitzgerald but by the prisoner's brother—I did not go and see Fitzgerald afterwards—I have not seen Fitzgerald be<lb></lb>tween Friday and to-day—I have not seen him within these six days I believe—I last saw him at his own house in Arundel-street—I called on him to make a little inquiry about this business, to see how things were going on.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What had you to do with how things were going on? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Why I was employed to inquire into the matter altogether, by my superiors, not about this charge, but about the money matters—I was employed by Mr. Clements, and I went to Fitzgerald to make inquiries into that point—I do not know much about his character—I was sent to Fitzgerald by Cle<lb></lb>ments—I swear that, not on that day—I went that day on my own business.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was your own business? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Why, the fact of the matter is this, I considered that the prisoner was badly treated and I went to Fitz<lb></lb>gerald to see what I could do for him—I did not swear just now that I called on him about the money business that day—I have been there different days—the last day I called I called on my own account—I called on the Dock' business previously—if I said I called that day about it I made a mistake—I do not say that I did—the way that you and the other coun<lb></lb>cilor put questions to me is not consistent—I am sometimes called in the Docks "The fox"—I have never been on visiting terms with Fitzgerald—I have never dined or drank with him—I never drink anything—I have</p>

               <p>been in his company when he has been drinking, more than once or twice—the first time I know Fitzgerald he was working in the Docks, and I have seen him scores of times with Mr. O'Connor—I do not know whether it was O'Connor that introduced me—I have not known Lee very long—I have seen Cavanagh and Fitzgerald together—I know where Fitzgerald lives well.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Upton, tobacconist, of 51, Church Street, Stoke Newington—on 5th September Browning came in with another man who is not here, who asked for two penny cigars, and gave me a shilling—I gave him the change, and they went out together—Kennedy then came in—I examined the shilling and bent it with my teeth—I had put it in the till—there was only copper there—Kennedy went out and brought Browning back—I said that he had passed a bad shilling—he said that it was not him, he did not pay for the cigars, it was his companion—I said that the best thing he could do was to give me a good shilling, and I should take no further notice—I said, "I know it was not you, it was your mate"—he produced his purse and showed me that he had money, but refused to pay—I gave him in custody with the bad shilling, which he broke in two pieces, and I picked them up.</p>

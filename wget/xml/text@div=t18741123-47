I am the wife of Edward Rowley, a general dealer, of Woolwich—on 7th November, a little before 12 o'clock at night, I was in the Earl of Moira public-house, Shooter's Hill Road, Charlton, and saw three Artillerymen, of whom Duffy and Bishop are two, and a man in the Scots Greys, that was Wragg—Wragg asked me to have a glass of ale, but he had not the money to pay for it, and I paid for it myself—he then asked me for some nuts, but the landlord said "You had a glass of ale and did not pay for that"—it was 11 o'clock and the landlord said it was time to clear the house—I went out first, and the soldiers followed—a policeman named King, who was in the bar, came out last and stood on the steps—Wragg asked me for another penny for a pennyworth of nuts and I heard King say "l am a policeman," in answer to something which I did not hear—there was another soldier who I don't think was in their company—the artillery men struck King and knocked him down, and I saw Duffy and Bishop strike him with their fists and then they used their whips and then they kicked him and jumped on him—I saw five Artillery men and the Scots Grey man with his back to the door—I screamed out "Murder!" and called to the landlord to come and assist him and to the landlord's son, and Wragg said "Give him one" and two Artillery men, I can't say which because it was so dark, threw me into the ditch opposite the door of the house—I crept out at a corner of the ditch and heard Wragg say "Give the b——<hi rend="italic">onions</hi>," and then he said "Give him <hi rend="italic">coals</hi>"—I ran away screaming Murder!" till I got to the station.</p>

               <p>time to close—they went out and I followed them out, and saw the six soldiers all round the woman as though they were trying to take away her nuts—she said "Don't take my nuts away"—one of them said "Who is he?" referring to me, and another said "It is a b——policeman"—Wragg said "Give the b——<hi rend="italic">onions</hi>, kick his b——brains out"—I said "Yes, I am a police-constable, and you ought to be ashamed of yourself to ill-treat that woman at this time of night on a lonely road"—the moment Wragg said "Kick the b——brains out" Duffy seized me, struck me on the side of the head and knocked me down, and the other prisoners all came round and kicked me and struck me with their whips until one of them said "I think we have given the b——enough"—I then got up and picked up this pair of gloves (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) which were lying in the road where I was knocked down—I put them in my pocket and one of them saw me and said "'The b——has got our gloves, give the b——<hi rend="italic">coals</hi>, let him have it again," and the whole six of them knocked me down and kicked me again, but I kept the gloves—they went away and I handed the gloves to Traveller, who came up, and I went up to the guard with him; we met the picket on our way with three soldiers in custody, but I don't know who they were—in the middle of the next day I found myself at the hospital with a wound on the back of my head—I was cut and bleeding, my hands were damaged, and I have been off duty ever since—I was in the hospital nine days.</p>

I am the son of the landlord of the Earl of Moira—on 7th November I was in the bar when the house closed—there were five soldiers and one Scots Grey man there—Duffy and Wragg are two of them—the woman went out first, and King last—I closed the door, heard a noise, went upstairs, looked out at a window, and saw Duffy <hi rend="italic">pilch into</hi> the prosecutor—he knocked him about with his fists, and knocked him down; and the others pitched into him when he was down, all but the Scots Grey—King halloaed out "Murder"—I did not notice the woman—I heard Wragg say "Give the b——onions"—he was then about 4 yards from them, and they were <hi rend="italic">pitching into</hi> him—I called out "Leave off," but they would not—I ran down, went out the back way, and over a wall to the guard-room, and as I got over the wall they threw four flint stones at me—when I got over the wall the Scots Grey was at the bottom—the guard-room is 500 or 600 yards off—I fetched the Artillery picket, and as I came back with them we met three of the soldiers, about 500 yards from the public-house—the picket took them in custody; it was Duffy and two other artillerymen—they did not take the Scots Grey; he went across the fields.</p>

                  </hi>. I am sergeant-major of the depot brigade of the Royal Artillery, Woolwich—these gloves are numbered 40,374, they belong to the prisoner Winter, that is his regimental number—they were shown to me on Monday at the Police Court and I saw blood on them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon of Woolwich—on Saturday night, 7th November, I was sent for to the Herbert Hospital where I found King perfectly insensible—he had a number of contused wounds on his head and a large one on the back of his head, his forehead was cut, scratched, and bleeding; his knuckles were scratched and he had various bruises on different parts of his body—he was in danger—the wounds might have been inflicted by kicking—he is out of danger now, but he will not be able to do duty for these two months.</p>

Costello says: "I was coming on Saturday night from Woolwich and I heard a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> and a man shouting 'Murder!' and I ran as far as about 20 yards from the guard room, and a bombadier caught hold of me, and the detective said 'Take every man that has a jacket on.'" <hi rend="italic">Wragg says</hi>: "On Saturday night I went to bed at 9. o'clock as usual, and I got up again at 10 o'clock or 10.30 to go to the water closet, and after leaving the closet I fell down, and lay senseless for a few minutes; I then felt better, and got up and went towards the sergeant's mess to get some brandy, and I met a non-commissioned officer of Artillery, and he said he thought the mess was closed. I then turned back and went to the Earl Moira. After being there a short time I came out and was going home, and I saw five artillerymen fighting a policeman. I looked at them a little while, and I said 'Don't kill the man, I think you have <hi rend="italic">gave</hi> him enough.' I says 'Come on <hi rend="italic">my onions</hi>, and let the man alone,' and I then went home to bed, and next day went into hospital."</p>

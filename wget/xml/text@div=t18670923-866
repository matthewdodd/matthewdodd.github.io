                  </hi>. I am a picture-frame dealer, of 12, Gutter Lane, Cheap<lb></lb>side—up to 20th July I was with Mr. Nottage, of the London Stereo<lb></lb>scopic Company—I managed the frame department and the wholesale de<lb></lb>partment as well—I have known the prisoner four or five years—he is a frame-maker—he occasionally supplied the company with goods; when he brought them there was an invoice, which I examined and put my initials to—he could then take it to the cashier and get the cash—the cashier would not pay it without my initials—it was generally the custom to pay him when he delivered the goods—on 5th July the prisoner and I and a gentleman named Way went and dined together at the Bay Tree, in St. Swithin's Lane—as soon as the prisoner had finished his dinner he said, "You must excuse my going; I must go and get some money, and will come back and pay your account"—he said that to me—he owed the company 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he then went out—I paid for his dinner—I afterwards returned to the company's place in Cheapside—I went up stairs—when we sell goods up stairs we have a little check-book in which we make entries—I went down stairs about twenty minutes after I had left the prisoner to enter 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and on the fly-leaf I saw a memorandum, "Cohen paid 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I spoke to the cashier about it, and demanded to see the invoice—the cashier showed me this invoice for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—there are the initials <hi rend="largeCaps">H. R</hi>. to it—they are not my writing—I gave no authority to write them—it is ft very good imitation indeed—none of the goods specified in that invoice had been supplied to the company—in consequence of seeing that docu<lb></lb>ment I made a search into the books for a few days back, and found that an invoice had been presented on the Wednesday before, while I was out of town—this is it, for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—it is dated 3rd July—my initials are on the top line of that invoice—that is my writing—the one below is a forgery—I gave no authority for those initials to be put—the goods men<lb></lb>tioned in that top line have been supplied to the company—there are two</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186709230015"></xptr>
               <p>other items: those have not been supplied—I was never more surprised in my life than when I found this invoice—about a week before we were at the Bay Tree the prisoner asked me to be security for a loan of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said that he was going to pay the company part of it—he then owed the company 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or I think a little more, at that time—he said part of the loan was to pay the company—I don't know what he was going to do with the remainder—he said he was going to send his wife to Germany—I was in the Dolphin, Milk Street, on 5th July, after I had discovered this—about ten minutes to eight I saw the prisoner—he asked what I was going to take—I said I must run over and see Mr. Nottage, instead of doing so I went to Bow Lane Police Station, and brought a man up and gave him in charge—I tapped the prisoner on the shoulder and said, "Mr. Cohen, I have got a very painful duty to perform, but I must do it; you have brought or you have taken an invoice into Cheapside, forged my initials to it, and got the money;" and I think I said, "There is a policeman before you"—he said, "Oh! yes, I know; but you are not going to look me up; if so, I shall commit suicide"—he put his hands to his head and began to cry—he was charged at the Mansion House on the following morning; while there he said to me that if I pressed the charge he would deny it, that I might have looked over it if I liked, and he would ruin me if possible.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long have you been in the service of Mr. Nottage? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Between six and seven years—the prisoner was employed there some time after, perhaps three years, or it might have been two years—we were upon yery friendly terms—we were often in the habit of dining together, he used to come to my private house to visit me; we were on very friendly terms indeed—I am not in Mr. Nottage's employ<lb></lb>ment now—I left to go into business on the 20th of the same month—I can't remember the date of the last examination before the Magistrate—I left Mr. Nottage on the 20th—I left of ray own accord—Mr. Nottage is, I believe, in Paris—I was certainly not discharged by Mr. Nottage—I had been looking after premises, and was going into business for myself—I did not give him notice, I left without giving any notice; the reason I left was I had been out an hour or so, and Mr. Nottage was rather cross, and I told him he was not satisfied—he said he would suspend me for a short time, and I told him I would leave at once—he certainly did not discharge me there and then—he had before told me that complaints had been made to him about me; he did not do so on that day; he complained of my being out—I forget what he said—it was perhaps a fortnight before that he had complained of me; I can't recollect what it was he said; I swear that—he was a little cross about something, I can't say what it was; I don't think he made a complaint since—I left on the 20th in consequence of his being cross—one of my fellow clerks is here, who was in the counting-house and heard all that took place, Mr. Clark—I am now in business for myself—I can't say how long Mr. Nottage has been abroad—the body of this invoice is in the prisoner's writing—I do not know what motive he had for paying the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. out of this 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he did pay it; the company was pressing him for the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; it was my duty to do it—I did press him for it—it was for frames that had been supplied to him by the company—it had been due some months, and it was my duty to press for it—they were supplied on 11th June—I am referring to the day-book; that is in the handwriting of Mr. Heal, the clerk that was up on the first floor with me; he is here—the other invoice, for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., is dated</p>

               <p>July 3rd—there are two items in that which the company neverhad from him, a dozen Oxfords at 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each, and three maple frames—he never de<lb></lb>livered those to the company—we never had them; I swear that—I never sent any body for them, I swear that—I did not on 2nd July go to the prisoner's house in a cab and take away those frames that are charged for in this invoice—I do not know Julia Jameson, Mrs. Nightingale, or Joseph Jameson. (<hi rend="italic">They were here called in.</hi>) I know that man by sight, I may have seen Julia Jameson before, but I could not swear it; I do not know Mrs. Nightingale—I know the prisoner's brother—the prisoner lived at 34, Little Charlotte Street, Blackfriars—I had been to his house some time previously to 2nd July, I can't say exactly the date—I can't recollect whether I saw the prisoner's brother on 1st July—I did not on that day give him an order for one dozen Oxford frames and for three Maple ditto—I did not direct them to be finished by dinner-time on the next day—I did not on the next day go in a cab and in the presence of the prisoner's brother and the three persons just called in, take away the Oxford frames and the three Maples, nor did any body for me by my orders—they were not brought to Cheapside—nobody fetched them froa the prisoner's house by my direction, I swear that—no accident happened in the removal, one of the frames was not broken—I have sent to his house for things a great many times; I have sent perhaps a dozen people at different times—I can't tell when I bad sent before 2nd July—I have gone myself lots of times—I can't recollect how soon before 2nd July I had been—I directed the prisoner to take a frame for a picture to my house; it was for myself—it was charged to the company, and I paid for it about a week after—that was six or seven months ago—it was for a picture of Christ walking on the sea—he took the frame and picture to my house—it was entered in the books of the company when I paid the cash, which was in about a week—it was entered in one of the, very old books, it may be six or eight months ago, I may possibly be able to find it—I did not tell any body in the establishment that he was going to take it to my house—I said what the cash was for when I paid it—I don't know that I had told any body in the establishment that the frame was to be charged to the company—I never used to tell them where the frames were going—I told the prisoner to charge it to the company—I believe it was paid for in the ordinary way, by sending in a bill which was initialed by me before the money was paid—I used to send out hundreds of frames, and no one knew anything about where they were going to—he may have delivered goods at other places for the company, but not for me—I was in authority over him—I directed him to take this frame to my place, and to charge it to the company—I never told him to takes things to other places and charge them to the company—I did not see the prisoner on 3rd July—I did not meet him about twelve o'clock that day and walk with him as far as the Peel statue in Cheapside—I did not see his brother David and his brother-in-law Jameson, and another person with him—I did not tell them that I was going home to Brixion as my children had a holiday—he and I did not walk together down Lud<lb></lb>gate Hill and go into Lockey's public-house—the prisoner did not ask me what time I should return, as he wanted money of the company—I did not say, "Probably between four and five"—I had told every one that I was going for the day and should not be back—I had told the manager so—I was in town up to one o'clock—the prisoner did not ask me if I would pay him part of the money I owed him—I did not say, "No, but have you got your</p>

I owed him he could not pay in the time—I did not then say, "I must give you an order for some goods"—I did not receive a letter from him next day—I received one about a fortnight ago, which I have here—that is the only letter I have received—it is in the prisoner's writing, his wife brought it, a few, days after he was let out on bail—his brother did not on the 5th bring me a letter and this invoice for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., nor did I in the brother's presence put my initials to it—I never saw the invoice until it was produced by our cashier—I did not give back the invoice to the prisoner's brother and tell him that his brother must come himself for the money at one o'clock—he was there at one o'clock on the 5th—I saw him—he was not paid until after he returned from the Bay Tree, where he dined with me and Mr. Way, a pictnre-frame maker, of the Edgware Road—the prisoner used to come to the premises very often,'at all hours of the day—he did not show me this invoice when he came at one o'clock—I can't say at what time he was paid on the 5th—it was not paid before we went to dinner—these are very like my initials—it was at the Dolphin that I gave him into custody—I did not tell him there had been a row at the office, and the governor had found out that I had passed bills before the goods were delivered; nothing of the sort—I did not say, "I have been detained for two hours; you know I have a wife and three little children, and I cannot afford to lose my place, and bo I said I did not sign the bill which got paid to-day"—something was said about three little children, but they were his children that I offered to take care of—I have three children—I told him that Mr. Nottage had told me to lock him up—I was the one to find the matter out and put it before Mr. Nottage at once, about an hour after I, returned from dinner—I told him they were not my Initials, and upon that he de sired me to give the prisoner into custody—there is a witness here who was in the counting-house at the time—nothing had happened previously about these invoices to make them the topic of conversation by any of the clerks—this little book (<hi rend="italic">handing it in</hi>) will explain how I came to find this out—I have put my initials to invoices for goods before they were delivered, upon the understanding that they would be in, to accommodate the prisoner, and I have had them—I have done so on two Or three occasions—this, book is the cashier's, Mr. Morrell's writing—you will find the date, of the pay<lb></lb>ment of the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a few leaves forward—this is not all in the cashier's writing, perhaps a dozen persons—it was quite by accident that I saw this 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and on seeing it I asked to see the invoice—I was very much astonished—I said, "What! has Cohen paid?" and Morrell said, "Yes, I have taken it out of his account"—I have got the young man here who was sitting just behind Morrell when he gave me the invoice—I told Mr. Nottage of it as soon as he returned, the same day—I told him that the prisoner had received the money and put my initials, which he had no right to do—this 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was not due to him at all, none of it—the goods had not been delivered—the three days' work had taken place, but it had been paid for previously; some time before—it might have been a fortnight before; I can't tell when—he generally had his money as soon as his work was done—I never paid him; the cashier, Morrell, did—he would not know whether the work was done or no, so long as the invoice was signed he would pay it—these "twelve Oxfords, 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>." had not been ordered, not by me—I did not say on this occasion, "Don't say a word about it; I will make it all right with the governor; you will be locked up to-night only, and as no one will appear against you you will be discharged"—I said I would make the case as light as possible for him, because it was not a very pleasant thing to lock up an intimate friend—I did not say, "You don't blame me, Cohen, do you?" nor did he reply, "To-morrow will show"—I don't remember anything of the sort—Heal has never signed my initials—I never authorised him to do so—I may have done so when I have been busy; I would not swear that I have not—I have never authorised the prisoner to do so—Heal was a confidential clerk up stairs, and the prisoner only an outdoor frame joiner—I know Mr. Watson, a frame-maker, he supplies the firm with frames—Heal was in the habit of writing orders to Watson for goods—I can't say whether he has signed my initials to those—I can't say—I know Mr. French, the landlord of the Coachmakers' Arms—I don't know Mr. Newton Wood by name—(<hi rend="italic">Mr. Wood was here called in</hi>) I know him very well by sight—I remember French and Wood calling on me in Cheap<lb></lb>side after Cohen had been locked up—I did not say to them, "I was obliged to lock Cohen up to save myself from being locked up"—I received this letter from the prisoner after he was out on bail.

                  </hi>. I am clerk in the service of the Stereo<lb></lb>scopic Company—I have known Cohen for some time as dealing with the company and the company with him—about a fortnight or three weeks previous to this matter happening he was in the counting-house waiting for Mr. Heed, who was out, and I saw him scribbling something on the blotting pad—he was doing so for about five or ten minutes as he sat in my seat at the desk—I looked at the pad, and saw he had been writing the letters <hi rend="largeCaps">H.

               <p>them were like Mr. Reed's initials—I said to the prisoner, "It is like your impudence to make these initials"—I then tore off the sheet from the blotting pad and destroyed it—he did not make any observation; be merely laughed—I remember his being there on the 3rd July, about three o'clock—I don't remember his going to the cashier—Mr. Reed was absent at the time—I believe he had left about one o'clock in the day—he did not come back—I don't remember seeing him again that day—the prisoner asked for him, and I said he was out, that he might return about six, and he might not come back again that day—on the 5th, when I saw him paid this money by the last witness, Mr. Reed was not on the premises, he was at dinner.</p>
               <p>

Reed—I will not swear that I have not signed his initials—I know his handwriting pretty well—I am not aware that any of the other clerks were permitted to sign for him—I can't say what day it was I saw the prisoner writing those initials—I did not tell Mr. Reed of it until after the prisoner was in custody—I have been in the employment fourteen months—I was very intimate with Mr. Reed—I do not know whether the other assistant, Mr. Green, has written his letters for him and signed his name; he may have done so—I was not examined on the first occasion before the Magistrate; I was on the second—between those examinations I had some conversation with Mr. Reed—it was then I told him about these initials—he had told me that the prisoner had signed his initials, and I then told him voluntarily that I had seen Cohen writing his initials on the blotting pad—these initials on the invoice are very like Mr. Reed's, I should not know the difference—I should very likely say they were his if they were shown to me without my having heard anything about them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a framemaker and carver, and live at 8, Ashley Crescent—I happened to be present at the Dolphin when Mr. Reed gave the prisoner into custody—he said to him, "Cohen, you have presented a bill over the way and signed my initials to it, for which I must have you taken"—Cohen said, "I know I have, but you won't have me taken up, will you, Harry?"—Mr. Reed said, "I must have you taken," and with that forthwith called a constable in, but before he called him in Cohen put up his hands and made some remark, and nearly fell backwards against the door.</p>

               <p>the Magistrate on the first occasion.

I have had to give him in charge; I was obliged to lock him up; if I had not I should have been locked up myself, so I did it to save myself"—he did not say why he should have been locked up himself—he said Cohen was locked up for a forgery, for signing his name on a bill—I did not ask him what he meant by being locked up himself; that was not my business; all I wanted was to ascertain where Cohen was—I went to Newgate to see Cohen once; that was about a week after that conversation—Mr. Wood was not with me—I did not make any inquiry of Mr. Nottage about this matter.</p>

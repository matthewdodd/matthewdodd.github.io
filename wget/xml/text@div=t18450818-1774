                  </hi>. I live in Dacre-street, Westminster, and am a saddler. On the night of the 3rd of Aug., at twelve o'clock, I was going down Stangate-street—I met the two prisoners—they stood in the middle of the path, and said, "My dear, where are you going?"—they seized hold of me, and took all sorts of liberties with me—while Upton was taking liberties with me, Code picked my pocket of four half-crowns—I put my hand to my pocket where I had had four half-crowns, and I missed them—I perceived that Code had robbed me, because Upton held me while Code picked my pocket—the money was in my right-hand waistcoat pocket—I called, "Police;" and two men immediately flew from some door-way to the prisoners—there seemed like some conversation with them, and something was handed—one of the men ran off—the other came to me, and said, "Don't be alarmed, I will protect you"—I would not leave the prisoners—they shuffled into another street, to get away from me, but I would not leave them—I said, "You have robbed me;" and they made a sort of jeer of it—the policeman came up, and I gave them in charge.</p>

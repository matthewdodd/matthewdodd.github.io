                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Philip Saunders Phillips, a pawnbroker, at Stratford. On 16th Jan. the prisoner came to our shop with Ann Donovan—she came to redeem some articles she had pawned—I was serving a customer at the time—some bed-gowns were produced—there was one in particular which I had in my hand, and I placed it on the writing-desk with some others—the prisoner left the shop, and in about half an hour I missed the bed-gown—I made inquiries, and found it at Mrs. Raynor's—this is it—I can swear to it by the mark—next morning the prisoner came to the shop—I sent for Mrs. Raynor, and she identified her—when I accused the prisoner of stealing it, Donovan who came with her was outside—the prisoner said Donovan gave it her, and Donovan denied it.</p>

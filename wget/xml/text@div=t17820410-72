               <p>Of what? - Of old hock.</p>
               <p>When did you miss it? - Upon Good-friday I believe it was missing.</p>
               <p>Did you miss any before that? - I never minded it till this time, I am an old man, am fourscore years of age, I saw three bottles taken from the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Can you by any certainty know that it was your wine? - I had seals upon it, it was part of the wine I had lost, I sold the same sort for three pounds, and three guineas a dozen.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>Was any more found than those bottles you mentioned, those three bottles, and the four bottles put by? - No.</p>
               <p>You found three bottles, and four, ready to be taken away? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you found any more of the quantity you missed? - No.</p>
               <p>How did they get into the cellar? - They broke it open, t he door had been locked.</p>
               <p>Did they break the lock or break the door of it? - They picked the lock, the padlock, or forced the staple, I had seen it locked about three or four days before this robbery; I have another cellar besides, she had took some and drank others, as she acknowledged, I dare say they sold it for a shilling.</p>

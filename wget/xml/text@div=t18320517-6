            . I am an officer of Marlborough-street. I produce a great coat, smelling-bottle, and umbrella, which I found at Glover's-hatch, New-cut, Lambeth, on the 30th of April, at the prisoner's house; we apprehended him there that day - the things were up stairs; the shirt, cap, and smelling-bottle in a box with other things; as I took the things out of the box he owned several of them - he had got the coat on his back; I did not take that from him till the 7th of May, when I found the prosecutor had lost such a coat; I am sure he had that coat on on the 30th of April - he was committed for re-examination.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You found the prisoner in the lower room, I believe? A. Yes; I never heard that the house belonged to a woman named Henson - I traced the prisoner to have moved there that morning.</p>

            . I produce an umbrella, which I found in the lower room of the house; and in a closet, up stairs, when I took the prisoner up, I found between thirty and forty skeleton-keys, two crow-bars, a phosphorus-box, and two files; the skeleton-keys would open almost any lock they would go into - I did not try them to Mr. Sadler's door; here is one picklock among them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you believe the prisoner had been there twenty-four house? A. This was Monday; I heard he had moved in there on Saturday.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

I never owned any thing in the room, and that Clements well knows - he wanted me to own them, but I did not; I was not aware they were in the house when I took it - there never was a man brought into Court so ensuared by villainy as I have been - my right name is Fisher; I was not born in wedlock - my father's name was Crowson.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and reside now at No. 95, London-road, Southwark; I formerly occupied a beershop, in Middle Grove-street, St. George's-in-the-East. On Wednesday, 13th Dec., the prisoner came to that beer shop, between 5 and 6 o'clock in the evening—he called for a glass of ale, and I served him—he asked me if my house was to be disposed of—I told him, yes—I had previously advertised the house for sale in the newspapers—I asked him if he would like to look at the inventory—after looking at it, he went out into the neighbourhood, and looked about—he said he should like to look at the neighbourhood, to see if it was a good one, before he made any to-do about the house—he came back, and I showed him over the house—he said he liked the house very well, and it would just do for him and his son—he asked if I would have anything to drink, and we had a pint of ale between us, which he paid for—he asked how much I would take for the house—I said, "Nothing less than 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he said he would not give any more than 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he stuck to that from the time of his coming in until his going out—after some time had elapsed, I told him I would take 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—he said, no, he would not give any more than the 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we finally agreed on 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he then sent my little girl for a quartern of gin, and paid for it—I took a very little of it—he agreed to give me the 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I called in Robert Baker to draw up the agreement, and witness it—this is the agreement Baker drew up—(<hi rend="italic">This being read, the prisoner, described as Joseph Stanley, agreed to take the house of the witness, and pay a deposit of</hi> 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.)—the prisoner signed this "Joseph Stanley" in my presence—he had told me during the conversation that his name was Joseph Stanley, and that he had come from Uxbridge that morning—he said he was a small farmer there—lie said it would do for his son, and he would bring his son next day; if he was not there between 12 and 2 o'clock, he would be at 4 o'clock—he said his son was lately married, and the business would just do for him—I asked him for a deposit of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said, "No; if I give you a deposit of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I shall leave myself without money; I will leave you a deposit of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I will return to you to-morrow, as I mean to do business"—I afterwards agreed with him for a deposit of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—while the inventory was being written out, he handed me a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note to be changed, in order to make the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deposit—I asked him to write his name on the note, and he wrote on it, "Joseph Stanley," in my presence—this is the note (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I took it to a neighbour, Mr. Smith, a grocer, to get it changed, and I wrote my name on it in Mr. Smith's shop—when I got back to my house I put the money down on the table—the whole of the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was in silver—the prisoner picked up 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and left 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the table for me—he then said if he did not make haste he should be too late for the <hi rend="italic">bus</hi>—he said he wanted to go to Paddington—whilst he was reaching over his hand to take up the money, I noticed his hand, and noticed that the top part of his finger was off—as he went away, he said he should be to his time appointed next day—he seemed to be in a very great hurry to be off after he had got the</p>

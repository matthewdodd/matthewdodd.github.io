                  </hi>. I am foreman to John Cope Folkard, pawnbroker, London-road. On the 2nd of Dec. 1842, the prisoner pawned an ingot of silver, wrapped up in two papers—he said, "Eight ounces of silver, 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. an ounce; 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—upon that I united the paper containing the goods, and found it was an ingot of silver—I applied the test of aquafortis—it responded to the test as silver—I rubber it, I weighed it, and found it weighed eight ounces—I advanced 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he took out at that time a pair of silver snuffers—he is a silver-snuffer-maker by trade—ib the 7th of December be brought eight ounces more, wrapped up as before—he said, "Eight ounces, the same as before, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I applied the same tests, and found it responded to the test as silver—I weighed, and found it weighed 80Z.—I gave him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it, and out of the money he redeemed a pair of snuffers—on the 22nd and 30th of Dec. he brought 80z. of silver, and said "Eight ounces, the same as before, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I did not test them, because they were so similar in appearance—he was present when I took them—I went to the other end of the shop to weigh them—I should think he saw that I did not test it—he received cash on the two last occasions—on the 13th of March, all the silver that I had received had been redeemed by payments in cash—on the 22nd of March he produced these two articles wrapped up in two papers, precisely in the way the others were done up, and the same in form, appearance, and mould—he said, "Eight</p>

               <p>Ounces, 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. an ounce, the same as before, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I did not test them—I merely weighed them—I believed them to be silver, the former being silver and these being so similar in form, and wrapped up in the same manner, and because he said "The same as before"—I gave him two tickets and the money—on the morning of the 24th of March he pledged a pair of genuine silver snuf<lb></lb>fers for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and redeemed them in the evening by bringing these other two ingots, and said, "Eight ounces, 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. an ounce, the same as before, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each"—at that time he produced the ticket for the snuffers he had pledged in the morning—I allowed him on account 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he received the balance, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.,—on the 4th on Dec. 1843, he came again, and brought these two pieces—he said, "Eight ounces, 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. an ounce, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. the same as before"—I paid him 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in cash—when I paid him on former occasions I paid him in gold and silver—on the 30th of Dec. he came again, and produced these two pieces—he said, "Eight ounces, 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. an ounce, the same as before"—he then pro<lb></lb>duced a ticket for a pair of snuffers, which had been pawned for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and said he would take these out—he received in case 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

               <p>that everything he has put in has been taken out—my reason for not testing on these other occasions was that the first ingots were silver, and these were precisely similar in appearance—my reason for advancing the money was be<lb></lb>cause I considered that they would be redeemed—if he had been a stranger I should have tested them all unless I had received the former pieces.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an assayer, and conduct business in Maiden-lane. I have assayed these forty-six packages that are here—none of them are silver—they are metal of very little value—they appear to me to be a kind of pewter—they are nearly all of the same material, and are worth about 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound.</p>

I accom<lb></lb>panied Fell to No. 60, St. John-street, with a warrant—Fell went in, and in about a minute I went in—the prisoner said, "You are an officer, I presume?" I said, "Yes"—he said, "Have you got a warrant?"—I said, "Yes, shall I read it?"—he said, "No; if you please, I will," which he did, and said, "Yes, I am the man, my name is as stated on the duplicates"—he afterwards said he thought Mr. Folkard was vindictive; if he had come himself, it might have been arranged differently, but as it was, it would be his ruin, and Mr. Fol<lb></lb>kard's loss.</p>

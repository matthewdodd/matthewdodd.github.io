                  </hi>. I keep an eating house, in Church-lane, Whitechapel. On 28th Oct. the prisoner came for three quarters of a pound of roast mutton—I am sure she is the person—I served her—it came to 9 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she paid with a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece—my wife took charge of it—I gave her the change, and she went away—on 1st Nov. she came again for two quarters of a pound of pudding—I served her—she paid with a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece—I noticed it was bad, but notwithstanding that I gave her change, and let her go out of the shop—I followed her—she went up Colchester-street, turned back, and went towards Whitechapel—she crossed over to Osborne-street, and then a man came up to her, and spoke to her—he then went away—she went on further, and I went up to her, laid hold of her, and said she had passed a bad 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece—I asked her to go back to the shop—in going along she put 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. into my hand—I said, "Still you must come back; I think I have another 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece of yours"—a mob came round—she addressed them, and said it was very hard to see a woman dragged along the street in that way—I saw a policeman and gave her into custody—I gave the policeman the last crown, and I applied to my wife for the other crown, and gave him that.</p>

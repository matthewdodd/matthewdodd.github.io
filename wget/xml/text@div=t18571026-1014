(<hi rend="italic">Policeman, B</hi> 254) I was in Ranelagh Street on 9th Oct; something was said to me by the last witness, and I pursued the prisoner—he was running away in the direction of Chester Square, and I saw him throw something away with his right hand—it was either a half sovereign or a sovereign; it glistened like gold—I afterwards searched, but I did not-find it—I was about twenty yards from him when he threw it—he was in the road, about two yards from the railings—I caught him at last, and told him he was charged with passing had money, and must come back with me—I took him back to the last witness in Ranelagh Street—another constable had come up to her just as I was bringing the prisoner back—he had a penknife in his hand, and was marking the half sovereign—the prisoner made a grab at it with his left hand, and it fell down in the road—the constable who had marked it picked it up—the last witness charged the prisoner with passing the bad half sovereign—he made no reply—I took him to the station, searched him, and found on him this purse, with two half crowns, one shilling, and a medal, but no gold—I told the inspector, before the prisoner, that I had seen him throw away something, and the inspector sent me back to see for it—I said I saw the prisoner throw away a half sovereign or a sovereign.</p>

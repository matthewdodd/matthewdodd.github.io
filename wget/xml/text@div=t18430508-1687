On the 11th of April I saw my hus<lb></lb>band clear the till of all the gold coin—there was none left in the till—Con<lb></lb>nor was employed in waiting in the house as an extra hand during the fair. Between four and five o'clock in the evening of the 13th of April, Welham came in—he asked for half a pint of rum, which came to 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I put it on the counter—Connor ordered it—Welham came up, and said to Connor, "Bill, is this for me?

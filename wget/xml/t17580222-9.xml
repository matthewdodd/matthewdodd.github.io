            . On the 3d of January I went to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175802220008"></xptr> spend the evening at the King's-Head in Red-Lion-Street, Goodman's-Fields, with several tradesmen, and staid till about twelve at night. As I live in the Borough I went to the house of Mr. Leekey, and there staid all night, with one Mr. Lambert that lives there. I went to bed with him, and the next morning I missed my watch. When I got up, about nine or ten o'clock, I inquired in the family if any body knew any thing of it. About a week afterwards another lodger in the house lost his watch, who had a warrant for the prisoner at the bar from justice Pell. I went there also. The justice shew'd me a watch, and ask'd me if it was mine. I said it was. The person that delivered it to the justice (named

            . On the 3d of January last Mr. Scot was invited by a lodger of mine to lie with him, as he was some distance from his home in the Borough. He came in about twelve o'clock, and lay with his friend Mr. Lambert. When he got up in the morning he told me he had lost his watch, and believed he had been rob'd in my house. I desired him to suspend his suspicion, and recollect himself whether he had not left it at home. The next day he came, and said he suspected the prisoner at the bar, who is a tenant at my house, on the same floor where he lay. I went into her room (her husband was not at home) ask'd her if she knew any thing of this watch, and said she was suspected of stealing it. She protested she knew nothing of it. Last Saturday Mrs. Audery, a pawnbroker, came to my house, and went to the prisoner's room, whom I ask'd if she had ever a watch pawn'd in the prisoner's name, or pawn'd by her in any other name. She said she did not know what her husband had done, but she had not took in any of her. Another man that had lost his watch in my house, about a week afterwards, went to Mrs. Audery's, where, I was afterwards informed, Mr. Scot's watch was seen. I went to Mr. Pell the justice, and got a search warrant, who sent for Mrs. Audery; she brought the watch there, and the prosecutor own'd it.</p>

            . I keep a pawnbroker's shop. The prisoner at the bar brought a watch to pawn for two guineas, and said it was her husband's. I would not lend her so much on it. In about a quarter of an hour after she came again, and said her husband would make shift with a guinea and half, so I lent it her on it. I always took her to be of a good character.</p>

The prisoner came to lodge with me on the 7th of November, and on the 10th I went up stairs, at twenty minutes before twelve o'clock, leaving him in my back parlour, and the watch on the drawers - he called to me, and said, "Mistress, I shall be back at two o'clock, if any one wants me." I came down, and saw him going off the step; I ran into the back parlour as he was going out so suddenly, and missed the watch - I ran up the street, and overtook him in Hat and Tun-yard, in custody of a young man; I asked him for the watch, which he gave me out of his pocket.</p>

While we were talking of this, this young man, the 'squire, as they called him, came up; he walked about the room and laid down a guinea on the table, and told the prisoner he might take it up if he pleased; the prisoner said no, he did not want it, I have money enough; upon which the 'squire and another began gaming, by naming a piece of money put under a candlestick; the 'squire lost, and then he said, with an oath, I have got among a parcel of barbers, taylors, and weavers, they have not one of them got any money; I will give every one a shilling for every guinea he can produce; upon which every one of the company, the prisoner with the rest, pulled out what money they had, and put it down on the table; then I pulled out my sixteen guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the 'squire give you the sixteen shillings?</p>
               <p>Leman. No. I was going to put my money in my pocket as the rest had done; upon which a man there, that said he was the landlord, catched hold of my hand, and said, let me have it, you shall have it again, but don't tell my wife; I have lost a good deal, but I will let you have it again; they made some motions among them, and then he said he had lost the money; he said he would give it me, and called me out to the door; by the time we had got about ten yards from the house, the landlord ran away; then I turned back and found the candles were all put out, and every one of them were gone; I enquired of the landlady what was become of them; she said she knew none of them, she never saw them before in her life. I did not tell them I had lost any thing, or make any particular complaint, but went next morning and enquired at the house, and somebody told me the names of them I believe, and I got a warrant; this was about four or five days before the man was taken up. The prisoner was the first man that began the gambling.</p>

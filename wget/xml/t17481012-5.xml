I mistrusted him, and as I was weighing them, he took a silver castor which I now have in my pocket: I said he did not look as if he wanted to buy, but rather to steal, but I did not know then that he had stole it; and when he saw me turn my eye towards the place where the castor was, he run away, and I run after him and cried stop thief.</p>

               <p>Triquett. No, I fell down, and when he found the people were pursuing him, he threw the castor into the kennel, the castor was upon the counter when he first came into the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him you had missed the castor?</p>
               <p>Triquett . No, I had no opportunity, he was taken and brought back into the shop, and he asked pardon, and said it was the first time that ever he was guilty of such a thing, and hoped I would forgive him; I said it was not in my power to do any such thing: I carried him before justice Fraser , and then he denied it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you see me take it off the counter?</p>

            . Last Wednesday night I was going along accidentally, and a little beyond Mr. Triquett's door I heard them call out stop thief, and the prisoner said if they would not stop him he would throw it down, and he did throw it down .</p>
               <p>Q. Who did he say so to?</p>
               <p>Sinclair . To the mob.</p>
               <p>Q. How could you know him again?</p>
               <p>Sinclair . He was carried first to Mr. Triquett's shop , and then I was 2 hours with him afterwards before the Justice.</p>
               <p>Three witnesses said the prisoner was an honest man, had behaved faithfully to them, and gave him a good character.</p>

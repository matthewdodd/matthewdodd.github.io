                  </hi>. I am a gentleman, and live in Blasson Cottages. On 12th Jan., between half-past 7 and 8 o'clock, I was taking a walk down Sloane Street—I had occasion to go to a particular court—after I had been there about a minute a woman came and asked me to direct her to some place—I said I could not tell her—I was then turning down the court to go into the main street, and I saw the prisoner and a tall man; they both rushed up to me and held my arm—I said, "What are you holding my arm for?" and, my coat being unbuttoned, the prisoner put his hand in my pocket and took my watch, which I had seen about a minute before—the female had left me—Ihad my watch after she had left me—it was loose; there was no guard to it—I seized the prisoner and accused him of taking the watch—I saw him hand the watch to the other man—I called the police, and the other man ran away—I stuck to the prisoner—the policeman came in eight or nine minutes; I held the prisoner all that time—I gave six guineas for the watch.</p>

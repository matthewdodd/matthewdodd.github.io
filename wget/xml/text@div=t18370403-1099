                  </hi>. I live in Bishopsgate-street-without, and am a paper-hanger. On Friday, the 10th of March, I went out, and when I returned I found the prisoner Bull looking at some paper-hangings for a staircase, for a job that he had—he ordered me to send twenty pieces to No. 4, Nothing<lb></lb>ham-place, Pearson-street, Kingsland-road, which I wrote down at the time</p>

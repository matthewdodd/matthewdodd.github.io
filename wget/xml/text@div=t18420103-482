                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City police-constable, No,</hi> 139.) I had a person named Welsh in custody on Sunday night, the 19th of December, and as I was taking him to prison I was surrounded by the prisoner and nine<lb></lb>teen or twenty men, in Brackley-street, Golden-lane—the prisoner was the first that came to rescue Welsh from me—he, had got a jacket on, and the prisoner came and cut the jacket, or tore it, and got him loose—I had a staff in my hand, with the string round my hand—I think the prisoner cut it from my hand, and took it from me, and ran away, which caused Welsh to escape—I was not much hurt, but I sprained my ankle—the staff was the property of the Mayor and Commonalty of London.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Brackley-street. About half-past seven o'clock this evening, I heard a cry of "Let him go"—I came out, and saw the policeman surrounded by twelve or twenty men—I rushed in, and seized Welsh, and dragged him out, but I was overpowered, and they rescued him—the prisoner was very active, and I believe he was one that struck me—I did not see who took the staff—the prisoner was taken a day or two after.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I was rather intoxicated—I saw a mob, and went round—the policeman struck me a violent blow—on his striking me a second time, I took the staff, and I suppose the string broke—I <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> it on the ground.</p>

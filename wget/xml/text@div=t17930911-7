               <p>Q. Did you ever see the prisoner? - I see him on Thursday the 20th of August; about half after three he came and knocked at the door, I being alone in the house went up and asked him what he wanted; I am sure the prisoner is the man, the prisoner came into the house and asked me if I did not know him, I said no, says he, don't you know your uncle, he then said he wanted some money, I said I had nothing but a few halfpence, he said that would not do, he took and put my apron up to my mouth, I screamed out, he said if I cried out any more he would cut my throat;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110012"></xptr>he then put his hand into my pocket and took out a tin box, it contained two guineas and a half, and eighteen-pence, he took the two guineas and half out of the box, and left the eighteen-pence, and threw it down on the floor and said I might take it and be damned, and went away; he was with me about ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon afterwards did you see the prisoner? - In ten minutes. As soon as he was gone I went and looked out of the parlour window, and I did not see any body, and I went to the door and I saw a little girl, and I asked her if she saw the prisoner? she said she had, and while I was at the door speaking to this little girl, I saw the prisoner come out of the door of another house, Mr. Osborne's; I was standing at this time at my own door about a hundred yards from Mrs. Osborne's door.</p>

               <p>I saw the prisoner on the 20th of August, a little before four, at Mrs. Osborne's; he knocked at the door, and asked me if my mistress was at home? I said, no, but if he had any message I would deliver it; he said he had no message to deliver to my mistress, but he had made her a present of many pheasants and partridges; I was to give his compliments, and his name was Mr. Harrison.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ask about your master? - He did; I told him he had been dead about ten years.</p>

               <p>I apprehended the prisoner; and in a purse, in his pocket, I found a shilling in one pocket, and in another pocket I found four-pence halfpenny; that is all. I found him at the Adam and Eve public house, Petty France, drinking.</p>

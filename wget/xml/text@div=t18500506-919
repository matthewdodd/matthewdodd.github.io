                  </hi>. I am the wife of Samuel Newell, of Grove-road, St. John's-wood. The prisoner was in my service two years ago—I was going to have a party on Friday, 5th April, and engaged her to assist—there was a great deal of plate used at the dinner—I told her to come the next day and clear up—she came on the Saturday, and the plate was afterwards looked over, and a spoon, two dessert-spoons, one table-fork, and a dessert-fork, were missing—the prisoner was then gone home—I suspected her, and sent for her—she came back with my servant—I told her I suspected her, and taxed her very severely—she assured me she had not got it—my husband called in a police<lb></lb>man, and gave her in charge—I had sent her up to my bedroom, about seven o'clock, with some plate, half an hour before she went away.</p>

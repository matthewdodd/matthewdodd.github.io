"Do you hear that"—he said, "That is my business, and not yours"—I then went to the last witness's shop in Drury-court, and he handed me these books which I now produce, and which he said he bought from the prisoner—I then went to Mrs. Miller's lodgings, 15, Clare-court, and on the top of the house, between the roof and the ceiling of the third floor, I found this looking-glass, these three pictures, and this tablecloth—it was a sort of lumber-room—I then went to the prisoner's lodgings and found the silk umbrella which has been identified by the prosecutrix.</p>

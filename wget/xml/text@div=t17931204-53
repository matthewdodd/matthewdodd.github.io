               <p>Q. Do you make up a number of beds in your house? - Yes, eight and forty.</p>


               <p>Q. Have you lost any sheets? - I have lost a great number.</p>
               <p>Q. In what situation in your house was Gladden, the prisoner? - In the situation of <rs id="t17931204-53-deflabel292" type="occupation">head chamber maid</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17931204-53-defend590 t17931204-53-deflabel292"></join>.</p>
               <p>Q. In her situation had she the care of the linen sheets? - She had.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence, if any sheets were wanted in the course of the business, must the other servants have applied to her, or could they have got them without her assistance? - None were able to give out any, but herself.</p>
               <p>Q. Who made the beds? - Both Gladden and Weeden, the other chambermaid. Weeden cleaned and scoured the rooms, and was under Gladden.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a girl of the name of Brown? - Yes, in the kitchen, under the cook, and apprentice, but she had no business in making the beds, that was entirely trusted to Weeden and Gladden.</p>
               <p>How long had Gladden lived with you? - She came to me the beginning of August, about the seventh or eighth, by the Ware coach, as a country person; and was hired in the capacity of chambermaid, and left me the 19th of November, rather in an abrupt manner.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any charcter with her? - No, we wanted a chambermaid at that time, and there was an old man of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179312040132"></xptr>name of Cooper, that recommended her, that carries lemons and oranges.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after she left you, had you any suspicion of losing any property? The next morning; she left us on Tuesday; she came in that morning, and desired her mistress to settle with her what money was due to her, and a guinea that she had deposited for some things, that they use in their business, for she wanted to go down into the country, and could not stop. It is the custom of our house to have security of our upper chambermaid; her mistress told her, that the gentlemen in the house were not stirring, and she would see in what state the linen was, before she settled with her. She began to make use of very bad language, and swore that she was neither a thief nor a drunkard, and that her mistress should not detain her; however, she told her, she certainly should detain her, till such times as she had looked the linen over; after we could get into the rooms, we went about, and took an account of the different sheets that were on the beds, and what was dirty and clean, and what was at the washerwoman's; we found there were twenty-one short of the account she had given in, when they were looked up before.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the last time, that the sheets had been taken an account of? - The 7th of October, and then they were not all there, only she made up that number according to her own account, by saying, there were rooms that she could not get in at. She said, there were no more, they must be in the drawers, for she would be d-d if she had not brought the sheets in, when she took them off the beds, and she would be settled with; her mistress took her in, and made her tell over the clean linen, and the account of what was at the washerwoman's, and she said, she had not got them; I was present when that was done, still there was the same deficiency of twenty-one; after that she began to make use of bad language; I sent for a constable, and gave charge of her, on suspicion of having stolen the sheets; she was not fully committed, till the 27th, about a week after. The constable who was charged with her, instead of taking her to the Compter, took her over to the public house, where she lodged the night before, and let her drink tea with the mistress. I was not pleased with his behaviour in the business, and I would not let him have any thing more to do with her. She was taken into custody that night, the 20th of November.</p>
               <p>Q. Besides these sheets, did you loose any thing else? - There were three towels found at Mr. Parker's of mine, there was a linen pillow cafe at Mr. Watson's, in Watling-street, and a check bed curtain, which I found the duplicate on Weeden.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you missed them at the time, you took Gladden up? - I had not, but I found afterwards, they were missing; they have our mark on them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing more of this matter of your own knowledge, then what you have now related? - Nothing more than finding the sheets at different pawnbrokers.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You keep the Angel Inn? - I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you the sole proprietor? - I am.</p>
               <p>Q. The last account you had taken of your property, was so long ago as the 7th of October.</p>
               <p>Q. These sheets must have been missed of course, before the prisoner returned again, to have her wages paid her? - These sheets were part of them pawned at the time she gave her account.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she return to your house to have her wages settled, after these sheets were pawned? - She did on Wednesday morning.</p>

            ? - She was an apprentice.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had she lived with you? - She came to me in December, 1792.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she remained in your service all the time? - She continued in my service till about the 27th of September last, when I turned her over to Mrs. Robinett, in Holborn.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, what was the reason that you turned her over to Mrs. Robinett? - Because a girl in our house is not a very proper person to be kept at an inn.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to give that answer to the jury? - I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the only reason why you parted with

            ? - Every fault that was done, it was always thrown on the girl.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did not you discharge your girl from your service; in the first place, for being a liar, and in the next place, for being a thief? - I never took her to be a thief.</p>
               <p>Q. That is not an answer? - She was never accused of being a thief.</p>
               <p>Q. That is not an answer? - A thief we never accused her of being.</p>
               <p>Q. A liar, what do you think of that? Did you never charge her with being a liar? - I have charged her with telling lies to hide the servants faults.</p>
               <p>Q. There were other reasons that induced you to part with this girl and turn her over to Mrs. Robinett - The girl seemed to wish to have a trade rather than to be brought up at an inn.</p>
               <p>Q. There was no other reason? - There was no other, upon my oath.</p>
               <p>Q. Now the prisoner Gladden had lived with you four months? - She had. She had not been with her above five or Six weeks at the time the girl went.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of Gladden at the time she went away from your house? - She went over the first night, and lodged at the public house opposite to our gate.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she go into any place afterwards? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you mean the day she left your house? - It was, and there she slept that night.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Did you ever give her a character to another place? - We did not. The place she went to, was the compter.</p>
               <p>Q. I see you are a pretty spirited witness; on your oath, did you give a character of the prisoner, Gladden, at any time? - We did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You always make persons, who are your servants, deposit money for the security of your property? - It is a common thing in an inn.</p>
               <p>Q. The accomplice Weeden had access to the beds, as well as the prisoner? - Under her directions she had; she scoured, and swept, and did any thing that she was ordered.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner Gladden's business was to deliver out the sheets? - Her business was, when she wanted sheets, to come to her mistress, and she was to give the dirty ones to her mistress in.</p>
               <p>Q. If the prisoner Weeden's business was to sweep, and to scour the rooms, it was not always that Gladden was by? - They generally were in one room together; one dusted and made the beds, and the other, swept; it might happen sometimes, that one might be gone to the washerwoman's, and the other might be waiting on the gentlemen.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you have many beds in your house? - Eight and forty.</p>
               <p>Q. You have a vast variety of different people that lodge in your house? - Mostly tradesmen.</p>
               <p>Q. They lodge for a night, and then off again? - Some for a month, and some for a single night.</p>
               <p>Q. The washerwoman of course gives an account, how many sheets she takes in, and how many she brings back? - She<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179312040134"></xptr>has always a bill, which frequently I make out myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps your wife makes it out at other times. Do you mean to say, that generally you make out the bill yourself? I do.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. On whose account do you make out the bill? - On Gladden's.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose duty is it to bring down the sheets, to have the bill made out? - Gladden's.</p>
               <p>Q. We are told, that she slept the opposite side of the way that night, that she was turned away? - She did.</p>
               <p>Q. She had not at that time been called upon, to make good her account till the next morning? - She was not.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner Gladden? - I cannot say, I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the other prisoner? - No, I do not; I recollect Gladden by sight, but I cannot say, where.</p>
               <p>Q. Has any things been pawned to your master? - Yes, there were eight sheets; I cannot say rightly, who pawned them all, because I did not take them in; it was a person who gave us the name of Morris.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it, that person Weeden? - That is the woman, I mean.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see that woman? On what occasion? - I have seen her at different times. She is the woman that appeared by the name of Morris. She produced eight sheets, as far as I can understand. I did not take them all in; I took in three sheets of her; one, the 19th of September; another, on the 2d. of October; and another, on the 23d.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you took in either of these, was the witness Weeden alone, or in company? - Alone, there might be somebody behind; but I did not see her bring any body in.</p>
               <p>Court. Then she was always alone to your knowledge? - She was.</p>
               <p>Q. You are certain, what you say, is true? - It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Your evidence has been taken down, and if you have sworn any thing that is false, you may, perhaps, he prosecuted for it. Do you mean to persist in every thing, that you have said? - I do.</p>
               <p>Jury to Brown. Did your master and mistress see them go out with these bundles? - Yes, my mistress saw them, but she did not know where they were going to take them to, she thought they were gentlemens linen.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. They often carried out gentlemens linen? - They did.</p>

Robinson marked on it, I asked her whose property it was; the name was at full length in one place, and R, at another corner; she told me it was her own; she bought it of a person whose name was Robinson; and then I asked her, if it was a sheet that she had had to wash, meaning, whether she was a washerwoman, she said, no; it was her own property; I told her then, if it was given her for washing, and she pledged it, she was liable to be transported; she assured me, it was her own property; I asked her the number of her house where she lived, she said, 131, Wood-street, it is a true account, that was the house she was taken from.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Smith, then notwithstanding, you told her, that if she had it as a washerwoman, and pledged it, she was liable to a sentence of transportation, yet she still persisted she had bought it of a person of the name of Robinson; with respect to her place of residence, she told<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179312040136"></xptr>you the true place where she lived? - She did.</p>

               <p>Court. And so you will, my girl, if you go on in this way.</p>
               <p>Court to Robinson. Look at this one sheet which Parker has produced, is it your's? - It is mine, I am certain of it, here is the marking iron that it was stamped with J. P. Robinson, and an R. put on it separate at the corner, it is my sheet.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. I am desired to ask you a question, whether some time ago you had not been robbed, and you found some duplicates some time before this? - I have been robbed several times since I have been in business.</p>
               <p>Court to Weedon. You said that she carried four sheets into the country with her, this was not one of those four that she carried into the country? - No, it was not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp to Mr. Robinson. Did not you find some duplicates? - There were some pieces of duplicates about two years ago that were brought me.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they of your property? - They were tore into such small pieces that we could not make them out.</p>
               <p>Q. Then they were not property as had been given to washerwomen? - About three years I found some duplicates that a washerwoman who drowned herself had pawned, and I got my linen at that time, that is three years ago.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Gladden. I never sent out a pair of sheets by that girl in my life, I never had such a thought, nor never knew of her carrying them out.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Douglas. The night that woman came away from her place which I have been informed since, was in Angel-street, she came crying to me, and said that she had left her place, and had met with an accident, and broke two panes of glass, and asked me if I would be so kind as to let her sleep in the house one night? I told her I had a bed, but I had no sheets to put on the bed; the reply she made was, that she had a sheet of her grandmother's, which her grandmother had left her about five months before; and she gave me that sheet to put on, I did not at all think that she was dishonest, for Mr. Robinson gave her a character that very morning to go to her present place where she was taken from.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Douglas called four witnesses who gave her an excellent character.</p>

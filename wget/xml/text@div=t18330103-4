No, nothing of the kind; my shopman slept in the surgery- I had him taken up - he was discharged, and I discharged him from my service; he slept in the room, the window of which was opened - the kitchen window was also thrown open; it was the shopman's duty to fasten the window - I know myself that it was shut down.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. On the morning of the 16th of December I was called to Mr. Thomas' house, and went into the stable; I found Miller and Mr. Thomas in the back kitchen, adjoinding the stable - Mr. Thomas said, in his presence, that he had been robbed, and had nobody to suspect but his servant; I asked what he had lost - he said his plate off the sideboard; I asked Miller if he had robbed his master - he made no answer; I then told him I must take him into custody - he made no answer; I went with him into the stable; I saw him put his hand into the cornbin, and shake the corn about; I asked what he was doing there - he shook his head, and said "It is gone;" I went into the shop with him, and I there again accused him of robbing his master - Mrs. Thomas was there; she did not say, "I will give you 10l. if you will tell me where the property is," before he said what I am going to say; he said he only wished for one thing - I asked him what that was; he said if he was allowed to go about a mile and a half he would get the property back - I told him I could not allow him to go out of my sight, if his mistress allowed him to go; I would not allow him to go out of my custody- I was going towards the shop door, and Martin, my brother-officer, produced a basket containing some plate; before that I consented to go with Miller as far as he wished me to go - he said they had put him in the hole, and he would split upon them, meaning he would say where they were; by putting him in the hole, I understood they did not take the property away as he expected - Miller said nothing when the basket was brought in; previous to my taking him to the station-house he admitted that he had let three men into the stable, and in consequence of what he said at the station-house I went to search for Hutchinson among others, and found him in Globe-fields in the evening, and apprehended him; I told him what I took him for, and he said, "What, for that concern?" and asked me if they had taken any person else - I said I had, and then I handcuffed him; in our way to the station-house (he had the handcuffs on) I saw him feeling about his bosom two or three times - I asked him what he did it for; he made no reply - I said, "You must have something there;" he said, "Take it from me," and I took this snuffer-stand from his bosom - I took it from him, and the precise words he said were, "That is all I have got - I have had no more."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Were you and Miller alone when he made the observation about splitting? A. Yes - it was in the shop; Mr. Thomas was not present, that I know of - he was in the stable when he made some observations to that effect, and when he said he would take me to where the property was.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. WALESBY. Q. Where are Globe-fields? A. In Bethnal-green, about a mile and a half from where Mr. Thomas lives - I took Hutchinson between six and seven o'clock in the evening - he went willingly.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Could he have escaped from you? A. He could not.</p>

            . I am servant to the prosecutor. -On the night of the 16th of December I fastened all the doors; I did not fasten the surgery window - I saw that the window was down, and the shutter closed; I am quite sure the window was down - there is a cellar-flap to the house; I saw that closed by my fellow-servant - I went to bed near twelve o'clock; I had seen Miller the last thing at night - he bade me good night: he did not sleep in the house - the cellar-flap was only shut down; Miller slept over the back kitchen, which is not connected with the house - I observed the surgery window open next day, when the alarm was given, and the kitchen window and the dining-room window were all open; I heard Miller say he had let three men into the stable.</p>

               <p>Miller's Defence. Mr. Thomas speaks false with regard to coming down and meeting me in the stable; he met me in the stable first - I went into the kitchen, and saw a Policeman; Mrs. Thomas immediately put her hand on my shoulder, and said, "Edward, for goodness sake tell me where the property is, and I will give you 10l.;" I made no answer - Mrs. Thomas begged hard of me to tell, and said if I did not the others would tell of me, and then the Policeman brought the property in.</p>
               <p>Hutchinson's Defence. Miller made it known that I slept in his master's stable; what he had been at I do not know - he cannot say before my face that he let me into his master's stable, for on the Sunday previous, at nine o'clock, I left my master's, and went home to my mother; she wished me to go to my aunt's, at Chelsea - I got there, and found she had left the house; I proceeded home - it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183301030008"></xptr>was late: I cannot say the time, but it might be between one and two o'clock - I got up on Sunday morning, had breakfast, and walked into Hare-street-fields, about ten minutes' walk from where I live; I there found the property which was found on me - I had it on me all day, and in the evening Miller's brother came to my house, and asked if I was coming out; I came out with him about one hundred and fifty yards, and saw three men walking sharp behind me; I looked round, and said to Miller's brother,"I should like to call at my mother's;" I was crossing the road, and a Policeman came over, and said I was his prisoner - he says I said, "Is it for that concern?" which is false - I only said I was willing to go with him; he handcuffed me, and two Policemen, who were with him, left; as we went along he asked if I wished to know what I was taken for - I said I did not mind, not having done any thing; he said, We want you on suspicion of some weights;" I asked what he meant by weights - he said,"I suppose you don't know;" I said, No, I never heard the word in my life - he said he wanted me on suspicion of being one of the party concerned in Mr. Thomas' robbery; I said I knew nothing about it - I was taken to the station-house, and gave him up the property, without his uttering a word to me; he did not ask what I was doing about my bosom; I was trying to button my coat several times - that is all I did: had I been inclined to put away the property, I had plenty of time - I am entirely innocent.</p>

               <p>Five witnesses gave Miller a good character, and Six deposed the same for Hutchinson.</p>

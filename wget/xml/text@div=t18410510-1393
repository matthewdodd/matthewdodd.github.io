                  </hi>. I am the wife of Samuel Ruddick, a brace and belt manufacturer, in Anchor-street, Shoreditch; the prisoner was his foreman. On Sunday, the 28th of March, my husband was out of town—a commu<lb></lb>nication was made to me—I went for a policeman, and I and Roots went to the prisoner's residence, in Woodbine-cottage, Bethnal-green—I saw the prisoner and his wife and family—the policeman showed me three yards of drab satteen jean, which I knew to be part of a roll belonging to my hus<lb></lb>band—it was soiled at one end, and was worth 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—there was a piece of white satteen—the prisoner's wife told me she bought the drab satteen at Wilson's, in Crown-street—I also found some cotton belt-web—believe it to be ours—we have a great deal of it.</p>

I found him about six o'clock at a public-house in East Smithfield, and asked him if he had taken my things - he said "Get out, you b - r." A girl, who was with him, said he had a silver watch in his pocket - he denied it. Tuffs shewed me the watch.</p>

On Sunday, the 14th of October, about half-past five o'clock, he came in and had a glass of rum, he said he had no money; I said I must send for an officer if he did not pay me - he then gave me this watch - I have kept it ever since; I shewed it to the prosecutor, in his presence, and he claimed it. I sent him to the watch-house, he then said he did take it out of the prosecutor's chest.</p>

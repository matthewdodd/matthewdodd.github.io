                  </hi>. I am a porter, and live in Green-street, Leicester-square. On the night of the 16th of February I was in Beech-lane, Barbican—I felt something at my pocket, turned round, and saw three persons behind me—the prisoner was one—he was nearest to me—he was going to step off the gutter into the street, when I turned round and charged him with stealing my handkerchief—he said he bad not—I re<lb></lb>newed the charge, and he then drew it from his pocket and gave it to me—this it—(<hi rend="italic">locking at it</hi>)—I told him I would give him in charge—he then ran away up a court—I followed him nearly to the door—as he was going up the court he hallooed for his father several times, and he was let into a house—there are only two houses in the court—I gave information to the policeman, who went to the first house—there were only two children there—he then went to the other house, and found the prisoner sitting up<lb></lb>stairs with his jacket and cap off—when he put them on I knew him again—it was a velveteen jacket—I am sure he is the same person.</p>

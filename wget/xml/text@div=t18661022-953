                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at the London Hospital—Air was brought there with a punctured wound over his sixth rib, a little to the left of the nipple; it went to the bone, and if it had not been for the bone it would have entered his heart in its natural position, but I find his heart is a quarter of an inch to the right—the stab was in a dangerous place—He is out of danger now, but is still unwell.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Berger's Defence</hi>. At half-past eleven I was eating an apple, intending to go to bed directly afterwards. There were six violent knocks at the door. Nieffer went outside, and in a little while he returned, and called his friend Ernest, who lives in the house. I became curious, went out a few steps, and saw Nieffer falling down, and I, being frightened, wanted to run away; but when I was about three yards from my home, going back, six men rushed upon me. I foolishly had the knife in my possession, and they ran on it. I went indoors, and three or four policemen came and took me. There is no truth in the statement that a knife was passed to me, and I did not throw it away, I took it inside with me.</p>

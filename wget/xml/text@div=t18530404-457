                  </hi>. I was errand boy in the service of Mr. Buckmaster a tailor of Burlington-street. On 19th Feb., about a quarter past 7 o'clock in the evening I was going down Silver-street, Golden-square, the prisons came up to me and asked if I was going of an errand—I said I was—he asked me if I was engaged for a minute or two; I said I was engaged, bat I was not in a violent hurry for a minute or two—he asked me if I would take a note to Mr. Imrie's the baker's, at the corner of Sherrard-street, and if I knew it—I told him I did—he then gave me a letter; he asked me to take that, and said I was to bring a parcel back, and to be careful how I brought it—I took the letter to Mr. Imrie's—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is like it, I cannot say it is the same—J recollect the name at the bottom, it was directed in the same way as this—I gave it to a female, who I afterwards found to be Helen Imrie—I afterwards received a parcel, I believe it was from a middle aged woman in the shop, I took it to the prisoner—he was in Golden-square, near where I left him—he came up behind me, and touched me on the shoulder—he gave me 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for going—I believe this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the parcel I gave him, it was a square parcel like this</p>

                  </hi>. I am a baker, and live at No. 36, Brewer-street, Goldensquare. On Saturday evening 19th Feb., my sister-in-law handed me a letter; it contained this card, this check, and this note in an envelope—it was sealed—I took two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes and five sovereigns, rolled them up and put them in one of my own printed bags, doubled it over and sealed it—I then handed it to my daughter, who handed it to the boy—I addressed it to Mr. Green, from whom I imagined it came—this is the bag in which the money was in, and these are the notes—(<hi rend="italic">check read.</hi> "London, 11th Feb. Messrs. Grindley and Co., pay Mr. F. Green or bearer 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. A. Clarke.")—this card is one of Mr. Green's, it was seeing that and the note made me send the money.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of the last witness. On Saturday evening 19th Feb., about 7 o'clock I saw the boy Crighton come into the shop with a letter—I saw my husband put up the parcel, and it was delivered to him—this is it—I had some suspicion and followed the boy, I saw him deliver the parcel to the prisoner—I saw that they passed Mr. Green's door, and then I was sure all was wrong—I went and touched the boy on the shoulder, and called out "Stop thief"—the prisoner ran away towards the square, he was stopped by some one, and as soon as he was stopped he turned round facing</p>

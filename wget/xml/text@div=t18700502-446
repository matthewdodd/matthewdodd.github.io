                  </hi>. I live at 32, Queen Street, Webber Street, and am the wife of John Bishop—the prisoner lodges next door to me, with my sister and her husband—I was sent for next door, my sister was in bed, she had only been confined two days—the prisoner was breaking the things—I told her she ought to know better, and she put her hand across my mouth and tried to choke me—I got away and went up stairs to my sister—when I went down the prisoner rushed at me with the knife and cut me on the forehead, and said "Take that you b——cow"—I had not struck her before or called her names—I went to Mr. Blades, the surgeon, and he strapped the place up.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk, and lire at Caledonian Street, King's Cross—there was a quarrel first between the landlord and the prisoner about a cup of tea—I put the landlord out of the room—Maria Bishop came in afterwards—she was afterwards put out of the room, and I put the latch of the door down—I tried to make the prisoner quiet—Mrs. Bishop called her names—I got between them, and the candle was put out as the prisoner struck Mrs. Bishop—I don't know what the effect of the blow was—I did not see a knife in her hand—I did not hear Mrs. Bishop call out—a policeman came afterwards—he brought Mrs. Bishop into the room, and I saw she was bleeding from the face.</p>

                  </hi>. I am landord at this house—the last witness and the prisoner had been for a walk on this afternoon—they had a game of cards—I afterwards made tea for the prisoner—she was rather cross, and began quarrelling about the tea—I said I never allowed a woman to dictate to me, and she struck me and gave me a black eye, and in the scuffle we knocked down the sideboard—I said I would give her in charge, I would not have my things broke, and while they were fetching the policeman there were cries of "Murder!"—we pushed the door open—before I went for the policeman there were three knives on the table—I did not see the blow—I was out of the house.</p>

She went out, and came back again and said "You b——cow, I will cut you down." I said I would not be cut about, and I did use the knife, more to frighten her than anything else. She came at me with the candiestick, and I did it in self-defence. I was very sorry for it, and went for a doctor, and did all I could. It was more a quarrel than anything else.</p>

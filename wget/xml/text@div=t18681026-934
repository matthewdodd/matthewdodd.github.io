                  </hi>. I am clerk to my father, a licensed carman, of 2, Tower Hill—we employ the prisoner casually to do jobs—on 7th October we had to case a quantity of tea that was to be sent by the Great Northern Railway to Liverpool—it was brought in vans to the Great Northern depot, Royal Mint Street—we employed the prisoners, with three other men, to case it—they had to sew canvas over the chests—they began the job between 7 and 8 o'clock, and I gave them instructions to take one chest at a time off the van as they wanted to canvas it—I superintended it at times, but at other times I had to leave, to go after my father's business and to get them canvas—at 8 p.m. I left for a short time, and all the cases were then apparently sound and on two vans—case 132 was amongst them—our errand boy, Jones, was left to assist to fetch canvas—I returned in about three quarters of an hour and found a quantity of cases piled up, which was contrary to my orders—Donaldson and Earwaker were there, and they had the chest in question in their possession—they appeared to be covering it up—I examined the case—the lid had been broken open—the lead bad been torn—the weight is marked on each chest—I weighed it, and found 31/2 lbs. missing—I asked them what they were doing with that chest—they said they were doing nothing—I asked if they had broken it open, and they said "No "—I turned round and saw a coat, which had some tea in the pocket, which I weighed, and there was just 31/2 lbs.—when I took the coat up Earwaker went away, and two others went out—not two of the prisoners—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186810260072"></xptr>
               <p>Earwaker and Donaldson were the only men I saw near the chest—I asked who the coat belonged to, and Stone claimed it—I then took it to my father—Stone said he knew nothing about the tea, he did not know how it came there—Earwaker then came back, and I asked him where he had been—he said "To have some refreshment"—when I found the coat, Stone was on the other side of the bench—soon after Mr. Cox came back, and then the prisoners were given in custody—the tea found in the coat was similar to that in the chest.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were there six men working by the chest? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not that particular chest—there were six men working where these men were-Stone was working about the length of this Court from the chest—he was casing other chests.</p>

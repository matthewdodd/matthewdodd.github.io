                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. John Simpson, and another, in Tottenham Court-road. On the 9th of April, the prisoner came for a pair of shoes—one of my shopmates was trying some shoes on her, and from the peculiarity of her conduct, we suspected she had taken a pair—I went into a passage which looks into the shop, and saw her put a pair under her cloak—I told Mr. Simpson, and as she was going out he charged her with having a pair—she said she had not—she went about the shop a little bit, then went to a part quite free from shoes, and dropped a pair of shoes from under her cloak—I did not see her drop them—I saw the place before, and it was all clear—I saw the shoes when they were dropped—these are my master's shoes.</p>

               <p>Are you sure it was your father's mare that he had in his hand? - I passed by him, and rode up to the young man at the turnpike, and told him, I had lost the mare, and I rode on as if I took no notice of him; I got off my nag, and whipped into a gate, I kept my eyes on him and saw him, and there came up two waggons, and he attempted to get through by the long-side of the waggons, and the young man and me seized him and the mare, the mare was very big with foal, and warmish, and I thought it was not proper for her to stand there, and I put her into the Castle, and am sure the prisoner was the man that was in possession of the mare when I stopped him, I asked him where he was going with that mare, he said, what was that to me, I said, it was; says I, you have stole her, says he, if I have, I have, here I am; he made no resistance.</p>

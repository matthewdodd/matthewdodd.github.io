            . I am a clerk in the office of underrated East India goods. On the 8th of May, last, this warrant was brought to me by the prisoner, for the delivery of the goods contained in it. I observed the signatures of Mr. Deacon, Middleton, and Thomas. I did not deliver him the warrant for the discharge; I stopped it; I knew their hand writing, these are nothing like it. I did not intimate that I observed it. I called him to come back, he did, and observing me look at the warrant, he questioned me whether it was correct. I paused some time, and said, very well; I having a firm conviction that these three names were forged, I gave information; it was laid before the board. I went to take this man up, he was in Mr. Rowe's accompting house alone. I believe I asked him if he had not, in the course of the day, tendered me a warrant for East India tanned hides; he said, yes. I believe Mr. Wright asked him whether he wrote the warrant; I believe he answered to that, yes, he did. Nalder came in, he was taken in custody; he was searched; this bill of calculation was found upon him. and five hundred and fifteen pounds in bank notes.</p>
               <p>The defendant said nothing in his defence, called seven witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

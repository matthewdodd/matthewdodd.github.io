                  </hi>. I live in the Borough. The prisoner was in my employ for nearly two years—he was occasionally employed to collect money—on the 4th of April he received 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from my partner, Mr. Charles Goode—he was to purchase some stair-rods.</p>

Q.</hi> Do you recollect giving the prisoner any directions about getting the goods? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He told me he was going to get some rods—I did not give him the order—that was on the 20th or 21st of February—there had been several purchases of rods about that time—I had possession of this bill—it was given me on the 21st of February, or the day following, as we balance every morning—if the 21st was Saturday, I received it on the Monday morning—I had no other bill from Mr. Phillips amounting to 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. This is my bill and my writing—I sold these articles to the prisoner—I gave this receipt for the amount which I received from the prisoner—he requested me, after paying that bill, to make out a second bill, as they were to sell to a customer, and they did not want him to know that they got a profit on them—I said it was not usual, but I did it—my demand was 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but the second bill was 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I received only 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the original bill was made out in the name of Gainsford; the second without a name.</p>

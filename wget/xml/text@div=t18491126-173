                  </hi>. I live at 11, Commercial-road, Lambeth At half-past seven o'clock in the evening of 28th Oct., I heard my front-door open—I was sitting in my parlour, with the passage-door open—I went into the pas<lb></lb>sage, and saw the prisoner, who had advanced two or three paces into the passage—he asked me if a man named Williams lived there—I did not answer him, but walked up and seized him by the wrist—he had put the door to, but not shut it—I wheeled him round and called the police, and gave him into custody—I distinctly heard the door opened with a Bramah key—the prisoner was searched; the key which opened the door was in his hand, and seven or eight other picklock keys were found on him.</p>

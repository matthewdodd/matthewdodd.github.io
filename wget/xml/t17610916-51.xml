I watched him till I saw him going away, and then we seized him; and in one pocket, we took out a quantity of sugar, that weighed five pounds neat sugar.</p>

            . I am constable for the king on the keys. The prisoner was committed to my care; when he was before the alderman at Guild-hall, he said, he pick'd it up upon the key. The alderman had it opened, and it appeared all of one sort, which could not have been the case, had he picked it up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I got a handful of one cooper, as he was opening a hogshead, and a handful of another, and so on. I am as innocent as the child unborn of feloniously taking any sugar; some I scraped from the ground, and so on. The gentlemen said, it was better than to trample it under foot. When I was going to Newgate, the prosecutors whispered, how much should be their share, in case I was convicted. Said the constable, never fear, you shall be secure if you swear against him, and so on. Before I came to Newgate, I turned round, and said, I hope, gentlemen, it is not come to that; you shall get nothing by me, do not crack of your chickens before they are hatched. I have got several gentlemen, and responsible house-keepers, to my character.</p>
               <p>Q. to the Constable. You hear what the prisoner has said, what do you say to it? Do you remember the conversation in your going to Newgate.</p>
               <p>Constable. The soldier said, I do not know what I shall do, I have got a family to work for. Said I, you need not trouble yourself about that, the merchants will satisfy you for your trouble.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember any thing of the prisoner's turning round, and what was said by him?</p>
               <p>Constable. He turned round, and said something, but I do not remember what were the words.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give the soldier any encouragement, to expect any reward for speaking more than the truth.</p>
               <p>Constable. No, I did not.</p>

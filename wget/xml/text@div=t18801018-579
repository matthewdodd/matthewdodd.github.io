                  </hi>. I am a builder, of 73, Charlton Street, Euston Road—about 12.30 on a.m. on the 6th October I was in Tottenham Court Road; I was sober; I had had something to drink during the day—the prisoners came behind me; Moore went on my right side and put his foot behind the calf of my leg and forced me back, and Conway struck me with his right arm under my chin—I was thrown down, and Moore kicked me and knelt on my right thigh; I have the bruise still—I called for the police, when Moore <hi rend="italic">advanced</hi> away from me, and Conway, who I had got by his collar, put his hand into my trousers pocket, but there was nothing for him to take—a policeman came up and he was taken—I was hurt at the time, and I had an embrocation and bathed the injured place when I got home.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Conway.</hi> I was on the right side of Tottenham Court Road—I had had a glass of ale and twopenny worth of gin when I left a friend—I was not drunk; I was excited from being knocked down—I never saw you until you were on each side of me—I did not fall up against you; you did not say "See where you are falling to"—I did not turn round and bawl out "Police!"—I held you till the police came—the policeman said "What are you going to charge him with?" I said "For knocking me down, an attempt"—at the police-station they had other business to attend to and did not take the charge for some time—the inspector did not say "If you mess about like this I shall have to lock you up too"—I had not got my spectacles in my pocket, and I did not attempt to write—the inspector wrote my name for me and I put my cross.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman E</hi> 24). About 12.40 a.m. on 6th October I heard cries of "Police!" in Tottenham Court Road—I ran across the road and went to the place, and saw Richardson struggling with Conway—he gave him into my custody for attempting to rob him and assaulting him—Moore was standing by—I went towards the station and Moore followed—Richardson told me that Conway's accomplice was walking on behind, and I took him in custody at the station—Richardson was under the influence of drink—he could walk, but staggered, and spoke father muddled—I said at the police-court he was drunk—he was not incapable—possibly a great deal of excitement attached to it—they were charged at the station—Richardson said he should charge them with assaulting him and attempting to rob him, and that Conway placed his hand in his left-hand trousers pocket—nothing was said by the inspector about locking the prosecutor up; he was not so drunk as to require it—they</p>

               <p>asked the inspector if the prosecutor was sober, and the inspector made no answer—the prisoners made no answer to the charge.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Conway.</hi> I did not hear the inspector caution the prosecutor—about half a dozen people were standing there, but no one ran to the prosecutor's assistance when I got up.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">By the</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">Moore's Statement before the Magistrate.</hi> "I was walking behind the prisoner down Tottenham Court Road to the station. When I got to the station they charged me. I did not interfere in any way."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Moore's Defence.</hi> I walked to the police-station without knowing what it was; to see what was the matter. When I got there they took me. The policeman knows he did not see me do anything. The prosecutor. was drunk. He made two or three different statements. This is the first time in my life I have ever been locked up. I am a hard-working chap, and am quite innocent; God above knows that. I do not get my living by robbing people.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Conway's Defence.</hi> I was walking along Tottenham Court Road when the prosecutor came out of a mews and bobbed up against me as I was crossing. I asked him to mind where he was bobbing to and to mind he did not fall down, and he turned round and took me by the collar and bawled out "Police," and two or three persons stopped and the police came up and said, "What is the matter?" He said, "I want to charge this fellow." He said, "What for?" The prosecutor said, "He tried to put his hand in my pocket," which I never did. The policeman said, "Have you lost anything? I see he is drunk," and he took me to the station, and Moore followed and they took him, what for I don't know. The prosecutor said, "I want to charge that man there." The inspector said, "Which man? there are two," and he turned round and saw two, thinking there was only one. The inspector said, "Mind what you are about, or we shall have to put you inside." He could not sign the charge sheet, and they locked us up. Why did not the prosecutor charge Moore at the time he charged me? He was drunk, and he wanted to charge somebody. Nobody interfered with him, I assure you.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 13th of August, about half-past four o'clock in the morning, I met the prisoner in Shadwell with two tea-boards and a bundle, and asked where he was going with them; he said to take them on board his ship - that they belonged to his wife. I took him to the watch-house, and found two petticoats, a gown, and an apron in the bundle - I asked where he got them; he said he did not know the street, but if I went with him he would show me. I took him to two streets, and in Blue-gate-fields he tried three or four doors, and said,</p>
               <p>"The door was a little open, I cannot find the house." As we returned I saw a door ajar, and said</p>
               <p>"Is that it," he said it was - he went along the passage into Scully's room, where she was asleep. I asked if she had lost anything, she looked and missed her tea-boards - I told her to dress and come to the watch-house, and as we were waiting I asked how he could rob this poor girl of her things; he said,</p>
               <p>"I don't deny taking them, but some girls have robbed me of a good deal of property before."</p>

               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that the prosecutrix invited him home, and on awaking he found her gone, and missed 4 s. from his trowsers pocket - when she returned she said she had been to get some drink, and he might be d - d, for his money was spent and if he could find anything worth 4 s. he might take it.</p>

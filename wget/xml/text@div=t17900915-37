               <p>The Indictment opened by Mr. Garrow.</p>
               <p>And the Case by Mr. Fielding, as follows:</p>
               <p>May it please your Lordship. Gentlemen of the Jury: I have the honour to solicit your attention upon this melancholy occasion as counsel for the Governors and Directors of the Bank of England. Gentlemen, the indictment which my learned friend has just stated to you, informs you of the crime now imputed to the prisoner at the bar; and when you are informed that this is a forgery of a receipt for money, in a transaction which has been carried on at the Bank, you at once receive the impression of all the importance that such an enquiry is of: it is not proper, on the present occasion, to travel out of the business which is the subject of the present charge; I shall not therefore seek to throw into the present business any of the other circumstances that bear on the prisoner at the bar, however it might seem to bear on the present prosecution, and fairly to be introduced into that prosecution, as they might, by possibility, seem to carry the appearance of charging, with accumulated imputation, more than was necessary to a matter that is extremely simple in itself: I shall only inform you now, therefore, that the prisoner at the bar has been for, I think, twenty years nearly, a servant of the Bank of England, and having continued so long in such employ, bespeaks his character and reputation, till the time of this discovery, certainly a fair one:<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179009150051"></xptr>indeed, gentlemen, it is of the utmost consolation to the Bank, when they contemplate that vast machine of public credit, the Bank of England, that no occasion has arisen wherein we have been called upon to question the wisdom of the regulation, the vigilance of the directors, or the fidelity and integrity of their servants; and till, unhappily, the present occasion arose, I think there has been no such occasion: acting, as the prisoner has done for so many years in the Bank, apprized of all the regulations made by the directors, unfortunately for himself, he has disobeyed one of those principal regulations which has involved him in the difficulties of this prosecution: as a clerk in one of the principal offices, he was expressly forbid to act as a broker; and, on the present occasion, he has violated that regulation: Gentlemen, the prisoner, while he was in this employ, not only gained the esteem and friendship of those around him, as well as the approbation of his masters, but likewise the confidence of several of his friends, who had intrusted him with the whole management of their concerns in the different stocks in which they had placed their money: among those people with whom he had obtained this confidence was the present prosecutor, Mr. Papps, who had employed him frequently in purchasing stock, but never in transferring any stock; on the 8th of May, as mentioned in the indictment, Mr. Papps, having at that time some money to lay out, applied to the prisoner, told him his intention, and desired that he would compleat the business for him; the money that he had on that occasion was 47 l. 10 s. 6 d. this was to be laid out in the purchase of so much stock, 50 l. in the four per cent. annuities; Mr. Papps having communicated his intentions to the prisoner, and he having received the money from him for the purpose, he expected the whole transaction should be compleat, till it was necessary for him to appear to accept a receipt, and to sign his acceptance of the stock; Mr. Papps very soon after having intrusted the money in the prisoner's hands, was told by him, that every thing was done and ready, and nothing more was necessary, than that he should sign the acceptance, and have the receipt; Papps, therefore, went with him to the desk, where a book was produced, and an instrument laid before them, and in signing that, which Papps conceived was an acceptance of the stock, he did, in fact, put his signature to a transfer of 450 l. stock of his own; this instrument laying before him, and to which, without any hesitation, he immediately put his signature, had within it those marks which immediately caught his eye; among those was the name of J. Pierce, of the Stock Exchange: soon after this, the prisoner delivered to him a receipt, signed J. Pierce, for that money which he had entrusted the prisoner with; here then terminates the transaction. I do not at present call your attention to that imposition made on Mr. Papps, in getting his hand to the signature of the transfer; this is a species of fraud, about which we are not at present enquiring; but you will see at once the relation which the name of that transfer bears to the name signed to the receipt given to Papps; that transaction, therefore, I say, in itself, rests here. Now to the evidence of this transaction, so as compleatly to bring home the charge of forgery to the prisoner, it will be necessary for you to pay particular attention to the circumstances which I shall now state: Mr. Papps had been in intimacy with the prisoner at the bar for many, many years; he had transacted all the business for him at the Bank; and as the prisoner was well known to Mr. Papps, and as Mr. Papps was well known to the prisoner, it is impossible that any person can have imposed on the prisoner, assuming the person of Papps, where there was so intimate a knowledge of one and the other between the parties: Gentlemen, the instrument of transfer is further material in the present business; you will find the very signature as the witness to this transfer, is that of the prisoner; that of course links him immediately to this transaction, as being concerned for Papps, when he first persuaded him to sign this transfer; then Mr. Pierce will come before you, and tell<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179009150052"></xptr>you, he was willing to become the purchaser of a share in the stock, if any such was to be disposed of; the prisoner having obtained this signature to the paper, was therefore enabled to proffer this as a proper transfer, in order to turn it over to Pierce, and to get Pierce's acceptance; in truth, he did so; but Mr. Pierce, being a man conversant in the transactions of the Bank, he, in consequence of seeing this transfer, at once signed his acceptance, and there was an end of the business, and Pierce himself had no receipt; but the subject on which we are at present enquiring, being the receipt put into the hands of Papps, purporting to be the receipt of J. Pierce; I say, the name instantly suggested itself to the prisoner; he instantly made use of the name of Pierce to sign to that receipt, which he was to turn over to Papps, as a satisfaction for the money Papps had paid into his hands: so far you see this transaction is then perfectly compleat; the prisoner's knowledge of Papps cannot be doubted; Papps, therefore, will come before you, and tell you, that he having engaged for this, he received this very receipt from the hands of the prisoner; Pierce will tell you, that on the same day he was at the Bank, and had the transaction I have related; that he never signed such receipt, and that it is a fabrication, and a forgery: Gentlemen, therefore, you perceive that the object of your enquiry lays within very small compass; but as it is always satisfactory that the minds of a jury should be made up from all the circumstances that attend the transaction, so I am ready to trust that on your view and consideration of every one circumstance, you will be enabled to make up your minds most compleatly, and without hesitation, that the crime imputed to the prisoner has been effected in the way I have described: now, gentlemen, with respect to the testimony, it appears to me that there cannot be a possible imputation upon any of the evidence which I shall call to you: Mr. Papps comes forward here to give his testimony against his ancient friend; at the same time, Mr. Papps has no interest in the present prosecution; indeed, I am anticipating those objections which can have no force, and therefore I stop and check myself: these gentlemen, when they tell you the simple transaction that I have explained to you, will, I trust, leave no doubt in your minds; as to the receipt given to Papps, and upon which it is the charge of forgery is now established, the very prisoner himself is a witness to that receipt: then, gentlemen, it seems to me, that the case is precluded from every possible observation; those little matters which now and then, indeed, arise in other cases, I think are totally shut out: but, if your minds were not compleatly satisfied on account of the receipt, it would still remain a forgery; and a forgery, as I conceive, proved, assuming that the witnesses will prove all I have related, whether they have a relation or not to that Mr. Pierce with whom the other transfer was transacted, for it still is a forgery by the prisoner; imposition, it is impossible to conceive, in the present case, being made by any person whatever; but, when you come to compare the two transactions together, and when you take into your consideration the result of that comparison, you must be persuaded that the mind of the prisoner was wickedly bent that morning, when Papps applied to him. Therefore, the trouble you will have in your attention to this case, will be short; the charge is confined to the simple circumstance of his having forged that receipt, and the evidence will lay in a very small compass. Gentlemen, lamentable it is, indeed, to see a person of the prisoner's appearance and description, standing at the bar, on a charge like this; it must, on the present occasion, and indeed it does, in the minds of a British Jury, excite emotions of compassion, and every tender feeling: and so far from wishing to interrupt the course, nay, the full indulgence of those feelings, the Governor and Company of the Bank of England, I am sure, will rejoice at every evidence of them; those feelings being at all times the best assurance of the faithful discharge of your respective duties, whether you consider<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179009150053"></xptr>yourselves as citizens, or advert to that more important duty, which you are now to discharge as a jury of your country.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys, Prisoner's Counsel. You come here under expectation to have all that stock replaced of which you was possessed; do not you come here under a promise to have four hundred and fifty pounds replaced to you on condition of giving evidence against the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you not had that expressly intimated to you, that on condition of giving evidence against this man you should be replaced in this sum of four hundred and fifty pounds stock? - No.</p>
               <p>How then did you form the expectation of having this stock replaced to you? Have not you had hopes given you that you should have four hundred and fifty pounds, or some sum on condition of giving evidence on this trial? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you mean to say that there had been a bargain between you and the Bank? - No; none at all.</p>
               <p>That if you gave your evidence you should have your four hundred and fifty pounds again, and if not you should not? That you expect shall be replaced to you? - Yes, I hope so.</p>
               <p>Have you made your bargain with the Bank about that, and have you stipulated with them, that provided they will do that, you will then give evidence, and if they do not you will not give evidence? - Not from the Bank.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. From whom then was it that you had that hope given you; was it from any servant, any person employed by the Bank in any manner whatever.</p>
               <p>Court. Has there been any consideration between you and any body on the part of the Bank, respecting your giving your evidence in this case, making you any promises if you would do it? - No; none at all from the Bank.</p>
               <p>Do you know the solicitor of the Bank, Mr. Winter? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was it intimated by him? - Yes; he gave me some hopes of recovering it.</p>
               <p>Court. But was it on condition that you would give evidence on this trial? - Yes, my lord.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. You perceive this four hundred and fifty pounds transfer is not immediately connected with any other indictment.</p>
               <p>Court. Suppose it is not, if this man will come here and say he expects four hundred and fifty pounds in money for giving his evidence, to be sure I shall reject his testimony.</p>
               <p>Did you make a bargain with the Solicitor? - No; I made no bargain at all.</p>
               <p>Did he on his part promise you, that if you would give the evidence then he would transfer to you? - He did not mention any such thing.</p>
               <p>Did he make it an express condition, that on condition of giving your evidence it should be replaced? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Russell. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long? - Some years.</p>
               <p>During that time have you been very intimately acquainted with him? - Not very; he used to come backwards and forwards to my house.</p>
               <p>Did you ever employ him to do business in the Stocks for you? - Yes, as an acquaintance.</p>
               <p>Did you employ him to buy any stock for you in May, 1789? - Fifty pounds, four per cents.</p>
               <p>Did he undertake to do it? - Yes; and gave a receipt for it.</p>
               <p>How soon did you see him after this business? - Not for some time afterwards.</p>
               <p>Did he tell you at any time that he had bought it for you? - Yes; he gave me a receipt for it.</p>
               <p>Did you write your name? - Yes, to a transfer book.</p>
               <p>When you wrote your name to that transfer book did you consider yourself writing your name to the transfer book or to the acceptance book? - I did not know it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179009150054"></xptr>was a transfer book, I thought it had been an acceptance book.</p>
               <p>Did he give you the receipt at the same time that you signed your name, or a different time? - At the same time.</p>
               <p>When did you pay him the money? - The same day.</p>
               <p>Before or after you took the receipt? - Before I took the receipt he came and told me he would get it ready against I came; and I used to go and leave it intirely to him.</p>
               <p>How much did you pay? - I cannot recollect justly what the stocks were; what fifty pounds cost; but he put it on the receipt himself.</p>
               <p>Was that the paper he gave you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>At the time you signed your name? - At the time I signed my name, and he put the figures on the back.</p>
               <p>Is that your hand writing? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know Mr. Fonton's hand writing? - I have seen it.</p>
               <p>Is that his hand writing; look at it? - Yes, I believe it is; it is very much like what I have seen in the corner of the receipt.</p>

               <p>How much did you receive for your dividend? - I received twelve pounds for six hundred and fifty pounds of Mr. Fonton.</p>
               <p>Was the dividend you received last Lady day the whole amount of your stock, suppose that four hundred and fifty pounds was standing there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Does that include fifty pounds that you supposed you had bought that day? - That made it up six hundred and fifty pounds.</p>
               <p>How came Fonton to pay you the dividend; was it his business? - He never paid me but twice; he used to give the dividend he said, to save me the trouble of waiting.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I would ask you whether you did not say yesterday, about five in the afternoon, to any body, that you had been promised by Mr. Winter, to have your four hundred and fifty pounds stock replaced, in case you gave evidence on this business, and all your expences, and that if you did not you would not? - No, there was nothing mentioned about expences; there were three gentlemen called upon me yesterday in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Did not you say to these three gentlemen, that you had been promised by Mr. Winter to have your four hundred and fifty pounds stock replaced, in case you gave evidence on this business, and all your expences, and that if you did not you would not; and that you would not have come if that promise had not been made? - No, I said no such thing; they called upon me about appearing against Mr. Fonton, and I told them I must appear, I could not do otherwise: I never made any such promise to any body.</p>
               <p>Did you relate to any body yesterday, that such conversation passed between Mr. Winter and you? - I did not say any such words as not appearing.</p>
               <p>Did not you tell them that you had a promise made you by Mr. Winter to have your four hundred and fifty pounds replaced, in case you gave evidence on this business, and if you did not you would not? - Mr. Winter said, he hoped it would be replaced, as I understood him; but I never made any agreement or bargain about it.</p>
               <p>Then did not you tell somebody yesterday, that Mr. Winter had promised you that the stock should be replaced if you appeared, and gave evidence on this trial? - No; not to the gentlemen that called yesterday.</p>
               <p>Mr. Russell. What gentleman was that that called yesterday? - The gentleman is in court.</p>
               <p>Point out the man? - That gentleman is one that called, Mr. Slack.</p>
               <p>What did he call about? - He called about Mr. Fonton's affair; Mr. Slack mentioned to me to know if I should appear, and I told him I was obliged to it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179009150055"></xptr>What passed between you about it? - I cannot recollect very particular.</p>
               <p>Try; what did he want of you; what did he come to you about? - He came with intent like, as for me not to appear against him.</p>
               <p>What did he say to you on that subject? - I cannot recollect the very words.</p>
               <p>I do not want the very words, but the sense of them? - It was something concerning the not appearing against him.</p>
               <p>What was it? - It was, that if the money was replaced by any person, that I would not appear against him: I told him I was obliged to it.</p>
               <p>What more? - Nothing further that I can recollect: I said, I was obliged to come because I was subpoened to appear.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. You are Accomptant to the Bank of England? - Yes: I believe this to be the hand writing of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Look at this transfer book; do you believe the name subscribed as witness to the transfer of Mr. Papps is the hand writing of the prisoner or not? - I do; the body of the receipt, which is not printed, and the filling up of the transfer, is his hand writing.</p>
               <p>JOHN PIERCE sworn.</p>
               <p>I live in Queen-street, Lincoln's-inn-fields.</p>
               <p>I believe you are sometimes described of the Stock Exchange? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You do business there frequently? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Be so good as to look at the signature of that, is that your hand writing? - It is not.</p>
               <p>Did you on the day that appears to be dated have any such transfer as that receipt imports? - No.</p>
               <p>You did not transfer fifty pounds stock on that day to any body? - I do not know to any body, but not in his name.</p>
               <p>Did you sell any sum of fifty pounds stock to the prisoner Fonton on that day? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Do you remember any transaction that you had respecting stock with the prisoner upon that day? - Yes.</p>
               <p>State what it was? - I bought four hundred and fifty pounds of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Look at this book and see whether that acceptance of a transfer belongs to you? - That was the four hundred and fifty pounds that was paid by me; the person who transacts business for me, who is in court, one Mr. Brown, paid it to Mr. Fonton.</p>
               <p>You gave directions to Mr. Brown?</p>
               <p>Court. I suppose you have other witnesses to prove that this is not the hand writing of another Mr. Pierce; because I doubt a little whether Mr. Pierce is a proper witness to prove his own hand writing.</p>

               <p>Do you recollect how you paid it? - I do not exactly; it was in cash and bank notes.</p>
               <p>Did you take a stock receipt from him? - No, Sir; I had no receipt.</p>
               <p>Do these kind of transactions frequently pass between the brokers without receipts? - Very frequently in the multiplicity of business: we see the transfer is made.</p>
               <p>Did you on this occasion satisfy yourself that the transfer was made to your principal? - Yes; I was satisfied of that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Then you do not consider the receipt as absolutely necessary among yourselves? - Not as a jobber.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Pierce. Did you take any receipt on this occasion? - No.</p>
               <p>How happened that? - Oh, we frequently do them without a receipt; I went and looked at the books, to see if there was any transfer.</p>
               <p>How long have you known the prisoner? - A great number of years.</p>
               <p>Are you acquainted with the character of his hand-writing? - I have seen it frequently, because I have a great number of receipts of his.</p>
               <p>Look at that receipt? - I believe it to be his.</p>
               <p>Look at the written part of the body of the transfer: do you believe that to be his? - Yes, I believe it is his.</p>

               <p>Look at the body of that receipt; is that the hand-writing of Fonton? - Yes.</p>

            , they have proved that this receipt is not his hand-writing; but beyond that, there is this strong circumstantial evidence, to prove it a forgery. That, whereas, that receipt expresses that this was received for the consideration of fifty pounds, transferred by Pierce to him; there is no transfer by any Pierce to him of that sum; and it is witnessed by you, the body of it; and therefore you are now called upon to satisfy the jury, if you can, how you came to put into the hands of Mr. Papps, such a false receipt.</p>

               <p>Mr. Edwards. I have known him eighteen years; he has always borne the character of a punctual orderly well-behaved man, very inoffensive in his manners; so much so, that he would have been one of the last in the house that, I should have thought capable of such a transaction.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five more witnesses who gave him an exceeding good character.</p>

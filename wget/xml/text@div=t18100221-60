            . I was coming from Fore-street about three quarters past twelve o'clock; the moon shone very bright; I saw three men at a little distance from me, they appeared to be wrestling; I came up and looked, and saw that they had got hold of this young man; I heard them say, do you mean to give it, he said, no; they then said, we'll give it you; with that the man in the great coat knocked him down. The man that was behind was dressed like a butcher: I saw him pull his hand out of the young man's breeches pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was that - A. The butcher. The prisoner tapped this butcher on the shoulder, and said, come along; they both ran up Holborn.</p>
               <p>Q. You spoke of three - A. Yes. One stopped in the great coat. I saw a watchman at a distance, I ran and told him; the prisoner and a butcher ran away, leaving the man in the great coat behind; the man in the great coat was then coming towards us, I told the watchman to stop him, as he had knocked the young man down, below, and robbed him; the watchman said he had no charge of him, he would not stop him. I then returned to the young man that was laying bleeding; the watchman went with me; I helped to gather the young man's onions up, that had rolled about, and while we were talking the prisoner returned; I then said to the watchman, catch hold of him; he did; we got the young man up, and asked him if he knew him; he said, yes, that was the man that had knocked him down; he would give charge of him. We went to Hatton Garden watchhouse; the constable of the night being busy we went to the fire backwards, the young man sat down and went to sleep, quite senseless; the prisoner then pulled three shillings and sixpence out of his pocket; he said that was all that he had got, and that he would give it me if I would say he was not the man; I told him he must make it up with the young man. The constable of the night then came, I stated the case to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, my boy - I thought you said it was the man in the great coat that knocked him down - A. Yes, it was, but this man was of the party; I had a perfect view of him by the moon shine; I am sure of his person.</p>
               <p>Q. to Perry. Do you remember the last witness coming<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181002210042"></xptr>up to you - A. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you lose - A. Twenty-three shillings and sixpence, a piece of beef, and some onions; my money was in my right hand breeches pocket; my pocket was buttoned.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they say any thing to you before they knocked you down - A. I do not remember any thing; it was done in an hurry. They came up the passage as I was going in.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner - do you know him - A. I cannot safely say that was one of the men that was with the three.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you an opportunity of seeing him - A. I remember seeing him, but I cannot swear positively; I believe he is one of them; I remember the face; when they took me up, owing to the blow, I was quite senseless; my backpart of my head fell on the edge of the stone step. I did not know where I was till I came to myself in the watchhouse.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the night this happened I was calling half after twelve on Sunday morning; I was coming back from Ely-court to where my stand is, I met that lad, the witness, Cook, he told me there was a young man knocked down and robbed, close to Ely-court, I hastened to him and saw seven or eight men altogether, and some onions laying upon the pavement; Cook pointed out the prisoner and told me that he was one of the three men that knocked the young man down; I asked him whether he was sure, and whether he would give charge of him or not; he said, yes, and then I took charge of him; I took him to the watchhouse, and from thence to Clerkenwell prison.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you stop the first man - A. The man was a great distance from him; he was going along solidly, and fast asleep almost; and I saw a great number of people standing at my stand, I hastened to them.</p>

            . Q. Did you at any time see the prisoner in your house - A. On the 11th of October; between ten and eleven in the morning, she was in the passage that leads into the street; I had a suspicion from hearing something fall in the passage, which I found was a hat; I went out as soon as possible, and saw the prisoner standing between the front parlour door and the street door; I asked her what she had under her cloak, I pulled aside the cloak, and there was a hat under her left arm: I took the hat from her, and by that time Compton came up from the kitchen; I then asked him if that was not his hat, he said yes, the prisoner had taken it from the nail where it hung in the passage. I gave the hat to

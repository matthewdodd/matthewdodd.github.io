            , went from the other parlour to the kitchen to fetch some rubbers to rub the furniture; she came up from the kitchen, and said, sir, there is a man getting out of the window; I directly sprung from the sofa, and opened the door.</p>
               <p>How was the door then? - The street-door was fast; I opened it, and pursued, and called stop thief! twice; and I saw the two prisoners run towards Kingsland turnpike, and when I saw them run, I called, fire, fire, says I, with a bold voice; for in the room where they committed the robbery, there is a number of fire-arms; then they turned round back at me; when I called fire, they threw the property from them.</p>
               <p>You said that to intimidate them? - Yes, Collard was the right-hand man; he threw the property away which he had; and Andrews was the left-hand man; he had property, and threw it away likewise; then they crossed each other; the property was taken up by the pursuers; they are here; I think we run near half a mile; I pursued them myself; I called stop thief till they were pursued; we lost Andrews, as we supposed, in a ditch; we over run him; Collard was taken, I suppose, in twenty minutes.</p>
               <p>Was he out of your sight? - In the last field that we went over he was out of my sight, I suppose, for seven minutes, or hardly so long; I am certain of him; I knew the man before.</p>
               <p>Did you know Andrews before? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Was Andrews taken that day? - Not till the day following; I saw him then at the Magpie, Clerkenwell; he was in custody; they had taken him that morning; I knew him again well, by reason, when I called fire, I brought him round three times.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178810220013"></xptr>Have you so full a knowledge of him, as safely to swear to him? - Yes, I had a full sight of him; this is the implement, that we suppose, they opened the window with; this is the piece of the sash that was broke at the bottom; I suppose, I had been in the parlour ten minutes before; for it was a rainy day; I had been in the garden with the gardener; and I went into the parlour; and seeing the guittar, I played a tune; I observed the windows then, they were down.</p>
               <p>Were they fastened? - Why there is a doubt, whether the window, that they came in at, was fastened or not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow objected that the indictment did not charge this witness to be in the room, where he said he was, but it was over-ruled.</p>
               <p>Mr. Season. This screw-driver, which was made use of, as it appears by the sash, to wrench the side sash up; this we found on the road that they went.</p>
               <p>Are you clear the window was down? - It was, but I cannot say for the screw.</p>
               <p>Who took up the property? - The different people that are here; I took up some of them; this cruel was broke before; and when we took Collard, his hand was bloody.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Andrews was not found till the next day? - No.</p>
               <p>What distance had the persons got from the house before you came in sight of them? - I suppose ten yards; these are the shoes we picked up in the road; Andrews was without shoes; he runs lane.</p>

               <p>You was present when Andrews was examined the next day? - I was.</p>
               <p>Did you examine his stockings? - I did.</p>
               <p>Was it you, or your brother, that had the prosecution here lately, for stealing a spoon out of his house; your brother is a thief-taker, that lives on Clerkenwell-green? - Exactly so; I saw Andrews and my brother the next day.</p>
               <p>Do you remember your brother examining his stockings, to see if they were muddy? - I do not recollect his examining there, but at Justice Blackborrow's I do, and they were not dirty; that is what you wish to know; I see your object, he had a new pair of shoes on which I told him he was wrong in wearing.</p>
               <p>I dare say you was as witty then as you are upon all occasions? - Upon my honor you are very polite.</p>
               <p>I wish to know what you are; you say you are of no trade, business, or profession? - I supplied the army with marquee tents, shirts, shoes, stockings, and sundries, &amp;c. during the war.</p>
               <p>A contractor? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then your brother perhaps took Andrews? - He did.</p>

               <p>How far were these old buildings from the path that they took? - It was just by Mr. Season's house.</p>
               <p>What distance? - I do not think above twenty yards.</p>
               <p>What distance was the place where you found the things from the path where they ran? - Not above a yard; these are my master's candlesticks, I have known them above nine months, I have been used to clean them, there is no mark upon them; and this set of glass castors with silver tops and silver stand, and these two table spoons I found in this pocket handkerchief; in the next building adjoining it is some old stables which have been pulled down.</p>
               <p>Did this empty building lay open, so that any thing could be thrown into it? - Yes, the front of the building was wide, and mostly down; it was near the path where the men went, close by; I saw such things as these on the side-board in the parlour; I missed them on giving the alarm.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Prosecutor. About what time was this? - As near twelve as could be.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner Andrews.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178810220015"></xptr>How long have you known the defendant Andrews? - For these seven, eight or nine years to the best of my knowledge; on the 26th of September and the 25th, I know where he was; Thursday was the 25th and Friday was the 26th; on Thursday, the 25th of September last, the prisoner Andrews and me went to Waltham statute, or fair; we had not an opportunity of coming back that night, we were obligated to lay there that night; on Friday morning the 26th, we had our breakfast there, and we set off for town from Waltham between eight and nine, I think, to the best of my knowledge, we walked all the way; we breakfasted on the road between Waltham Abbey Church and the Cross, at a private house, where they accommodated people going to the fair; the name of the place was Waltham Abbey.</p>
               <p>What time did you leave that? - I believe it was about half past nine; we came on towards Enfield Wash; we stopped when we came to the other side of Enfield highway; I cannot recollect the sign.</p>
               <p>When did you leave the prisoner Andrews? - After we came out of this house, we stopped and had a pot of beer, and bread and cheese, and smoked a pipe, it was about ten, I think it was just upon ten, and we staid there till near eleven; I came with him over Enfield highway, and about the middle of it I met a friend of mine, and returned, and the prisoner Andrews at the bar, walked on; I did not think of staying, when I returned with this acquaintance, but I did not return to him; I parted company with him about eleven.</p>
               <p>Do you know the other prisoner Collard? - No.</p>
               <p>He was not in company at that time? - No.</p>
               <p>What coloured coat had Andrews on? - A blue coat during the time I was with him, from Thursday morning till Friday morning eleven o'clock, he had the same coat on he has now; I swear he had not a light coloured coat; I never heard any harm of the man; I never knew any blemish in his character.</p>
               <p>Court. Where do you live? - No. 72, Snow-hill.</p>
               <p>What was your errand to this fair? - For a bit of frolick.</p>
               <p>Where about does Andrews live? - In Beech-lane.</p>

               <p>What is he? - A printer.</p>
               <p>Where did you set out from? - We went over Stamford Hill.</p>
               <p>You had no business there? - No, only out of frolick; I never had been to see the fair.</p>
               <p>Did you ever appear before the justice? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>When did you first know of his being taken up? - I heard of it on the Saturday, I believe, or Sunday morning, I will not be sure.</p>
               <p>When was the first application made to you to come here, and by whom? - I believe it is four or five days since.</p>
               <p>You never was applied to before about this business? - Not to my knowledge.</p>

            . About the 11th or 12th of July, I let the Prisoner a Lodging in my House at 3 s. a Week; she came in the Evening, and then I saw all my Goods in the Room, for I help'd her to make the Bed. In the Morning I intended she should breakfast with me, so I went up Stairs. to call her, but no Body answered. About 12 I open'd the Door, and found the Bed just as I had made it the Night before, - only it was stripp'd, and the rest of my Goods were gone. About a Month afterward, one Mrs. Cotton inform'd me, that she had seen some of my Things in a Broker's (one Mrs. Bushnel's ) Shop in Castle-Street. Upon this, I went thither, and found my Looking-glass, but the Broker would have 6 s. for it.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Cotton. About a Week after the Prosecutrix was robb'd, we found the Candlestick and the Glass at Bushnel's, and nothing more, for the Constable did not search carefully; he open'd no Boxes nor Drawers.</p>
               <p>Roberts. Bushnel informed us, she had the Goods of the Prisoner, and the Prisoner when she was before Justice Mercer own'd she took them.</p>

            ; so they took me to the Gin-shop, and made me almost drunk, while we were at the Gin-shop says Betty Cook, I want a little Money, - let's go and take a Lodging. We agreed upon it, and went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173709070038"></xptr> out together for that Purpose: when we came to Mrs. Robert's House, says Cook there's a Bill up, - and 'twas the first Bill we came at, - do you go in and take the Lodging, and so I did. At Night I went to my new Lodging, and at a proper Time I handed the Things out to them - they waited at the Door for them. My Lord, I am a Housekeeper my self at Hyde Park Corner, - please to let me suffer here, by burning me in the Hand, - or what you please.</p>
               <p>Justice Mercer. I granted a Warrant to search Bushnel's House, and had her before me, and she said the Prisoner was to be produced, for she liv'd at Hyde-Park Corner. What the Prisoner says now is very different from what she said when she was before me. <rs id="t17370907-55-verdict282" type="verdictDescription">

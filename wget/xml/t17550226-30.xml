            . On the 10th of February, Mrs. Bentley seeing the cheeses move upon her bulk, I being with her, went out, and at the corner of Leather-lane I saw the prisoner standing with a bundle; I asked him what he had got there? He said, what is that to you? I insisted on seeing what he had, and feeling under his arm, found they were cheeses. I brought him into Mrs. Bently's shop, and he laid them on the compter, and said he found him leaning against a house side at the corner of Leather-lane. He was taken before justice Fielding, and committed.</p>

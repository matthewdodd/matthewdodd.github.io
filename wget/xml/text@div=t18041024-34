               <p>Q. When you were passing, did any thing particular take your attention? - A. I passed on the right-hand side of the way, a woman came out of a house, and I saw a lady looking out of a window at the upper story of the house opposite No. 11, she cried out to me for God's sake go over, pointing to that house opposite; in consequence of what she said to me I went over, to No. 11, I turned round and went to the house, and saw the lady knocking violently at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. At the door No. 11? - A. I cannot say that, I was at too great a distance from the place, I proceeded about half way across the street; when the door opened, the prisoner rushed out, and struck Mrs. Wilson on the face, I did not see the blow directed particularly on the face of the lady, as he passed he gave a violent blow; running up Thayer-street, the prisoner was passing by me, I sprang and seized him; he struggled, and with his right-hand raised an instrument, and made a violent blow at me, which very luckily I avoided as much as I could; it was an iron crow, I saw it afterwards; he struck me on the thigh, and just cut through the skin, (the crow produced); that is the crow, he struck me with that.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt of the prisoner being the man that struck you? - A. None at all, I never lost sight of him; at the time he made the blow at me, I returned it; he fell from the blow that he received from me; he got up again, and ran away; I never lost sight of him.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You are a surgeon? - A. Yes, in Thayer-street, Manchester-square.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect being called in on the evening of that day to this lady, Mrs. Wilson? - A. Yes, about seven o'clock in the evening; I found Mrs. Wilson had received an extensive wound on the right side of the face, near two inches in length; it appeared to be inflicted by a sharp instrument; at the inferior part of the wound the instrument had penetrated into the mouth; it had cut through the flesh; it is what we denominate a fresh wound; one of the large double teeth in the lower jaw was loosened in the socket, and there was a considerable hemorrhage. (The crow shewn to the witness.)</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt but it might be done by such an instrument as this? - A. I have no doubt but such an instrument as this would inflict such a wound.</p>
               <p>The prisoner did not say any thing in his defence.</p>

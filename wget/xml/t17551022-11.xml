On the 7th of this instant I had this book in my hand, and the next morning I missed it. I got a search-warrant, and searched her lodgings, but found nothing. I brought her to New-prison for further examination, then I went to her there, and she owned she had taken the book. Mr. Fielding ordered her up at 11 o'clock the next day, she owned the same there, and that she had torn the back, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175510220007"></xptr> lids, and paper, in which was some writing, and burnt them, and she had sold the book for 2 d. to one Mr. Brown in Chancery-lane. I went to Mr. Brown, he owned he had bought such a book, and he produced the book before the justice.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I did sell the book.</p>
               <p>John Brown. I knew the prisoner by sight before, she came to me the 9th of this month in the morning with this book, and ask'd me if I would buy it; I bought it of her for two-pence. When Mr. Williamson came to me, and ask'd me if I had bought such a book, I told him I had, and produced it.</p>

On Tuesday evening, the 25th of May, about half-past eight o'clock, I was in the shop - there were watches and jewellery in the window - I heard a pane of glass break, which was whole before; I looked round, and saw the prisoner at the window in the street - I did not see him do any thing; I had seen the watches in the window all day - there were about six near that pane - he was standing at the window: I immediately went round the counter, and went out - he was then running across the road; I ran after him, and saw him throw a watch from his hand on the pavement, as if he was trying, to throw it down the area - I took hold of him, and took him back to the watch-house; I picked it up, took him back to the shop, and gave him in charge to a Police-man, who came up soon after - the whole transaction lasted scarcely five minutes: it was a very large pane of glass, and was broken quite out - a person outside could reach the watch off the hook; he was scarcely out of my sight, only while I went round the counter.</p>

            . I was standing in Mr. Kendrick's oil-shop, No. 3, Glo'ster-terrace, where I live, about half-past eight o'clock, and heard a pane of glass smash - I looked out at the door, and saw the prisoner run by the shop as fast as he could, and then cross the road - Wharton came out, and called Stop thief! I ran after him as fast as I could, and got before him - I was going to take hold of him, and he threw a watch out of his hand, and turned round; I am sure I saw him throw it from his hand - I and Wharton took hold of him, and led him back to where the watch lay; Wharton picked it up, and took him back.</p>

            . This is Mr. Page's watch - it is silver, and worth 40s.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going along the road, and it began to rain very hard; I ran to get shelter - two men followed and collared me, and said I had stolen a watch; they took me to the shop, and said I had broken a square of glass - the window was full of wearing-apparel. Is it possible for the prosecutor to swear it was me? Could he see through the clothes? I never saw the watch till I saw them with it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a printer, and live in Bartlett's-build<lb></lb>ings, Holborn. On the 27th of February I met the prisoner about twelve o'clock at night, and was induced to accompany her to her lodging, in Compton-street, Clerkenwell—after being there some time I took some re<lb></lb>freshment, and when I essayed to go I found she had stolen my purse—I had 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. In my purse, and some loose silver in my pocket—I charged both her and her attendant, who was in the room, with it, and told them they had stolen my purse—after some little noise and dispute, the purse was returned to me, with 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had not given her any money, nor had she asked me for any—I was not going, but this was the occasion of my going—I was not in bed when I missed the purse—I might have staid longer but for this—we had not the least discussion about money—a few minutes after she returned me the 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I told her I missed 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and counted the money over—she then looked about, and returned another half-sovereign—I told her I would not go, I would have a policeman, and she in fact opened the window, and called out for the police herself—the policeman came, and I gave her in charge for the robbery—she did not make any complaint against me—the policeman found 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., I believe.</p>

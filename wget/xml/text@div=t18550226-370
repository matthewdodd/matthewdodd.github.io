                  </hi>. I live at Barking, in Essex. On 17th Jan. the prisoner came to nurse my wife—she was with me four days, and on the evening of 20th Jan. she was going away—she had come on Wednesday, and was going on the Saturday—I had to go to a box, and her shawl laid on the box—as I lifted the box lid, an article that we call a roundabout, which is a worsted frock, fell out of her shawl—I also missed a frock, a serge shirt, a petticoat, and a fancy shirt—I went for a policeman, and he</p>

               <p>found the duplicates at the prisoner's house—I went with the policeman to the pawnbroker's, and found these articles—these three articles I cannot swear to, but they are just such as I had—this one I can swear to, it has the name at full length—I missed it on the Tuesday after the prisoner was gone—1 had seen it safe on the Tuesday before she came—I did not see it while she was there—the article that fell out of her shawl is not here.</p>

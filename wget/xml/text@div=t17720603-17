            . The prisoners and I were coming home from Kilburn, we had been all round that part, in order to see what money we could get by robbing the first gentleman that came; we met the prosecutor; we walked past him because there were people behind him, when these people were gone by, we returned and robbed him; they said, Stand, and give us you money; but they used no other force or threats, only put a pistol to him. Waters took his money, and Adams took his buckles; the buckles were afterwards sold by one Jones; we all went to his lodging in Maynard-street, St. Giles'; they broke them to pieces in his lodging before he came.</p>

            . I keep a publick house at Kilburn; three men came to my house on Sunday the 17th of May, in the evening, about half after eight; they staid at the door and drank a pot of beer.</p>

               <p>Errington. I have no reason to doubt that they are the men; I have seen them before; I know them perfectly well; one of them desired I would make haste; I served them with the pot of beer. There were some carriages at the door; a gentleman, one Mr. Francis, came by, to whom I had lent my horse; he was in a chaise; I asked him what he had done with my horse? he said he had tied him to a rail at Paddington. Knowing my horse to be shy, I was fearful that by a number of horses and carriages passing, he might break his bridle and get away; therefore I was very angry at Mr. Francis, and told him, I would never let him have my horse again, upon any account; then I sent a man after my horse.

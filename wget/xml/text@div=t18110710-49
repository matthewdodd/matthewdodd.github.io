               <p>Q. Were you possessed of a watch on the 12th of June. - A. Yes, about a twelvemonth I had the watch. The watch was taken from the kitchen of the public-house, I had left it on the shelf about two o'clock in the morning. It is a market-house, we generally open about two o'clock in the morning. I opened the house at that time. The prisoner came into my house, as I opened it, he asked if he could have any coffee.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in the kitchen - A. Yes, he said he would take a quartern of brandy, we drawed him the brandy. I asked him for the money, he said he had nothing less than a ten pound note, we immediately ordered him out of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he produce a ten-pound note. - A. No, he left the house upon being ordered out, about three minutes after he left the house, I missed the watch, I gave an alarm, and went out of doors to look for him, and while I was out, the prisoner was brought back, when I returned he was in the house, he was taken to the watchhouse, I saw the watch found upon him by Kimber; I knew it to be mine.</p>

            . I am a constable. The prisoner was brought to the watchhouse, I took the watch from him, I have kept it ever since.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is my watch.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The matter is this: I am a person that was upwards of twenty years well-doing in this metropolis; I have had upwards of five years sickness in the north, my friends were kind to me. On this morning, through great distress I stood in need of something, they were early open in the market, I thought perhaps I might get a cup of coffee, the young man brought me brandy, what I called for; as I could not produce the money, I said nothing less than a ten pound note, I had not the note; I was ordered out, I went to the upper part of the market, told my distress, they gave me coffee, I was not apprehensive there was any alarm given, I took a walk round the market. They over-hauled me, and found the watch upon me.</p>

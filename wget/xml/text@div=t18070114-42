            . You are an officer of Worship street. - A. I am, I went on Monday the 8th of December in the afternoon, with Vickrey and Bishop, to a house situated in Brewer's Yard, Chick Lane, I left Bishop in the front part of the house; I and Vickrey went round the back way, and went into a stair case, that led into a room where the prisoner was sitting, two women were in that room, one he said was his wife. I asked him if he lived there, he said yes, he had lived there a twelvemonth and paid 8 s. a week. I asked him if he had got any thing there, (I believe them were the direct words) he said no, I looked into a cupboard of the left hand side, and in a minute or less, Vickerey said it was all right. I then from that called up Bishop, bolted the door, and in one minute I saw Vickrey lift up a board, and take out this (producing the leather howzells) from between the ceiling below; they were handed to me, and I put them on a table, I believe there were eight of them, and I knew eight were lost. I then says to the prisoner, how came you by this, his answer was, I know nothing about them; the prisoner was secured instantly, and in coming away, he said, I wish you would go up stairs for they had been brought in there by a little boy, that found them in the necessary. I went up stairs, I tried the door of the room, it was padlocked; then I took them to the office; they were sworn to.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. In the morning when I was coming down stairs, I saw two boys in the privy, I asked them what they had there, they said that they had some leather that they found in the privy; they said it did not belong to them; I asked them what they wanted, they said they were going to call a drover up that lived there, if I was a mind to have it, I might have it; when the officers came the drover was out; the drover came up to the office to me, I asked him for the boys, he told me he would bring them, but the boys have gone on board a ship this fortnight.</p>

             sworn. Examined by Mr. Fielding. I am an officer, in consequence of information I went to the prisoners' lodgings, on the 11th of August, about ten in the morning, one room was a one pair of stairs room and the other was a two pair, I I went in company with Brown, my brother officer, we found the house door open, we went up one pair of stairs, and opened the one pair of stairs room door, the moment we opened the room we secured the man and the woman; one of us bolted the door least any other person might come, we instantly examined their fingers and thumbs, and on each of the prisoners we found then green and yellow; I took a pin and pricked from under their nails, and took out that which had a strong smell of aqua-fortis, we both examined them; we told the prisoners they had been working lately, we told them if they smelled their own fingers they had the smell of aqua fortis.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they say either of them to that. - A. They behaved exceedingly quiet, they made no answer; I then desired Mr. Brown to search the man, and to assist in searching the woman, when he had done with the man I searched the woman; among good money in her pocket I found nine shillings and two sixpences of base coin, I produce them, there was twelve shillings and sixpence good money in the same pocket; Mr. Brown assisted in searching the other pocket, I found nothing more on her person; after this I went up the other pair of stairs, which I understood to be their room, and left Brown in the charge of the prisoner; when I got into the second story room, I found the door open, I found this trunk laying on a bed, it contains forty counterfeit half crowns, three dollars, counterfeit, and six sixpences not fit for circulation; I found this little hand vice near by the fire side in the two pair of stairs room; an hand vice is used when they file, I found this piece of cork; that is likewise used in the process, I found this piece of leather with stuff upon them which they use for clearing up these sixpences to make them fit for circulation, I found this pair of scissars.</p>
               <p>A. Are they calculated for any purpose. - A. Goods that are not cut with an engine they clip them round, and then they file them; I found several sheets of sand paper, that is used also; I found this tin, it is like a cheese toaster, this put upon charcoal is used for the purpose of coining; I will not say it has positively been used; I found several pieces of sand paper that had been used, that vial I will not say what has been in it; these sixpences can be put in a state of circulation with this piece of leather; on this cloth are several stains of liquid, such as aqua fortis.</p>

             sworn. Examined by Mr. Knapp. I was the first person that went into the room, I immediately secured them and handcuffed them together, I saw what was taken from their nails, their hands, I believe, were coloured with aqua fortis; I searched the man, and found on him three shillings and sixpence good silver, and some halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any base metal on his person. A. One sixpence; I then searched the cupboard, there I found a quantity of le dust, I found this file with the filings of metal in the teeth in it; on the shelf of the same cupboard I found one counterfeit shilling, and I found some cream of tartar that is used in coining, I found by the side of the fire place in the same room, this charcoal; I found this bottle, in the cupboard, it a pears to me to be aqua fortis, but there has been asafoetida in it likewise; I found three pieces of cork in the shape they are now, they are necessary for coining; on the mantle piece I found a small piece of blacking, that is likewise used; I found these two pocket books in Mrs. Miller's pocket, and in one of the pocket books a counterfeited shilling; in this bottle I found some white liquor; these pans have been set over the fire apparently.</p>
               <p>Q. Are these used in coining. - A. Yes, I found several cloths with the appearance of aqua fortis on different parts of them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley.</p>
               <p>Q. You know they are also applied to domestic purposes. - A. No doubt.</p>
               <p>Q. You could not find any aqua fortis. - A. There was but a very little quantity.</p>
               <p>Q. There is asafoetida in the vial, you know aqua fortis is necessary to complete the coining. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There is no aqua fortis there. - A. Very little.</p>

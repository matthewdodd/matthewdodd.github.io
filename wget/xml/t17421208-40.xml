               <p>Tryphena Eden . On the 15th of October last, my House was broke open. - I lost two Casks, containing eight Gallons of Rum, the Value is two Pounds, the one Cask of Brandy, Value three<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174212080031"></xptr> Pounds, one Stone Bottle with two Gallons of English Brandy, Value five Shillings, one Pewter Gallon Pot, Value five Shillings, and three Brass Cocks, Value three Shillings. They broke into the Vault in the Cellar; I missed these Things on Saturday, about Three o'Clock in the Afternoon. - One of the Shutters was broke off, and one of the Bars bent in. - I believe they were shut fast on Friday Night; but I saw them fast the Thursday before: There is an Iron Bar cross the Window, they took that off, and pulled the Pin out, and then there was room enough for a Man to go into the Cellar. I have not got any Thing again but the Gallon Pot, which I had of Mr Unwin ; he brought it to my House, and shewed it to me, and said, he took it out of Robinson's House: I cannot swear this is my Pot: I believe it is mine, because it was without a Lid. - Robinson said he had sold the Brandy and Rum to a Jew; but I cannot remember his Name.</p>

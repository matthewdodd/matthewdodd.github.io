            . I am one of Elliott's light-horse. The prisoner and I do not both belong to one troop, I never was but once with him in my life, on such an account, but only when we robbed the prosecutor upon Christmas-eve about two in the Morning, a little beyond Kensington turnpi ke; we were on foot, we went out on purpose to see if we could find any body, we met this gentleman and a woman in a post-chaise, we both ran up to them. I stood by the horses, and he robbed him of a gold watch and twelve and sixpence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go out in your soldiers cloaths?</p>
               <p>White. No; he had a serjeant's blue coat which I put on, and he got a Major's servant's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176602190024"></xptr> brown coat, and a narrow gold laced hat. The money we divided, and I had the watch in order to dispose of it.</p>

I live at 175, New Kent Road—I am a tobacconist, and I also sell toys—on 8th November a man came into my shop and asked for some birdseye tobacco, and then he spoke about boot laces—he said he belonged to a school, and he wanted some boot laces for the school, and they must be got that day—I had not got any then, and he went away—after that an old man came with a van, of whom I ordered some toys—I asked him if he had boot laces, and I took a dozen and a half of his whip<lb></lb>cord laces to try—he had not got the toys with him; he said he should be round again in three-quarters of an hour, and would bring the toys—after the old man had gone the prisoner came in, and I thinking he was the man told him I had the laces he was inquiring about—he said "Oh, have you, let me see them?"—he said he would take a dozen and see if they would do—he paid me for them—he said he would see if they were the sort that would be required at the school, and if it was he would come back and let me know whether he would have any more—he said he could get a good many orders if I would allow him a penny off every shilling, and I agreed to do so—he left, and in a short time he came back again with a young man, who he introduced as pupil teacher at the school—he then produced a written order for seventeen dozen whipcord laces, and eighteen dozen of a different kind—he told me several times that it was useless unless I executed it at once—I said the man I bought the others of would be back in a short time—the prisoner went out saying he would be back in an how and a half—about five minutes after the old man came in with the order I had given him—I showed him the paper, and told him I would take two gross of each—he only had one gross and nine dozen of the penny ones—I took them and two gross of the twopenny ones, and paid him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them—the prisoner never called for the laces and the old man never came again—I have the laces now; they are useless—when I found the young man did not come, I tried to sell them to someone in the trade, and they said they were worth 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a gross, and I had given 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them—I don't understand them myself—I never had anything to do with them before—I met a man that same afternoon and gave him in charge—that was the same man I had seen in the shop in the morning—I took him to the station and he was discharged—I was quite mistaken—when I said before the Magistrate that it was the prisoner, I made a mistake—I apologised to the gentleman since I knew he was not the man who brought me the orders—I am quite sure that the prisoner is the man who ordered the laces; I have no doubt whatever.</p>

I keep a general shop, at 2, Gloucester Terrace, Lower Wandsworth—on 29th September, last year, the prisoner came to my shop—he asked me about some pipes at first—he then looked round the shop, and said "I see you have got some boot laces"—I said "Yes"—he said "Have you got enough to supply me with this order?"—he produced an order for thirty-two dozen at 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and eighteen dozen at 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a dozen; eighteen dozen of leather at 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and fifteen dozen strong at 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I said I would try and get the order, as a man had been in the morning with the laces—he left the order with me, and said he would call again at 2 o'clock—he said if I got the order it would save him having to walk where he was in the habit of going—about three-quarters or half an hour after he left, the man who had been in before with the laces came in again, and offered me the laces again, and I bought the quantity that the prisoner ordered, and paid the man 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and he went away—I did not see the prisoner again till three weeks ago to-morrow—he did not come back at 2 o'clock as he said he would—I have since ascertained that the laces are worth 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. which I gave 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for—I was not a judge of laces—I recognised the prisoner as the man as he came through the door into the Police Court—I am quite positive he is the man, and I told the Magistrate so—he said he wanted the laces for a clog factory.</p>

               <p>in the morning, the prisoner came in to sell some boot-laces—he asked me if I wanted any articles from his master, toys or laces—I said at first I did not want anything, and then I asked if he had some of his printed cards—he said he came from Mr. Harrison's, in the City—he said he was going to meet a friend of his, whom he hoped would have a card, and he would come back in half an hour and leave a card—he went away, and about ten minutes afterwards an old gentleman came in and asked for some boot-laces—he saw some hanging up, and said "Oh, yes, you have some"—he looked at them and said they were not nice ones, they were not the strongest sort—he broke one and bought one, which he paid a halfpenny for—he said they were not the sort he wanted, he wanted better laces—he went away, and came back again in about ten minutes, and brought a piece of lace to show me what sort he wanted—he then went away again—in about a quarter of an hour the prisoner came back—he said he had not got one of his cards then, but he hoped to get one soon—I showed him the lace the old man had brought, and said I wanted some like that—I said somebody had been in for laces—I bought three dozen of him similar to that lace, and I paid him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said he would come back soon and bring one of his printed cards—very soon after he left the old man came back, and gave me a written order for eighteen dozen—I had some conversation with him, and he left—he said he hoped I should be able to get the laces in about an hour, because he wanted them—very soon after the prisoner came, with his horse and cart and another young man—he said he had not got the card, but he would write his address down—I showed him the order, and ordered laces from him to supply that order—he told me I had better have five gross, as it would be cheaper—he gave me a quantity of laces, which I supposed was five gross—when he left I found there was only three gross and a half—he made out two bills, one for four gross and the other for one gross—I saw him write them—he told me the laces would come to 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I gave him 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he went away without giving me the change—I gave him 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold and 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver by mistake—it was my mistake—I found it out afterwards, when I counted my money—he went away quickly—when I bought the laces he repre<lb></lb>sented them to be leather laces—I asked him if they were leather, and he said they were strong leather laces—I afterwards enquired at a boot shop, and they said they were only painted string—I bought them believing they were leather—I believe the prisoner is the man, but he does not seem quite so tall as when he came into the shop—I also said that his whiskers were a little larger—I did not see him with his hat off, so I could not tell what forehead he had—he was in my shop a few minutes each time—I described the man to the police, and I was taken to the police-station to identify him.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at High Street, Clapham, with Mr. Neale, a butcher—I know the prisoner—on the morning of 10th November I was with my master's son, with a horse and van, near the Surrey Theatre, about 11.50—I saw the prisoner there, and we gave him a ride to the New Meat Market, Smithfield, where we arrived at 12.20—I put my master down at one end of the market, and went to where the horses and carts stand—I then went with the prisoner and had something to drink—he left me at I o'clock at the market.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was not spoken to by anyone—a policeman brought me a letter to appear the next Thursday—I can speak to the time by the Elephant and Castle clock—it was a Friday, and we were going a second time after the second load of meat—we always go twice on a Friday—I knew the prisoner well before—he called after me "Dick"—I pulled up and he jumped in behind the van.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. It was the day after Lord Mayor's Day, and that is how I can recollect it—he was with me from 11.50 till 1 o'clock.</p>

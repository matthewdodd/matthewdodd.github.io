I saw the prisoner coming towards me, as I got over the stile. He came up, and struck me on the pit of the stomach with one hand. He said nothing - He put his hand up my petticoats, and forced it up to my back. I did not know him before. He forced me on the ground-as he threw me down, the bundle slipped out of my hand, he immediately snatched it up and ran away. He offered me no other violence. I I cried out that there was a man coming, and called out murder! until assistance came, and followed him - He went towards Holloway; a person came up and stopped with me, and I followed him the best part of three fields. I saw my bundle again in half an hour in the officer's hands - I am positive the prisoner is the man; he was taken in half an hour-it was near Copenhagen House.</p>

            . On the 11th of September, I was going to Copenhagen House about nine o'clock in the morning; I saw the prisoner loitering about the lane;I passed him, and walked some distance up the lane, and frequently looked after him; when I got into the fields I still saw him. I got over the ditch to go to Copenhagen House; when I got about a hundred yards from the field I heard the cry of murder! I called to some men - We all ran across the field, and saw him crossing Ring Common. I saw him before me for half a mile, and lost sight of him-Kempton followed him. I got sight of him again in a moment; he was secured in a garden. I saw him drop the bundle. I am sure heis the man.</p>

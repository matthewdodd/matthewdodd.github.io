            , I am a working jeweller, and live in South Audley-street, Grosvenor-square. Barnes came to my shop on the evening of the 10th of December, between six and seven o'clock, and asked if I would purchase a ring, which he brought - I looked at it, and asked how he came by; he said he found it twelve months ago, and had had it by him, but he was then out of a situation, and wished to sell it to raise some money, and he said he had just come from Mr. Neat's, the pawnbroker, who had offered him 15s. for it, and said it was a diamond - I said I was not certain whether it was or not, as it was candle-light, but I would give him a sovereign for it; he wanted 30s. for it, and then said I should have it for 28s. - I refused to give it; he then said I should have it for 25s. - I refused; he left the shop, but returned and took the sovereign, and asked for a drop of ale, which I gave him; he came again the next morning, and asked if I would buy a gold chain - I took it and weighed it, and asked how he got it; he said of a friend of his - I refused to buy it, and he asked if I knew any refuers; I said Yes, and named two persons - he then left the shop; the diamond in the ring was a rose diamond, worth about 3l. - I kept it for a fortnight, and then being in want of a bit of gold. I melted the ring.</p>
               <p>Barnes. I asked him how much it was worth - he looked at it for ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, and said he would give me 1l.; I said it must be worth 30s. - I at last took the 1l.; I took the chain next morning - he said it was worth 2l. or 3l. but he could not buy it as he had no small change. Witness. I did not, I had money enough to pay for it.</p>

            . I am a porter at the Green Man and Still, in Oxford-street, and live in Queen-street. I have known Barues four years; he came to me about the middle of December, and showed me a ring and a brooch; there were three stones in the ring, and I think three small ones and one large one in the brooch - he said he had found them or knew somebody who had, and he must dispose of them; I took them to Dobree's, to ascertain the value of them - they asked if I was going to buy them; I said Yes, for 10s. - they said I could not be hurt at that, and I bought them; I sold them to a Jew the next day for 4s., as I did not know what they were.</p>

On the 11th of December Barnes brought this gold chain to me; I asked where he got it - he said it belonged to his sister, who was nursemaid to a lady; I asked what his father was - he said a shoemaker, at No. 15, Weston-street, Somers-town; I was not satisfied, and told him I should not buy it - I detained it, and gave him a voucher to show his father; I went in the evening with an officer to find him, but I could not - this is the chain; it is worth about 3l.; I gave it up at the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employment of Benjamin Chamberlain, a carman, of Belvidere-road, Lambeth. On 8th Nov. I was driving one of his carts for Mr. Downes, and went to Walker's shot factory, by his directions, and got four pieces of lead, which I took to the Belle Salvage—I saw them safe after I arrived there, which was about 3 o'clock—in about twenty minutes I received information, and missed one piece, which was afterwards found in the prisoner's nose bag, which was hanging on a shaft—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—all the pieces were different, and this is the one which was missing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am fourteen years old, and live in Belle Sauvage-yard. On Saturday afternoon, 18th Nov., about 20 minutes to 3 o'clock, I was in a covered cart in the yard, and the prisoner was there in a cart, behind my cart; he left his cart, went to the cart of the last witness, took a piece of lead out of it, put it under his coat, and then said to me, "Go and see the time"—I went, but looked under my cart, and saw him put it into his nose bag—I gave information to Charles Tether, at the top of the yard, and to Mr. Merritt, the foreman of the buildings.</p>

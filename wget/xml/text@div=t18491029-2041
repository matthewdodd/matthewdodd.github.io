I am an inspector of police—the prisoner was brought to the station, which is a quarter of a mile from the spot where this occurred—I observed this purse sticking from the breast of his coat—I think it could not have got there during the struggle, because the part the money was in, was under the coat—his coat was similar to what he has on now, but it was not buttoned up quite so high—the prisoner said he knew nothing at all how it came there.</p>

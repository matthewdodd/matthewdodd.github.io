                  </hi> I am a tailor and outfitter, and live in Wellington-place, East India Dock, Limehouse. The prisoner came to me on the 24th of June, and said he was recommended to me, by some of my customers, to have an outfit—he gave an order to the amount of 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and said be should receive a cheque from home to pay on the following Tuesday—when he had concluded the order, he asked me to oblige him with two sovereigns—he re<lb></lb>presented himself as a chief officer in the employ of Mr. Smith, the ship-owner—I did not consider there was any danger in his request, and I did so—on the next day he came again—he said the ship would sail soon, and would I let him have three sovereigns—I did so—he said, "I rather think I shall want some money to pay the labourers to-morrow; if Mr. Smith does not come, will you oblige me?"—I said I would, and he came and had three sovereigns—he came again, and had two sovereigns more—he said he was chief officer of a vessel lying in Mr. Green's dock—I lent him all this money, be<lb></lb>lieving he was chief officer of that ship.</p>

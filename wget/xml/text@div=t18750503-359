                  </hi>. I am a dealer, and live at 9, St. Ann's. Court—on Friday, 16th April, at 10.30 p.m. the prisoner came and asked me if I would purchase of him an Australian note—he' said that he had just returned from Australia, and that he was in the habit of taking them to Mr. Smart, a money changer, of Princes Street, Leicester Square, who paid him 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for them, and it being too late to go there he gave me the opportunity of purchasing it—I had not sufficient money, I consequently gave him 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and promised him the remainder next day—I went next morning to Mr. Smart and subsequently communicated with the police—the prisoner called in the evening for the balance and I gave him into custody—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the note; it purports to-be a 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; note—I said that I hoped it was genuine—he held it up to the light and said "You can see that it is a good note"—I afterwards held it to the light but I saw nothing that would give me an idea that it was a bad one—I am not a judge of Australian notes—I parted with my money because he informed me that Mr. Smart gave him 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the notes and I was to give him 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., so that I should make 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. out of the transaction.</p>

I am a money changer at 60, Princes Street, Leicester Square—the prisoner was not in the habit of changing notes at my shop—I never remember having seen him till I saw him at Marlborough Street—this note was offered to me by Mr. Dowle to be cashed; I saw it was a forgery; that it was not legal money—the Royal Bank is no longer in existence, besides 1 saw it had never been issued by the bank; I can say that from my knowledge of bank notes of the whole world, and I drew my pen across it immediately to prevent any person being taken in.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Parliamentary agent—I was a director of the Royal Bank; it was wound up about twenty-two years ago—I believe this note is a genuine note; it was printed for the bank, and taken out to Australia by two directors who went out to found the bank, but it was never issued—this professes to be signed by H. C. Joyce, a director; there never was a director of that name; it is also signed.W. G. Wilson, manager, and I never heard of such a manager, and it is evident that all the signatures are of a recent date.</p>

Morse, who is mentioned there—he was not the accountant here—he might have been out there—I never heard of W. G. Wilson—he certainly was not manager here, and I never heard of him being manager in Australia.</p>

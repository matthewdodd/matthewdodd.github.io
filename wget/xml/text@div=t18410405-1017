                  </hi>. I keep a coffee-shop in Barbican. The prisoner came to my house on Saturday night, the 20th of March, and asked for a bed for the night—he went to bed about half-past eleven o'clock—I had eleven or twelve shillings and a half-sovereign in my trowsers' pocket when I went to bed—my room door was not locked—I got up at a quarter before six next morning, and missed my money from my pocket—the prisoner being the only strange person in the house, I went to his room—I found the door open, the key taken out, and put on a chest of drawers—one of the drawers was taken out and placed a few yards off, where it had no business to be—when he came down at half-past six, I told him what had happened, and said he could have no objection to be searched—he said, "NO"—I asked what money he had in his pocket—he said 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I asked if that was all—he said, "Yes"—a policeman was sent for—I told him what money I had lost, and went up to the room with him and the prisoner—he was searched, and 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. produced—he was asked if that was all the money he had about him—he said, "Yes"—I, not being satisfied, requested him to pull off his shoes, which he did—in pulling off his left shoe I perceived a bit of cotton rag tied round his leg—I asked what it was—he did not speak at first—I spoke rather sharp, took hold of him, and endeavoured to pull his stocking off—he endeavoured to prevent me, by putting his foot on the floor, and said he could do it himself—I said I would do it for him—I pulled his stocking off, and found a hard substance in it—I gave it to the policeman—he put his hand in and found a half-sovereign—on my return from the station 1 missed a pair of shoes from a closet in the room where the prisoner slept, and which I had seen safe the night before—I found them under the seat where he had sat while I sent for the-policeman, with a small bundle of patent leather, and four stiffeners for stocks, which had been on a shelf on the landing, close to his room door the night before—the piece of cotton which was on the prisoner's leg had been taken from the closet where the shoes were—there was nothing the matter with his leg.</p>

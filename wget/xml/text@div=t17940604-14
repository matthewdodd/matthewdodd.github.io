            Was he near enough to see what you was about when you picked up the two guineas? - He was, he stopped, I saw the guinea, and he took and pushed me on one side and picked it up, I told him it was the lady's guinea, he said where is the lady? it is my guinea; he would not give the guinea up.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You say he throwed down some money, will you swear there were not some guineas throwed down as well as shillings? - I see him throw down the silver but I see no guineas fall.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't know whether there were any guineas among them? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pick up the guineas and silver that he threw down? - No, he picked it up.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how do you know but what he might have thrown down a guinea as well as the lady that dropped the other? - He owned it at last.</p>
               <p>Q. You stated to my lord and jury, just now, that the prisoner pushed you away? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say so before the justice, upon your oath? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You said before you went before the justice that you see him pick some money up? - I did.</p>

            And when you came before the justice you said that you saw him throw some money down.</p>
               <p>Court. You took up two; did you see the other guinea on the ground before the prisoner throwed down his money? - No, I see it when he stopped.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. So that his money was down on the ground before you saw the lady's guinea? - He throwed it down.</p>

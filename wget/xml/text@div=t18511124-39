                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live at 8, Gunn-square, Houndsditch. On 18th Oct., I went with Timothy Shea, who is no relation of mine, to the Horns public house, in Petticoat-lane—we had a pint of beer together there—the prisoner and some others, who I do not know, were drinking there likewise—the prisoner got off his seat, caught hold of Timothy Shea, and pulled him across the form—I got up and separated them—the prisoner struck me, and I returned it—he then caught hold of my nose with his teeth, and never parted from me till he <hi rend="italic">grizzled</hi> it off—I did not find the por<lb></lb>tion</p>

               <p>of my nose again, I was in too much agony to look for it—he must have either swallowed it or spit it out—I found a policeman at the door, and gave the prisoner into custody—I knew the prisoner by sight before, but had never spoken to him—he was not tipsy.</p>

                  </hi>. I am no relation of the last witness. On 18th Oct., about 11 o'clock at night, I was at the Horns, and also Dennis Shea, the prisoner, and others I do not know—the prisoner came across the room to where I was sitting with Dennis Shea—I told him three times to go back to his own company, and he caught me by the breast, and pulled me across the form—Dennis came behind and tried to take him away, he turned round and bit hold of Dennis's nose—I laid hold of the prisoner, trying to take him away from Dennis, and he would not part from him till he got Dennis's nose off—it bled very much—I have seen the prisoner before, but have never spoken to him—he was given into custody.</p>

On 18th Oct., Dennis Shea was brought to the hospital—I examined his face, the end of his nose was gone, and appeared to have been bitten off—it was bleeding then, but not so much as it had been—it was a dangerous wound for a man of his condition—I treated him to prevent erysipelas coming on, which it might have done—he was in the hospital till 4th Nov., and is still an out-patient.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Joseph Clow, of Ludgate-hill. On the 22nd of August, in the evening, the prisoner came into the shop, with another man, and asked to see some silk handkerchiefs—I showed him some, and turned my head away for a moment—I saw the prisoner put something into his hat, and put his hat on—he purchased one handkerchief, the other man paid for it—when they went out, I brought the prisoner back, and said I wished to see what was in his hat—he would not allow me, and I sent for an officer—he took his hat off himself, and a piece of five handkerchiefs was in it—he threw them behind the counter—the shopman took them up—I had shown that piece to them—this is it—it has my master's shop ticket on it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Ludgate-street. I saw the prisoner and the other man in the shop—Collins brought the other man back, and asked him to take off his hat—I asked him also—he said, "I about"—I said, "Very well, an officer will be here in a moment"—he then managed to take his hat off, and threw something behind the counter—the shopman took it up and produced it—it is my property.</p>

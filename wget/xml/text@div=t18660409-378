                  </hi>, M.D., M.R.C.S. I live at 52, Montague-street, Russell-square—about 9 o'clock, on Sunday morning, I was called in to see Mrs. Peacock—her face was very much injured by some corrosive acid, especially her forehead—she has had one eye taken out, and it is very doubt<lb></lb>ful whether she will retain the sight of the other—it still remains very weak, and the least exposure to cold brings on inflammation—it will never be the same eye that it was previous to the injury—I examined this Inverness cape, and tested a number of spots on it—I found they were caused by sulphuric acid—I also examined Mrs. Peacock's bonnet, and found sulphuric acid spots on that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When did you examine this cape? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On the Thursday after this took place—some of those large spots have been caused by coming in contact with the bonnet—they have been wrapped up together.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LEWIS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> were there not other spots quite independent of those? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—there may have been seven or eight—my tests clearly indicate that they were made by sulphuric acid.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Look at that handkerchief, do you notice anything there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; there are spots here—I have no doubt they are caused by sulphuric acid, but I could not say positively without testing them—this quill has had acid upon it; it is quite charred.</p>

                  </hi>, M.R.C.S. I am a physician, and live at 11, Hart-street, Bloomsbury—about half-past 10, on 6th January, I was called to a baker's shop in Museum-street—I found a lady there suffering a great deal of pain—her face was excoriated and discoloured, and her eyes spasmodically closed—that was caused by some acid—she was taken to the hospital by my instructions—I examined this cape, and found some red spots on the pocket and down the front, which there had been an attempt to obliterate by the application of an alkaline fluid—the cape was damp, but that dampness was not, in my opinion, caused by rain.</p>

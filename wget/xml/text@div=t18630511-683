On 14th April I saw the prisoner served by my wife—I saw her examining a coin, and she said it looked queer—she went to try it in the detector, and I saw the prisoner reach his hand over to get it away from her—I immediately went and took the florin from my wife—I had been looking for the prisoner—I had seen him in my shop about a week before—on a Sunday evening about dusk, when a half—crown was passed to my wife—I kept that by me—when I took the florin from my wife, I put it in my pocket, and told the prisoner I should keep it—he said I was not to do that for he should be the loser, his governor had just given it to him—I said, "Send the governor up to me then"—he said, "I shall," and left the shop—I followed him and gave him into custody, and gave the policeman the half-crown and the florin.</p>

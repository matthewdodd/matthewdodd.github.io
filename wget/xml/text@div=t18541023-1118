                  </hi>. I am cashier to Messrs. Dawson and Son, news-agents—the prisoner has been in their employ from about the middle of July—his duty, as advertising clerk, upon receiving advertisements, whether paid for or not, was to make an entry in this book, which I produce—we call it "The Advertising Day Book"—he would post all those that were not paid for at the time—if he received any money, he would pay it to me, making an entry in the cash book—what he would pay for Mr. Nicholson I do not know—I should merely take Mr. Nicholson's money as the whole—I have no entry of his of 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on 2nd Sept—he enters the sum received in this cash book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is his duty to enter in the cash book all sums he pays over—there is no entry of 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. received and paid over to me on 2nd Sept.—he has entered no cash on 5th Sept.—there is no entry on the 8th—on the 13th, there is an entry of 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but no entry of 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—on 2nd Sept. he makes this entry in the day book, "J. A." Walworth, Mark Lane, "meaning the name of the paper—"Sept 4th, 18th, Oct 3, To Millers and others;" that is the nature of the advertisement—on that day there is 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; it has evidently first been 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and altered—that is not carried out into the ledger—it has not been posted, but he makes a note in the margin, "Cash, 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.;" it had been 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he was obliged to make an entry to distinguish those paid and those not—he does not enter it in the cash book.</p>

Nature of Advertisement—To Millers, or Millers and Bakers;" there is a note of having received 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. here.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at Stratford. I remember calling at the office of Messrs.

John Bowman and May, The prisoner was in their employ—they are warehouse-men in Wood-street, Cheapside—they purchase packing canvass of Mr. Crichton—on the 26th of October I made a purchase to 99 pieces of hessing canvass, of Gainsford, Mr. Crichton's assistant—here is the invoice I re<lb></lb>ceived—Messrs. Bowman and May do not deal in it, but had it to pack their goods—this was deposited on the first floor, at the back of the pack<lb></lb>ing counter—every one in the house would have access to it—this is the piece of canvass—it comes in rolls as this is—there are marks upon them by the manufacturer, not by me—I suppose it is worth about 6 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., a yard—I do not recollect what I gave for it—it is worth more than 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard—it was all marked with K and a diamond.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Crichton—he carries on business in Pancras-lane. I remember effecting a sale with Sidell, on the part of his employers, of nine pieces of hessing in October last—this is the bill of parcels that I made out—this is one piece which I sold on that occasion.</p>

I came home to breakfast, about eight o'clock, the prisoner was there then in the room - I went to work again, right opposite the alley, and Pearce came over to me; I went up stairs, and missed these things. When the prisoner was taken; the officer asked if I knew him, I said that was the very man - he said the small clothes were not mine. The duplicate was found on him.</p>

Murray's box is small, and my husband locked his things up in my box - the prisoner saw them locked up; he slept in a bed by himself, and went away about nine o'clock in the morning of the robbery, with a bundle which seemed larger a great deal than what he brought with him; he asked me about half-past eight o'clock for a pen, ink, and the number of my house; he then went up stairs for three quarters of an hour, and gave me the key of the room, and said,</p>

            . I am an officer. I was on duty in Mile-end-road, about half-past one o'clock in the morning, of the 11th of February, and seeing the prisoner come up the road, I asked his business - he gave no satisfactory answer; I thought he answered the description of a man suspected of several robberies; and took him. As I took him to Bow-street, Pearce came and said he had broken open her box, and stolen the clothes - I found a tool on him, which corresponded with the marks on the box. I found the duplicate of the drawers on him.</p>

                  </hi> I am a jeweller, and live at No.18, Ludgate-strect—it is my dwelling-house, and is in the parish of St. Gregory by St. Paul—the pri<lb></lb>soner was in my service from the 28th of Nov., 1844, to the 8th of Sept., 1845—this gold watch is mine—I know it by a mark inside in my own writing—I saw it last in the early part of the summer of 1845—I recollect then having it in my stock—there is an entry of it in my stock-book, which I have here—it has never been sold—I missed it some time in the summer of 1845—inquiry was made about it—the prisoner was aware that it was missing—it cost me 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—these diamond studs are mine—I know them by the style, and by giving out the stones to be made up by the workman, and seeing them when they came in—I have no hesitation in saying they are mine—they were missed at the latter end of the summer—they had been in my stock that year, and were not sold—the prisoner was aware of their being missed—more inquiry was made about them than anything that was missed—they are worth about 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I know this emerald ring by the style of it, it was in my possession up to about July, 1845—that was also missed, and inquiries made respecting it, to the prisoner's knowledge—it is worth about 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the 27th of Dec, at a quarter after nine o'clock in the evening, I was on duty in St. James's-square, in the enclosure, which is part of my beat—I went to the summer-house there, and found the prisoner standing up by the side of the wall—I asked what he did there—he said he came there to sleep—I asked him by whose authority—he made no reply—I took him into custody, and sprang my rattle—assistance came, and I gave the prisoner to another constable—he must have got over the railings, as the gates were all locked—I saw some lead lying on the floor, and on the bench of the summer-house—I took possession of it—another per-son, who was lying down, who I had not seen before, got up, and ran when I sprung my rattle—I have never seen him since—I examined the top of the summer-house, and found lead gone from it—I have gone there almost every night for the last three months—I never found anybody there before, or missed any lead—I found this knife on the prisoner—(<hi rend="italic">produced.</hi>)</p>

                  </hi>. I am collector of rates and surveyor to William Edger-ton, Esq., and others, trustees of St. James's-square. On Tuesday afternoon, the 27th of Dec., I passed through the square nearly at dusk, between three and four o'clock—I observed the summer-house, the gates of the square, and every thing was quite safe then—about two years ago the lead was stolen off the roof, and new was put on—I had part of it painted, and have every reason to believe this is it—one piece still remains, which exactly corresponds with this.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Kent. I heard some-body in the house. I called out, who is there; I then heard a person walk a-cross the house. He opened the door to come out; when he saw me he returned back again. I told him not to resist, for I would take him; he surrendered. I went into the house, and found sixteen chimney tiles lying upon the ground, and an old broken knife.</p>

               <p>Q. What excuse did he make for being there?</p>
               <p>Sayer. He said he was let in by two men with leather aprons on. He was willing to go with me; he said he was overcome with liquor, and was put in there by two men to sleep; and he did not know how long he had been there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I was much in liquor. I intended to go to work. I was with two brother labourers. I fell down by a wind-mill. Two men put me into this place, and told me I might lie down to sleep, and rest myself. One of these men waked me about six o'clock. The man said he had something against me. I said, I was sorry for that. I said I would go with them where they pleased.</p>

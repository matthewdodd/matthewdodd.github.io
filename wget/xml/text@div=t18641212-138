                  </hi>. I am a labourer, of 52, St. Andrew's-road—last Saturday night, about 12 o'clock, I saw the prisoner and two others pulling an old woman about—I requested them to leave off—they did so, and the other two got in front me, and said they would give me something for myself if I did not move off—the prisoner came behind me, and struck me with something on my neck, and when I turned round he was pulling my handkerchief out of my pocket—the blow made my ear very sore, but it did not bleed, and it was all over mud—I have not seen my handkerchief since.</p>

I keep the Turk's Head, Blue-anchor-road, Bermondsey—I have a concert at my house on Saturday evenings—it generally begins I about half past 8, and I close the room at half-past 11, and clear out before I 12—last Saturday evening the prisoner came with other friends about I twenty minutes to 9; among them were two females—the prisoner was I there up <hi rend="italic">to</hi> the end, and I cleared out about twenty minutes to 12—my I establishment in Bermondsey is about a mile and a quarter, or nearly so, from St. George's Church.</p>

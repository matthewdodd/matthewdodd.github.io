On 11th July, I took the prisoner into custody in the Old Kent-road, and told him he was charged with taking a towel from a parcel going to Brighton—he said, "I must acknowledge that I have taken that; I am very sorry for it"—I asked him where it was—he said at home, and he would go and fetch it—I went with him to his house, found the towel, and also some envelopes and pencils with the Com<lb></lb>pany's mark on them.</p>

On 7th July, I received a parcel from Mrs. Hawkins, directed to Mr. Hawkins, and which was to be delivered at Brighton—there were several packages; one was in a very loose condition—the prisoner weighed them, and I left them in his charge—one parcel consisted of bedding.</p>

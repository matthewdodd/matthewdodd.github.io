The prisoner was in my service about two months—I have missed a great deal of worsted and silk—on the 31st of October I received information, and on the 1st of November, as soon as all the men were gone, as he thought, the prisoner cut off some plat-leads from another man's loom—Campion tole me of it—I ran after the prisoner to a marine store-shop in King-street, and collared him, and took these three plat<lb></lb>leads out of his hand just as he was going in—I said, "You vagabond, now I have caught you"—I gave him in charge—he had taken his own entirely away, and put brickbats in the place of them—1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is the value of them, but they cost me more.</p>

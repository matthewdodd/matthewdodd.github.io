They met me about the bottom of the pond. Marshall came up first, and held a pistol to my head, and said, sir, your money, Dunk came on the other side me. Marshal took my watch and some silver, a pinchbeck metal one, chain of the same, and a seal with the impression of Mercury on it. The key and book were gilded. Dunk took from my left breeches pocket, half a guinea. They said, D - n you, you have more money, and if I would not hold my peace, they would do me farther injury. I said, gentlemen, I cannot say what money I have got. I never am without some. You are both looking for it, take what you can get. After they had done, they said, Go along, Sir. I went towards the wilderness, and came home directly. After that, I went and told Sir

             what had happened. He sent four men with me to search the Ambury. We searched, but could not find any of them. On the Sunday after, I was sent for to come on the Monday morning to Sir John. I went. The prisoner and Marshal had been taken two days before. They were brought there. Sir John asked me, if I could swear to either of them. I said, I was pretty sure they were the men, but I did not swear to them till I had recollected myself. They were in soldiers jackets when they robbed me, and I took particular notice of their faces and voices. When I gave information of them, I gave an account of the colour of their clothes. Marshal told every particular of the robbery, and where the woman at the bar sold the watch. He said, they met me about the middle of the park, and that he took from me my watch, and three shillings in silver; and Dunk took the half guinea: and that they saw me afterwards going home towards Rosamond's pond. He said, the woman sold the watch to some Jew in Duke's-Place, and the prisoner and he went to some public-house there, while she sold it; and that she told him, she could dispose of the King's crown, if she had it there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see your watch again?</p>
               <p>Read. No, I never did. The woman was brought there. She at first, when charged with it, denied it, and at last said, if she knew where she sold it, she would tell me; but she did not know the house. She admitted she had sold it. I had described the watch to her. It was engraved with a basket of flowers on it.</p>

My husband and I were full of conversation. I said to him, there are a couple of men on the other side the pond. As we went on, I observed them following us. I said, they will hear what we are talking about. When Mr. Clark came within about ten yards of this side the gate that leads into the grove, all on a sudden the two men surrounded us. They bid us stop. My husband said, what must we stop for? They pulled out two bludgeons, and held one over my husband's head, and the other over mine. One of them said, D - n you, stop, or I'll knock your brains out. I burst out a crying, and said, I was in a great deal of trouble, having lost my children, and begged they would not hurt me. One of them put his hand into my left hand pocket, and took out seven silver tea-spoons, a pair of pearl necklaces, a red and white handkerchief, and out of my right-hand pocket, they took out between three and four shillings, and two or three pennyworth of halfpence. I took a quarter guinea out of my pocket, and put it in my mouth, and looked in one of their faces, fearing he should see me, and take it out, which made me take more notice of him. I saw the other man take my husband's watch, by giving it a jerk. They took what money he had in his pocket, which was not much. They took a parcel of keys from him, and gave them to him again, saying, they are of no use. After this, my husband pulled off his hat, and said, I thank you, gentlemen, for not hurting my wife. After they were gone, my husband ran, thinking to get to them before they got out of the park, but he missed them. They turned as if they were going down the Queen's-park.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of them was it you took particular notice of, him that robbed you, or him that robbed your husband?</p>
               <p>A. Clark. Of him that robbed my husband. I saw him since at the Brown-Bear, Bow-street; that is the man now at the bar. He had just such a coat and waistcoat on then as he has now. My husband went to Sir

I pointed him out myself, from among several people that were in the room. I did not chose at that time to swear to him; and as my husband had pointed him out two or three days before I saw him, I thought there was no occasion for me to swear. I knew him directly, though his dress was not the same there. Then he had a scarlet waistcoat on, not the same as now. I saw my necklace and Cornelian seal at Sir

I asked him if he was a soldier; he said, No. I asked him whose clothes they were; he said, a friend of his. I asked his name; he, at last, said Marshal. I found this seal on the mantle-piece there, which Mrs. Clark's husband said was to his watch when they robbed him. Dunk said, there was a necklace at one Flumery's. I went there, and found it.

               <p>Marshall. It is two months ago, and more; we took a shilling or two, I cannot tell rightly how much.</p>
               <p>Q. How was you dressed?</p>
               <p>Marshall. I was in the same dress I have now (Old soldiers cloaths.) I think Dunk was the same; I was a soldier at that time. Dunk had been a soldier, but he was discharged. After we had done, we came to Dunk's room in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177001170033"></xptr> Westminster. Paterson was in the room when we came in. She took the cardinals, and went and pawned them; one to a pawnbroker in Prince's-street, for 7 s. and 6 d. or 7 s. and she pawned another at another place.</p>

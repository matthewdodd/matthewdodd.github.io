               <p>Holloway. It was two or three Streets.</p>
               <p>Court. So you delivered it to Blankflower?</p>
               <p>Holloway. Yes, and he carried it into one George Wood's Yard, and there he poured it into an Apron and a Sheet; I was there and held up one of the Corners .</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Hudson?</p>
               <p>Holloway. Hudson was there too; then we took and carried it into Petticoat-square, and we sold it to one Alvarez, a Jew.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you sell it for?</p>
               <p>Holloway . We sold it for 5 l. and the Money was shared between Hudson and myself, and Blankflower had 18 d. of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How came Blankflower to have so little a Share?</p>
               <p>Holloway. If he had carried the Cannister away to hide any where, we should have paid him for it; he had 18 d. and Part of 2 s. worth of Punch.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you meet with Blankflower ?</p>
               <p>Holloway . In Church-lane near Rag-fair , at a Distiller's , where we use to frequent to and fro.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any body at Hurst's House ?</p>
               <p>Holloway . I saw a Man go up Stairs with a Candle , I can't say it was Mr Hurst; Mr Hurst said he lost two Cannisters ; he told me he had got one, but that I did not see.</p>
               <p>Q. These were large Cannisters, how did you carry them?</p>
               <p>Holloway. I flung away the Top, and carried it as well as I could.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any great Coat?</p>
               <p>Holloway. No, I carried it open, it was dark.</p>
               <p>Q. to Holloway by Hudson, the Prisoner. Was the Latch within Side, or without Side?</p>
               <p>Holloway. Without Side.</p>

               <p>Beck. It was about ten o'Clock at Night; it was about two Minutes before the Things were lost, according to the Account the Prosecutor gives.</p>
               <p>Court to Blankflower. Now is the Time to make your Defence.</p>
               <p>Blankflower. Holloway asked me if I would earn 6 d. I was to hold this Cannister for him; then he said if I would carry it a little farther, he would give me a Shilling more; now, says he, if you will not carry the Cannister away, I will give you nothing ; so I carried it away after I had emptied the Tea into a Woman's Lap.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, V</hi> 41). I went to Mr. Lyon's wharf, Wandsworth, on 4th Sept., between eleven and twelve o'clock—I saw Napper come from the wharf, with a wagon loaded with coals, drawn by three horses—I and Pearce followed it—it stopped at the Crown public-house, at Morden, about four miles from Mr. Lyon's wharf—I know Millard; he is ostler at the Crown—when Napper got there he baited his horses—he had some refreshment, and he got on the wagon, and drew an empty corn<lb></lb>sack on the top of it—he took pieces of coals from different sacks, and put them into it—he then got down, and went into a shed, close by where the wagon stood—he remained there about five minutes, when he came back with Millard—Napper got on the wagon—he took the sack off that he had filled, and gave it to Millard, who went away with it, towards the stable—Pearce and I had been concealed behind a hedge—we jumped over, and took both the prisoners—I followed Millard, and saw the sack close to the stable, which belongs to the Crown—there is a privy nearly close to the stable—I found Millard there—I said I wanted him, for receiving these coals of Napper, knowing them to be stolen—I pointed out the sack to him—he said he was very sorry, and hoped I would not be hard with him—I asked him if he had charge of the stable which was close by—he said he had—I asked him if he had any sacks or coals in that stable belonging to Mr.Marfleet—he said, "No"—I said, "I must go and see"—he gave me the key—I went in, and found a sack and a nose-bag, marked "Marfleet," in the manger—Pearce took Napper, and delivered him to me—I took the corn-sack and the bag—I took the prisoners to the station—as we were going, Napper said it was the first time he ever took any coals, and Millard said it was the first time he ever received any.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Ewell. I am a coal-merchant—I purchase coals in the London market—they are then conveyed to Mr. Lyon's wharf, at Wandsworth, and remain there till I draw them away—Napper was my car<lb></lb>man four or five years—I had coals to deliver on 4th Sept., to Mr. Stowell—it was Napper's duty to go with my wagon and horses to the wharf, to fetch three tons of coals, and to deliver them—he had been accustomed to fill the sacks; we allowed him to do so when we were busy—he knew the quantity of coals that were to be delivered to Mr. Stowel, and he had a ticket—it was thirty sacks—I was not at the wharf—between six and seven o'clock that evening, on my return home, I found my wagon in my yard, and thirty sacks of coals in it—they were weighed in my presence—only one sack weighed the right weight—the others were between 50lbs and 60lbs. over weight—this sack that had the coals in was produced to me—I had seen it before—I exa<lb></lb>mined the coals that were in it; they were of the same description as mine—Napper had no orders to deliver coals at the Crown Inn that day—I had never supplied Mr. Parsons with any corn—he delivered some straw to me last year; that is the only transaction we ever had—this sack and nose-bag are mine, here is my name on them.</p>

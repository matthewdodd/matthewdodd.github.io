Peacock was in my employ for about three months as foreman—in consequence of information I received I spoke to Hack and Wilkinson, and the prisoners were appre<lb></lb>hended—Peacock was not authorized to sell on a Sunday—I do not open shop at all on a Sunday, at any time—if a regular customer sends, I may accommodate him, but then I expect to be applied to, before I allow him to serve—when I engaged him, he asked too much wages, and I said, "Remember, there is no Sunday work."</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector of the police. In consequence of information, I watched the shop on Sunday, the 25th of January, I was on the opposite side of the street, from between six and seven o'clock till half-past eight o'clock—I saw the prisoner Fairey come opposite Mr. Putley's shop just before it struck eight by the church clock—he stood near the curb, looking towards the door, till half-past eight o'clock—he waited there half an hour—he neither rung nor knocked at the door—I observed Peacock open the door—he popped out, and took a hat-box, which Fairey had in his hand, and a basket—he turned into the shop, and was out again in a moment—he handed the basket to Fairey, who walked as fast as he could down towards London-bridge, till he came to Chapel-court—he turned up Chapel-court, and I apprehended him—I laid hold of the basket, and said, "It is all right"—I said to the constable behind me, "Take this man in charge"—I found a belly of pork very wet, as if it had just come from the pickling-tub, a piece of beef, and a piece of suet—I sent him to the station-house, and went directly to Mr. Putley's house—I rang the bell four times before it was answered, and then Peacock opened the door—I said, "We want you, I must see Mr. Putley directly"—he said he bad sold the meat—I had told him I wanted him for robbing his master—I said, "If you have sold it, what does it weigh?"—he said, "It weighed ten pounds"—that be had sold it at 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per lb. and there was the money on the desk—there was half-a-crown, two shillings, and a sixpence on the desk—I looked at the scale, and it was quite dry and clean—the prosecutor came down directly, and I took Peacock into custody—at the watch-house, Fairey said the meat was paid for—I asked him how much—he said, it weighed seven pounds, and he had given half-a-crown for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was there not a cloth in the basket? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was a butcher's woollen apron—he said at Union Hall next day, that he put the meat on the apron to be weighed, that it might not dirty the scale, but he did not say so at the station-house—I had not dirty the scale, of the meat to him, as weighing seven pounds—he said, "The meat"—Putley was in the shop all the time I was questioning Peacock, and must have heard all, I should think.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 3, Tower-street, Seven Dials, in the parish of St. Giles's. I am a steel-worker. On Saturday, the 18th of October, about twelve o'clock at night, we heard somebody in the work-shop—a young man was with me who works for me—my family consists of my wife and child, and a servant girl—I had made the house safe my<lb></lb>self at eleven o'clock—the workshop is situated at the back of the pre<lb></lb>mises, not on the ground floor, but higher—there are four windows to it, which open—I fastened them about nine o'clock—my young man went into the workshop on hearing the noise—we have a room even with the workshop—I did not go into the workshop—I fastened the window with a large wooden button, which keeps two close—there is a tiling by the win<lb></lb>dow—a person could get into the window from the tiling—the window goes on hinges—it does not lift up—when I left the workshop at nine o'clock, I left a quantity of unfinished work on my bench—large button-hook han<lb></lb>dles and ivory—I made my way to the street door—I found it safely locked and bolted—I went into the workshop about an hour after and ob<lb></lb>served a 9-inch file sticking into a drawer, as if to prize it open—the file had broken in doing it—the file was mine—I had left it on the bench—I walked farther into the shop, and found a square of glass broken in one of the windows, which was open—that was not broken at nine o'clock when I left the workshop—a hand put into that square would turn the button—I then went into the tower shop on the ground floor—they communicate by a step ladder—I found a padlock broken off the cellar door—I keep my ivory in that cellar—the door had been opened, and all the ivory was gone—the box it was kept in was empty—there might be three or four dozen pieces gone—I then made to the street door, and found it fast as before—I called a policeman to have the place searched—the policeman did not come—my young man went into the front parlour—the street door commands a view of the parlour—on his going into the parlour, I hallooed out "Police"—my young man opened a large cupboard door, and I saw the prisoner in the cupboard—he worked for me as journeyman for four or five weeks—I have not a doubt of his being the man—he got out of the cupboard—I said, "You d—d scoundrel, what brings you here at this time on Sunday morning?"—he said, "I came here for my wages"—I said it was a pretty time to come for wages—he came to the street door while I was calling "Policeman," and knocked me down on the pavement—I followed him, but lost sight of him in Monmouth-street—on returning</p>

               <p>to my house, in one corner of the cupboard where he was concealed, I found about three dozen pieces of ivory tied up in a handkerchief—I can swear, on my solemn oath, it is my property—it is ivory I had cut up myself—it had been in my cellar.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Simmons. On Sa<lb></lb>turday, the 18th of October, about twelve o'clock at night, I was with Mr. Simmons, in his room, and had been with him since I left work, which was about eight o'clock—while I was sitting with him, I was alarmed by a noise in the workshop—I went there, but did not take a candle with me—I heard a noise of foosteps hurrying down stairs, when I went into the shop—I came out again, and told my master somebody was there—I got a light, and went down into the front parlour—master was with me, and told me to open the cupboard door, which was shut—I opened it, and found the prisoner in the cupboard—master asked what business he had there—he said he came for his wages—he passed me, knocked Mr. Simmons down, and ran away—I went into the workshop with master afterwards—I found the window unbuttoned, and a square of glass broken quite close to the button—I knew the prisoner before—he worked there about five weeks—I have not a doubt of his being the man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman.

Starr-street, St. George's, on Easter Sunday, 16th April, the prisoner lived in the same house, in the back-room—she was living with my brother—between eight and nine in the morning I heard "Murder "cried twice—I went into the room in which the prisoner and my brother were—the prisoner had nothing in her hand when I went in—my brother was lying in bed, undressed, and the prisoner was standing up by the sideboard, and she took a great conch shell off it and hit at my brother—it did not hit him, it hit the bedstead and broke it—I said, "Lizzie, do not use such awful weapons, you will do murder"—she said she would kill any b----that entered the room—my husband came to the door at that moment and said to me, "Polly, come out for God's sake, you will be killed"—with that the prisoner took a quart bottle off the sideboard and made a blow at my husband—I caught her arm and broke the force of the blow or it would have killed him on the spot—the bottle hit him on the head and cut his head—he went to the hospital, the nurse dressed his head and told him to come again in the afternoon, but his head did not become worse and he did not go—he afterwards became worse, and died in the hos<lb></lb>pital on the Friday week after.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at the London Hospital—the de-ceased came there on 26th April—he had a lacerated scalp wound about an inch long, extending to the bone, and also erysipelas, for which I took him in—it was such a wound as might have been produced by a glass bottle—the erysipelas was recent—he died on the 28th of inflammation of the mem<lb></lb>branes of the brain supervening on the wound—in other respects he appeared a healthy man.</p>

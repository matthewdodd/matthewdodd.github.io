                  </hi>. I am a merchant, of 8, Lime-street-square—on 10th August I was at the Black wall railway-station, about ten minutes past 4—I was going by the express train to Hampstead—there was a considerable crowd there—I felt a pressure against me as I was going towards the carriages—several persons turned back as if they were going the same way—the prisoner is the person who pressed against me—at the same moment I heard a click, looked down, and saw the prisoner with his fingers holding the bow of my watch—I called out to him, "You have stolen my watch"—I directly seized hold of him—he said, "You are mistaken, it is not me," but I never let go of him until I gave him in charge—he struggled at first—my watch is worth 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I saw the policeman pick it up about three yards from the place where I first took the prisoner—this is it.</p>

SMITH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did this robbery take place downstairs where the tickets are taken? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, on the platform—I had got my ticket—this occurred at a very narrow part of the platform—it was very crowded that day—I believe there was a fair or something going on down the line but it is always too much crowded; the place is not above three feet wide there; we have made frequent complaints to the directors about it—the lines of rail are on one side, and a wall on the other—the people were all crowding together to get into the carriages—the prisoner was in front of me—I was not pressing against him, but he against me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a porter at the station in Fenchurch-street—on the afternoon of 10th August I saw the prisoner there—I saw him drop something on the step of a carriage—I afterwards saw the policeman pick it up, and it turned out to be this watch.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was he getting into the carriage? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, he was on the platform close by it—I was behind him—there was a crowd—I had fetched the policeman—it is my business to open and shut the carriages—there was something going on at Hackney Wick that afternoon, a wrestle or something of that sort, and there were a few extra persons there on that account.</p>

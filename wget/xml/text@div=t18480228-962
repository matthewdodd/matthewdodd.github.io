                  </hi> I am servant to Mr. Powell, of Lambeth. On 8th of Feb. the prisoner came for a pennyworth of milk, and gave me half-a-crown—I put it to my teeth; it went like a bit of sand—I sent it next door for change, which I gave the prisoner—the half-crown was afterwards brought back—I could tell it was the same by two marks I made by biting it—the prisoner came again for some more milk—I said, "You gave me a bad half-crown"—he said, "Did I?" and ran away—a man in the yard ran after him—he was caught, a policeman was fetched, and he was given in charge—I marked the half-crown again and gave it to the policeman—this is it—here are the two little dents I made with my teeth.</p>
               <p>---- <hi rend="smallCaps">QUADIN.</hi> I followed the prisoner, caught him, and gave him in charge—I asked him for the change of the half-crown—he said he gave it to his brother—he wanted me to let him go to his brother's to get the change.</p>

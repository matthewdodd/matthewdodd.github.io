                  </hi>. I live in Little George-street, in the parish of St. Matthew, Bethnal-green. I let out the second floor room, and keep all the rest myself—there is a back and a front room on the ground floor—I am a weaver—on the evening of the 2nd of Janu<lb></lb>ary, I was up stairs with all my family, on the third floor—there was nobody left down stairs—I was the last person that had been below—I left the doors and windows perfectly fast at as near six o'clock as possible—the windows were fastened inside—the window which was broken open has two sliding bolts, which were fastened—there is a shutter inside that, and that was put up—the doors were all fast—my son Joshua went down about nine o'clock—he was the first that went down—in consequence of what he said, I went down, and found the back window broken open—some of the glass was broken, window opened, and the shutter pulled out—I found the shutter outside in the yard—it is an in<lb></lb>side shutter—the back door was also open, which had been fastened with two bolts inside—I found them unbolted—I missed two cloaks, a waist<lb></lb>coat, a pair of trowsers, a coat; and a time-piece, which had been on the mantel-piece in the front room, when I went up stairs—there was room enough for a grown-up person to get in at the window.</p>

                  </hi>. On the night of the 2nd of January, I was up stairs with my father. I went down about nine o'clock, looked round, and saw the chairs misplaced, things pulled out, and lying about the carpet—the back window and door were open—I alarmed my father and mother, who came down—I found a bolt broken off the window, and part of the window-frame—several matches had been lighted about the place, and the property missing—I went in search of the prisoner afterwards—I was pre<lb></lb>sent at the office on Saturday, the 3rd of January, when the prisoner was in custody—a little boy came to the door, while she was in the lock-up place—he brought her some bread and butter—he stood at the door, and gave it in—he was not let inside—he was on one side of the door, and she on the other—I stood outside, close to him—he saw me—I could hear every thing he said—there were two or three penons waiting about, within hear<lb></lb>ing—I saw her take the bread and butter from the boy, and she appeared to know him; she saw him—one of the officers shut the door, and went away—I remained there, and the boy said, "Mary, keep your spirits up, for <hi rend="italic">Bob</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi> says, if it comes to any thing, they will get you counsel"—he called her Mary or Eliza—I am not now certain which it was—but afterwards one of them came and called her Eliza—but whether that boy said Mary or Eliza, I cannot say—she asked him what was done with the other things; he told her they were all put away, for they were taken to some place in Tooley-street—and said <hi rend="italic">Bob</hi> had got 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi> had got 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.,—she told him she had torn the border off the shawl, and the boy said that</p>

                  </hi>. I apprehended the prisoner at the pawnbroker's shop—he delivered me this cloak—I asked her at the station-house how she became possessed of it—she said a young man, named Jones, gave it to her in Half-Nichol-street, Bethnal-green—I asked her how he was dressed—she said he had a fustian coat—then the said, "O no, the young man who gave it to me is not there, he is in Brick-lane;" and she would not tell me any more about it.</p>

             owed me 2l. 12s. on the 22d of December; the prisoner never accounted to me for that sum, which he should have done on the Saturday; here is his book, and an account of monies owing to me - he should cross out those which are paid - Jones' name is not marked out - it is entered forward and as cash due on the 1st of January.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Whose handwriting is that entry? A. Mine - we sometimes settled on other evenings besides Saturday - I heard of its being paid two or three days after he left me - the account of debts remaining due on the 1st of January was made about a fortnight after - we examined it together - that is the only balance we ever made; I collected from the book what appeared due, and he put it down.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. This is not the list that was made from the books, it is a copy? A. There was another - I wrote part of that myself - this is a copy of it.</p>
               <p>ALICE JONES. I live at the British Hotel, Jermyn-street. On the 22d of December the prisoner brought a bill of 3l.; I paid him three sovereigns; here is his receipt; (read) Murray, after Christmas, brought me a bill of 2l. 12s.; which surprised me.</p>

            . I was in Mr. Murray's employ - the prisoner settled his accounts every Saturday evening - I was generally present - he used on Saturdays to write on a paper what he had received in the week, for Murray to enter it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you ever receive money? A. Yes - I generally paid it on the day I received it; and he sometimes has asked the prisoner for 10l. or so, on account; he entered what he received in a memorandum book - I sometimes paid money for Murray, and gave him the balance.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. There was no account kept of what I paid - he would not allow me to keep an account; so I was forced to keep one in a small book.</p>

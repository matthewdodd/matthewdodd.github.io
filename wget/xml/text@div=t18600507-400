                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Black, of Billiter-street—I went out on 1st May, left my door securely locked, and took the key with me; I had it in my hand when I returned—I was gone about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, the door of my room was wide open when I returned, and the prisoner coming out—I would not let him pass me, he wanted to escape, and he was speaking something that I did not understand—I scuffled with him down the stairs and called "Thief"—a young man named John Stainton who was in the house assisted me—when a policeman came, I went into my room—I missed 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. off my drawers by the side of a little tea-caddy—the 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was rather plain on the <hi rend="italic">wreath</hi> side—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

                  </hi>. I was in this house where the last witness lodges on 1st May last, and heard a cry of "Stop thief"—I went out, and saw the prisoner escaping down the landing—he tried to get away, when he was on the landing he was rather too quick for me, but in running down the stairs he slipped and fell—I ran down after him, caught him, and gave him in charge—I kept him till the policeman came.</p>

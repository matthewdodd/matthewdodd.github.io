            . I am servant to Mrs. Young, of No. 3, Bunhill-row, which is about thirty yards from Mr. Harley's house, on the opposite side. On Sunday, the 9th of July, at twenty minutes to six o'clock, I was standing at the parlour window, which was open, and saw the prisoner Wilson and another come out of the public-house opposite - they walked to Harley's door, then shook hands, and parted; Wilson came on the opposite side by me, continued there two or three minutes, when Walker and another man came out of the public-house - they went and stood at Harley's door, and Wilson crossed over to them; I then saw Walker take something out of his pocket, and put under the door - it did not appear to open it, and he took out something else, which opened the door - I immediately went from the window to the street-door, and saw one of them knock violently at the door three or four times, though they had it open - the three men still stood there with the door open, but they saw me looking hard at them - they had not gone in; I immediately ran across to the public-house which they had come out of, and gave an alarm, but they said, Nonsense; I came out, and missed them all; I went to Mr. Dix, who lives next door to Harley, at the corner house - he came with me directly to the house - we found the door shut - Dix rang both the bells, and we heard some one run down stairs - the prisoner, Wilson, opened the door to Mr. Dix, and asked his business - Mr. Dix said, "My business is with you," and immediately collared him - Walker then rushed out from behind Wilson; I hallooed Stop thief! and he was caught by a young man at the opposite corner, without being out of my sight at all.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. They knocked at the door? A. Yes, when they saw me observing them - I missed them from the door when I came out of the public-house - I only went in and came out directly; they had time to run into the house while I was in there; Mr. Dix was at the door within five minutes; the public-house is not more than four yards from the prosecutor's; I saw Mrs. Dix first, and she called him.</p>

               <p>Q. You had not lent it to any person to make use of, had you - A. No. I saw it in my stable myself about three o'clock; I missed it about seven o'clock the next morning, and a cart, saddle, bridle, collar, a pair of reins. On the next morning I enquired at several places. I had information on the Wednesday evening.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was the 19th - A. Tuesday was the 19th, and on the Wednesday I received information that the mare was in the custody of Mr. Jaques. On Friday I saw the mare in Mr. Jaques's possession.</p>
               <p>Q. How had you left the stable - A. Locked up; the lock was broken. When I went the next morning I found all these articles gone, as well as the mare. The mare is now in the possession of Mr. Jaques. I went to Shadwell office; they persuaded me to prosecute the man. The mare I saw in the possession of Mr. Jaques, is my own mare.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any mark upon it - A. Yes, a faint white mark upon the forehead. I had it about four months. I had used her in my cart near to the very day. I am quite certain it is the very same. I only know that the lock was broken, and the mare and harness was gone.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Stepney-green. I was on duty on the 20th of this month, between the hours of three and four in the morning, the prisoner was coming along Stepney-green with a horse and a cart; he was going towards Mile-end-road. I asked him what he had got in that cart.</p>
               <p>Q. What induced you to ask him what he had got in the cart - A. Because I thought he had something he should not have; he told me all was right. I was not satisfied with that. I ran after the cart. I then asked him what he had got in the cart; he said, flax. I followed him along Stepney-green about seven or eight hundred yards, or more. After following of him I asked him where he brought it from. He said, Limehouse-stairs. He told me he was going to take it to Birdcage-walk.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is Birdcage-walk - A. One part is on Bethnal-green and the other part in Hackney-road. I followed him, and I went and acquainted Mr. Jaques, the constable of the night, of him. Mr. Jaques was in the watchhouse when I called him. The cart came very near to the watchhouse. Mr. Jaques came out of the watchhouse after him. We brought him back to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the horse and cart - A. We put the horse and the property he had got, in the engine-house, adjoining the watchhouse. It was locked up there. The cart was put in Mr. Charrington's turning; the mare and the property in the engine-house. The night constable has the key of that in the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a horse or a mare - A. A mare. I observed particularly that.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the harness put up with the property - A. Every thing together. We never took it off. Mr. Jaques took care of the mare. I had nothing more to do with it.</p>
               <p>MR. JAQUES. I was constable of the night. On this occasion I was called upon by Hollingsood, between five and six in the morning, to watch him. We went about sixty yards: I then took the prisoner by the collar, on the road. The prisoner was then sitting in the cart, driving it along the road. I caught him by the collar, and asked him what he had got in his cart. He said it contained flax and twine, he was going to Birdcage-walk with it. I took him to the watchhouse, and locked him up, as he did not give me a satisfactory account of himself. I took the property out of the cart, and put it into the engine-house, likewise the mare, and locked it up. Then after we came to the office we put the mare into the livery stable. On Thursday, Mr. Pritchard came to my house. I refused shewing him the mare that day, as the prisoner said it was his own. The prisoner was then committed. Mr. Pritchard came again on the Friday morning, and the mare proved to be his property. The mare and the harness Mr. Pritchard said was his property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The cart and horse was lent me by a person of the name of Carrol, whose stable the horse was in, as I understood. We had a glass of gin together at the Basing-house. I agreed to meet him at the Nag's Head, Old-street-road. He met me there, and there I agreed for the loan of the horse.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. John Weaver, an eating-house keeper in High-Holborn. On the 14th of November I put one shilling into the till, which I had just taken of a customer—there was nothing in that part of the till but a bag—there was some copper in the other part—I shut the till and went into the street, to speak to a person about some repairs which were doing to the house, and on my return the prisoner was leaning over the counter, with the till half open, the bag in his left hand, and the shilling between the thumb and fingers of his right hand—I collared him, and asked what business he had with the bag—he said he did not know—I asked what he did with the shilling—he said, after some hesitation, that he wanted change for a shilling—I gave him into custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is your master here? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—there was no mark on the shilling, but being no other in the till, I am positive it is the same—it is a shilling much worn—I was not absent more than five or six minutes—I was speaking to a person next door—I did not see the prisoner go in—when I went in his back was towards me—if any one had gone in then, they would not have been served in my absence.</p>

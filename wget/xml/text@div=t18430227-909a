I am the son of Levi Sampson, a slop-seller—he has a warehouse in Vine-street, and a retail shop in Whitechapel—the prisoner was in his service—on the 31st of Jan., I called him down stairs at my father's warehouse, and when he came I said, "I thought his pockets were very bulky, and asked him to let me feel—he pushed my hand away, and said it was only his handkerchief—I said, "There was a piece of red, and a piece of white calico out of his pocket"—he went up stairs—I followed him, and he pulled out of his pocket this piece of calico, and three dozen of handker<lb></lb>chiefs—I told him this was the property that he had pulled out of his pocket</p>

               <p>—he swore and said they were not—I told him to come down stairs, but there was no policeman about—when I was outside the door, he said, "For God's sake do not make a disturbance at all"—he went away afterwards—I asked him if he would come in the morning—he said, "Yes," but he did not come at all—I went with a policeman to look for him next day—we found his wife—the officer watched, and in about half an hour he and his wife came out together—he was taken.</p>

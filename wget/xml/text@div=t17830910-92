               <p>I am a broker, and sell houshold furniture and other commodities, the prisoner brought these articles to me, he appeared a young man just come from Birmingham upon his own and his father's account, he said, he worked for his father, and that his father and him were case-makers; he wanted me to employ him, and give him materials to make a dozen cases; I bought these of him, as he told me his father lived at Beasonsfield, and his brother was a case maker, and that they were made by the family; I bought them of him, I gave him nine pounds for them, some of the things I never had seen before in my life, and I did not know the real value; we in the brokery buy things in different branches, he was obliged to shew me the way to open the brushes; I asked him the price of the brushes at Birmingham, where he told me they were made, and my wife who went to school at Birmingham said, the children there are put early to work, he told me they would ask me three shillings and sixpence but I might get them for three shillings.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Council. Did you ever see this young man before? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I do not know, my Lord, whether the prisoner took them or not, for there is a pane of glass broke and any body might get in, but my apprentices must be privy to it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Have not you frequently lost cases before? - I lost two before he came to town, his father has worked for me almost eighteen years, and he worked for me at that time, the prisoner was <rs id="t17830910-92-deflabel504" type="occupation">apprentice</rs>

               <p>Court. Had you any reason to distrust the father before at any time? - No.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I had these things from Beaconsfield and Birmingham, which my father, and me, and my brother, made at odd times, and laid them by, and I sold them to Mr. Paul.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council to Prosecutor. How did the young man behave? - As far as I know, very well.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner called two Witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council to Prosecutor. As this young man and his father have worked for you, I presume you could not well distinguish the cases made by them on their own account, from the cases made for you? - Not if the wood is alike.</p>
               <p>And it is very possible that the same market is open to them to buy wood as that is open to you, so far at least as their work is concerned? - I am more likely to know them by the finishing part, and I know these by the wood and the work of the inside, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178309100131"></xptr> know they are the property of me and

               <p>Tried by the second Middlesex Jury before Mr. DEPUTY RECORDER.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. You probably owe your escape from this charge to the error in the indictment, the property not being laid there as it turns out in the evidence; and you owe much to the lenity and candor of your prosecutor in giving his evidence; however, there is too much reason to suppose that you are badly connected, you will therefore take warning by your escape for the future, and not fall under any of these suspicious circumstances again.</p>
               <p>Court to the Prisoner's Father. You owe much to the candor and humanity of your son's prosecutor, and I am afraid your son has escaped by the error in the indictment rather than the merits of the case, the proof was very strong, and it behoves you to keep your son out of these practices for the future.</p>
               <p>Court to Paul. I think you can have no doubt whose property these are, I therefore hope you will not be instrumental in preventing this man from recovering his right.</p>

On the 7th of October, at half-past one o'clock in the morning, I had spent the evening out, and was going home; a female accosted me - I was walking along, talking to her- the prisoner and another were with her, and after she left me the prisoner knocked my hat off, and took it up - he ran away with it; I followed, and called Stop thief! the Policeman stopped him with the hat on his head - I picked up a shoe while I was in pursuit, and he claimed it at the station-house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was not my hat on the ground? A. He threw his hat down in front of me, and then knocked mine off - mine was some distance from his.</p>
               <p>JOHN HANDLEY. I am a Policeman. I heard an alarm, and stopped the prisoner with this hat on his head; he had no shoes on, and owned one which was produced.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was passing the prosecutor - a drunken man came by and knocked off both our hats; I took up one and ran after the man, and asked, what he did it for - I did not know but I had my own hat, which was better than his.</p>

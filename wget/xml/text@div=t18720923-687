                  <hi rend="smallCaps">SARAH ANN RODWELL</hi>. I am single, and at the time this happened I was living with the prisoner as his wife at Earl's Court, Kensington; we lived in the top front room—a little girl, thirteen months old when I took her, was left with me on 22nd July by Hannah Weeden—I was to be paid 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, quarterly, but I had received no money at all—I was then living in Palmer Place, Victoria Street, Westminster—on the evening of 7th September I was out shopping, five or ten minutes' walk from home, and as I was coming out of a public-house, the prisoner met me and said "Sarah, I want you"—I said "What is it?"—he said "You had better make haste off home, for I am afraid you will find the child dead"—I went straight home; he did not go with me; I found the child exactly where I left it on the bed—I took it on my lap by the fire, and gave it some tea—it was not dead when I found it, but it died in my arms, and I laid it down on the bed again, and went out and met the prisoner coming towards home crying very bitterly—I said "<hi rend="italic">Ted, Ted</hi>, what have you done? you have been and done it"—he said he was very sorry, but he did not do it with the inten<lb></lb>tion of killing the child, he had not that thought in his head for a moment; that he went home with the intention of changing his clothes, and the child was making a grunting noise and crying, and he took it and nursed it for some considerable time and it did not leave off crying and would not be quiet at all, so he laid it down again, and then he took the pepper-box off the table, and sprinkled a little on the child's mouth—he did not say then that the top came off—I went down with him to my sister's house, Mrs. Spaul, and asked her to speak to <hi rend="italic">Ted</hi>, as he was in trouble—she asked him what it was that he had done—I was crying too bitterly, to hear what was said—we remained there about twenty minutes—he was taken into custody that night, Saturday, and on Monday morning he was taken before a Magistrate—I went and saw him in the House of Detention on the Tues<lb></lb>day, and asked him how he did it—he said that he laid the child down, and took the pepper-box off the table, and wanted to sprinkle a little in the child's mouth, and the top fell off it—he was in drink on the Saturday night—the child was left with me on 22nd July, and I was to be paid when the quarter came, but I have never seen the mother since, or received a farthing of money—I had been in the habit of giving the child hot things with its meals, pepper, mustard, and a little horse-radish—it seemed to like it; it did not seem to throw it back again, it seemed to eat it just as another child would—I gave it pepper mixed up on a bit of meat, the same as I had for my own meals; it had exactly the same as I had, I fed it from my own plate—my age is twenty-two; I have no children—I have seen my brother's child two years and a half old eat pepper.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Soames Spaul, of Earl's Terrace—the prisoner is my brother; he is a builder, and has been acting as carman to a builder for some weeks past—on 7th September the prisoner and Mrs. Rod well came to me together—she had been there before, to pay me some money she owed me in the week, and I asked her to go out and get me some coppers; she did so, and came back with the prisoner; she looked very much excited, in fact both of them did—I said, "What is the matter? come indoors;" and then she said "<hi rend="italic">Ted</hi> has done something, may he speak to you?" and then she said "Tell Susan what you have done, <hi rend="italic">Ted</hi>"—I took hold of him, and said, "What is it? tell me the truth"—he said that he had done something to the child—I asked him what he had done; he said he had given the child a little pepper, and he was afraid he had killed it—the girl said, "What do you think he had better do?"—I said, "Go to Dr. Parker at once"—I went too, sending Edwin back first to Rodwell for the key—he was crying a good deal; he was very much excited, and I believe it was from liquor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He was very much distressed, and crying, and he said going along how sorry he was that it had happened—I have been married to his brother ten years, and have known him from a little boy; he bears a very good character, but he is very excitable and hot tempered—he told me that he got some water to wash the pepper out of the child's mouth. <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> By hot tempered I mean easily annoyed, passionate. <hi rend="smallCaps">GEORGE SEYMOUR</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Officer T</hi>). On 7th September I was spoken to, and went to the prisoner's house—I found the dead body of a child on the bed; there was some pepper on its mouth and some on its face—I fetched Dr. Orton, and Mr. Parker was in the room when I came back—I asked the doctor the cause of the child's death; he said no doubt it had been killed by pepper being administered to it—the prisoner was sitting on a chair on the other side of the room, and Rodwell said, "<hi rend="italic">Ted, Ted</hi>, you know you done it in one of your mad freaks"—he went to a washhand-stand, and drank some water out of a jug, and said, "You know I never killed a rabbit or cat in my life, leave alone a child"—he was very much excited and quite hysterical; he seemed to have been drinking—I said I should charge him and his wife with causing the death of the child—I received the pepper-castor from the Coroner's officer, who took it from the table, and took it from the room.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not take the top off; I believe the Coroner's officer took it off and fixed it on again—the prisoner was in great distress, he was greatly excited; he put this handkerchief round his neck, and pulled both ends of it, and tried to strangle himself.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a physician, of 47, Earl's Court Road—on Saturday night, 7th September, I was called to the house, and saw the child lying on the bed—it had been dead about half-an-hour—there was pepper all over its face, principally about its mouth; its eyes were open,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187209230068"></xptr>
               <p>and there was pepper upon the eyeballs, also in the nostrils, and there was a lump of pepper on the tongue, which appeared to have been worked to<lb></lb>gether with the saliva into a body—I think the pepper would cause a flow of saliva—there was also pepper in the crevices of the neck—the front of the pinafore was wet, and there was pepper on it—It appeared to have been washed from the face, and that is the way I believe it found its way into the crevices of the neck—there were two bruises on the face; a large one on the left cheek, extending from the angle of the mouth to the lobe of the ear, about three days old—there was also a recent bruise, very slight, on the right cheek—by the colour I should not judge that it had been done more than half-a-dozen hours—I made &amp; <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination, and found that the mouth and throat, by which I mean the cavity of the mouth, not the gullet, contained a large quantity of pepper—I could have got a teaspoonful of pepper from the throat which had not entered the gullet—there was a little pepper in the throat, and a little in the passage of the stomach, but the greater quantity I found in the air passages, which led to death—there was a very large quantity there—I should think the child must have had half-an-ounce of pepper in its mouth, apart from what appeared on its face—I saw the pepper-box when I went into the room, the top was on; there was very little in it. <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I observed wet about the child's dress, as though there had been an attempt to wash the pepper from its neck—I have said that if the top had fallen off accidentally, there might be enough escape from the bottle to account for all I saw—it holds two ounces.</p>

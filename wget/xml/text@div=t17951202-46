No; but it is a back way; it was the nighest way for me; I sent for some rum, across the way, to the public-house, and ordered them to bring change for half-a-guinea; when they brought it, I would not pay for it, and the landlady took it back again.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to refuse to pay for it? - A. I was doubtful of getting my change again; the prisoner Hutton then knocked me down into the entry; I was shoved right back wards against the stair-case, and Mary Ash took my watch from me; before I could get up, I felt my watch go from me; I immediately holloa'd out, watch, and they run off; we pursued them, and caught them in about ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour.</p>

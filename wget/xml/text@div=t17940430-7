            , who is here, wanted change for half a guinea, he gave me the half guinea, the house was very full, I brought him the silver, and put it on the table, and I said, here, who wants change for a guinea? I turned my back, and in turning my back I see the prisoner take the change up, and saw him put it in his pocket; I immediately says to him, what do you want with that half guinea? I cannot find silver for every body, give me the half guinea; he makes answer and says, I did give you the half guinea; I says, you cannot say positively that you gave me the half guinea, you must be joking. The other man, Gilbert,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179404300010"></xptr>says, I gave you the half guinea, I says, I am satisfied you gave me the half guinea, and therefore I shall give you the silver; I then gave Gilbert the half guinea worth of silver; and I then says to Peeling do you mean to give me the half guinea? you be satisfied that you did not give it me. I had but one half guinea in my pocket, I pulls out my money and lays it on the table, and there was but one half guinea, then I says no more about it; I told him I should see about it on a future day. I let it pass till the Monday following; he had been in the house in the course of the time before. On Monday night I saw him not in my house, but in another house, and I took him up I took a constable with me; well, says I, Mr. Peeling, am I to have this half guinea? says he, what half guinea? I don't know you; you don't know me, says I that is very odd indeed; and I said to the constable, that is the man, and I wentout immediately, and I went home.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Gadsden and Co. On 15th June, at one o'clock in the morning, I had been to Hoxton, and was cross<lb></lb>ing—the Hackney-road—I had had half-a-dozen glasses of wine, not more—I knew what I was about perfectly—the prisoner came up tome and snatchedmy guard, which was in my waistcoat-pocket; the swivel gave way and thewatch parted from it—I followed the prisoner, and never lost sight of him—Burnham stopped him three yards before me—I saw no one else in the street I have not seen the watch since.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman</hi>.) About half-past one o'clock in the morning Iwas in the Commercial-road—I heard a cry of "Stop him," but a young manran by me just before that—I saw the prisoner running towards me, and the pro<lb></lb>secutorafter him—the prisoner is the only man he was running after—he said, "That is him, policeman; he has robbed me of my watch"—I took him, but found no watch—five or six constables searched, but could not find it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I saw the gentleman standing with two girls on theother side of the way; he was intoxicated; and a young man and womanwere looking at him; they ran different ways; about four young men randown the street, and 1 was stopped.</p>

I saw no girls—there were two or threemen and women walking in the street, but none running, unless it was whenmy attention was taken in stopping him—the prosecutor was a little theworse for liquor, but could run faster than me—there was no one in the streetlike the prisoner—his was a very remarkable dress.</p>

             were with me; but they were a few yards before me - I had two ladies' work boxes tied in a handkerchief, and they were inside a ladies' dressing box, which was tied round with a double tape, and hung on my arm - Curtis came up to me, struck me a violent blow in the face, made use of a vile expression, and told me to drop the things - I called to Allen and Pavitt for help, but they were prevented by some other persons from coming to my assistance - Curtis got the property from me - he put his knee on it, and broke it - he then walked away pretty fast - it was dark, but the gas enabled me to see him - I pursued him, and called the police - when he found the police were coming, he dropped the boxes, and I gave him into custody - I did not see any one with him whom I could swear to; but there were both men and women with him - I called out murder - from the blows I received, I had a black eye, and my cheek was cut open.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are you a widow? A. Yes; Mr. Lilly has been dead three years - he was transported - I heard he was dead from a sailor who came from there - I was once tried here, but I was brought here innocently - there was another tried with me - I believe she was transported - it was for some wearing apparel - I now live with Henry Pavitt - he is married, and has three children - he pays for them - his wife and children do not live with him - I do not know what prevents them - this was about a quarter to four o'clock in the morning - we were going home - we had been out spending the evening with a party of friends, of Pavitt's, in Shoreditch - I had some beer with my supper - we had taken these boxes out in the evening to sell them; and we had one ordered by a lady in Holywell-street, Strand - I cannot tell how we got to St. Giles's to go from Shoreditch to Hampstead Road - I do not know that end of the town - Curtis was taken in about five or ten minutes.</p>

On the morning of the 25th of February, I was coming along the Bowl-yard with Allen, and Lilly was ten or twelve yards behind us - she called out Harry, and we turned, and saw some one ill-using her - before we got to her, we were surrounded - Allen was knocked down, and kicked severely - some more tried to get me down, and very ill-used me - I did not see Lilly until she came to me again - she had had two work boxes, and a lady's dressing box, tied with a tape, on her arm - there might be a dozen persons there, but I could not swear to any one - I was so beat about, I half lost my senses.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by 
               <persName id="t18340410-66-person512">MR. DOANE</persName>
            . Q. Were they all men? A. I believe one or two were women - I make boxes, and hawk them - I have no houses in Eden-street - I am a lodger of Frederick Allen's - I do not live with my wife - I live with Lilly - we had been that night to Shoreditch with a party of friends; and on returning home, we went through the Bowl-yard - we had been round Covent-garden to try to get something to drink, as it was market morning; but we did not get any thing - we had been four or five hours with our friends - we had some porter - I had no gin - I was not drunk - there was no gin drank in my presence, nor to my knowledge - I had been hawking those boxes round Spitalfields, and other places, that evening - we were not in Westminster to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>FREDERICK ALLEN. I live in Eden-street, Hampstead-road. I was with the prosecutor and Lilly, going home, at half-past three, or twenty minutes to four o'clock - I heard Lilly cry out, and went back to her assistance - I was assailed by Cain and several others, who began beating me, and prevented my going to Lilly - I was knocked down; but I got up again, and followed Cain across the road - we had a bit of a scuffle - I was thrown down and kicked on the head - Cain then ran off, and the officer took him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. How came you to walk away from Lilly? A. Pavitt and I had some talk which we did not wish her to hear - I am a carpenter, but it is nearly three years since I was in work - I have been supported by my father and mother, who live in the country - I am the landlord of the house I live in, but I do not rent any other - I sometimes receive the rent of the next house (No. 11) for my father - it is let to a female - I do not know what she is.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, is it not a brothel? A. It is - I have nothing to do with any other brothel - I do not choose to tell where my father lives, nor what he allows me.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. You saw them talking with some other persons? A. Yes: I was about 100 yards off when I heard the cry - I got up in about a minute - Lilly could not have got any distance before I got up; and when I got up, the box was on her arm.</p>
               <p>Curtis's Defence. I had been with some friends about ten minutes before I was taken - I am quite innocent - Lilly was tipsy.</p>

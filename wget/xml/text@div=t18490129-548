                  </hi>. I am the daughter of Richard Lambert, the housekeeper of the Insolvent Debtors' Court—I reside there. On 8th Dec, between three and four o'clock, I was going up-stairs—I saw the prisoner Schmidt on the garret-stairs, and in the middle of the stairs I met Boyall, both coming down fast—there are from twenty to twenty-four stairs—no one had business there but our family—I went on to the top of the landing, and found the press open, in which were pigeon-holes, containing schedules, which I had seen safe at twelve o'clock—two holes were empty—it is quite at the top of the bouse—round the corner of the stairs, a very short distance from where I met the prisoners, I found a blue bag—next day I saw Schmidt at the Mansion-house—there were a number of persons in the room—I pointed him out—he was walking in the hall—I knew him directly—I recognised Boyall in the room at Bow-street-office.</p>

                  </hi>. I am housekeeper of the Insolvent Debtors Court. In consequence of information from my daughter, on 8th Dec, I went up stairs—I found the lower part of the press open, and papers and parchments had been abstracted from it, and were in this blue bag—these are them—no stranger has any business with these presses, or up the stairs leading to my apartments—an officer occasionally comes up for the purpose of taking papers out, but no one else—I am responsible for their safe custody—the staircase is four stories high.</p>

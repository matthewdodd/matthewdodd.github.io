On the 26th of July my husband's watch hung up in a little room behind the shop near the fire place; I saw it there between ten and eleven, and missed it before eleven. I was gone out for a little time; when I came back I heard somebody go out of the shop; I missed my watch; immediately I saw a man going along, I suspected he had been in the shop; I followed him; he went into another shop just by; when he came out of that shop I laid hold of him and asked him if he had not been in our shop; he said he had been to ask for one Mr. Harris, a bricklayer, and that he went into the other shop also to ask for him; I desired him to go back to that shop again to enquire for him; when I got him there I taxed him with having got the watch; he denied it; a Mr. Rice, a neighbour, came up and threatened to charge a constable with him; he then took it out of his breeche and gave it to Mr. Rice.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was on duty in Hounslow-road, in the parish of Heston—about a quarter past twelve o'clock in the night, I heard horses galloping in the field where Limpus keeps his horses—I got over the gate into the field, and walked along the hedge, about 100 yards—the horses ceased galloping—I stopped, and saw the prisoner leading one by the top of the mane—he stopped when he came opposite me—I said, "Halloo, what are you doing with that horse?"—he said, "I don't know, I am going to have a ride"—I said, "You must ride with me to the station"—he had not got out of the field—the gate was off one hinge—I took him in charge—the mare galloped away in the field—on the way to the station he said he thought of mounting the horse to gallop away to some place where he might lie down—at the station I was obliged to handcuff him to search him—I found on him a discharge from the hulks—he said he had been transported for seven years, but discharged at the end of four for good conduct.</p>

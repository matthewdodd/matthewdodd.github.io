                  </hi>. I am an oilman, living at 8, Queen's Street, Black<lb></lb>heath—about 6.50 one evening, about the 12th October, I was passing along Commercial Street—I saw two men loitering by the side of a music hall and "Sideling" round Pearl Street, and as I was going across the prisoner abruptly looked me in the face—I stared him in the face, and directly I did so he snatched my guard and locket, but left the watch in my pocket—I endeavoured to pursue him, but his companion threatened to knock my brains out, and said if I went down that street I should be killed—a policeman came up and made a little search for him, and I went to the station and reported the robbery—the music hall was lighted up at the time—there was a good strong light of gas, and I had a full opportunity of seeing the prisoner's face—when he had got my chain he stooped down with something in his hand—I gave a description of the man, as far as I possibly could—I was under great excitement at the time—I saw no more of the prisoner until some time in the month of November, when I was sent for to go to the police-station—I went into a room where there were seven or eight people, and I identified the prisoner—the guard and locket are worth about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

I can't tell the date when I was taken to the police-station to identity the prisoner—it was November, I know—I had not seen the man who took my chain before the night I was robbed—I was not walking quickly past the music hall—I was on my way to Shoreditch—it is about thirty yards from the music hall to Pearl Street—my chain was taken about two minutes after I saw the two men sideling round Pearl Street—there were two or three other people passing—I think there were several men standing at the corner—it was about ten minutes after when I saw the policeman—it was not foggy, but clear—I gave the policeman a description of the man—I said he had a red handkerchief round his neck, that he was a loose, thief-looking man, and that he had a dark coat and a low-crowned felt hat on—I do not remember whether I described his features—the identification took place in the room where the charges are taken—the persons were placed in a row—I did not know any of them besides the prisoner—I do not know where they were brought from—I did not notice their clothes particularly, or whether they had policeman's trousers on—there were several policemen in different parts of the court—an officer stood beside me—he said "Mr. Garratt, is there a man there you know?"—I said "Yes"—I do not remember whether there were any work<lb></lb>ing men amongst them.</p>

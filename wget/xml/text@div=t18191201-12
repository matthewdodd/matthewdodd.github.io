            . On Tuesday, the 23d of November, about ten minutes before seven o'clock in the evening, I was in <placeName id="t18191201-12-crimeloc79">Fountain-court, Aldermanbury</placeName>

At the entrance of the small passage the prisoner met me, I was going to let him pass, but he came before me, pushed me into the open court, and laid hold of my watch-chain with both his hands. I applied my hand to my fob to prevent my watch coming out, and it being a large one it would not come out, but he broke the chain, and immediately ran off with part of that and two seals; some persons were at the end of the court, I told them to stop him, but a man gave him encouragement, and said,</p>
               <p>"Run on! Run on!" I called out,</p>
               <p>"Stop thief! for he has robbed me of my watch;" he was seized, and I asked him for my watch? as I thought that was also gone, but he said he had not got it. I then asked him for my seals? but he said he had not got them. He was taken to the office; my property was not found. He is the boy who took them, I am positive - he was secured in less than two minutes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. WALFORD. Q. You hardly saw him - A. Yes, he was some time trying to get my watch; he was in the open part of the court, and ran to Aldermanbury; he was stopped opposite the gateway. I have no doubt but the other man received them of him.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was at the end of Lad-lane, heard the cry, stepped round the corner, and saw the prisoner come out of Fountain-court. I secured him; there were two or three people there. The prosecutor came up, and asked him for his watch and seals? then said,</p>
               <p>"Here is my watch, give me my seals." I searched him, but found nothing on him.</p>

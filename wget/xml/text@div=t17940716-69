On Whit- Sunday, the 8th of June, that day I missed money twice; on the 8th of June, I deposited my money in my bureau, about eleven o'clock in the morning, thirteen guineas, in gold, in one small canvas bag, and three pounds two shillings and six-pence in silver, in another bag, sixpences, shillings, and half crowns; and halfpence I had in two separate draw<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179407160119"></xptr>ers, to the amount of nine shillings and six-pence good, in one drawer, and nine shillings bad in another. After I had put my money into my bureau I locked it up and put the key in my pocket, it was under three locks where the money was, and the parlour was double locked, but the key left in the door, and the partition door was double locked, and I had the key in my pocket, Mrs. Bullen was gone to Church before I put my money there, and I went afterwards and joined her at Church.</p>

               <p>Q. What family have you besides this servant? - Only a baby I left at home, and an apprentice, but he went out at nine o'clock in the morning, and I always give him leave to be out till nine o'clock at night. We intended to dine at Piccadilly, at my wife's father's, we intended to proceed to there from church; we never dine at home of a Sunday, we always dine out, and leave the prisoner at the bar in possession of the premises.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go from Church to your father-in-laws to dine? - No, we returned home, my wife being very poorly; she returned first, and I did not know it, and I saw my weekly porter, and he told me that his mistress was at the door, I came up to her, and found she had rung two or three times, and the door was not answered, I then rung for admittance, and about the second time the door was opened with the young child in the maid's arms, and she seemed very much in a flurry, my wife asked her the reason she had not come before? she said she had not heard the bell; my wife asked me for a key in the bureau, I went to unlock the bureau, and I perceived the bags were not precisely in the state in which I had put them, I gave my wife the keys of her drawers, she was on the stairs, I returned immediately to my bureau, and counted the money, and instead of thirteen guineas there were but twelve, instead of eight half crowns there were but six; it rather sturried me, and I put the bags back where I had put them before, and locked up the place, and put the key in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you leave the key of the parlour in the same stale as before? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at all at any time intimate any suspicion to the servant? - No, none to her, we went out afterwards to dine with my father, and returned in the evening betwen eight and nine, very near nine.</p>
               <p>Q. When you returned had your apprentice returned? - He had just come in.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you went to your bureau again, on your second time returning? - About a quarter of an hour; instead of twelve guineas which I left at dinner time, there were only eleven, another guinea was gone, I counted the silver, the six half crowns was the same as I left them when I went out to dinner, then I counted the remainder of the silver, and there were fourteen shillings deficient of the silver, the good halfpence tastied right according to the paper, but when I came to count the bad ones there were three and six-pence wanting, there was only five shillings and six-pence left.</p>
               <p>Q. On finding this loss did you communicate your suspicions to the servant that evening? - No, I did not, I took her up the next morning, I sent for at constable, Mr. Marsh, she was searched, there was nothing particular on her, except a key that will open a closet where I keep my candles.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search her boxes? - I was present when they were searched.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after you had sent for the constable? - Somewhere about eleven, or half after; she had several boxes, four or five; there was found in one box a small<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179407160120"></xptr>purse, which contained sixteen guineas, the officer gave her leave to take out her own things out of the box, in doing of that the officer perceived her going to conceal a small purse, I perceived it likewise, and the officer took it from her, and it contained fourteen guineas and four half guineas; there was a smallscrew box that contained some silver, six pences and shillings, I don't know exactly the quantity; there was found a pocket with about four shillings or better, of halfpence, I think they were chiefly bad ones, there was a small bag with farthings, there was a kind of a small cap box, where there was a pile of half crowns, one and twenty; in the large box I found two pen knives, and two childs clouts, they are in the custody of the officer. Mrs. Bullen knows the things, one knife I knew particular, the green handle one, the other knife and clouts Mrs. Bullen will speak to.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. This girl lived with you at this present time, and had lived with you two years? - She has lived with me upwards of two years altogether, but this last time she had lived about seven months, she lived the time before, a year and seven months.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had elapsed between the time she lived before, and the present time? - About five weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe she came to live with you again on your own request? - Mrs. Bullen seemed desirous to have her again.</p>
               <p>Q. The shop windows were all shut of course being Sunday? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Does the bell ring hard? - It rings loud.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any difficulty of making it ring when the shutters are up? - I heard it myself, it comes even with the kitchen door.</p>
               <p>Q. Fleet street is a very busy street? - It was very quiet at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. The maid servant must have come down stairs to have opened the door whenever she did come down? - She must.</p>
               <p>Q. The money you will not identify? - I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. With respect to this green handled knife I take it for granted that you are only able to speak to it by its being green? - No, it is not; it is by knowing it a long time.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a knife is this? - A small knife with two blades in it, of no value; Mrs. Bullen used to have it in her pocket; she had it when first I was married to her.</p>

               <p>On Sunday I went to church before Mr. Bullen, and I was taken ill in the church, and returned earlier then usual; I rung five times at the bell, and could not gain admittance, and he rung twice, double rings, before we could gain admittance; when she came I asked her why she had not come before? she said, she was in the cellar; I said, she must be either dead or deaf; afterwards she-said, she was in the kitchen; afterwards she said, she was gone up to fetch the child, which lay in the two pair of stairs room. I afterwards asked Mr. Bullen for my keys, which were deposited in the bureau because I would not be cumbered with them; he gave me the keys; soon after I had been up stairs, Mr. Bullen came to me and informed me of the loss. After that I went to my father; we came from my father about eight, and were at home between eight and nine. On Monday morning we took this girl up; I was present when the box was searched; Mr. Marsh was the constable.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you find in the box? - Two childs clouts, and two knives which I know to be mine, I have the clouts now, the constable gave them me yesterday afternoon, I have likewife two that correspond with the pattern; there is no<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179407160121"></xptr>mark on them, but a particular method of making them, I know them by having loops at the corners, which is not a very usual way, there were two deficient, and I had repeatedly asked the prisoner for them, she said she did not know any thing of them.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you made enquiry after them before this discovery took place? - I should suppose ten or twelve months; they were lost with my first child.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you lost your knives? - A considerable time.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the knives when you see them? - I do, they are both pen knives, I had made enquiry about the knives repeatedly; she said, she did not know any thing at all of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the money found? - I did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Mrs Bullen, we are to understand that you swear to the clouts, not from your own work, but from these loops; you say that loops to clouts are not very usual things; I take it for granted you may have seen them before? - I never see any before with loops.</p>

               <p>I am beadle of the ward; I was sent for to take charge of the prisoner, and search her boxes; I have a memorandom of what was found; in silver two pounds eighteen shillings and six-pence, in shillings and six-pences; in a little bag there was sixteen guineas in all, with some half guineas; I see her catch hold of something in her hand, which she endeavoured to conceal, and I catched fast hold of it from her; in that bag was the sixteen guineas, incloding some half guineas, I think four. There was farthings and halfpence in another part of the box, to the amount of four shillings and three-pence, among them was a silver sixpence. In another box there were twenty one half crowns piled upon one corner; there was five-pence farthing all in farthings in that box; in another there were fifteen pence in halfpence and farthings, and two shillings and three pence all in farthings; and in another place I see six tea spoons.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any clouts? - Not that day; I think we took them out on Saturday the 5th of July, Mrs. Bullen said, she believed them to be her's, she had got some that tallied with them; and two little knives were found, which she said were both her's.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Bullen. I know them to be mine, they are the two knives that were missing.</p>

               <p>Court to Bullen. Was it necessary, in order to get to this bureau, to pass through this partition door? - Yes, it was, and the key was in my pocket.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Marybone. About half past three in the morning of the 27th of June, I had gone my round; I returned to my box. I blew the light out in my lanthorn; I went into my box. The prisoner came past my box at the corner of Titchfield-street; I asked him where he was going; he said to work. I observed that he had a bundle under his arm; he said, he was going to work at Mr. Tyson's in Park-lane, he kept livery stables I perceived a pair of girths drop on the pavement. I asked him what he had got in the bundle; he said, his clothes. I said, you walk along with me; I brought him into Lower Titchfield-street; he ran away from me. Some of the girths that fell from under his arm, he picked up. I ran after him, and catched hold of him by the collar. I told him if he did not stop, I would knock him down. I brought the prisoner round to the other end of the market place, and

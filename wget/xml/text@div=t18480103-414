I was at the Black Cap, Camden-town, having some bread and meat and beer—the prisoners were there—I laid my forehead on my hands on the table—I remained so a few minutes—Bertout put his arm over my neck, and pressed his fingers over my eyes while Norman took 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. out of my pocket—there were two half-crowns, and the rest in six<lb></lb>pences and shillings—my pocket was turned inside out—there were a good many persons there—I forced my head up, and said to Norman, "You took my money"—I said nothing more then, but glided quickly out of the tap-room, got a policeman and gave them in charge in ten minutes—I had the money safe half an hour before—I have known Bertout ten years, and Nor<lb></lb>man about twelve months—I am quite satisfied they had the money.</p>

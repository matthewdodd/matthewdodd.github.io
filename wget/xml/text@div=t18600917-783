I am a city-police constable—I was with Gayler on the morning of 31st August, at half-past 7 o'clock—I first saw Bosworth at the corner of Salisbury-court—shortly afterwards I saw George come with Mr. Clayton's cart in a direction from Temple-bar; he drew up near where Bosworth was and Bosworth went to the cart, and Geoige took this parcel out of the cart and gave it to Bosworth—I let George to on towards London-bridge—I waited at the end of Cannon-street—I there stopped the cart—I got in the cart and told George I was a police officer—I asked him what parcel he had given out in Fleet-street—he said, a parcel for the Great Northern Railway—I took him to Fleet-street station—I then asked him who gave him that parcel—he said no one gave it him, it was laid on the counter, and he took it and put it in the cart by no one's direction.</p>

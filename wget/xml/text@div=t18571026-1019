                  </hi>. I live in Paul's Head Yard, Westminster. On 21st Sept. I was acting as clerk at the Charing Cross railway station—the prisoner came there between 12 and 1 o'clock; he gave me a parcel, and asked me if we booked for Nottingham—I said, "Yes," and asked him 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for booking the parcel—he said, "Is it all right?"—I said, "Yes," and he left the parcel with me—I marked it "No, 2," and booked it in the usual way—this is the parcel; here is my mark on it now—about half past 2 o'clock the same day this parcel was shown to me by a police constable; it was in the same condition in which the prisoner gave it me, sealed and tied up—I know it by the writing on it—I saw the prisoner at the time, and said to the officer, "That is the man that brought the parcel"—the prisoner replied, "I did bring a parcel, I don't know whether it was that or any other."</p>

On 21st Sept I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner about a quarter past 10 o'clock—I kept him in sight about half an hour, I then lost sight of him—I saw him again about 20 minutes after 12 o'clock—and another officer followed him—we took him to the Great Northern Booking Office, Charing Cross—when I took him I said, "I want you for that parcel that you left this morning at the Booking Office, at Charing Cross"—he said, "I left no parcel at the Booking Office, I never saw a parcel"—I said he must go with me to the Booking Office, and on the road he said, "I did take a parcel to the Booking Office, Charing Cross, this morning "—I asked him where he got it—he said it was no business of mine, at first; and then he said that a man gave him 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to carry it from the corner of Peter Street—I took him to the Booking Office, and the clerk said, "That is the man that brought the parcel"—he said, "I know I brought a parcel here this morning"—I went to King's Cross station, and got this parcel—it was tied up and sealed.</p>

I went to the Booking Office at Charing Cross, and then, to the terminus of the Great Northern Railway, and got this parcel; and we took it and the prisoner to the office at Charing Cross—Mr. Darter was at the door, he was six or eight yards from the prisoner; he said, "That is the man that gave me the parcel," pointing to the prisoner—after we had been to the Booking Office, I took the parcel to the station and opened it—I found in it twelve half crowns, wrapped in separate pieces of paper, and nine 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. pieces, wrapped in separate papers, and wrapped in this brown paper, and then bound round with these posting bills, which have been posted up, and made into a parcel, tied with string—I was with them when they went into the public house—I could not say who asked to go in, for I was behind Huddy and sergeant Loomes, so that I could not say—they went into the house; I went in with them—I do not know what the prisoner had to drink—we had some ale—what the prisoner had he paid for—I paid for the drink for myself—I was present when the prisoner was taken—the last witness asked him what he had left at the Booking Office at Charing Cross—I cannot say that I over<lb></lb>heard all that was said—the prisoner said, "I left no parcel there "—those were the words he used, as near as I can remember—Huddy said, "You must go with me to the Booking Office"—he afterwards acknowledged taking the parcel to the Booking Office.</p>

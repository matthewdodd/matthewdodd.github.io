Somebody said, it is a pity but she had something to drink; with that I went away and fetched a little drop of gin, and they put it into a drop of water; and they put it into her mouth, and she made a kind of goggle, but could not drink it. I took up her cloak, and saw some holes in it, on the left side in the lower part the cloak. I went to Vincent's house, and said to Vincent, what have you been doing? he said, that she had been breaking his windows; and he told her, if she did not keep away he would shoot her in the arse, that was his word directly; he said, she stood aggravating him, and he shot her; but he did not think of doing her any harm; and he said, that if he had killed her he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177904040052"></xptr> would suffer for it; I told him, I must take him into custody as I am an officer; I hope you will not be angry with me about it; he said he could not help it; he was not angry with me.

When she was coming towards me she had a china cup in her hand; she said it was given her, and she would give it me; she turned back, and went in again.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing about that china cup? - No; I never saw it before.</p>
               <p>Did any body object to her giving it you? - No; I went into my gate, and she turned back.</p>

               <p>I am a surgeon. I was on Tuesday the 23d sent for to a person I was told was shot at North-End; I was not at home when they first sent; I went as soon as I came home. When I came into the room, I saw her lying on her back on the bed just expiring; I enquired whether any thing had been done; they said, they attempted to give her some liquor, but she could not swallow it; she died soon after.</p>
               <p>Did you examine the body? - I did; I asked where the wound was; they showed it me, and turned her on her side; the wound was near the back, on the left side; I found two wounds between the loins and the ribs; first I examined it with a probe; then I passed my finger into the wounds; there were two deep penetrating wounds; they penetrated into the cavity of the body. I told them there could be nothing done for her, she was dying. The man came in and asked me if it was in my power to do any thing for her; I told him, no; he asked to kiss her; and the constable followed him and took him away.</p>
               <p>Did you afterwards examine the body? - No; I was before the coroner; I showed them the wounds.</p>
               <p>There was no thorough wound, as if a ball had passed? - No. After having my finger some time in the wound, I brought out the point part of a nail. The woman was then in the agonies of death. (The nail was produced in the court.) That was the occasion of her death.</p>

               <p>Do you know any thing of the affair? - No; I was drinking at the Crown; hearing the prisoner had shot Dollard, I went out to see.</p>
               <p>Did you hear the report of the gun? - I might, but did not take any notice of it. When I came by his gate, the prisoner stood<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177904040054"></xptr> at the gate, or in the foot-path, I cannot say which. This gate comes out on the foot-path; I went by him, and went and saw the woman. I came back to him, and said, why, Vincent, have you shot her? he said, I have, and am sorry for it; I did not think the shot to be so fatal as it was. I said, why don't you get the doctor or surgeon? He said to me, get some body to go, I will pay them for their trouble.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen the gun before? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you live near him? - About two hundred yards off.</p>
               <p>Did you ever use to be in the hou se? - No, I never was in the house in my life that I know of.</p>

               <p>As I was riding through North-end, I saw a great many people. Lord Seston was there; he came and met me, and said, a man had shot a woman, and begged I would bleed her. I said she was as bad as dead. I opened a vein, and she bled; but there was no circulation.

               <p>I live at North-End. On the 23d of March, about three o'clock or thereabouts, I cannot say precisely, I had an information brought me, that Vincent had shot Mrs. Dollard. I went immediately to Vincent's, and saw him in the garden, talking with one Mills. I went up to him, and said, Good God, Vincent! how could you do so? He made answer, he had shot her; but had no more intention to kill her than he had me that moment. He told me she had broke his windows, and aggravated him a good deal; that he did not know what to do with himself. I heard him say afterwards, that he had done it; and if he was to be hanged for it, he must be hanged for it.</p>
               <p>Did he say to you he had done it accidentally? - No.</p>

               <p>Coming on horseback by North-End, I saw a crowd of people; I enquired what it was; some children told me, that an old man had shot a woman; he came out, and said to me (I cannot repeat the exact words) he said, if he was to suffer for it he could not help it; but, if he had not shot her, she would have done him a mischief. I asked what she had done? He said, she had thrown brickbats at him, and broke his windows, and threw water at him. The people said they had lived together upon exceeding bad terms; that is the whole, as near as I can recollect. I was coming to town; as they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177904040055"></xptr> did not seem very willing to take him; I hurried the constable away with him.</p>

               <p>When he said she had been throwing brickbats at him, did your lordship propose any question to him? - I did not; he seemed so very hardened. He said afterwards, he had no more intention of killing her than he had of killing me. Then he said he was only shooting at the gate.</p>

               <p>I was riding with Lord Seston and another gentleman on the North-End road, and observing a crowd at the door of a gardener, we rode up and enquired what was the matter; they informed us an old man had just shot a woman. My curiosity prompted me to get off my horse; I went into the house and saw the woman, I believe, nearly expiring. I got on my horse again. The prisoner came to the door; the crowd informed me that was the man that had done it. I asked him what could induce him to commit so horrid an action. As far as I can recollect, that was the purport of my question; he did not make any immediate answer, but began a detail of circumstances, that she had thrown water upon him in the night. I do not know that he alluded to the preceding night; that she had been breaking his windows that morning and throwing brickbats at him, and pointed to the wall where there were some brickbats; after that, he said he had no intention of killing her; and concluded by saying he was only shooting at the gate. That is the general purport of what he said. We staid till the woman was dead, and charged a constable with him.</p>

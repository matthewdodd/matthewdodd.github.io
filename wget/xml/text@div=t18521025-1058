On 14th Oct., between 2 and 3 o'clock, the prisoner Williams came to the bar and asked for half a quartern of brandy—I served her, and put it into a bottle which she had—she paid me with a half crown—she put it on the counter, and directly I took it into my hand I told her it was bad—the waiter then examined it, but I did not lose sight of it—I put it in the detector and found it was a bad one—I gave it her back—she gave me a good half crown, and took that one away with her.</p>

I was on duty at Putney—there was a rowing match going on—about 3 o'clock I was at the Duke's Head, and saw Williams there—I heard Mrs. Trimby mention about the bad money, and in consequence I followed Williams—she went round the back of the house, seven, eight, or ten yards, and there joined Smith, who was apparently waiting for her—they bad some conversation together, and went towards Barnes Common—they went about twenty yards down a passage leading to the waterside—Williams then took a bottle out and each of them drank from it, and after that Williams was apparently holding something white in her band, and passed it to Smith—Smith returned it to Williams—Williams then stooped down, moved the earth with her hand, and appeared to plant something—they then moved the earth back and put their feet over it—they then turned towards Barnes Common, and I and Levy, who was with me, went immdiately to the spot, and I saw Levy take up half a crown which was covered with earth—we followed the prisoners some way—they both turned back again, passed the Duke's Head, and at the end of River-street they both stopped, and Smith appeared to pass something to Williams, who went into the Bells public house while Smith waited at the end of River-street—I was in plain clothes, and I followed Smith in, and stood by her side—she was served with a small quantity of gin, which was put into a bottle—she put a half crown on the counter, and as soon as Mr. Avis took it up I told him to look at it, but being very busy he dropped it into the till—I could see it from where I stood, called Mr. Avis's attention to it, and be took it from the till—it was the same he had put in—he marked it, and gave it to me—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I took Williams into custody, and told her she was charged with passing bad money—she said she was very sorry for it—I asked her where her partner was—she said she had no partner.</p>

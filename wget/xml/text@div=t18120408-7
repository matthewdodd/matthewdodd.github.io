On the 4th of March I was at home, I saw both the prisoner's come into the shop, I attended to them; the man said he wanted to look at some prints for a gown; I shewed him a great many.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he look at them, or the woman - A. He looked at most himself; they bought a gown, and left two shillings, saying they would call the next morning for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who bought it - A. Both; it was for the woman; the woman desired the man to pay the two shillings; I think it was the woman that desired me to cut it off.</p>
               <p>Q. Who paid the two shillings - A. The man, by the woman's desire.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the gown come to - A. Ten shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they leave the shop then or not - A. They did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any thing while they were there - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How many people was there in the shop at the time you were serving them - A. There was one woman, she lived in Kensington; she was in the shop at the same time as the prisoners; the other woman was waiting to be served; none of my people was in the shop besides myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards miss any thing - A. Yes, about three minutes after they were gone. As soon as they left the shop I went to put one of the prints in the window that the woman took out and throwed on the counter, and when I went to the window to put the print in its place, I missed two pieces of Irish linen from the window. The woman had been to the window while she was there, and throwed it for the man to look at on the counter. That piece of print lay on the smallest piece of Irish, I put them in the window that morning. When I missed the pieces of Irish I called my sister, and pursued the prisoners; I went towards Hammersmith; my brother-in-law met them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the property afterwards found - A. Yes, by my brother,

               <p>JAMES BALL. I am brother-in-law to Mr. Breeze. I pursued the prisoners and overtook them by Knight-bridge, they were both together; I procured a constable; I took them and told them they must go back with me to Kensington: I gave the man into the constable's hands and walked with the woman to the watchhouse. They wanted me to go to have something to drink at the public-house, and gave me the bundle, the woman did, they were taken to the watch-house; they were searched, and two pieces of Irish linen were found upon the man. When I caught hold of the man he had got the two pieces of Irish tied up in a shawl under his arm.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take them from him - A. No, I did not. He carried them himself to the watchhouse, and then the constable searched him.</p>
               <p>Q. And were they delivered up to the constable at that time - A. They were; his name is Winter.</p>
               <p>MR. WINTER. I am a constable of St. Margaret's parish. The prisoners were delivered into my charge the two pieces of Irish linen were under the man's arm tied up in a shawl; I took them from him, I kept them till the evening, and then I delivered them to Gillmore.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they ever out of your possession - A. Never.</p>
               <p>JAMES GILLMORE. I am an officer. I have had these pieces of linen in my possession from the time that Winter delivered them to me; they were delivered to me in the prisoner's presence at the office, Winter marked them before he gave them to me, and Mr. Breeze wrote his initials.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Look at these two pieces and tell me whether you know either of them - A. Yes, they both of them have my shop mark.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen them both before you missed them - A. That very morning I put them myself on the window; I can speak positively to both pieces.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181204080009"></xptr> Q. What is the value of them - A. I suppose between four and five pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the cost price above forty shillings - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the man ever near that part of the window where these things were - A. Not close; the woman was there all the time.</p>
               <p>Q. The man was never near enough to the window to take them himself, was he, to take them himself - A. No. The woman was near the window while her husband was looking at the print at the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when they were searched - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. to Winter. Had they any money - A. No, except two or three halfpence I found on one of them.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. There was no alarm at the time in your shop that any thing was taken was there - A. No.</p>
               <p>William Webster's Defence. My wife, and I were walking together down the road, a man came up to me, he said my friend, will you hold this for me while I go and get a glass of liquor: I said, I will. I put it under my arm. When the person laid hold of me, and said you must go with me, you have stolen that property: Me! said I, there is the man coming out of the house that gave me the property. No, he said, you are sufficient, you have got the property, and with that they hurried me to the watchhouse. That is true, so help me God, and my wife is as innocent as me concerning the robbery; I did not know it was stolen, had I known it was stolen or any thing of the kind I would not have had any thing to do with it.</p>
               <p>Susanna Webster's Defence. My lord, my husband and me had some words, and I had a very bad arm; my husband asked me if I would have a gown; I said, yes; he had money to pay for the gown; as we came from the shop we were going to the hospital to have my arm dressed, and coming along the man said would my husband have something to drink, my husband would not. This man went in to get three half quarterns of gin, he gave my husband the bundle to hold. He shewed the officer the man. They would not take him, therefore we are as innocent my lord as you are.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Ball. When you took them what did they say - A. They pointed to another man that was at the public-house door, and said, that was the man that gave them the bundle, but I saw him with the bundle from where I first overtook him.</p>
               <p>Q. You had seen him with the bundle before they got up to that public-house - A. Yes, walking quite unconcerned.</p>
               <p>Q. How far were they from the other side of the public-house when you first saw them - A. About a dozen yards; I had seen them on the Kensington side of that public-house nearly an hundred yards.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw them first was that man in their company or not - A. I do not recollect seeing more than the two.</p>
               <p>Q. When you took them were they walking on, or were they stopping - A. Walking on, and there was no man with them then.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Did you see these pieces of Irish while they were in the shop - A. Yes; I saw one while they were in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before then had you seen the other piece - A. I had not finished dressing the window untill twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether they had a shawl with them - A. I think the woman had a shawl on.</p>

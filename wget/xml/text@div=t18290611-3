On the night of the 21st of December, I know the house was safe - I missed a quantity of calico, stockings, bacon, cheese, tobacco and pork; some tobacco had been taken out of the jars, and some unpacked; there might be 30s. worth of copper- I know there was a two-penny piece which had been in the back part of the till for three years; it was safe with every thing else the night the robbery was committed - we had taken the silver out of the till that night; I missed some handkerchiefs - there were two of a particular nature, which I saw afterwards; I came down first in the morning, and found a hole made through the brick work under the window, and a hole cut by a sharp instrument in the wood work at the end of the shop window, large enough for a man to get through.</p>

            . I am a constable of Twickenham, about six miles from West Drayton. In consequence of information from a man named Fisher, I went to a house at Whitton, the beginning of April, with a search warrant; I knew the prisoner lived in that house, for I have seen him going in and out there - I have known him these four years; he was in custody at this time - I have not seen him go in there above twice since December; I found there this copper coin - here are two two-penny pieces among it; I found them in his box, where his clothes were - I took the clothes to Bow-street, and he claimed them; I showed the two-penny piece to the prosecutrix - I went to search for other property, and found one handkerchief at a pawnbrokers, at Brentford, and redeemed it; Dalby produced this handkerchief in my presence at Hampton, where she lived.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When did you see him go into this house last? A. In April, about two days before he was taken, I think - his wife and family were there when I went; King, Kite, and another, who were tried at Kingston, have been executed - I cannot say whether the prisoner was a witness on their trial.</p>

            . I live at Hampton. In the latter part of December I lived at Twickenham; I knew a man named Kite - I have seen the prisoner twice; I was present at a division of some property - I think it was on the 7th of December. On the 20th, Kite shewed me some property - Young was not present then; I never saw him after the 20th till he was in custody - not at Kite's house; I only know about the prisoner from what Kite said - Kite said he was one of the party.</p>

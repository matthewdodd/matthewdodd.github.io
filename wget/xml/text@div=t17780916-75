The prisoner was at my shop on Monday the 17th or 18th of August; he asked me to let him look at some dozens of buckles; I had never seen him before to my knowledge; before I showed him any, I looked at his person a good deal, because he asked for dozens; it is unusual to sell plate by dozens. I asked if he wanted plated buckles; he said, no; for the term of plate in the trade is so much per ounce, and so much for fashion; he said he was a tradesman, and was going to Hamburgh. I looked at him very much; it appeared odd to me that he should ask me such a question, but seeing the man creditably dressed, I did not suspect him; I thought he might, being a stranger, make a mistake in the language. I took out a drawer and showed him some silver buckles; he looked out two or three pair; then he asked to see some more; I was rather loth to show him any more; but my wife being behind the counter, I gave her a wink; there was besides a sailor and a captain in the shop, and another gentleman, who is now in court; when the prisoner had looked out three or four pair, I told Mrs. Bendix, in Hebrew, that she should take care; I put the drawer in, and then took out another drawer; he picked out two or three pair from the drawer, and laid them down on the counter himself; he looked two or three pair out of the other drawer; he asked for more; I put that drawer away and showed him another; while he was looking at that, which was the third drawer, I suspected that he had some scheme or another, and that he did not mean to buy, for he chose a broken buckle of one pattern along with another odd buckle; from that circumstance I saw that he was not a buyer nor a trader, yet I thought I would give him his way, and see what he was about. His appearance deceived me; I gave as much attention as I could to his hands; he took out a purse; seeing It was pretty well loaded, I did not suspect him; it was a close worked purse, so I did not see what was in it; but it appeared before the justice that it was filled with foreign farthings. He asked for the first drawer again; I dare say in all he looked over ten or a dozen drawers, containing to the amount of three or four hundred pair of buckles; among all the drawers he chose thirteen pair of silver steel chaped buckles; I told him, you had better make it even, there is thirteen; O, said he, it does not signify; let me look at some knee-buckles; he behaved very genteel and polite, and made use of a great many compliments. Mrs. Bendix took out a drawer with knee-buckles; there were then upon the counter three or four drawers of knee buckles and shoe buckles; he had his handkerchief almost in constant motion, in this form, (describing it) rubbing his hands with it, and so on; then he pulled off his gloves and put them on again; then he took out the buckles; I could not see whether he took any thing or no, for his hands were very quick with his handkerchief and gloves; there was a pair of knee-buckles handed over to him by my wife; a knee-buckle fell down, but whether she dropped it, or the prisoner, I will not take upon me to say; however it dropped; I stooped, and Mrs. Bendix stooped, and I believe the gentlemen in the shop stooped likewise; whether he took that opportunity to take the buckles, or put them in the gloves or handkerchief, I cannot say; but he took a pair of silver buckles.</p>
               <p>Court. Did the prisoner stoop also as well as you? - No; he stood up. He chose thirteen pair of knee-buckles out of the different drawers; we laid them by with the others. He then asked for some silver buckles that the chapes and tongues were all silver; he looked out six pair of them; I asked him whether he wanted any all silver knee-buckles; he said, no; but he should want some second-hand watches; but I showed him none; I was lifting up the flap of the counter to go and weigh these buckles in the scales. I heard somebody say I will be here at five o'clock, after 'Change, and he was gone all at once. He never asked the price per ounce, or for fashion, or any thing whatsoever. I was startled at his going away<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177809160053"></xptr> in that manner; I said to my wife, this man has robbed me. I put the goods in a paper which I was going to weigh in the scales, and threw them behind the counter upon a board, and desired my wife to put all the drawers in; the gentleman remained in the shop, and I went after the prisoner in my morning gown and my night cap; I followed him up Tower-Hill; I was not positive he had taken any thing, but I intended to follow him, to see whether he would go into any other silversmith's shop, so that I might enquire what his business was there, or tell the shop-keeper how I had been served. I saw him turn round very short sometimes, and look back; whether he did not know me, or did not see me, I cannot say. When he came upon the hill, he turned very short into an alley; I followed him as close as I could, and saw him just get into a pawnbroker's shop, the corner of Catherine's lane, where I since understand he offered my buckles for sale. His dress, person, and appearance were so good, that I was afraid to challenge him. I stood at the corner of the lane, so that I could see him come out. I called a fruit woman, and bid her go in to the master of the shop, and tell him a gentleman wanted to speak to him; the prisoner instantly came out; as soon as he saw me he was startled; I said, Sir, you must go home along with me; he made me no answer but I be a gentleman, O Sir, I be a gentleman, and he came and squeezed my hand; I held him by the coat; I said he should come along with me; he said, he would go and treat me with some liquor in a house; I could get no English out of him then, whereas before he spoke very good English. I took him to my house; he wanted me to go to a publick house, the sign of the Hamburgh Arms, where the Bremen captains use; I sent for the person who keeps the house; he said he did not know the prisoner. I told the prisoner he had certainly robbed me; I asked him, what he did do at the pawnbroker's: a mob came and said I should secure him; I asked for a peace officer, I could not get one; I asked him what he had got belonging to me, he would not say any thing for a long time but I be a gentleman, I married to such a great lady; and he mentioned the Earl of Denbigh, and Mr. Pitt, and Dr. Franklin; at last he asked to speak with me alone, I said I would not speak with him alone; I asked him what he had robbed me of; at last he said I have got no more than one pair; and he took a pair of buckles out of his pocket; he took hold of my hand and kissed it, and begged for God sake I would let him go, for he was a gentleman, and it would spoil his character for ever; I told him that as he was a gentleman and behaved in that manner, that I would be as severe upon him as the law would allow; he then offered me two half guineas and a watch which he took out of his pocket with some silver, which he offered me to let him go. I sent to the pawnbroker's, and was informed that he had offered to sell the buckles; I took him before Justice Clarke and he was committed; the buckles he produced to me had no other mark than the hall stamp and the maker's name; I knew I had two pair of the same pattern. I examined my buckles and found one pair missing; nobody had been in my shop after the prisoner. (On his cross examination he said that he had seen the buckles in the drawer a day or two before, that they had never been sold, that he could swear to them; that when the prisoner gave them to him, he said he took but one pair, and there they are, and gave them to him.)</p>

               <p>I was present in Mr. Bendix's shop when the prisoner came back again; I saw him deliver the buckles to Mr. Bendix; he said don't make a noise, I will give you a guinea and my watch to let me go; afterwards he said I took the buckles because I had not money enough to go home; these are the buckles (producing them.)</p>
               <p>On his cross examination he said that when the prisoner was brought back, the prosecutor said you certainly have taken something of mine; and said he would send for a peace officer; that the prisoner then said, don't make a noise here are the buckles, and I will give you a guinea and my watch; don't say any thing.</p>

               <p>I am a pawnbroker, I live in Manor-row, the top of St. Catherine's lane. On Monday the 17th of August the prisoner came to my shop and offered to sell this pair of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177809160054"></xptr> silver buckles; I asked him if he wanted to pledge them; he said no to sell them. I said I did not choose to buy them, and I gave them to him again; he was met at the door by Mr. Bendix, I am certain the prisoner is the person; I perceived the buckles were new and therefore I did not choose to buy them. I weighed them, they weighed an ounce and three quarters.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>Gentleman, you will remember I told you I had been in Holland; I bought these buckles in a shop in Rotterdam; several gentlemen there desired me to bring some new fashioned buckles; I put these buckles into my pocket with intention to buy fashionable buckles; I was to send some beer and cheese aboard for the Prussian ambassador; I went to enquire for Captain Wilcox at a publick-house in St. Catherine's, I went there to him; they said I should see him upon 'Change; I went into this shop, not knowing that I came among a set of Jews; I said I saw some buckles in his windows which would do for foreign countries; I asked what he asked an ounce for the buckles, he said he did not sell them by the ounce but by the pair; I saw a great many buckles in different drawers; a captain came in at the moment I was to talk with him over the buckles with a watch to mend; he catched the watch from the captain and looked over it, the time was long for me; I said Mr. Bendix, let these buckles be together; I shall certainly be here at five o'clock; I am going to 'Change; because I thought to embark this beer and cheese at five o'clock; this man who is in his heart a Jew; his own heart being not clear, he thought I must be a thief. I intended when I bought some buckles to change my buckles; so soon as I walked out of the shop, not thinking that any body watched me, and not knowing that it was a pawnbroker's shop I went into it; I said, Sir, what are these buckles worth? He said will you pawn them, I said no, then Bendix came after me, and said you have been in my shop; have you not seen some buckles; not knowing what to say, I was in such a part of the town, I did not see a gentleman there; I said come with me to the publick-house I came from; I was afraid these blackguards would murther me. So soon as I came into the shop he locked the door; he asked me what had I been in that shop about; I said I went to see what was the worth of these buckles; in this moment he thought that the buckles must be his property. This gentleman and another tore my shirt; they beat me in the eyes that I thought I should be murthered; the door was shut, and three or four Jews about me beating me; they tore me by my coat before the justice; I asked for a coach, not to go among a thousand blackguards: no I should not have a coach. As soon as I came before the justice I was kept in a publick-house, at the same time my prosecutor was going to the justice's; I went before a justice

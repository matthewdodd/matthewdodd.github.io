               <p>Q. Did you at any time lose your pocket book, money, and bank notes. - A. Yes, on the 29th of September; I lost them between the hours of twelve at night and five in the morning; I had them in my pocket book at twelve at night, I was in a house <placeName id="t18071028-47-crimeloc261">No. 35, Dyot-street</placeName>

               <p>Q.Were you sober. - A. I was sober enough. I was fatigued, I come from Leeds, I had no sleep for four nights.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you leave your friend. - A. The house was shut up.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you set off from Hermitage to see your friend. - A. In the afternoon, about seven or eight o'clock, I am quite lame; I had been in two public houses.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of Drury-lane does your friend live in. A. The Marquis of Granby, his name is Mr. Welch; the house was shut up; I did not call, as the house was shut up; I called there the next morning after this woman took the money away from me.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the night did you call to see whether your friend was there. - A. Between eleven and twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you loiter all that time, from seven o'clock till half after eleven, till you got to Drury-lane. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I should not suppose you were sober. - A I was sober enough.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you keep your money and your pocket book. - A. In an inside jacket pocket. I met the woman between eleven and twelve o'clock in Drury-lane; I am sure this is the woman that I met, she cannot deny it; I asked her where I could get a bed, I said I was tired; she said she would get me a good bed; she took me to 35, Dyot-street; I counted my money before her, and I went to bed between twelve and one o'clock, in this room she took me to.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any other woman with her. - A. Yes; she went down stairs, and left me and the prisoner in the room all night, I counted my money after the other woman went down stairs; I awoke between four and five in the morning; the prisoner had absconded.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you given her any money before you went to bed. - A. I gave her four shillings, and eighteen pence I paid for the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you put the pocket book after you had counted your money. - A. In my inside jacket pocket<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180710280048"></xptr>and I put that under my pillow.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your jacket gone as well as your pocket book. - A. I found all my clothes safe; I lost all the pocket book, the ring, the money and the notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think that you were sober enough to say you had the money at 35, in Dyot-street. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have never got any of your money or your notes. - A No.</p>
               <p>Q. This was a great deal of money for a poor man like you to have; how long had you had it. - A. This money was wages that I had from a ship at Peru; about nine weeks back I received fifty pounds, and this was the remainder of it. I had Scotch notes; I changed them for bank notes at Edinburgh.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met this man in Drury-lane, he was very much intoxicated in liquor; he asked me to go into a public house to take something to drink; being a cold night I accepted, and the young woman together; we went to this room, he wanted two of us to sleep in the bed with him; I thought it an imprudent thing; I left him; the door having no lock or bolt on. I went to Charles-street Drury-lane, where I lived. I never saw a farthing of his money.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses to her character, who said at a prior time she bore a good character, but had known little or nothing of her lately.</p>

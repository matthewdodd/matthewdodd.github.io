My husband keeps a beer-house, No.4, High Street, Bow—on 5th March the prisoner came there; he had been there before—I was serving in the bar—he asked for a half-pint of 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. ale, which would be Id, and paid me with a shilling—I did not look at it—I put it in the till, and gave him change—there was no other money in the till when I put the shilling there—the prisoner sat down for some little time, drinking his ale—about three quarters of an hour afterwards I had to send out for something in a hurry, and I gave the shilling to my niece, Sarah Ash; she came back with it—I then found it was bad, and marked it—I kept it by me till the 18th, when I gave it to the constable—I had several times found bad money in my till after the prisoner had been there, but I never suspected him—on Saturday, 8th March, he came again, and asked for a pint of 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. ale and a screw of tobacco, which came to 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I served him; he paid me with a 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece—I said to him, "You were in on Wednesday"—he said "No; I don't think I have been in all the week"—I said "Yes, you were in, and you then gave me a bad shilling; I shall try this, and see if it is bad"—I tried it and it bent—I then said "I shall detain you," and I gave him in charge—he asked me not to give him in charge—he held out a half-crown, and said "Will you take for the bad money out of this half-crown, and let me go?"—I said "No"—he did not ask me to take the half-crown for the florin, but for the shilling—I sent for a policeman and gave him in charge, and gave the florin to the policeman, and the shilling I gave to the officer at the station on the Monday.</p>

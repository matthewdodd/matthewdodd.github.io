            . Q. What do you know about taking this rug. - A. On the 20th of February I had a sale by auction at No. 19, Oxford street; one of the rugs were taken from the door post; I knew nothing of it till the officer brought the prisoner and the rug to me. I then recognised it to be my property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Yours is a night auction, is it not. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say if they would give you a guinea you would not prosecute. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you take any money. - A. I did not.</p>

             said there were some men endeavouring to take the rug away which was at the door post; we both came out and watched them. I stood in the path right by the door, I saw

             called out stop thief, and so did I; with that he dropped the rug and ran up Hanway street; Spencer took the rug up. We pursued him till he was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you him constantly in view. - A. We lost sight of him turning the corner of Hanway street; when we came up to him he was in Mr. Piper's custody.</p>

Yes, and I saw the prisoner in company of four or five more; they were all pulling the rug in turn that was nailed up; I did not see him pull it down, I saw him walk away with it; when I called out stop thief he threw it down and ran down Hanway street.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>

               <p>MRS. HODGES. - Mr. Knapp You are mother of the prisoner. - A. I am, he is sixteen years old; I heard of the misfortune, I solicited for my child; he said he had lost nothing, it was a great deal out of his way in putting the auction of one side; I said to the prosecutor pray forgive my child, whatever he has been guilty of; he said it was a guinea out of his way; I said if it has been a guinea out of your way, here is a guinea and a half, he accepted the guinea and a half, and I thought there would no more come of it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

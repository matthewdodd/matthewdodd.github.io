             sworn. - I am the wife of Benjamin Marshall: Last Sunday was a week, about nine o'clock in the evening, I lost a shirt, the prisoner was a stranger to me; I saw the prisoner and another woman pass the top of our stairs. I keep a kitchen in <placeName id="t17980523-25-crimeloc136">Monmouth-street</placeName>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. While I was down there, there came something like a man's hat, and put out the lamp, and then she said she was robbed by somebody and I should suffer for it; I had nobody with me but my child, I never saw the shirt.</p>

On Sunday, the 1st of Dec., I took to Mr. Horsley's a piece of beef and a batter<lb></lb>pudding in a round dish—about twenty minutes after one o'clock I went for it, but it was gone—I saw the dish again on the Monday—this is it—it is brown at the bottom and yellow at top—I know it well.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my father, George Horsley, a baker, at Camberwell. On Sunday forenoon, the 1st of Dec., the prosecutor brought his beef and pudding to be baked—a few minutes past one o'clock the prisoner came—he was going through the house into the bakehouse—I asked if he had paid, and he put down 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on the counter—I asked whose he came for, and I understood him the name of Ware—lie went into the bakehouse, and came out with something which had a cloth over it—I could not tell whether it was meat or pudding—as soon as he had left, my father came from the bakehouse and spoke to me—I went after the pri<lb></lb>soner—I did not find him—the next night I went with an officer to a house in Edward-street, in the Grove, saw the prisoner, and gave him into cus<lb></lb>tody—I saw this dish behind him in the chair where lie was sitting, and the officer took it—I saw the dish that Ware rought his meat and pudding in—it was such a dish as this, but I did not notice it—I am quite sure the prisoner is the person.</p>

About ten minutes past one o'clock, on the 1st of Dec., the prisoner came with a cloth—I am confident of him—he did not ask for anything, but I said, "My man, whose do you come for?"—he said nothing—I asked again, and he said, "Smith"—I said, "What, of Collingwood-street?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "What?"—he said, "A dish of beef "—I said, "Potatoes?"—he said, "No, but a pudding"—I allowed him to take it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am principal clerk at the Westminster Savings-Bank. I remember 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. being deposited in the bank on 7th July—I delivered this book out in the regular course of business—it relates to the sum of 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., paid in by Pye—I saw the depositor sign it—it would be necessary to produce this book to get the money, or any of it out—I believe a person came about it on 11th July—I have no particular recollection of it—any notice would be received by Mr. Gray, sen.—the book came in on that day—assuming that notice was given to take the money out, it would be necessary for the depositor to come himself, seven days after the notice, to receive the money: that would be the 18th—on the 18th, Ward came and a woman, I believe Myers; I saw her afterwards—Ward produced the book—it was put with a number of others, and in the course it was called up—the man then came forward, and I said, "You have come to receive 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," and he was told to sign his name to the receipt—he signed," J. Pye"—this is the receipt (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—supposing him to be the real depositor, that would be the real form, but we might have asked him to sign at full length—it appeared that the original signature was written at full length, and I asked him to sign at full length—I then remarked that his signature was not like that one—he declared he was the party who paid in the money, and said he was tipsy at the time he came to deposit the money, that he was not the best of writers at any time, and that would account for the difference in the writing—the female then came forward—I cannot tell whether she was the one who came forward afterwards—I have no recollection of her features—she stated that the man was the rightful owner of the money—I was inclined to dispute it, seeing the difference in the signature, and feeling almost sure it was an attempt to defraud the bank, I desired them to sit down—I afterwards desired them to come forward, and then both the prisoners came, I am sure—I asked Ward if he was the owner ôf the money—he said he was—I put before him the receipt to sign, and then Myers came up to the counter, and persuaded him not, saying," Do not commit yourself, the money is my money, and not your's, "or words to that effect—I had provided a policeman, and gave them both into custody—they were taken before a Magistrate and remanded, and afterwards Joseph Pye came forward—the woman who came forward first, said she was the woman who had given the notice—Charles William Hallett is one of the trustees of the bank—there are five.</p>

I lost my watch on the 19th of April, about two o'clock in the morning. I had been at a friends, the other side of Russell-square; I stopped there, and when I came home to my lodging I was locked out. I then went down to Holborn, and there I met the prisoner; she was alone. This was about two o'clock, as nigh as I can tell; I went with the prisoner to <placeName id="t18130602-134-crimeloc721">No. 5, Charles-street, Drury-lane</placeName>

I went with her up to the garrett of the house; my watch then was safe in my fob, and three shillings in money. I went in the room with her; I staid there about twenty minutes. I did not go to sleep; I accused her of taking my watch; I did not perceive the watch go from me; she denied having the watch. We were in the dark; she said she would go for a light; she went away to get a light, and did not come back. I stopped about five minutes; she did not return I found my way down into the street. I then saw Cuthbert, the watchman, in Drury-lane; I told him what I had lost, and described the person to him. On the 24th I saw the prisoner again; the watchman and me found her in the same room. My master was with me; she denied having seen me or my watch. I am certain the prisoner is the person.</p>

            . I am a watchman: my beat is near Charles-street. On the 19th of April I saw the prosecutor; he told me he had been robbed, and told me the place; and on the 24th I found the prisoner in that garret. Wyght pointed her out to me; he said she was the woman that robbed, him: another woman opened the door to me; I found the prisoner in the cupboard; she denied having seen him or the watch; she was searched in my presence, nothing was found.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am innocent; this night that he said I slept with him, I slept at the Bull and Gate, Holborn, with the waiter; his mistress would not let him come forward for fear it should be said, she kept a house for company; and the reason that I went into the cupboard, I was afraid it was young man of the name of George coming.</p>

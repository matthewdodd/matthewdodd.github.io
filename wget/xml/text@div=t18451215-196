                  </hi>. I am a tailoress, and live at No. 12, Eagle-place, Princes-street, Whitechapel. I know the house No. 9, Roper's build<lb></lb>ings—I went there, on the afternoon of the 9th of Dec, about two o'clock, to find the prisoner, as she had struck an old lady who works with me—I wanted to know what she had beat her for—I found the prisoner in the room of Michael Reed—I have known Reed for two years as a friend of mine, by my keeping company with the young man he lives with—on entering the room I said nothing, I had no time; the prisoner did not give me time before she knocked me down—I had not raised my hand to strike her, I am quite sure—I ran into the room, and rushed towards the prisoner—I was not going to knock her down, but to ask her the reason she beat the old lady—I went into the room in haste—I pushed the door open, and she knocked me down—she was about the centre of the room—she had run towards me as I ran towards her, we met in the middle of the room, and she knocked me dowo with a sword which she had in her hand—she struck me on the front of the head first—I still rushed towards her, intending to strike her, after she had struck me—I was going to strike her with my fist.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean that you went in quietly, and did not announce your business? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Oh, yes, she had heard me down stairs say loud enough, that I wanted to know the reason why <hi rend="italic">Biddy</hi> had beat Mrs. Andrews in that manner, and given her two black eyes—I was talking to Mr. Pursel—I spoke pretty loud, and in a tolerable passion—I did not go there to give her a <hi rend="italic">hiding</hi> particularly—I meant to strike her—my fist was not held up.</p>

ROBINSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was not there a child in the room? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I did not see a little sword in his hand—I had no ill-feeling towards the prisoner, except for beating the old lady—I never had any quarrel with her—I know Turfrey, in whose house Reed lives—Samuel Turfrey was a sweetheart of mine—he was not about to marry the prisoner, that I am aware of—he never told me so; he always spoke the reverse—I was still keeping company with him—I had nothing in my hand when I went up stairs, I will swear—the prisoner and I have quarrelled many times, and fought, about Samuel Turtrey—I did not threaten to stab the prisoner before I went up stairs—I said I would insist on seeing her—the young man and his father tried to prevent me—I had gone into Turfrey's bed—room that morning—he was lying on Mr. Reed's bed—I did not use violent expres<lb></lb>sions towards the prisoner—Turfrey did not tell me it was his father's deter<lb></lb>mination that I should not come to the house—I did not make several attempts to enter the room—I did not snatch up a knife—Mrs. Harvey was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184512150013"></xptr>
               <p>there—the room door was shut, and Mrs. Turfrey standing behind it to pre<lb></lb>vent my getting in—I pushed it, and she fell on the box as I went in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not you make another attack upon the prisoner afterwards, when Turfrey prevented you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I fell on the ground—a young man picked me up, and I lost my senses—I had been drinking a little half-and-half—I was rather the worse for liquor.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live in Roper's-buildings. I employ the prisoner as a needlewoman—she had been at work in my room—before the prosecutrix came up, a little brother of mine had been playing with a sword with her, fencing—the prisoner had a sword in her hand at the time the prose<lb></lb>cutrix rushed in—she approached the prisoner with her fist closed to strike her, and after she got the first blow she rushed forward more, or she would not have got struck—I took the sword from the prisoner—Samuel Turfrey caught the prosecutrix in his arms, to prevent her ill-using the prisoner, she was still so violent—the prisoner had drunk one glass of spirits, that was all—she did not advance to the prosecutrix, but stood still—the prosecutrix rushed for<lb></lb>ward and knocked down an old lady against a chest, and said if she got hold of the b—y w—e she would pay her for it—when she rushed towards the prisoner, the prisoner raised the sword and struck her with it, to defend herself.</p>

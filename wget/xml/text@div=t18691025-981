I am a leather dresser, at Swan Yard, Bermondsey—about 6.2 on the morning of 16th October, I went down stairs and saw the prisoner standing behind the door—he had my coat on, and this umbrella in his hand—I pounced on him, and asked what he wanted there—he said, "It is all right"—I took the umbrella out of his hand—I got him into the</p>

About 6 o'clock on the morning of 16th October, I saw the prisoner and the last witness struggling together—I went up, and took the prisoner into custody—he was wearing this hat—the coat was lying on the ground by the side of him—I found a shawl, a waistcoat, and shirt—the things were all identified by the prosecutor—I found the back window open, the prisoner was perfectly sober.</p>

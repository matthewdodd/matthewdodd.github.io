            . I am the wife of William Thomas Loftus. I have lived with my mother in <placeName id="t18250915-204-crimeloc1083">Bedford-place</placeName>

I lost several articles, and had suspicion of some of the servants. I told the prisoner I had lost my stockings, and said, "As I am going out, have the goodness to let me find them in their place when I come home;" she made no answer, but went out of the room. I returned home, and did not find them; next day I missed other things. I then asked the cook in the prisoner's presence, if she would have the goodness to let me look into her box, which she immediately opened. I then said to the prisoner "Will you open yours?" she did so - the cook then gave me a bag, which she said was the prisoner's. I was about to open it, but she snatched it out of my hand, put her hand into it and took something out, which she put behind her into the box. I looked to see what it was, and it was a yard of muslin, and my stockings, with the marks picked out.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I bought the stockings of Mr. Steven's, in Aldgate; they cost 1 s. 6 d. a pair - I have the other pair at home. The muslin was in the room, and the child had it to play with - it was not there with an intent to steal. - Witness. The muslin had been in the drawer, and the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150075"></xptr>stockings likewise. I sent for an officer, and had her taken. I asked her if the muslin was mine, and she said it was.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>JURY to MR. LOFTUS. Q. Were there any children playing in the room? A. There was a little boy, but the muslin was in a drawer, which he could not open - he is but two years old.</p>

On Sunday, 9th January last, I was keeping the Red Lion beer-shop, 42, Warwick-street, Borough-road—I made every-thing safe, and went to bed between 11 and 12 o'clock—I came down about 7 next morning and found part of the counter ripped up, and on going into the bar parlour I missed a pair of trousers, a frock coat, and a pair of</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, M</hi> 228). On Monday morning, 10th January last, about 6 o'clock, I was on duty in Little Surrey-street, in the Borough-road, and saw three men walking very closely together, coming in the direction from Warwick-street—the prisoner is one of them—one was carrying a carpet bag which I now produce—the other was carrying a large bundle—the prisoner was not carrying anything—thinking it was not altogether right I seized hold of one of them, and he dropped the carpet bag—the prisoner picked it up, and ran away with the party who was carrying the bundle down Little Surrey-street—I had a struggle with the one that I seized, and seeing the parties were escaping with the property I used my truncheon, and immediately followed them—finding I was getting close to them they threw the property down and made their escape—I picked up the bundle and the carpet bag, and brought them to the station—they contained a great number of things which were afterwards shown to the prosecutor, before the magistrate, and identified by him as his property—after taking the things to the station, I came back to Little Surrey-street, and watched a house where I suspected the prisoner lodged—I took him into custody about 1 o'clock the same day—I told him I charged him with breaking into the Bed Lion beer-shop, he said, "I know nothing about it, I was in bed"—I am sure the prisoner is one of the men, I knew him before.</p>

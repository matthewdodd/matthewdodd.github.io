                  </hi>. I am in the employ of the Mint authorities—on 31st May last, about half-past 6 o'clock, I went with some other officers to the White Horse, Baldwin's-gardens, Gray's-inn-lane, and saw the prisoner there with others—he was seized by the right arm by Inspector Brannan, my son—I seized him by the left and pulled him towards the back-room, he clung to the stairs but was pushed forward by Sergeant Elliott—when he let go the staircase he attempted to put his left hand into his pocket—after he got inside the large room, which is occasionally used as a skittle ground, I put my hand into his pocket and found this paper packet (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) containing fourteen counterfeit shillings wrapped in paper, and two half-sovereigns, a half-crown, three florins, five shillings, and sixteen sixpences, good money, loose—on taking them out I placed them on the table, and addressing him by name, said "<hi rend="italic">Jack,</hi> I received instructions from the authorities of the Mint to look after you as an extensive dealer in counterfeit coin; I do not think you have a right to grumble at your run"—at that time I had seen 13 G take from the prisoner's right hand pocket a sovereign—the prisoner then said, "I will be on my oath that the sovereign is the only bad money I have got about me"—I commenced searching in the room, and behind the door I found this bag (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), containing two crowns, one half-crown, and thirty-two florins, wrapped up into packets, all counterfeit—since then, Mr. Webster, upon comparing the paper in which the money was wrapped, found in the prisoner's pocket, with that which contained the thirty-two florins, discovered that they were pieces of the same <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi>—these are the pieces.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-sergeant, G</hi> 13). I went with Mr. Brannan on this morning to the White Horse—I followed him into the house—I searched the prisoner—as Mr. Brannan took the first handful of money, the packet of shillings came out with the loose silver—I saw him take it out and lay it on the table—the prisoner then began to straggle—I seized him, and put my hand in his right hand waistcoat pocket—he said, "All you will find there is one counterfeit sovereign; that is all the bad money you will find about me"—I found this counterfeit sovereign (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) wrapped very carefully in this piece of tissue paper.</p>

                  </hi>. This sovereign is bad, and these fourteen shillings also—there are several from the same moulds—the coins in the bag and those found on the person are not from the same mould—there are thirty-two florins found in the bag, several from the same mould, but not from the same mould as those from the person—in looking over the papers I found two pieces of <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi> corresponding, one piece agreeing with a piece found on the prisoner.</p>

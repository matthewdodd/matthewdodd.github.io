                  <hi rend="smallCaps">ANN LORD</hi>. I am the wife of William Henry Lord, who is now ill in the barracks at Chatham—I now live with my uncle, who keeps the Salmon and Ball public-house, Bethnel-green—I went to live there at the latter end of Aug.—on the 31st of Oct. my husband was out of employ, and had been from the time we came to town till that day seeking for employ—he left me that day, and about a week after I heard he had enlisted for a soldier in the East India Company's service—the prisoner had been in the habit of coming to my uncle's house—he was there on the 14th or 15th of Nov., which was after I heard of my husband having enlisted—he said, "Mrs. Lord, I have not had an opportunity of speaking to you since your husband enlisted, I suppose you think I know something about it, but I do not"—he said some one ought to go down to Soho-square, to try to make arrangements with Captain Murray about his discharge—I went with him to Soho-square the next day to the office of Captain Murray—he went to the front door—Sergeant Steven<lb></lb>son came to the door, and said, "Is it on military business?"—the prisoner said, "Yes"—Sergeant Stevenson said, "Walk round to the office-door in Bateman's-buildings"—we went round and went towards Captain Murray's office—the prisoner then said if they knew my husband was a married man, it would take 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to get him off, and perhaps do him a serious injury—I did not go in consequence of that, but remained on some leads leading to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184302270129"></xptr>
               <p>the office—he went in and came out in about ten minutes—I said, "What did they say?"—he said, "They asked me who you was, and I said you was my sister"—he said he had seen Captain Murray, who said that there must be 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. paid in that night before eight o'clock, as there was a vessel at Gravesend that would go on Sunday, and my husband would be drafted into it—I had no money about me—I went to a friend in St. Martin's-lane to borrow it, but did not succeed—I was forced to go back to my uncle—the prisoner was with me—I borrowed the money of Mr. Turley—I went back with the pri<lb></lb>soner to Soho-square, and when we got to Bateman's-buildings I gave him the two sovereigns, and he went in—I could not see from where I was, whether he went into the office—I waited in Bateman's-buildings—he came out of the court where the office is, and said he had paid it to Captain Murray—I asked if he had got a receipt—he said there was not any required, and that money would detain my husband twelve or fourteen days—this money was given to the prisoner to give to Captain Murray to prevent my husband going abroad.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> What was the purport of our going to Captain Murray? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> To inquire about my husband's discharge—I do not recollect any thing being said about a bounty that my husband would receive on enlisting—I received a letter to you from Sergeant-major Sullivan, from Chatham, which I opened—there might, perhaps, be something said about the bounty, but I cannot recollect it—I went to a public-house with you, and I believe there was a letter written to Sergeant-major Sullivan, not to pay my husband the bounty—I stated at the office, that having paid you 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for the purpose of paying Captain Murray, I did not see you again for eight or ten days—you was pre<lb></lb>sent when I received a letter from my brother—it was on the 17th of No<lb></lb>vember that we went to Captain Murray—I am quite positive of that—you did not come to my uncle's again after that night—we were wondering what was the reason, and in a mean time the letter came from Brompton, in answer to the letter you wrote to Sullivan, and my uncle said I had better open it.</p>

                  </hi>. I lent Mrs. Lord 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., about the 17th of Nov.—I am not quite positive as to the day—the prisoner was not present, but I had seen him a moment previously—he stated that 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was required to he paid that very night, otherwise her husband would be drafted off, and it would cost 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. instead of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to buy him off.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sergeant in the East India Company's service—about the 17th of Nov. the prisoner came to the office, and I referred him to Serjeant-major Sullivan, of the Brompton-bar<lb></lb>racks—no money was paid to me—I have been in the service fourteen years—the sum of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. could not be paid for any such purpose as delaying a man's departure for India.</p>

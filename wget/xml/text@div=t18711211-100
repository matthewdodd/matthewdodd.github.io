About 10.45, on 6th December, I was in Brushfield Street, and saw the two prisoners and another man not in custody—they went into Bishopsgate Street—Murray walked to and fro the prosecutor's shop twice—the one not in custody opened a knife and gave it to him—Burgess at that time was standing in the centre of the road, where there was a hoarding—he was looking towards the shop—Murray then cut this pair of boots down from the shop door—they were hanging by a string—he put them under his arm, and ran down Skinner Street—the other two ran in opposite directions—I went after Murray, and took him into custody with the boots under his arm.</p>

I was with Randall, and saw the two prisoners and another man coming down Bishopsgate Street—Murray stole the boots—Burgess was in the middle of the road, looking up and down the street, and also looking at the shop to see if they were watched—after Murray had got the boots, Burgess went down Spital Square and through various turnings till he got to Commercial Street, the third man being with him the latter part of the time—they then separated—I went and took hold of Burgess—he said "What do you want me for?"—I said "For being concerned with another man in stealing a pair of boots just now"—he said "You have made a mistake; I have just come from my aunt's"—I said "I saw where you came from; I have not made any mis<lb></lb>take."</p>

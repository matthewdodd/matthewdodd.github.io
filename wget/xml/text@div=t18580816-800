                  </hi>. I live with Mr. Thomas Lowe, 39, Queen-terrace, Haverstock-hill, in the parish of St. Pancras—on Sunday morning, 17th July, at a little before 6 o'clock, I was alarmed by a noise at the window—I thought it was a cat, and did not take any notice for some time—when I looked round, I saw a man's head, as I thought it was, under the blind; his hand was on the chair, and, hearing me, he got back and his cap fell into the chair—I hallooed out, and he got away—the policeman took him—I had to ring the bell, and a man came into my room—I saw my mistress take up the cap—I heard the window opened, but I can't tell whether it was close down the night before—I heard the prisoner afterwards own the cap, he said in the room, "Give me my cap:" they did not give it him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Why did not you go to the window directly, if you heard it open? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not—there was an image of a dog on the table; I thought you would knock it down, and in getting back you did knock it down and break it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you see him have the cap on? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, he had it on when I hallooed to him, and it fell off when the blind fell on his head.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, S</hi> 371). On the morning this happened, I saw the prisoner about 500 yards from the prosecutor's house, and he was coming in a direction from it, and coming into a brickfield—he had no cap on—I took him back to the house, and this cap was handed to me by Mrs. Lowe—the prisoner said, "That is my cap, give it to me,"—I took him to the station—he repeatedly asked for the cap; at the station he said, "It is my property, you have no right to detain it; a boy threw my cap in at the window, and I went in for it."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had he any boy with him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was no boy near the place at the time—it was impossible to throw a cap in the window; the lower part of the sash is level with the balcony, and the blind was down inside, so that nothing could have been thrown in—there was a heavy roller at the bottom of the blind, which kept it down.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the owner of the house—I went round the house that night, and fastened it up—the sash of that window was quite down to the bottom, as close as it could go—there is a balcony in front of that window which goes very nearly up to where the sashes join—he had to get up six or seven steps of the door to get over into the balcony and raise the window—there is a catch to that window, but I will not swear that it was down; if it were, he must have broken the glass.</p>

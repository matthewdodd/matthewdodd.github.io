            . I am an officer. On the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181409140011"></xptr>31st of August, I went with the officer, Harrison, to a house in <placeName id="t18140914-8-crimeloc43">Smart's buildings, No. 6, in Holborn</placeName>

I knocked at the door three times; I knocked again, and then Hannah Goodger opened the door. I entered the room; it smelled very strong of aquafortis. I told my brother officer, to lay hold of the prisoners, there was coining going forwards; the man prisoner was sitting in the room, with his shirt sleeves tucked up; there was another man in the room; I did not know him; the woman prisoner came to the door in a confused state. My brother officer, secured the man prisoner; the other man went out. I searched the room. On the fire was this cup, half full of aquafortis, and thirteen shillings in it; the thirty shillings were in the aquafortis boiling on the fire; I knew they were counterfeit shillings. I then proceeded to the cupboard at the side of the door. I found in a plate fifty shillings, all ready for circulation. I found in a paper some shillings half finished; I have got them here, and a number of papers containing a white stuff, a composition. I tried this stuff this morning, before Mr. Powell; it coloured a copper halfpenny white, the same as a good shilling.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at the fifty - A. They are counterfeits, and fit for circulation, except one.</p>
               <p>Johnson. I found in a bason some aquafortis and water. I also found two vials, one with aquafortis, and the other with vitriol, and I found this stick, what they stir the aquafortis round in the cup; it is burnt with aquafortis. In the chimney I found this coarse rag, what they rub over the shillings with after they come out of the aquafortis after being boiled. This spoon is what they mix up the composition; it is stained with the white composition; there was a saucer full of this composition. I do not know the name of the stuff. That stuff, and with what is in the jug, will colour a copper halfpenny with the white surface of a shilling. I found these white rags; they have the appearance of having been burnt with vitriol and aquafortis. I found a flat iron, which appeared as if copper had been hammered on it, and I found scowering paper. The prisoners were very much confused, and said nothing in my presence. We took them out of the room as soon as we could, for fear they should throw any thing off the table.</p>

               <p>Harrison. The woman's fingers appeared quite yellow. The woman in going along sucked her fingers, and in doing that, she was sick; the man prisoner, gave her this handkerchief; the handkerchief appears to have been burnt with aquafortis or vitriol, it is quite rotten.</p>

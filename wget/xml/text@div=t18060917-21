Yes, it was brought there in a truck, I had it in my custody in Union street, Kingsland Road, it was placed there for repairs; I left the pipe there on the 22d of July, about ten o'clock in the morning, I missed it at ten at night; on the next morning, from information, I went to the prisoner's house, Saunders's Gardens, Kingsland Road, he is a pump maker.</p>
               <p>Q. Who went with you. - A. Mr. Anderson; at that house I found a wooden pipe.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that pipe you found there the one you brought to Union street, Kingsland Road, on the Tuesday morning. - A. I have not the least doubt but it is the company's pipe.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it bear the same appearance as it had when you lost it. - A. No, he had squared it then all the length but nine inches.</p>
               <p>Jury. What length was it. - A. Five yards long, it laid then across the prisoner's door, I did not take it away.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember on the 22d of July observing any men, and what they were doing. - A. I saw a good many men among the pipes with a truck, I was busy, I cannot say how many nor did I see them take the pipe away, I went about my business, and when I came back again the men were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner, and tell me whether you you know his person. - A. I do not.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you find any thing there. - A. I found a pipe in the prisoner's premises in a small inclosed yard, it was partly transformed into the shape of a pump, and a bit of the pipe had been partly cut away with a cross-cut saw, in order to take out the hook which is driven into the wood; one end of the pipe was not defaced at all.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180609170018"></xptr>Jury. Did you find that part which was cut off. A. No, but still on the end of the pipe there was the place where the hook had been taken out very evident, I knew it to belong to the New River company.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take the pipe away. - A. No, the pipe was removed from there to Kingsland Crescent, No. 1, in a gentleman's yard; the prisoner told us where he had removed it, he said it was not ours, he had bought it of a man of the name of Basing, the other side of the water.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. They have taken a piece of timber out of my yard, they said it came out of the said pipe; I bought it of Mr. Basing, and I have got the receipt for my money.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

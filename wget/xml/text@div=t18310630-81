               <p>Prisoner. Q.How many butcher's shops are there in Hampstead? A. Five - they might have beef of the same sort, but this was cut different to what it generally is.</p>

            , who keeps the Horse and Groom, at Hampstead. On the 24th of June the prisoner came there with a piece of beef, about a quarter after five o'clock - my master asked what he gave for it; he said 6s. - that he had bought it at a butcher's shop, and he asked master to cook it for him - my master said, as he was so tipsy, if he would go up to bed he would send it to the baker's, and I took it.</p>
               <p>PHILIP MOSE. I am a constable of Hampstead. I found the prisoner in bed at the top of Pilcher's house - I told him in coming down stairs if he would take me to the butcher's shop I would let him go; he had at first stated that he bought it at a butcher's shop, but when I got him out he said he bought it of a person in the town - I took him to the baker's, and then to the cage; he said, before the Magistrate, that he gave 2s. 4d. for it, but I understood him at first 1s. 2d.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the day before, I had received part of my bounty, and got intoxicated - I never made mention of 6s.; I was stupidly drunk when I went to the public-house, and there I had some more drink - the landlord said if I would go and lay down on the bed he would let me know when his dinner came from the cook-house -I went up, and in fifteen minutes the officer came and took me; I had bought the beef for 1s. 2d. of a man who said he was a brick-setter, or a brickmaker - he said a butler had made him a compliment of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an ironmonger, of the Royal Parade, Blackheath—the prisoner is my apprentice—I received 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. pre<lb></lb>mium with him—on 24th December I gave him leave to go home to visit his friends, and he left my place and did not return for four weeks, when his father brought him back—in the meantime I looked through my stock and missed a small cash-box, a pistol, and a penknife—I asked him what he had done with the cash-box, he said that he gave it to Marsden's young man—Marsden is a bootmaker, twelve or fourteen doors away—on the evening of 30th January I gave him in custody—I missed a great deal of property—he said that he had given the pistol to the same person—this cash-box (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is worth 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; this pistol, 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; and the pen<lb></lb>knife, 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What is the actual value of the cash-box? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It cost me 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. less than that—I sell pistols—the prisoner had a room to himself—I did not afterwards let it and put him into a back kitchen to sleep, or into a little back room—I put him into a large place—it was a counting-house, and before that it was a sitting-room—it is parted off from the shop—my wife and I used to dine, breakfast, and sup in it, but when the prisoner was put in we went out of it—he did not complain of it</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186702250100"></xptr>
               <p>particularly—I do not know that he complained—since Christmas for two or three nights he lodged out—if he had come to me he would have had something to eat and drink, or money to buy it—I have a neighbour named Payne, who sells the same things as me—I did not ask the prisoner to break his windows, and chalk his shutters, "Gone back to Woolwich"—I did not tie something to my chaise and carry it across the heath—it is quite untrue.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you remember the prisoner bringing home a little dog and saying that he found it, and a reward of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. being offered for it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, the dog was given to my daughter by Miss Stephens, next door—the prisoner afterwards brought me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I said that, as the dog was given to my daughter, I would divide the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. between the prisoner and my daughter, and I did so—I did not give him an old watch instead—he bothered very hard for a watch, which I valued at 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and teased my wife to let him have it; I let him have it instead of the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and two or three days afterwards he parted with it—it was gold—I do not know that all he could get for it was 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I do not know that if he is found guilty I shall get rid of him and keep the 63<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not make him clean my pony and cart, and drag a truck—there were a great many complaints between his father and me—the father did not say that he thought it was a bed of roses, and it turned out to be a bed of thornt—nothing of the kind—the father is an oil and colour merchant—I believe he is very respectable—his eldest son, Alfred, carries on business with him—Alfred had reports from the prisoner, and came down and found them to be false—he dined with me each time he came, pretty well—the prisoner has asked me to forgive him, and I have forgiven him four-fifths—he has been twice before a Magistrate, and I have his father's letters directing me to take these steps, pressing me to do so—before going before the Magistrate I intimated my intention to his father, who came to me—his father knew that I had charged him before a Magistrate before—I have his letters telling me to do so—I forgave him four-fifths, and the fifth time I took him before a Magistrate, and then begged him off, or he would have been sent for trial—he did not come back too late when he went for the holiday at Christmas—I found him living with two women in the Lee Road, Lydia Thayes and another girl—I told him to go to his father, who wished to see him, and to bring me a letter from his father, but instead of that he brought one from his brother, and then went back and brought one from his mother—I do not know that his father had gone a long journey, but he ultimately brought the prisoner to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. DALY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was the reason you removed him from his bed-room? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because he used to boast to the female servants that he was going up stairs to lie down with his mistress, and one Sunday afternoon I was out on the heath, and saw a light at my bedroom window, I was afraid he was with my little girl, and hastened home and removed him—one Sunday I dined in London, and he had to feed my horses in my absence—I afterwards found that he took them out and drove them seventy miles in nine hours, they having done a week's work, and another Sunday he drove them to Foots Cray and Croydon, when I thought they were having a rest—on three other occasions he nearly smashed the van, and on 19th February nearly killed the horse—he was drunk—he is seventeen or eighteen years old.</p>

               <p>a few doors fromthe prosecutor's—I know the prisoner—he made me a pre<lb></lb>sent of this cash-box—he said that he had made presents of several, and had got one which he was going to give to a friend, but had fallen out with him, and gave it to me—he said that he bought two pistols, made a present of one to a young <hi rend="italic">chap</hi> named Morson, and would I accept the other, because I was sleeping in the house alone—he made me a present of this penknife six months before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

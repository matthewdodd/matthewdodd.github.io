Hall's warehouse in Seething-lane—Bennett was employed there as foreman—I saw him on the premises there and said, "I belong to the police; have you delivered any bales of rags since yesterday morning from the warehouse?"—he hesitated and said, "No"—a minute or more afterwards he said, "I delivered two bales of rags from the warehouse yesterday morning to a man of the name of Smith, a marine store dealer in Rosemary-lane; he gave me an order for them, but the order was not signed"—I said, "Where is that order?"—he said, "I gave it back to Smith again"—I then said, "You will consider yourself in my custody for stealing a quantity of rags"—I took him into custody, and on taking him past Smith's premises in Rosemary-lane, he said, "That is where Smith lives, who I sold the rags to"—that is all he said.</p>

Next morning I had another bale; it was not so good as the the first, I said I could only give 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a cwt. for it. When we got the first bale in the cart, he said, "You might as well take the two, this all I have got," and I did so. I told him I could not pay him then, I did not know the worth of them. I tried to sell them at a place, and they offered 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a cwt which I did not think enough, and I said he had better let me have them a day or two, and I would try and get as much as I could for them. The man told me they were his own property. If I had been aware they were stolen goods, I should not have sold them to my next door neigh<lb></lb>bour.

               <p>Q. Did you at any time lose any clothes? - I lost them at the time that this prisoner at the bar was in my house; the first time I see her was the 1st of May, and I took her to work for me the fifth.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179507010106"></xptr>Q. What was your business? - Japanning. She did not live in my house at that time, she worked a fortnight, and then I took her into the house.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did she remain in the house? - A month; I missed a white apron and a coloured apron the first week that she came; I missed the next week two cotton handkerchiefs, I did not miss the rest of the things till the day before she was taken; I missed a whole ham, and a silk handkerchief, and a black silk hat, and two pair of japan candlesticks, two japan tea pots, four pewter plates, a flat iron, a white muslin handkerchief, and a neck handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen the ham? - The Saturday week before she was taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. You had seen these last things after you had missed the white apron, and the coloured apron? - Yes. We found the muslin handkerchief in her room, and her hat. She did not sleep in my house at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to her lodging? - Yes, I went myself on the 15th.</p>

            What did you find there? - A white muslin handkerchief, a snuff box, a black silk hat, and ticket. (The handkerchief produced.) It is mine. The hat was left in the cupboard of her room; we found them altogether in the cupboard; the snuff box handkerchief, and hat.</p>

            Where did you find the other things you lost? - We did not find any of them, only the ticket of a silk handkerchief, and I have been at the pawnbroker's and owned it; the pawnbroker has got it, he was not bound over to appear.</p>
               <p>- MILES sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. You I suppose went in search of the ham? - Yes; I found this muslin handkerchief crammed into the head of a bonnet, or hat, and the snuff box was in a little jar.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was there of days, but I was not there of nights; I went at seven o'clock in the morning, and staid till eleven o'clock at night; one night it rained and thundered very hard, and I had nothing to come home with, and she lent me the old hat, another night she was leaning on two chairs, and had two or three glasses full of rum, I then asked her to lend me an iron to iron a cap? I took the iron and pawned it for sixpence, being very much distressed; them two neck handkerchiefs she lent me to tie over my head, the night it thundered and lightened.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Russian merchant carrying on business at Alderman's Wharf—in the autumn of 1864 the prisoner introduced him<lb></lb>self to me to inquire whether some friends of mine who were coming from Siberia had arrived, and in June, 1865, he borrowed 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd of me on a bill of exchange—before that bill came to maturity, and before I knew whether it would be honoured or not, he came to me on the 30th of June, 1865, and said that he had failed, in consequence of difficulties in St. Petersburg, and had got a friend who had lent him some Russian rouble notes, upon the security of which he borrowed 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of me, as there would be a loss in exchanging them—he produced them; these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—here are seventy-five of them—they are in the identical packets as he delivered them to me—they are for five roubles each; the aggregate value is 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but the exchange varies—I gave him this cheque for 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>); he endorsed it in my presence, and it has been returned to me by my bankers, paid—I never saw the prisoner afterwards till he was in custody last month—I put the notes by in my safe box, where they remained some months, for an opportunity of sending them to my agent at St. Petersburg, as to change them in London there would be a loss—in November, 1865,1 sent them to my agent at St. Petersburg, but took the numbers first; they were returned to me in May, 1866, as forgeries—when I was at the Mansion House the prisoner was asked whether he had any questions to put to me, and he said that he knew the notes were forgeries, and that I knew so also—there is not the slightest truth in that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I never borrowed the money on the bill of exchange—I never had the money. I had 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; not on account of these notes at all, it was a different affair altogether. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> It was specially given him on the security of the notes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Why did you keep these notes in your possession so long? why did not you change them directly and get the money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was a matter of no particular importance; they were put away in a safe, and remained there—I thought in the first instance that you might come back to redeem them, you borrowed the money for a few days and promised to repay it—I sent them to my correspondent to be realised, and if they had been good they would have passed into circulation like notes in this country—I did not say at the Mansion House that I sent them to the Russian Bank, it would be quite out of course to do so—I got them back without a letter; the person who brought them stated that they were false—he was a German from St. Petersburg—I do not know where he is—they were sent back in the identical package in which they were received, with the specification which was sent out with them—the German was directed simply to give me a message, because the possession of forged notes in Russia would be a very serious thing, and my correspondent would not like to commit himself by writing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> If he brought the notes he could substitute these notes for others. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I had not marked them, but I had taken a specification of the numbers, and the identical specification sent by me to St. Petersburg was returned to me in London—I know that the notes are the same, because the numbers correspond—I have no other means of speaking to their identity—I know that the notes I sent were forgeries, because these are the identical notes—I have been to St. Petersburg—you asked me at the Mansion House if I knew a rouble note, and I said that I did, but I did</p>

               <p>not say that I knew the difference between a good note and a bad one—I do not know that you were here in November, 1865—a letter may have been sent to the hotel at Charing Cross to know if you had come back, but I did not see you. and did not know you were here—I cannot recollect sending a letter there by a young Spaniard, but cannot undertake to say that I did not—I do not know that you were in London again in December.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) what you call a specification? A. Yes, it is in my writing—the number of each note was taken down on this paper, which was sent with the notes to St. Petersburg, to Herman L. Milroid, a merchant in a very good position there—the whole seventy-five numbers are here—the messenger was a person who came to me with a letter of introduction, and was charged to deliver the notes and state that they were forged—it was only a verbal communication—I then communicated with a Russian gentleman, who examined them, and after<lb></lb>wards with the Consul here—I afterwards heard of the prisoner in France—my clerks might take upon themselves to make inquiries about him without consulting me—I have carried on business in London twenty-five or twenty-eight years.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did you lend me any money before you had the notes? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Before you pledged the forged notes I once lent you 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. without any pledge, and it was repaid—I wanted a pledge for die 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., because there was then a bill of yours pending for 217<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which was ultimately dishonoured—it may have been through the hands of ten parties, but I was responsible upon it, and I had to relmburse the amount—it had several endorsements—I did not know that it was had, but I had quite enough risk already.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a professional interpreter—I attended at the Mansion House on the examination of the prisoner, and interpreted the proceedings to him—after Mr. Harbottle had been examined in chief the Lord Mayor asked the prisoner if he had any questions to put—I inter<lb></lb>preted that to the prisoner, and he then made a voluntary statement, which I interpreted to the Court—he first asked several questions which I interpreted, such as, "When did you send those notes to St. Petersburg?" and, "Why did not you send them before?" and, "Did not you lend me money without security on one or two different occasions?" and several more—he then said, "I knew the notes were forged, but Mr. Harbottle knew it as well"—I asked him two or three times, "Do I understand you rightly?" he said, "Yes, I knew they were forged, but he knew it as well."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> I did not mean that at all, because I pledged no notes at all there; did not you ask Mr. Harbottle whether he sent the notes to the Bank? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You asked him where he sent the notes to and when, and he said that he sent them to St. Petersburg some months afterwards, and would have sent them before, but he thought the exchange was lower, and that he should have lost money by them—you never raised the point that these were not the notes—you did ask him whether this transaction did not take place before he stated, and he denied it—I think you asked him whether he had not taken notes from you before, but I cannot remember the amounts—I think you asked him whether you had had dealings with him before, you did not ask him whether he had changed forged notes for you.</p>

I allowed him to send me a sample by post. It was such a good one that I thought he was making a fool of me, and that it was a real note; I told him so and gave him back the sample. He said, 'I will send a worse one, so that you may be con<lb></lb>vinced that it comes from our factory;' and he sent me one finished here faulty. The figure 8 in the number was out of its place, and another un<lb></lb>finished, or a skeleton, as he called it (both annexed to this letter).

                  <hi rend="italic">The Prisoner's Statement before the Magistrate</hi>:—"I wish to say some<lb></lb>thing now. Being in this position now as a criminal, I wish the people around me to listen and hear something. I went to Mr. Harbottle, because I was aware that thirty or thirty-five years since he ran away from St. Petersburg for a criminal matter. He was in the service of Count Levashoff, as the manager of his estate. That was the reason I went to him, as I told him at once I knew him; I mean of course, not that I knew him, but that my father-in-law was serving under the same estate as him. Another person made my acquaintance, and then also of Mr. Harbottle, and that person is the first director for the forged notes. I was so well acquainted with that person that I was able to send to the government there a small piece of the type of the notes. As a proof of what I say being true, I refer to Mr. Klein. This was the reason why I wrote to the Emperor and the Minister about it, and in order to get into the confidence of this man, who had entrusted me with the bits of type. You will understand it was necessary that I should get into his good graces. It was arranged that I and Mr. Harbottle should become agents of this man. I did not buy or sell any forged notes, but Mr. Harbottle bought on several occasions. Mr. Harbottle had no business to speak of it through any person but me. I brought to Mr. Harbottle's notice the seventy-five rouble notes, but on another occasion I brought him another seventy-five before this transaction. This transaction took place before the time Mr. Harbottle states. On another occasion, prior to these two transactions, the gentleman gave Mr. Harbottle 200 of these notes. I did all this only because I had already written about it and thought it would be easy for me to discover more. I did not receive any money from the Minister of Finance, but afterwards I was offered money by him, which I declined to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186701280029"></xptr>
               <p>take, as I wanted to serve the state only as a patriot. At a later period I received from the Minister authority that I might go in partnership with those people and make the notes with them. There are the papers about it in the hands of the officer. It will look extraordinary why Mr. Har<lb></lb>bottle should all at once give information about it, but the cause of this will be shown later. I can prove that the reason they have not found out the manufacturers is that the persons are beyond suspicion."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner addressed the Jury through the interpreter, stating that he was a Russian, and Mr. Harbottle an American; that he had previously received money from Mr. Harbottle without security, and that having put his name upon a cheque was no proof that he had given any notes as security, which he denied doing, and contended that his letters to the Emperor and to the Finance Minister spoke for him and not against him; that on arriving in Lon<lb></lb>don he introduced himself to Mr. Harbottle, who he knew had been guilty of criminal acts in Russia for some years as adminstrator to an estate there and running away with the money, the prisoner's father living on the same estate at the time; that ten years afterwards Mr. Harbottle was manager of the estates of Count Pascoff, brother-in-law of Count Levashoff, the prisoner residing there at the time, but, coming afterwards to London, found that Mr. Harbottle was doing business there, went to see him, after which he met Ra<lb></lb>detzky, who proposed that he and Mr. Harbottle should become agents for passing forged notes, Mr. Harbottle staying in London and furnishing the prisoner, who was to go to Russia, with notes, and was to send back wheat or corn; that he did not like to lose their acquaintance and confidence, seeing that he could thus serve Russia as well as the poor peasants among whom the notes were circulated; that Radetzky proposed to Mr. Harbottle to send a certain sum to Holland, but the latter refused to have anything to do with any agents fat Radetzky himself; that Radetzky then proposed to send a commissioner with a parcel to meet the prisoner at a certain post-office, where there was a thoroughfare, another commissioner coming in the other way, who was to identify him, to which the prisoner consented, but declined being a party to utter the notes; that three transactions took place between them, in one of which, at the end of 1865, he received 200 notes, and in another the seventy-five notes in question, but, not having mixed himself up in the sale of the notes, he could not say how many Radetzky sold to Mr. Harbottle or what Mr. Harbottle paid him; that he handed over the packets of 200 and the 75 notes to the commissioner, who handed them to Mr. Harbottle, and that when he asked Mr. Harbottle what he had done with them he said, "That is my business;" that Radetzky was manager of the company who issued the notes, one of whom, named Lepault, was tried for that offence in Paris, but acquitted, as it was proved that he only acted for political purposes; that those who received the notes handed them over to their agents, who never knew the makers; that in writing for notes to the manufacturer, Radetzky would send an address, not his own, and if there was one line on it the person would know to whom to deliver it, but if two lines he was to give it to a higher authority; that a man named Jankouski took him to a house and introduced him to some of the agents, one of whom was Holchester</hi> (Tried December 20th, 1865); <hi rend="italic">that on the 13th of January, when he was going to Paris, Mr. Harbottle said that he would give him some commissions, and gave him a cheque for</hi> 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for which he took three receipts, one for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and two for 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, in different names, telling him he was to pay the money to whoever brought him those receipts in Paris: that the receipt for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was brought by a man named Lievitz, whom he paid and took the receipt, but that the two for 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. did not come at all; that before going</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">to Paris Mr. Harbottle told him to come to him for some forged notes to hand to somebody there, which he promised to do but did not, not liking such a commission, which displeased Mr. Harbottle, as he afterwards told him; that he gave information in Paris to Prince Dolgorouki, now General Governor of Moscow, who referred him to the Russian Ambassador at Brussels, then in Paris, who requested him to obtain some of the forged notes and send them to him in Brussels, which he did, having obtained them by letter from Radetzsky under the pretence that he had a buyer for them, and a few days after<lb></lb>wards Radetzky sent over a person to Paris with more notes, demanding to tee the buyer, upon which he applied to the Consul, and the persons were cap<lb></lb>tured with the notes, which Mr. Klein could confirm; that he then wrote to the Russian Minister of Finance, and afterwards went and saw him at Berlin, who begged him to assist in discovering the manufactory, and with one of whose agents, M. Kamensky, he laid his plans, and who offered him money, which he declined, not having then been at any expense; that he wrote to the Minister for a power of attorney for his protection, and received in reply a letter from the Department of the Minister of Finance, which he pro<lb></lb>duced, dated November 14, 1865, and which stated</hi>—"I hereby authorise you to execute those plans, to enter into partnership in the manufacture of these notes, and, if necessary, you may as well assist in making the notes, and you are also to bring into this manufacture the controlling machine of which you spoke; in one word, you can do everything which you will deem necessary." <hi rend="italic">He further stated that the Minister sent a letter in English to the police, requesting them not to interfere with him; that he then obtained the confidence of the forgers, and was thus able to obtain some of their steel types, which he sent to the Minister and to M. Kamensky which Mr. Klein was aware of; that Mr. Harbottle's statement was not true, and that it was not likely he should put off forged notes with a man who knew him so well, and who was acquainted with Russian notes, and never did so; that the trial of Holchester would have induced Mr. Harbottlt to examine the notes, if he really had them, before sending them to Russia; that he saw Mr. Harbottle in November, who told him that he had been instrumental in getting the forgers in Paris into custody, and, as Mr. Harbottle was mixed up in the matter rather heavily, he concocted this plan with Radetzky to crush the prisoner.</hi>

They spread themselves a-cross the Way, and Weedon (the <rs id="t17331010-22-deflabel102" type="occupation">Soldier</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17331010-22-defend180 t17331010-22-deflabel102"></join> ) took old of my Horse's Bridle, and led me down, and the other two went one on each Side. When we came to the Gate, at the Bottom of the Hill, by the Meadow Side, they nhors'd me. Butler put his Hand in my Pocket, and took out my Purse with my Money in it, and then unbuttoning my Breeches, shook the Wristband, and ask'd me, if I had any more ? I said, No; but searching farther, he found 2 or 3 penn'orth of Ha'pence, upon which he gave me a great Slap o' the Face, for saying I had no more. Weedon then led me about 60 Poles, sheer a-cross the Meadow, to the farther Side, behind a Hedge. There Weedon and Butler, who, I think, had Pistols, took off my Great-Coat, and laid it for me to sit on. I thank'd them, and then they ty'd my Hands and left me, but soon turn'd back, and Cox felt of my Hat, and saying it would fit him took it from me, and ty'd my Legs too. Then one of them took away my great Coat, and telling me it I shirr'd before they brought me more Company, they'd shoot me thro' the Head; they went away again. However, I made shift to slip my Hands loose, and went to the Crane at Edgworth, where I told Mr. Russel my Case ; some Justices were sitting at that House, and they sent in search of the Prisoners, who were found at the White-Lion, in Edgworth. They were brought to me in about an Hour and a Half. I knew Cox at the first Sight, but was not so positive to the other two immediately, tho' upon Recollection, I was positive to them likewise, the same Night. Weedon was not then in his Regimental Clothes, and Cox, I remember, in particular, when they had ty'd my Hands, wanted to cut the String to take my Clothes off, and leave me naked.</p>
               <p>Weedon. What Clothes had I on ?</p>

               <p>Butler. He clear'd me before the Justice that Night.</p>
               <p>Partridge. I said at first Sight, I did not know him, but I recollected him in less than an Hour, tho' indeed I did not say so at that time, for I did not think it proper, because no Body ask'd me the Question.</p>

            . I live at the White-Lion. The 3 Prisoners came there to drink, about 4 in the Afternoon. Cox went to Bed between 4 and 5, and between 6 and 7, Mr. Marshal, a Butcher, came and pulled him out of Bed. He sat by the Fire a Quarter of an Hour, and then went to Bed again. At half an Hour past 7, as I was going up Stairs, I saw a Light in his Room, upon which I went in to fetch away the Candle, and saw him asleep, and half an Hour afterwards the Officers came and took him out of Bed. The other two were drinking at the same time; they had been out, and came in again, between 6 and 7, as I guess, for we have no Clock - but it was about half an Hour before they were taken.</p>

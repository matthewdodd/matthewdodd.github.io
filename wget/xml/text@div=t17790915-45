On the 27th of August, when I was going with my master's horse and chaise to the stable, I saw the prisoner, Kelly, come out of my master's warehouse with two bars of iron. When I returned he was got to his work; he was putting up a crane for my master. I catechised him about it; he said his master ordered him to take them, and work them up in the crane. I told my master, and he ordered me to get a constable, and take him up. When we went before the magistrate he ordered us to go, and search among the shops to see if we could find any of my master's property. We first went to four or five places, and then we went to the foreman, who was over Kelly, and he said he had sold them to Arkin. We went there and found all the things mentioned in the indictment, in a shop at the back part of the house. We took them and Arkin before the magistrate. There Arkin said he bought them of the prisoner for a penny a pound. Kelly said he took the things away from my master.</p>
               <p>Was there any promise made by your master or you to induce them to confess? - No.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>When you first met Kelly, did not he tell you he had the foreman's direction to take these things away? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he or the foreman tell you where they were carried to? - The foreman.</p>
               <p>Court. What did he say? - He said the foreman was as much concerned in it as him.</p>

               <p>What is the value of them? - They are worth one penny a pound.</p>
               <p>Any more? - Not to sell again.</p>

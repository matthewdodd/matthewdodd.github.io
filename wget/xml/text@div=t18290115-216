On the 12th of January, at a quarter before nine o'clock in the evening, I was in my parlour, and saw a woman's arm snatch something off my door-post; I saw her rush in, and take it; I did not know what it was; I called to my boy who was reading in the shop: he went and brought the prisoner back with the pelisse.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.How near to your shop was this pelisse? A. On a shelf inside my shop, about three feet from the door, which was open.</p>
               <p>THOMAS NORRIS. I was in the shop, and reading - my master called to me; I went out, and caught the prisoner two or three doors from the shop with this pelisse - I brought her back.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Was she searched? A. No; she had the pelisse on her arm under her shawl: it was about three feet from the door.</p>

               <p>CHRISTIAN PODZUS. I was at the watch-house, and took charge of the prisoner - she denied having taken it.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to the oil shop for a candle, and just as I got to the door the lad came and stopped me with the pelisse in his hand: he said, "Where is that coat you have stolen?" I said "What coat?" he said "Here it is;" I went back with him, and his master gave me in charge - I had not been near the place.</p>

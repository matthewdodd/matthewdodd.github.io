               <p>Q. In what room were these clothes scattered? - Some in one and some in another, in my bed room. I sleep up stairs. I stood in my shirt till the watchman came up, and found me in the situation I have described. My watch was in the chest along with my money, in the room where I sleep; there was about forty shillings to forty-three shillings in my trowsers, and seventeen guineas in my chest; my trowsers were under my head in the bed. There was no lock to the chest; I did not see any alteration in it, it was not moved, the lid was down.</p>

               <p>Q. Was your watch and money in the chest when you got up? - No. I wish it was. The trowsers were gone from under my head, and they were laying on the bed; I had put them under my head myself; when the watchman came,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179407160043"></xptr>I dressed myself and went down into the one pair of stairs room, the chamber where we live, we live in the chamber and sell coals in the lower room; then the watchman observed before I did, the tracking of a foot, and a naked bayonet laying on the table; then I took the bayonet with me, and went to a friends that I thought I had then, and told him I was robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing else in that room? - No, only eighteen-pence that I had left in that room when I went to bed, they were there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take any notice when you went down stairs how any body had got into your house? - No, I did not. All the notice I took was a track of a foot in the chamber.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you ever find your watch or money again? - No, never.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I tell you before I ask you a question, I do not believe you ever was robbed; therefore you will be careful how you answer. I see you was pretty rich, seventeen guineas in your chest. How long had you had the money? - I had been collecting it as the customers came in.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear positively that you had seventeen guineas? - I have done it already.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you went to a friend as you thought? - I had.</p>
               <p>Q. That friend that you mention is a man of the name of Drew, is not he? - He is.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not you with that man about eight o'clock in the evening? - I was from four till nine, I dare say.</p>
               <p>Q. You are in the militia as well as Drew? Did not you go and ask your commanding officer leave to go to Ireland, because of your extreme distress? - I deny that. I went to have my protection renewed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell Drew that you was extremely distressed indeed to make up a little money to pay your coal merchant, and had only a few shillings? - I deny it, or any thing like it.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, though you have told us that there was no money left in your trowsers after you was robbed, was not there half a crown produced out of them? - Not a farthing.</p>
               <p>Q. So your wife was extremely ill of a fever and could not sleep? - I don't know, you must ask her that question; I know she was ill.</p>
               <p>Q. Your friend Drew returned home with you after this robbery to see the house? - He did not; he lives in King-street, and I live in New Gravel-lane; I was at home about half past nine; the watchman called two when I called him into my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he return to you house at last? - Yes, he did; and he saw the track of a foot.</p>
               <p>Q. Now this wife of your's, did not you find her fast asleep? - No, that I deny.</p>

            How many duplicates were found on you when you was examined before the magistrate? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, you rich man, with seventeen guineas in your trunk, and a watch in your trunk. How many duplicates were found on you? - I believe fifteen; but if I had five times seventeen guineas, it would have been all gone.</p>
               <p>Q. These were very high minded thieves, they ran away with the silver and gold, and left the halfpence standing, they scorned to touch that? - Just so.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure your trowsers were under your head when you went to sleep? - I am sure they were.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not wake during the whole course of the burglary? - No, indeed I did not; I wish I had.</p>

            Then the duplicate of that watch was not among the other duplicates? - There was the duplicate of one pawned for seven shillings and sixpence, I can produce the letter that my mother sent it me from Ireland.</p>
               <p>Q. Now this Dempsey is a man that has served in the militia as well as your self? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I observe there was a naked bayonet in your room, whose bayonet was that? - That was mine; when I went to bed, the belt was hanging by the chamber window, and the scabbard in it, and the bayonet in the scabbard.</p>
               <p>Q. There is one thing more I would wish to ask you about Drew. Did not Drew tell you that perhaps your wife had laid up some money; and did not you tell Drew that you was sure your wife had never laid up any money? - No, I never said such a thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Your neighbour Drew deceived you before the justice, and gave you the lie to all these things? - He never came till the last.</p>
               <p>Q. If it was not so, Dempsey would not have been admitted to bail. Did not Dempsey come voluntary to justice? - That was not the way he came to justice, he came to the house where the officers are, I was going to the coal merchants the same time, to tell him I was robbed of his property; as I was going by, Dempsey says, d-mn you, don't you say that I robbed you. Says I you are the man that I want.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe the magistrate took his word at the first hearing for his appearing again on Wednesday, at the further examination? - Yes.</p>

            The man did appear? - Yes.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am the wife of the last witness; I went to bed on the 6th of June last, between eleven and twelve, I was the last up in the house, I shut the chamber window when I went to bed, I am confident of it, because I was last in the room, our neighbourhood we live in is a very noisy neighbourhood, by which means when I heard the sash of the window open I paid no attention to it, I thought it was a neighbour, a woman that lives in the adjoining house, doing it to divert herself.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your bed room? - In the two pair of stairs room, the uppermost room in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any persons come into your bed room? - Yes, two men, the prisoner Dempsey was the foremost; about a quarter before one I heard the window open, and I heard a foot go down stairs, and the street door open, but I thought it was in the adjoining house; afterwards all remained still; after the watchman had gone round his beat of one o'clock, I heard them come from the lower room up into the chamber again, I thought it was in the next house, that it was the woman's nurse there, the woman being in a dying state; after the watchman was out of hearing I heard the feet come up into the two pair of stairs room; on hearing the feet I raised my head in the bed, the room door was only put to, it was not locked, I rise my head, and to my surprise I saw the prisoner Dempsey come in, he had a cap over his face, and another man at his back, that appeared to be something taller, he had lanthorn in his left hand, and a naked bayonet in the right.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a lanthorn was that, was it a dark lanthorn? - I never saw a dark lanthorn, the light only appeared from one pane, but whether it was horn<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179407160045"></xptr>or glass I cannot swear, my fright was so great; the pane from whence the light came was farthest from his body, the light did not shine on him, but from him, so when I saw the fight I was so frightened I was deprived of speech, and the first thing he did, was to present the bayonet to me, and said, if I made a word, he would have my bloody liver and lights out immediately.</p>

            Was you in bed with your husband at that time? - Yes. He drew quite near to the side of the bed, as near as possible he could; he spoke in a middling manner, so as to be very plainly heard, he then put the bayonet to my collar bone, fixed it right here, and threatened in case I made the least alarm that he certainly would put an end to me; he put the lanthorn out of his hand, on a chair on the side of the bed, then the other man came to the other side of the bed, and raises my husband's shoulder up off the pillow, while Dempsey, with his left hand, took a pair of trowsers from under his head, he then threw down the trowsers on the bed, and took the lanthorn up in his hand, and still stood to guard me; the other man let my husband's head gently fall on the pillow, and the other man then took the money out of the trowsers pocket, then Dempsey demanded my pockets; I told him I had nothing in them; he asked me then where was my money? I told him I had no money, he had taken all I had; he said he knowed better, and if I did not give it him he would have my life; I told him he might as well take my life as to take what I had to support it, and he called me most infamous names, and took up the bayonet again, and said, if I did not give him my pockets he would kill us instantly, I then put my hand to the head of my bed, and threw my pockets to him, I having been ill, there was no money in my pocket but a single shilling, which had been paid me that evening. He laid hold of my pockets, and shook them, and finding no chink of money in them he flung them in my face, then he took with the bayonet and put the bed cloaths over my face, and placed it in the same place as before; the other man then went to search the places about, he went to the foot of the bed and examined one chest where my clothes lay, and found nothing in it.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that he searched that chest? - Because I heard it open, for the room is so small that there is scarce room for the two chests, bedstead, and three or four chairs to stand. Then the other man examined the other, and there after he searched the chest, I heard the money gingle, and I heard the watch chain rattle in his hand; then I heard him walk towards the door. Dempsey asked him don't you mean to pack up? He made answer and says, no, d-mn it, it would be the way to blow the gaff. During the time of their speaking them words, the other man spoke, I heard the voice of another stranger, with a very distinct found, and he spoke twice in the irish language, and desired them to make haste.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by the Irish? - The speech of the country. I was born in Ireland, but bred in England. Then they went down stairs, then Dempsey returned up again, and took the bed clothes off my face with the point of the bayonet, and told me in case I made any alarm or the least resistance, he would leave them in the house that would finish us. On that they went down stairs into the chamber, and stopped for about five minutes; from that they went down into the lower room, and might stop near ten minutes longer there, and I heard them go out of the street door, and the door was shut on the latch; during the time that they stopped in the house, I used every endeavour in my power without speaking<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179407160046"></xptr>to awake my husband, but it was all useless, I could not awake him; when I heard them go out of the street door, I screamed and made a great outcry to my husband, and acquainted him with our loss; I was a long time before I could make him sensible of what had happened; and when he became sensible, he was like a man almost distracted.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he sober when he went to bed that night? - I cannot say that he was sober; he had been out a good part of the afternoon. Then he sat in the bed, and never got out of bed till such times as he heard the watchman cry two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the other man? Did you know him? Did you ever see him before? - I cannot say that I did.</p>
               <p>Q. He had no cap over his face? - Yes, he had; they had both caps. I have known Dempsey some years.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the cap off his face any part of the time that he was in the room? - No, not that I saw.</p>

            Then you did not see his face any part of the time? - I could not see his face.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Mrs. Luddy, I think you have the most accurate recollection of any woman I know; you have given us a very particular account of the manner in which this past. Did I hear you right that as soon as you saw the persons coming into the room, you could not speak? - I was shocked at that instant.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet, I observe, that from that time you have given a very accurate account; I observe you say Mr. Dempsey very glibly, you never hesitate; you was examined twice before the magistrate? - Four times I was.</p>

               <p>Q. The first time did not you say it was a person taller than Dempsey? - No. At the first examination Mr. Staples spoke in a very gruff manner, and asked me the reason why I could not stand up? I was very ill; they asked me what I thought of the prisoner, if I thought the prisoner was concerned? I told him that he was the man that held the bayonet to me, while I lay in bed. I said in my fright, as I lay in bed, they appeared to be taller than Dempsey, and he was a very stout man.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, did not you, at the first examination, say that they both appeared taller than Dempsey? - I said, that the man, as I lay in bed, appeared so, but his voice corresponded. I swear to his voice, and his back.</p>

            You know he put the clothes over your face, and he fastened it with his bayonet, and he was then afterwards so kind to release you, and to take the clothes off your face? - When he went he took the bayonet with him; if I had had courage enough I might have stripped the clothes off my face, but the fear of my life prevented me.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you have told us that after your face was covered, that Dempsey went and rifled the box for money; where in point of fact there was no money; but the other man went and took the money? - No, it was the other man that rifled the chest.</p>

            Now how can you tell which was the man that rifled the chest when your face was covered? - I must know the difference of the man that stood with the bayoner to me, and addressed me with horrid imprecations, and the man that was at a further distance, rifling the chest.</p>

            How often do you think these threats were repeated to you? - Almost as often as he could speak, his tongue had scarce any intermission.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet your husband lay snug in bed all the while? - When he has a drop of liquor in his head he is so stupified that you may take him where you please; whenever he is in liquor if he goes to sleep he never moves till he has had his sleep out; that is his disposition. It is a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179407160047"></xptr>shame that I should expose my husband's failings in an open court, but the occasion requires it.</p>
               <p>Q. On your second examination how came you to say that it was a man about the size of John Dempsey that came in? - If the clerk took down the wrong examination I cannot help it.</p>
               <p>Q. He read it over to you, and you swear to it, and signed it? - I signed it before it was read over to me; I signed it before I was sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear, woman, that you signed it before you was sworn? - It was read to me before I was sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not read to you after you was sworn? - Yes, I had been sworn to answer true answers.</p>
               <p>Q. You and your husband use some particular words, that I should like to have explained. What is the meaning of blowing the gaff? - The meaning I take it to be, that if they took our clothes it would be the means of finding them out.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you have heard the meaning of blood money too? - I don't know; I heard say, when Mr. Macarthy prosecuted a person, that he would not have the blood money, he would have a Tyburn ticket.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to know the meaning of blowing the gaff? - In the neighbourhood where I live, I often hear the girls say that, it will blow the gaff.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a man of the name of Michael Connell? - Not perfectly well, I have not seen him above half a dozen times in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, had you never such conversation with him as this, if you will say that the prisoner and Macarthy passed by my door between eleven and twelve it would be a good thing for me, and I will give you a couple of guineas? - I never did.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you recollect the evening when this house breaking was said to be committed? - Yes; I was in company with Luddy that evening till about half past eight; he came to where I was at work, about five o'clock, he seemed to be down much at the heart, which I was very sorry for; John, says I, what is the matter? come and let us have some beer; says I, I will treat you with part of a pot: with that we called for a pot, and before the pot was half drank, he called me out, and said he must set off now: says I, where? Says he, on board a ship; says he, I must be off, for my wife has made away with the creditors money that I had, and I must be off; come to Black Wall and get a ship for me, and you will have crimpage money for me; he puts his hand into his breeches pocket and pulls out a few shillings and four half crowns, and one of the half crowns was marked the same as this. (Pulls one out of his pocket.) Then I advised him that he had volunteered once before on board the Tender, so I advised him to go into<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179407160049"></xptr>the country, as the harvest was coming on; and he asked me if I would go with him; I told him I would not go with him; but I advised him to go, and let his wife set off about her business. Then we parted about half past eight or it might be near nine; and then the watchman came to me; when he parted with me he agreed not to go to sea; then he asked me if I could get him the loan of two or three guineas from one of my lodgers, to buy two or three vats of coal; so that the coal merchant should not know that he was out of stock; then we parted; and he came to me before the watchman went two o'clock; the watchman was going about, but he did not cry the hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him any more questions before the second time? - I asked him whether he did not over hawl to see whether his wife had not some money hid in the house? He said he had not a copper but what he shewed me.</p>
               <p>Q. When he came to you after the robbery, what did he complain of then? - He complained that he had lost all his things; I thought then it was his clothes; he declared then he had not a halfpenny worth in the world, but what he had been robbed of.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he mention to you at that time what he had been robbed of? - No, he did not; I thought it must be his clothes, because he had told me that he had but these four half crowns and a few shillings to pay his creditors, and he took an unlawful oath about it. I went with him about, thinking I might see some people in the night houses with a bundle; we called at two or three, and we drank in each house, and he paid for what we had, except in one house, in which I paid for a pint of two-penny; we went to one house two or three times, because we could not meet with houses as often as he wanted to drink, then going with him about and finding nothing, I goes on board a ship to work that day, and the first thing I heard, was, of these people being taken, and Luddy was at work with me on the Monday following, on board the same ship; Monday afterwards we were at very dusty work, and wanted some drink, and we were short of money most of us, and he put his hand into his pocket, and pulled out a handful of money, and said that he would lend money to any one that wanted it, and I saw that half crown again in his hand that I saw the Friday before. I was his bosom friend, nor would I have spoken this, if he was not going to take away these persons lives. I said to him, in ShadwellDock, John, you know what I know of you, and you must not go to take away their lives.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you in consequence of hearing that these people were going to be committed for an offence that would affect their lives, go and declare this story? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go back to Luddy to his house, after he told you that he had been robbed? - I did; and his wife was obliged to be called three times before she waked; at the third time he says, why don't you awake and tell Mr. Drew what happened to you? which the woman did not tell me any thing about, and I went down into their chamber, and I saw two heaps, about six or seven penny worth of halfpence laying, and I said, why, John, they did not take all from you: Says he that is the money that I put there last night. But I declare to you that a cat could not have come in at the window, without disturbing these halfpence.</p>

               <p>Mr. Keys. The money that was paid at the public house, how was it paid? - He had six-pence in silver, and the rest in halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you first heard of his being robbed of seventeen guineas and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179407160050"></xptr>forty shillings? - I heard of it when he made a charge of it, at the second hearing before the justice.</p>

I told her that all that I had to say was, that I saw these two persons going to their lodgings between nine and ten o'clock at night, to the best of my knowledge, it was the same night that this matter happened; she told me, arrah, if you swear that you will do me over; swear that you saw them both going by my door between eleven and twelve o'clock, and I will handsomely reward you as far as two guineas; I turned about and had a mind to have hit her a slap of the mouth, and told her I would not do any such a thing for the world.</p>

               <p>JOHN MONINS HODGES. I live in New-street, Cannon-street-road. On the 30th of June, I was in <placeName id="t18340703-104-crimeloc580">Chancery-<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183407030051"></xptr>lane</placeName>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was there not a quantity of persons standing round? A. I cannot say particularly - I was looking at the brass-founders - I had my eye on you, and saw you in possession of my handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There was a sudden rush given - I was pushed suddenly on the gentleman - he turned round and accused me of stealing his handkerchief. Witness. There was no crush round me at all - I saw my handkerchief in his hand.</p>

             (police-constable F 68). I took the prisoner into custody - the prosecutor was holding him by the collar, calling, "Police" - he gave me the handkerchief.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going home - I only stood at the bottom of the lane a minute, before the gentleman turned round, seized me by the collar, and accused me of stealing his handkerchief - he gave me into custody - there were twenty or thirty persons standing about; I being the nearest, he laid hold of me - I am perfectly innocent.</p>

                  </hi>. I went with a cart to the London-docks on the 19th of May, and had twenty-four fowls in two coops—Salter was the carter—he left for a few minutes—while he was gone Mr. Cable came and asked me where Salter was—I told him—he went after him—I saw the prisoner Brown unloading the next wagon to our cart—then the two dozen fowls slipped down in the jetty, and Brown backed his wagon where I was sitting, and took a fowl out of the coop, put it in his apron, put it into a bag, and <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> it in his wagon—Walker was unloading the wagon—he moved the coops where the fowls were to make room for the boxes which came in the wagon—Walker took an empty basket and put it on the top of another, where the fowls were.</p>

I work for Mr. Cable, of Barking—I took two dozen of fowls and some other things to the London<lb></lb>docks—I left them there with Bradford—I was going away—he called me—I went back, and from what he told me, I got into Jenning's wagon, and found three fowls in front of it—the policeman came up and I gave them to him—they were all dead—two of them were bleeding—the bead of the other was quite off—I did not see either of the prisoners.</p>

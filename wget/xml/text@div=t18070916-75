            . I am a servant to Mr. Rogers. On Tuesday the 18th of August, the prisoner came into the shop between eleven and twelve o'clock in the morning. He wished to look at some seals; I shewed him some; he selected some of them; he said his name was Evans, he was a messenger of the Secretary of State's office; the seals were not for him, they were for a gentleman at the Secretary of State's office; he said the two that he selected out he must take to the office, and he would return with the seals or the money. I sent the seals with

               <p>Q. Did you go with the prisoner with a couple of gold seals. - A. Yes, by the direction of Hancock, to the Secretary of State's office. As soon as I got into the landing place of the Secretary of State's office, the prisoner took the two seals, and bid me to wait outside while he went in and shewed them to the gentleman in the office. I waited about two minutes, he returned, he said the gentleman was not there, but if I would call at twelve o'clock I should<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180709160055"></xptr>have an answer; then he would either return the seals or the money. I went to the office at twelve o'clock; I could not see the prisoner, nor could I hear any thing of him at the office.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you part with these seals to this man believing that he wanted to shew them to another. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the prisoner again. - A. On the Friday following at Bow Street.</p>
               <p>Cross examined by Mr. Knapp. You say you did not see the prisoner afterwards till you saw him at Bow Street; do not you know that the prisoner called at your house with the seals. - A. Yes, but I did not see him.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Hancock) Did you see him. - A. He called at the other house in the Strand; I was not present. We have two shops, one 63, Charing Cross, and one 127, in the Strand. My master lives there. I heard Mr. Rogers say he did call there.</p>
               <p>Mr. ROGERS. Q. Did the prisoner call at 127, in the Strand. - A. Yes; that was the next day after he had the seals. Then he came mounted upon a very fine horse; I went to the door; he began by explaining himself very politely, that his name was Evans, that he had a couple of seals from my shop at Charing Cross the day previous, that he had procured them by the order of Mr. Nepan, that he had accompanied my servant for the purpose of shewing them to Mr. Nepan at the Secretary of State's office, that when he came there he was gone, and he had not had an opportunity of seeing him since; he described himself as a messenger at the office, that I need not be under any alarm for the safety of the seals, that he should certainly see Mr. Nepan that evening or early in the morning, and that one or both of the seals would be returned or the money. I considered him to be in the situation as he represented himself to be, and upon that I gave him credit for the seals.</p>
               <p>- WOODLAND. I am a porter to the Secretary of State's office.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this man messenger in the Secretary of State's office. - A. Not since I have been there.</p>
               <p>Mr. NEPAN. I never gave him any order, nor ever received them.</p>

                  </hi>. The prisoner was my shopman—I now carry on business in Pitfield-street, Hoxton—at the time in question I lived in the Borough—In consequence of information which I received on the evening of the 30th September, I desired the prisoner to allow me to examine his boxes—he did an immediately, and from the top of his box he took, in a hurried manner, a small parcel, and threw it into one corner of the closet which his box was in—I took it up, and have it here—it contains a yard and a half of silk, which I identify as my property, from having a piece in my shop from which it has been cut—I compared the edge where it was cut and it cor<lb></lb>responds precisely—I charged him with having taken ithe denied any knowledge of it—I sent for an officer—I told him I had seen him throw it in the corner—the box was locked before he opened it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at the Crown Coach Office, St. Paul's Church-yard. I was shopman to Mr. Hopkins when the prisoner was there—he had about six shopmen—I remember on the 13th of September the prisoner being given into custody—he had shewn, me a piece of black silk, and asked how I thought it would wear for a waistcoat—this is the thing—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—I told him I did not think it would wear well, but if he had it to have it watered—there was only one young man in the shop at the time—this was about eight o'clock in the morning—he was taken up about eight or nine o'clock that night—I have known an instance where a young man has an article and forgotten to enter it till next day.</p>

               <p>he was inclined to force this thing, or if there was no way to get my son from coming to trial—he mentioned the loss he had sustained at Reading with a shopman he had there—I said, as my son was only a menial servant, he could not bring any accusation against him—he said, "I have had losses at various times"—I said, "You shall not lose any thing by my son"—he said, "Sir, I cannot enter into it; I refer you to Mr. Chell, of Clement's Inn; he is acquainted with these things better than I am"—he said, "There may be a flaw introduced into the indictment"—I cannot exactly recollect the words.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shawl manufacturer, and carry on business at 21, Friday-street, in the parish of St. Margaret Moses—I believe no one sleeps in the house—on Friday morning 22nd April, I came to the ware-house at a quarter past 9 o'clock, and found the police in the passage, and the witness Dean at the door—I had left the warehouse at half past 4 the evening before, leaving Dean to shut up—I was not there when he shut up—in the morning I found the outer door had been opened, as if by a key—the inner door was forced—I went to the station, and found thirty-two shawls—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they are mine, and my brothers—I know them by the pattern, and by the cloth, and the way they are made—there are not other patterns of the same sort—they are not made by ourselves—I had seen them in the warehouse the evening before—when I examined the warehouse I discovered nothing different from what I had left it the evening before, with the exception of some shawls having been taken from below the table and put on the top of it—I had a desk in the warehouse, which I found had been forced; it was safe the evening before—I missed nothing but the thirty-two shawls.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>, 486). On Thursday night, 22nd April, about 9 o'clock, I was on duty in Friday-street. I went and pushed against the prosecutor's door, and it went open; as soon as it was opened the prisoner and another man rushed out at me—I did not know the prisoner before—he had a bundle with him, containing thirty-one shawls; and the other had a lantern, which he threw down and got away—the prisoner was carrying the bundle in his hands; he dropped it—I laid hold of him, and <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> him back into the passage of the warehouse—I put my foot round the door and banged it to; I heard the lock spring, and the door closed on us inside—the prisoner struggled with me—Batten, another constable, came up, and hallooed outside "All right"—the prisoner then left off struggling—I opened the door, and Batten and I secured him—we picked up the bundle of shawls, and brought them with the prisoner to the station—I searched him, and found on him a halfpenny, a knife, a latch key, and several lucifer matches—sergeant Shep<lb></lb>herd came into the warehouse at the time we were there, and he picked up another shawl, which made thirty-two—that one laid two or three yards from the bundle which the prisoner dropped.</p>

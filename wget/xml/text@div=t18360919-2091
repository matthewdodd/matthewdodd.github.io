                  </hi>. I am in the service of William Hill, a baker in Long-acre. I have known the prisoner about four months—he is a journeyman baker out of place—he has been with em delivering bread occasionally, and I have now and then asked him to take an odd loaf to a customer—Mr. Vinall of High Holborn, is a customer of my master's—the prisoner has been there with me when I have delivered bread there—I left a bill there on Monday the 15th of August—I did not authorize the prisoner to re<lb></lb>ceive any money for me—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a bill</hi>) this is the bill I left on Monday—there some writing in pencil on it, which is not mine—I did not au<lb></lb>thorize any one to write it—I have not received the money for it.</p>

                  </hi>. I was a customer of Mr. Hill's—this was de<lb></lb>livered at my my house on the Monday and I paid it to the prisoner on Tuesday—he wrote this receipt here in pencil "Thomas Dalby—I do not think I ever paid him any thing before—I am quite sure it was the pri<lb></lb>soner I paid it to—I said before the Magistrate that the prisoner to the best of my belief, brought the bill—that was a mistake—the prisoner has called on me several times with bread.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I apprehended the prisoner on Fri<lb></lb>day the 26th of August, in a beer shop—I said I wanted him—he said, "What for?"—I said he had received money by false pretences from Mr. Vinall—he asked if Dalby's master knew it—I said he did—then it would go hard with him—he did not mention any name—he said he had lost a sovereign of the money.</p>

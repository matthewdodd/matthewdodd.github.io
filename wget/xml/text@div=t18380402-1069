                  </hi>. I am foreman to the plumbers in the employ of Mr. Thomas Cubitt, a builder, in Eaton-place, Belgrave-square. We were building in Davies-street—on Tuesday the 27th of March I received in<lb></lb>formation, in consequence of which I applied to Vallance, the policeman and went with him to the Hertford Arms public-house, in Little Grosvenor-street—I there received a carpet bag—I examined it, and found it had eleven pieces of wood, which had been cut off the ends of boards we were using to the roof of some premises in Davies-street—the prisoner was employed of those premises—I went there with Vallance, and took the carpet bag with us—I saw the prisoner, and asked him How he came by the wood, pointing to the wood in the bag,—he said, "I took it off the roof of the house where I was at work"—I gave him into custody, and afterwards went to his lodging in Buckingham-place, New-road—I was present while search was made there, and a quantity of wood was found—I should say three parts of a cart load—also a quantity of solder, a brass tubing, and a crash with a C on it—all belonging to Mr. Cubitt—the prisoner would have no right to that property—it was not given to him as perquisites—the things; are worth between 20 and 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

JONES</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long has the prisoner been in Mr. Cubitt's employ? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Nine or ten months—I heard nothing against him before—Vallance was present when the wood was found in the carpet bag—the prisoner said he got them from the building where he was at work on the roof—he said, "roof," to the best of my knowledge—I have never said he used any other words besides roof or building to my know<lb></lb>ledge—he said he got them from the roof to the best of my knowledge and he hoped they were not going to take him into custody for it—these pieces of wood might be used for rails for a back landing—Mr. Cubitt's occasionally goes on buildings, but very seldom—there is no mark on the wood, nor on the solder—I swear it is not an 0 on this crank—it is a C—it is not a G—there is no other mark on it—the prisoner has worked constantly for Mr. Cubitt for ten months, except a few days at Christmas.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I went with Clifton to the Hertford Arms public-house, and received this carpet bag, containing the eleven pieces of wood—we then went to Davies-street, where the prisoner was at work—he said the carpet bag belonged to him, and he had taken the wood from the building—the Hertford Arms is about fifty yards from Davies-street.</p>

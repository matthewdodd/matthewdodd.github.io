On the 11th of July, he came to the shop and bought some superfine cloth, some kerseymere, and four yards an half of olive velveteen, which came to 4l. 5s. 11d.; he paid me a 5l. bank note. I asked his name and address - He gave the name of Davis, No. 8, Crown-street Soho, he gave no Christian name. I gave him the change (looking at the note). This is it, I wrote on it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you write the whole of this, "Davis, 8, Crown-street, Soho, 11-7;" 
               <persName id="t18180909-48-person441">T. S. </persName>
            - A. Yes; T. S. are my initials. I have no doubt of its being the note he gave me. He took the things away with him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. He had no acquaintance with him; he came by himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Was no person near him - A. None. I am certain he is the man. I gave him 14s. ld., which was all he had to receive. I wrote on the note while he was in the shop. I had no other 5l. note, except one which I took the night before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he say "my name is Davis, and I am known at No. 8, Crown-street" - A. No; Crown-street is nearer to me than Whitecross-street.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you any reason to doubt its being the note he gave you - A. No; I paid it away, with another 5l. note, the same day, to a Mr. Thomas, of the Strand-the other 5l. note was taken of a person named Jones, and had Jones's name on it.</p>
               <p>JOHN SHEPHERD. I am landlord of the house, No. 8,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181809090020"></xptr>Crown-street; it was empty on the 11th of July, and a long time before, and is so now.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Crown-street was formerly called Hog-lane - A. Yes. It is very irregularly numbered; there are two houses of No. 2.</p>
               <p>THOMAS MILNER. In July last I lived at the other No. 8, Crown-street, I lived there four years and a half. I never had a lodger of the name of Davis; the prisoner never lodged with me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are there not several new houses at the other end of the street - A. Yes. It is irregularly numbered. My house, No. 8, is in St. Ann's parish, and Shepherd's house, No. 8, is in St. Giles's.</p>
               <p>THOMAS CORDELL. I keep a public-house in Fashion-street, Spitalfields. On the 12th of May the prisoner came to my house in company with another man, who I understood to be Lloyd; I do not know that they came in together - They sat together in one box, and had a separate glass of gin and water and a glass of rum and water; they had liquor to the amount of 6s., the other man paid for it all. There was a third person drank with them, he used my house. (Looking at a 5l. note)-this is the note I received; I wrote "
               <persName id="t18180909-48-person442">D. </persName>
            Clifton's friend" on it(meaning the person who was in company with Clifton) the prisoner was one of them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did the other two come in together - A. I do not know, they might. Clifton paid me the note.</p>
               <p>Q. Lloyd came into the bar, and gave you the 5l. note in the absence of the prisoner - A. Yes, the prisoner was in the tap-room at the time - They could not see each other.</p>

            . I am an officer of Marlborough-street, I received information, and went to the prisoner's lodging, in Lamb's-court, between Bunhill-row and Whitecross-street, with Plank and Mr. Christmas, on the 17th of July, a little before nine o'clock in the morning, and found him and his wife in bed-no stranger was there. I searched, and found some velveteen and cotton there. I found a rolling-pin among some rubbish and shoes, under the table. I asked whose it was? the prisoner made no answer, but his wife said it was her's - He heard it. I laid it down till the prisoner dressed himself. I then found that the top unscrewed, and in the cavity I found five 5l. notes, which I marked and gave to Mr. Christmas(looking at them) these are them; I marked them before I parted with them. I produce the velveteen and cotton.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards hear the prisoner say any thing about the velveteen - A. He said his brother had left it with him about a month before.</p>

            . I accompanied Foy at the time he stated. I saw the rolling-pin found, and the notes found in it. I found the velveteen and cotton at the top of the bedstead; the moment I took it off the prisoner said what do you want with that, it is my property. A few minutes before we took him away, he said, it is not mine, it is my brother-in-law's, he left it with me a short time ago to take care of; his wife contradicted him, and said she bought it of a hawker in the street, he made no reply.</p>

            . I will not say whether it is the velveteen he bought of me or not; I have the piece which it was cut off, it is similar to it, and very near the same quality with that which I sold him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe one to be part of the other - A. It may; it is the same colour, with some little variation. I think one is not so stout as the other; it is the same quantity as that I sold him-the cotton is not so long.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The velveteen is not an uncommon quantity to cut; it is the most common colour, it appeared not so stout.</p>

               <p>CHARLES CHRISTMAS. I am inspector of bank notes. I have been so for fourteen years (looks at the notes uttered to the prosecutor), it is forged, the paper is not bank paper, it is not struck from the Bank plate, the signature is not the hand-writing of the signing clerk, but it is his name. That uttered to Coulson is also forged in every respect, the paper, plate and signature are the same; but one is dated the 4th of August, 1817, the other the 5th of June, 1818; the plate has been altered in order to vary the date. The five 5l. notes found in the rolling-pin are also all forged in every respect-two are of different signatures; they are all off the same plate, and dated the 15th of June, 1818; the first note is also dated so; the hand-writing is the same, although the name is different. The signature is C. Phillips on one, and

On the 2d of June, about half-past ten o'clock at night, I was in the City-road- I was very much intoxicated, and fell in company with the female prisoner; I had at that time three half-sovereigns, a half-crown, two farthings, and some half-pence - I am not sure whether I had my hat on or not: I agreed to give her 4s. - I gave her half a crown, went to a room with her, and staid about a quarter of an hour; we then went to a public-house, and had something to drink- I there changed a half-sovereign, to pay for gin, and gave her 1s. 6d. more; she immediately ran down a court and I never saw her again till I was at the watch-house - I had had a silk handkerchief in my hat, and another round my neck; one of the farthings was of the old coin, and battered round the edge.</p>

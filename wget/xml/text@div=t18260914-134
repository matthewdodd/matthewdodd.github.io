I was in my shop on the 21st of July last - I went into a private passage for about half a minute; when I came back the prisoner was there; he asked the price of Burn's Works, but did not purchase them. Another gentleman came in - the prisoner went away, and soon after I missed a prayer-book, and another book - I went down Broad-street, and saw the prisoner walking with another person; I said, "You have stolen some books" - I did not find the property with him. When I got back to the shop I found the prayer-book on the chair; I did not see him take it from his pocket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. He did not attempt to run away? A. No. I understand his connections are respectable.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I waited in the shop I had ample time to run away; when I came back the books he said were stolen were found, one on the desk, and the other in the chair.</p>

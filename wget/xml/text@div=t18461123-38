                  </hi>. I am a clerk at Giltspur-street Compter. On the 10th of Nov. I received a check from Mr. James Raymond Withair, the governor, for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I got cash for it, and deposited the money on the governor's desk—there were three sovereigns, two half-crowns, four shillings, and threepence in copper—the sovereigns were of the late coinage, not the dragon sovereign—I have two of them in my pocket—these are them—they</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184611230039"></xptr>
               <p>were all new ones—these two are Victoria sovereigns—I cannot swear whether the other was a Victoria sovereign, but it was similar to. these—it had a crown on it—the prisoner was discharged from the Compter that morning—he had been gone a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes before I obtained the cash—he returned in about half an hour or three<lb></lb>quarters of an hour after I had placed the money on the desk for some money which had been taken from him when he entered the prison—I gave him the money—it was 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—this took place in the room where the money was—having got his money and signed a book, he went away—he signed the book on a little platform just behind the desk, about one yard from where the money was—he had not been gone more than two minutes when I missed a sovereign off the governor's desk—no one had been in the room but him and myself, from the time I laid the money on the desk till he went out—he could see the money from where he stood—I went after him with Evans, a turn-key—I found him at the White Lion, in Fleet-lane—I left him there with Evans, and I went for a policeman—when I came back I told the prisoner I had lost a sovereign off the governor's desk, and charged him with it—I requested the policeman to search him—the prisoner said he had a sovereign in his waistcoat pocket, and he produced it on the table—he said, "Be positive"—I said, "I am positive it was on the table, and it was gone"—some females in the room said, "Can we make it up with paying anything"—they appeared to be all in company together—the pri<lb></lb>soner was taken—the sovereign was in his left hand waistcoat pocket, and some other money.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

"turning to some other person in the room—no one had then mentioned a sovereign—after a second or so the person said, "I did; I gave you a sovereign this morning; what of that?"—the prisoner at that time produced a sovereign and some silver, and halfpence, out of his waistcoat pocket—I told him to put it back—Mr. Spiller came back with the officer and took him into custody—I had seen the prisoner that morning—I let him through the cross-door at the Compter to be discharged—I saw him in the office when he came back.</p>

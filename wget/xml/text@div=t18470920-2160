                  </hi> I am a carpenter, and live in Orchard-place, Mary<lb></lb>lebone. I had a lodger named Garey, and one named Crimming—on the 1st of Aug., a complaint was made to me that Crimming and several others were coming to my place to kick up a row and knock my place and me about—I acquainted the constables, and they refused to come in—about half-past seven o'clock in the morning I met the prisoner on the stairs—I had never seen him before—he was with Crimming—he had a poker in his hand and hit me with it—he went into Crimming's room, I tried to get in after him, but could not—he broke the panel of the door with the poker—he then wanted to get out of the window, the back way—I went round outside the window—he saw me, turned back again, and came out of the door—he had the poker with him still—I tried to lay hold of him, and he lifted up the poker, hit me with it, and cut my forehead open—it bled very much—I was senseless after the first blow, and did not see him make any farther attempt—I fell back against some persons behind me—the prisoner attempted to hit me again with the poker, but was prevented by the constable, who defended the blow off with his staff—he was taken into custody—I did not have a doctor that night, as it was rather late—a man dressed the wound—it bled till six o'clock next morning—I was in the doctor's hands better than a fortnight.</p>

                  </hi> I lived in Orchard-place, Marylebone. On the 1st of Aug. the prisoner came to my room—he stood for some time at the door, then made towards me and struck me with his fist—he then went out of my room, and into Crimming's room—I did not see him strike the prosecutor—I re<lb></lb>mained in my own room—I saw the prosecutor afterwards with his head cut and bleeding.</p>

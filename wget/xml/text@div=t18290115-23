I missed a belly of pork about half-past five o'clock on the 10th of December, from my cellar; the prisoner was in my service, but was out - he came home at nine o'clock: I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182901150014"></xptr>charged him with it - he denied it, but my brother came in, and he confessed it to him, and went with him to Vere-street, where he had sold it.</p>

               <p>MARIA TASKER. The prisoner sold me a piece of pork- I gave the same to my daughter, to give to my son; the officer went and got it.</p>
               <p>JOHN SHUM. I was present when the prisoner first denied the charge; I said it was of no use denying it, he knew he had stolen it - he confessed it; I said he must take me to the place, and he said, after the mob was gone from the door he would; he took me to Mrs. Tasker's.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that he had been induced to confess the offence under a promise of forgiveness.</p>

On the 10th of July, about eleven o'clock, my father sent me to Old Ford with a jar of pickles in a bag, to a customer—I went over Twig Folly-bridge, and on the bridge saw all the prisoners, and about twenty boys altogether—I was to meet my father on the bridge—I stopped on the bridge, and put the jar on the ground—I heard one of them, I believe it was Moffatt, say he had <hi rend="italic">done</hi> a man out of his handkerchief, and if they worked pretty hard to-day they should earn 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. that day—Jones said, "Yes, if we work pretty hard at <hi rend="italic">smugging</hi>"—I crossed the bridge with the jar, and got right on the other side—five of them instantly followed me—the prisoners were among them, and another one, who is not taken—Moffatt laid hold of my shoulders, Jones held my arms behind me—Moffatt pretended to speak to me—he said, "Halloo, Frederick,"and put his hands into my right-hand jacket-pocket, and then into my waistcoat-pocket—I knew him well by sight before—Meagan took my jar and bag from me—it was not in my hand—I had put it on the ground before they came up to me—he had got three or four yards away with it and then stood still—he held it in his hand—Robinson came near me, held his fist up to me, and was going to spit in my face—Moffatt said, "Don't do that, let us do what we are about first,"and then Fossey, the one who is not taken, came up to me, and asked Moffatt whether he had got anything out of my pocket—he said, "Not at present"(I did not know Fossey by name before, but have heard the po<lb></lb>lice mention his name since) the other boy then came and stood by the side of me—Robinson laid hold of my arm, and said he was going to look at my hand to see if I had anything in it, and the others stood on the other side of the bridge and saw it done—they did not do anything to my pocket—Moffatt put his hand into my pocket, and asked me if I bad a few coppers to spare—I said I had nothing for him in my pocket—some labourers came by, the prison<lb></lb>ers then began to run, and Meagan dropped the jar—I called out for help just as I saw the men—in about a quarter of an hour my father came up—he went with me down Cut-throat-lane—the prisoners had gone down there—we found</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's father. I was at Worship-street, and heard the prosecutor say to his son, "you stick to what I have told you, or it won't be of any use"—I said, "Is that a father's advice, to direct a boy to swear against a poor lad who is innocent?"—my son stopped at home from the time this happened till the morning he was taken—he used to go to work with me at Ditcham and Co., at Blackwall—I worked for Wright, a rigger, at the West India Dock-gates—I heard what I have stated before the examination—I did not tell the Magistrate what I had heard, because I thought it would be of no use—the witnesses were not allowed inside—I told the Magistrate I had witnesses for the boy, and Edward York gave evidence.</p>

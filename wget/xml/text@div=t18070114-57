On the 7th of January the prisoner and two others came into my shop about one o'clock in the day, he asked me to shew him a pair of breeches, I shewed him some, and he pretended there was none to suit him; they then went out all three together. I have a line withinside of my window, upon which I hung up this waistcoat, exposed to sale. I suspected them as soon as they went out of the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they meddle with any of the goods. - A. They did not appear to meddle with any, but my suspicion arose from the trouble they gave me. I missed the waistcoat off the line that minute they went out.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately had you seen it. - A. Just the minute before they came in. I went out after them, I met them coming up my court, in a direction from Drury lane playhouse; the prisoner being the nearest to me I catched hold of him by the collar and brought him into my shop, I then taxed him with robbing me; he said he was very sorry, he would give me any recompence.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of his companions. - A. I do not know, they made their escape. The prisoner in my shop took this waistcoat from under his coat; it cost me five shillings.</p>

            . Q. Were you in Mr. Marks' shop when the prisoner was there. - A. Yes, Mr. Marks called me in, he taxed the prisoner with the robbery; the prisoner said he was sorry for it, and he would make him any recompence for it, and then he pulled it out from under his coat.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did I not say that I did not know that the property was stole at all. One of the young men gave it to me about three or more streets off. I should not have come back to the court if I had known it had been stolen. - A. That was after he was out of my shop, going to Bow street. The clerk asked if any body had access to the shop as well as myself, I told him my wife had; at the same time before I accused him of the waistcoat, I asked her if she had sold any thing; she then described this waistcoat, and that it was hanging in that situation.</p>

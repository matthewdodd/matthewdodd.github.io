               <p>John Maxey. On the 9th of April, between 9 and 10 at Night, as I was going along Lime Street, I saw the Prisoner, and

            *, (who was convicted last Sessions) standing at Pewterer's Hall-Gate. I looked at them, and did not like them, they follow'd me, I turn'd about at the Rummer Tavern-Door, and saw both their Faces plainly by the Lamp. When I came into <placeName id="t17320705-16-crimeloc95">Cullum-street</placeName>

Crouch bid me deliver. The Prisoner put a Handkerchief
<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173207050012"></xptr> to my Mouth, and Crouch shook my Breeches, and finding nothing in them, he took my Hat and Wig, and went off; but perceiving that Crouch did not follow him, he turn'd back and said to him, Danm you, why don't you come along. Says Crouch, He holds me ; with that the Prisoner came up and stabb'd me in the Hand to make me let go, by which means they both got off. The Prisoner was taken in Rosemary-Lane last Monday by Mr. Harris, to whom I had described him the Day before.</p>

He was taken some time ago, on an Information for robbing a Man in Bishopsgate-Street.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never saw the Prosecutor in my Life, nor never was in Crouch's Company but 2 or 3 times, and Crouch will say the same if you send for him from Newgate. The Jury found him <rs id="t17320705-16-verdict96" type="verdictDescription">

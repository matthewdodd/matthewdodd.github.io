               <p>Q. Was it dark?</p>
               <p>Leigh. The moon was up at that time; a man passed us on horseback very swift; as we were going up a hill, he came back to the right side of the chaise, where the lady sat; he presented a pistol, and cried out, money, money! the lady was frightened, I desired him to come round to my side and I would give him money, which he did; I gave him half a crown and a shilling; when he took the money out of my hand, he said, he had been shot; he dropped some blood in my hand, then he left us.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take any notice of him, or his horse?</p>
               <p>Leigh. The left arm of his coat had been shot; it was shattered up the arm, it was open in two places. He had on a dark blue coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take any notice of the horse?</p>
               <p>Leigh. I believe it was a little dark bay horse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take notice of the person of the man?</p>
               <p>Leigh. Not particularly; I wanted to see his face, but he would not let me. He went off towards London. He was taken in a quarter of an hour after I saw him, the same night, at a public house on the road, about a mile and a half from the place where I was robbed; he was then in the same dress; I knew him by his shattered coat, and I knew his voice as soon as I heard him speak.</p>
               <p>Q. Then upon the whole you are satisfied the prisoner is the man?</p>
               <p>Leigh. Perfectly so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine his arm to see if it was wounded, after he was taken?</p>
               <p>Leigh. No, here is a man, I believe, did; he was bloody.</p>

            . I live at Kilburn, on the Edgware road. I was at Edgware on the 11th of September, about some business; I returned at at eight at night, on horse-back. Going up the hill, I overtook Mr. Harrison and Mr. Mascal, in a chaise, and Mr. Norton, on horse-back; they said, they had been robbed by a highwayman, and that they had shot him: as we were riding together, and talking of the affair, there came a man galloping along the road very fast towards London; they said, that was the man that robbed them; I immediately pursued him, when he came near my house, his horse fell, and threw him; I jumped off my mare, and laid hold of him; the first thing he said, I think, was,</p>
               <p>"Are you the man that shot me?" I said, no, he wanted to see the man that shot him; I and Mr. Norton took him to the first public house, and Mr. Mascal and Mr. - came up, and said, that was the man that robbed them. There was a piece out of his coat and shirt; he was much shot in the left arm, face, and hand; I believe both hands were shot. There was in his pocket a guinea, a half-crown, a six-pence, and five penny-worth of half-pence; there was blood on the half-crown, (it is produced in court.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The half crown may well be bloody, for it was put into my hand after it was taken out of my pocket.</p>

            . I was with Mr. Leigh when the chaise was stopped by a man; he came to my side of the chaise, and called out money money four or five times. He presented a pistol; I was very much frightened. Mr. Leigh desired him to come round to him; he went round, and I saw Mr. Leigh give him something, but could not see what. He had on a dark blue coat: I took notice that he had been shot. I believe he stopped about a minute after Mr. Leigh had given him the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177510180036"></xptr> money, and said, Oh, I have been shot, and then rode away. I saw him afterwards at the house where he was taken. I am sure he is the man that robbed us.</p>

That man's name I believe to be Dickens. I have not seen that man since, until lately. I took the spoons from him; these are them. I afterwards went to a man at work opposite, at a trough; I took these eight forks and three spoons; one was in the man's hand, and the other two laid close by, opposite of him. There was a man at work with these forks. I took them out of the trough. Other officers took other articles from this manufactory. Cartwright took some articles. I did not see, from where he took them. I saw the prisoner in the accompting-house, and Hawkins and Fogg were both there.</p>

            . Q. You are a marshal-man of the City of London, and you are a working silversmith - A. I am. I went to the house of the prisoner on this day. I went up stairs into the top shop. I went first into the accompting-house. I found the prisoner there. I left Fogg in the accompting-house, to see that the prisoner touched nothing nor any body else.</p>
               <p>Q. In what dress was the prisoner - A. He had his coat on in the usual way. He was in the accompting-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in his working dress with his sleeve<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181302170023"></xptr>tucked up - A. I think he had his coat on, I am not positive whether he had or not. I then went up with my fellow-servants, thinking I might assist them, knowing the nature of the business. I saw them take the things as they have just mention. I took one dozen of salt-ladles and one dozen of tea-spoons from the top shop, and another dozen of tea-spoons not polished. There are two dozen of tea-spoons. I took from the top shop, and one dozen of salt-spoons The son was up in the top shop. I immediately returned to the accompting-house.</p>
               <p>Q. When you returned to the accompting-house, who was in the accompting-house - A. Fogg and the prisoner. I brought the son down from the top shop to the accompting-house, and we proceeded to search the accompting-house. I took then these spoons from different parts of the accompting-house. There are about eight or ten dozen of tea-spoons, mustard-spoons, and caddy-ladles, and tea-tongs. I found two punches with the initials of the prisoner, in the accompting-house, with an anvil, which is proper to mark this work, and another punch, with somebody else initials; it is so badly done I can hardly tell the letters. There was an anvil, or a test. I found the punch close to the anvill. There was a fork-press that could be used for any purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing that could be used for putting the forged stamp upon plate - A. The fork-press could be used for that purpose better than the test, or anvill.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you the fork-press here - A. No; it is a fixture; it is a heavy thing, similar to a fly. That tool is a common tool in the trade, but it would be more useful to put the stamp on than the hammer and anvil.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say anything to the prisoner - A. He seemed to be alarmed, and asked what we all wanted. I said, you must know; you know me; I have a warrant; there is an information that you are marking your own work. He then said, if that was all he cared nothing about it. The table-spoons were shewed to him; they were held to him and he was asked if they were his own make. He said, they were. He said, every thing was right as far as he knew.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You did not find any die for the forged mark or stamp in any place, by which any impression could be made - A. No, I did not expect I should. I looked a long while very minutely and very diligently. It is a small thing; it might be very easily concealed.</p>
               <p>- FOGG. Q. You were with the last witness, we understand - A. I was. I went into the accompting-house; I there found the prisoner; he was sitting at his desk without his coat, with his sleeves tucked up, quite in a working state.</p>
               <p>Q. What was before him - A. This ladle I hold in my hand was laying before him, and one spoon. Hawkins merely locked in, and left me with him; he did not stop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did anything pass between you and Wintle - A. I do not know that I spoke one word to him.</p>

            . Q. I believe you are the marker of silver plate at Goldsmiths hall - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. When plate is sent by the manufacturer to the hall who receives it - A. Mr. Barrow, at that time, received it. It is delivered over by Barrow to Preston, or to Mr. Labor, who has large work, who weighs and enters it; it is then handed into another office, where I draw an assay of it.</p>
               <p>Q. That is, you draw a small piece from each article to make an assay - A. The assay is made, and if found right it is marked by me.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe all plate that comes from the manufacturer must have the initials of that manufacturer - A. It must, sir. We receive from every manufacturer the impression of his own stamp.</p>
               <p>Q. Produce the impression you have of the prisoner's stamp - A. Yes, this is it.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, sir, have you examined the punches which the officer found in the prisoner's house - A. I have; two of them correspond with the mark I have.</p>
               <p>Q. The genuine stamp of the hall is, first the lion, then the leopard's head, the variable letter, which is changed every year, and then the King's head, that is the duty mark. You receive the duty at Goldsmiths hall, and pay it over to the commissioners of the stamps - A. We do.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that stamp upon these nine tablespoons - A. I have examined them all before.</p>
               <p>Q. On each piece of plate the officers found at his house, do you find the prisoner's own stamp - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you find anything upon them to represent the hall stamp; the four ones that we have mentioned; that is, the lion, the leopard's head, the variable letter, and the King's head - A. I find the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that stamp you find representing the hall mark, genuine or forged - A. It is forged on these nine table-spoons.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the three other table-spoons, is there the prisoner's initial mark upon them - A. There is, and they all apparently have the hall stamps. They appear to be the same forged stamp.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these two gravy spoons - A. The two gravy-spoons are a forgery, and the third I believe to be a forgery. There is on them a mark to represent the hall mark. They are every one of them forged.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, the forks are the prisoner's initials upon them - A. There are, and they all have the hall stamps upon them apparently. They appear to be the same forged stamp.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, look at these salt-spoons - A. These I am confident, are forgery. They have the whole of them the prisoner's mark as the manufacturer.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these dozen of spoons that are unpolished - A. These are genuine; the twelve teaspoons that are not polished, they are genuine.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these tea-spoons - A. The whole of there are forgeries, containing the prisoner's mark, and the salt-ladles, the whole of these are forgeries, containing the prisoner's mark.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, look at these found in the accompting-house, one tea-spoon and a number of salt spoons - A. The whole of these are forgeries. Every thing there is marked by the manufacturer the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, can you recollect the circumstance of the prisoner being taken up on the 16th of October - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you were spoken to before he was taken up - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to say that none of the goods came from the prisoner either on the day he was taken up or the day before - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. You have the hall impression and stamp in your pocket - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Give me the impression. You are the marker with the genuine stamp - A. I am, and I am confident that no one of these have been impressed with the genuine stamp. When the prisoner was committed I took an impression of the stamp; the whole four is made by one blow.</p>
               <p>COURT. Miles, did you see a fly in the prisoner's possession - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Would the fly have enabled the forged die to have given the impression on silver plate - A. It would, and without a great deal of noise. The fly is a thing used by the trade.</p>

               <p>Q. Have the goodness to look at that stamp, the die; is that your impression - A. Yes, it is the King's head. I only engrave that.</p>

               <p>Q. You are the die sinker of the King's Head - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. In that die, or any other die, will not the constant use and application make an alteration in the die - A. The parts will appear more blunt; they will not appear so sharp and striking.</p>
               <p>Q. to Miles. You told me the letter varied every year - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the letter for the present year - A. The letter R. Our year commences on the 30th of May.</p>
               <p>Q. Then that was the proper letter in October last - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. And that stamp only had been used from the 30th of May - A. No. It appears quite perfect now.</p>
               <p>Q. And this is the impression you have made after the prisoner was taken - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Upon looking at that stamp, is it done so as to impose on people - A. Yes, any person almost, except they are very much used to it.</p>
               <p>MR. SMITH. Q. Are you engraver to the Goldsmith's company - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you engrave the lion, the leopard's head, and the letter, upon that stamp - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Are the impression of the lion, the leopard's head, and the letter, upon that plate made from your die - A. No, they are forged.</p>

               <p>Q. Look in your book, and see whether you received any large of Wintle after the 8th of October - A. No, there is none.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Miles. Is this all wrought plate of English manufacture - A. It is.</p>

               <p>on my property—on 13th December, as I was in Ludgate Hill, my atten<lb></lb>tion was called to some auction rooms at No. 43, Ludgate Hill—I went in—Levine, Wood, two females, and another man were there—Levine was in the rostrum and Wood was on his right—a man came round and showed the goods on a waiter—they were put up by Levine for sale, and Wood generally made the first bid—I saw about half a dozen lots knocked down to Wood, but did not see any money pass—they appeared to be electro<lb></lb>plated goods—saltsellers were put up which were bought by Miss Levine I believe, a lady with frizzly hair—a tea and coffee service was put up and Wood bid for it—it was started at 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and it was knocked down for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not bid for it—before it was knocked down Levine said he would warrant them the best silver, genuine electro plate, and lined with gold, and the cost price would be 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—when it was knocked down Wood said it was worth more than 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Levine called me up and asked me for my ad<lb></lb>dress—I told him my name was Baron—he said, "The lot was knocked down to you"—I said it was not—before that Wood wanted to know if it was knocked down to him, and Levine said, "No, it was knocked down to that gentleman," pointing to me—he said, "You need only pay a depositn—I said, "No, I will pay the full amount"—I told him more than once that I did not bid and that they were no use to me, and he said they were worth more money, and he would warrant them—I said if they were knocked down to me I would pay for them, and I did pay for them—it was the representa<lb></lb>tion of Levine, warranting them the best silver plate, lined with gold, that induced me to part with my money—some other things were put up, which I did not bid for, but they were knocked down to me five or six different times—Wood caused a dispute about them—he said he bid 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and asked me if I bid—I said "No," and he went to the auctioneer, who said they were not his, but they were mine—the first time he put them up he said he knocked them down to himself, and Wood said that an auctioneer could not have the first bid, and that he could not have them himself—the second time Wood said he would stand 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them—they were knocked down to me—they were put up again—a gentleman asked me if I bid, and I said no, and he went to the auctioneer and said he bid 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and they were his, and they were put up a third time, and the same happened again—I did not bid on that occasion—they were put; up again after that—Wood wanted me to pay a deposit, and said they were his, and he said, "You are standing out for a shilling, and if you want another shilling I will give it to you"—that was the end of it—they were knocked down to Wood, who said he had 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to spend there, and he might as well make a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note as anybody else—after that a liqueur stand was put up, which I bid for—Wood bid for it first, while my back was turned—I heard his voice distinctly—he said that he would warrant it the best electro plate and the best cut glass—that was before the goods were knocked down—he called me up again and said, "That was knocked down to you at 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I said it was not and that I did not bid—I said I would pay the money down, because he warranted it the best silver electro plate and the best cut glass, and I paid the money as before—after I said I did not bid for it, and I would not take it, Wood kept on taunting me and said that I had no money—Levine wanted me to leave the goods behind, and he would send them after me, and I said I would take them with me—during the time I was in the auction room I saw no money paid except what I paid—I took the goods away with me—about an hour after that I went to Messrs. Benson's, in Ludgate Hill, with the</p>

               <p>goods, and showed them to a gentleman—I cannot say whether it was Mr. Benson—I then returned to the auction rooms—I saw Levine—I told him that they were not what he represented, and that I wanted my money back—he said no, and told me not to have my mind poisoned by some<lb></lb>body outside—I asked him the second time for my money, he would not return it, and I then went away—he gave me this receipt (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) when I bought and paid for the goods.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Examining it</hi>)—it is Britannia metal covered with a transparent film of silver—it is the very worst electro plate—this liqueur stand is Britannia metal, and the first lot is the same—they are a full service: tea, coffee, sugar, and milk—the value of them is 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in a shop—the liqueur stand would be very dear at 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the whole<lb></lb>sale price of the tea service would be 21<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 22<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at the outside—we have made them at that price—we have not made them for the shops—we made them to see if we could get a trade of that kind—the shop price is the retail price to the customers, which is 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I never saw such a thing as this waiter—I cannot tell you the price of that, it is so miserably bad—it is a twenty-inch tray, and they are made at 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. an inch, which would make it 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. wholesale price and 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. shop price—I never make kettles of this quality, so I cannot tell you how much it cost, it is electro plate on Britannia metal—I have made some of a better quality, which we sell at 60<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. with the stand—the kettle is not complete without the stand—the lowest we make is 60<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which we make to send to Africa—when I said this was Britannia metal I did not mean all of it, there must be half a ton of lead here or something equally as heavy—the shop price would be sixty per cent, so that it would come up to 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I never had any<lb></lb>thing so inferior, but the most inferior is 60<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. with the kettle—we made the sets complete for a guinea for the African market, and we have also made them for goldsmiths—the coffee-pot might be about 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; the sugar bason perhaps 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., I am sure I cannot tell you; and the cream jug about 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I have made them for persons to sell again—they do not fetch them out until they are asked for—I have not been present when they have been priced—30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. is a speculation of my own, any respectable jeweller would not sell them for more than that—electro plate varies in value of course—it varies thousands per cent.—we could cover that table with the silver in a half-crown—we pay 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per cent, for planing and gilding, and every pennyweight cost 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to put on—the wholesale price of this service if it was the best electro plate lined with gold would be 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the retail price would be about 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the waiter, kettle, and stand, and all the others, if they were the very best electro plate lined with gold, the same as Elkin<lb></lb>ton would sell, would be about 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. wholesale and 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. retail—the best electro plate is plated on nickel silver—these are plated on Britannia metal—the lowest is what we send to the African trade—I believe the West End people have less profit than the little shopkeepers in the East End—silver-smiths at the West End put on thirty per cent., and some only twenty-five—the little shopkeepers in the East End get what profit they can, they get from forty to fifty per cent.—I should certainly not be conspiring to defraud when I was manufacturing for the African market—I was not examined at the Mansion House—yon can see through the transparent film of silver—the whole things would be worth about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

In this case there was not even such a definite standard of quality as Elkington's A mentioned, and therefore there was less ground for holding the offence indictable.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi>, <hi rend="italic">for Wood, in support of the same objection, quoted a decision of</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">at the Warwick Assizes (Reg.</hi> v. <hi rend="italic">Ridgway and another, 3 Foster and Finlaison, p. 858), defining the offence within these narrow limits, that if in selling coals by weight the seller falsely represented the quantity, the offence would be committed, whereas if he were selling for a lump sum, and made the same misrepresentation, the offence would not be com<lb></lb>mitted. He also quoted Reg.</hi> v. <hi rend="italic">Lee (8 Cox Crim. Cases, p. 233), where in this Court it was held that the representation of a chain as gold which was a compound of brass, silver, and gold, was not a false pretence within the statute. He further submitted that there was no evidence of Wood's making any pre<lb></lb>tence at all until after the bargain was concluded for </hi>7<hi rend="italic">l., when he said the tea set was worth more money. As to the conspiracy, the Count was bad upon the face of it for not alleging by what means the prosecutor was to be cheated. Such a count in Syders</hi> v. <hi rend="italic">the Queen had been held good on a writ of error, but it had never been held good before judgment. Another objection was that there was no evidence of conspiracy, and, lastly, that if there was any question of conspiracy, it could only to be to obtain the prosecutor's money by repre<lb></lb>sentations which were perfectly lawful, on the authority of the Queen</hi> v. <hi rend="italic">Bryan.</hi>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">THE COMMON SERJEANT</hi>, <hi rend="italic">after consulting the</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">RECORDER</hi>, <hi rend="italic">said, "The counts for false pretences allege that the defendants falsely pretended that the articles were electro plate and lined with gold, and the evidence proves that those pretences were literally true. Those Counts, therefore, fail, and it is only neces<lb></lb>sary to determine whether this case is governed by the Queen</hi> v. <hi rend="italic">Bryan, for the purpose of seeing whether the Count for conspiracy can be maintained. It is most important not to bring within the criminal law the ordinary enhancing of value and quality, by the seller of goods. There is always a conflict of knowledge and skill between a buyer and seller, the one wishing to buy as advantageously and the other wishing to sell as advantageously as he possibly can, and it would be very dangerous to extend the criminal law to such cases. At present the line is fixed, and there must be a false representation of an existing fact, operat<lb></lb>ing upon the mind of the buyer, and deceiving him in such a manner that he cannot protect himself against it. The only means suggested upon this evidence as the means by which the defendants agreed to obtain the prosecutor's money are means which, upon the authority of the Queen</hi> v. <hi rend="italic">Bryan, are not unlawful. There is therefore no conspiracy, and no case for the Jury to consider.</hi>

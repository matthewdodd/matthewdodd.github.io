               <p>Q. Were there any marks on your money. - A. Yes, it was kept in a drawer of an iron chest in the accompting house; I marked it on Saturday, the twenty ninth of December, in the forenoon; it was safe in the drawer there. I left the accompting house between two and three, to go to dinner, and between five and six I looked in the chest; there was gone then the half guinea, two half crowns and a shilling. We searched the prisoner's chest, and found a new pelisse, and the bill of parcel that led to the shop, where part of the money was found, a half guinea, and a half crown.</p>

            . I am superintendant for Mrs. Dolben, Holborn hill. On the 29th of December, the prisoner paid me two pound three shillings, for the difference of a pelisse, that had been bought on the 22nd of December, I put the money in the till. I very well recollect how she paid me, a guinea, a half, two half crowns, and seven shilling piece; I had other change in the till. Mr. Byerly came and picked out a half guinea, and half a crown, saying that was the money that he marked, and put in his iron chest.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have this to say in my own defence, that I am the daughter of a clergyman, and was bred up in a plain genteel way, till the death of my father, I was obliged to go to servitude. I am now left without a friend to give me good advice; if I was not ashamed, I could bring forward those who could prove that I never was in disgrace; they would prove that I was never before a magistrate before.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave her a good character.</p>

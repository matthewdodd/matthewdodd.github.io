I was near the Royal Mint, about 9 o'clock in the evening—I was in a wine shop show<lb></lb>ing a ring that I wanted to dispose of—the prisoner came in, and asked me to show him the ring—I pulled it off to show him, and the moment I got it off he caught hold of it, and ran away—I followed him—I bad a purse in my pocket with five rupees in it—when I came up to the prisoner he knocked me down with his fist—I called "Police!" and be ran away—a police sergeant came up, and then the prisoner drew a knife and opened it—the parties got hold of him before he did any further mischief—this is the ring (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live in East Smithfield. On 7th Dec., about 9 o'clock at night, I heard a noise near the court where I live; I went out, got on a wall, and saw the prosecutor standing two or three feet off the wall, and the prisoner was behind some empty barrels—I asked what was the matter—I did not get any answer; I jumped off the wall, and the prisoner run away—I ran after him, and the prosecutor with me—the pri<lb></lb>soner turned round and struck the prosecutor with his fist, and knocked him down—the prosecutor got up, and the prisoner ran into the Mint, and into the guard-room where the soldiers are—the prosecutor followed him up—the prisoner claimed the protection of the soldiers; they would not have anything to do with him—he came and drew a knife, and ran up Queen-street—the police sergeant caught him by the back of his coat, and I caught the hand that had the knife in it—the prisoner did not do anything with the knife, but he threw it about in a dangerous manner.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">police sergeant, H</hi> 3). I was in the Mint, and heard several voices cry, "Murder!" and "Stop thief!"—I went and saw the prisoner running at the head of the mob, just, as I got out of the Royal Mint gates—they were following him, but did not seem to be willing to lay hold of him—I pursued him, overtook him at the top of Queen-street, about 150 yards off, and seized him by the neck and collar of his coat—several persons called out, "He has got an open knife in his hand; you will be stabbed," and immediately the last witness stepped behind me, took his right hand, and said, "Give me the knife"—the prisoner said, "I have no knife"—I said,"You have, give me the knife"—he shut it and gave it to me, and said, "would not use the knife to you, policeman, but I was not going to be taken by them, it is not their business; what am I taken for?"—I said, "For robbing this man of his ring and money"—he said, "You are very foolish to stop me, I have not got the ring; the woman he is stop<lb></lb>ping with has got his ring and money"—I took him to the station, and he there produced this ring from his waistcoat pocket—the purse and money have not been found—in the place from which he ran there are eighty or ninety large water butts—it has been searched, but the money has not been found.</p>

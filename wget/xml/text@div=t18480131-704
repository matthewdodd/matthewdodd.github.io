Quelch had been in their service about a week or ten days—on that day I went to Mr. Attenborough', in Fleet-street, for good—I had a box of plate—I put into it a watch, a brooch, and a ring, wrapped up in brown paper—I did not see them, but I saw the brown-paper parcel—I took the box to the van—Quelch had charge of the van while I was in at Messrs. Atten<lb></lb>borough's—I went straight from there to Debenham's (no one was with me from the time that I left Messrs. Attenborough's) when I got there, Quelch remained in charge of the van, and I carried the box and the other things from the van up stairs of the warehouse—I left Quelch by himself with the van for two or three minutes, from time to time—the box was not locked—I cannot say whether it was taken in first, or some other things, or whether I left Quelch and the with the box while I went in with something else.</p>

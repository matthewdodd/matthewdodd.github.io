            . I am a watchman in St. Giles's, about 20 minutes after 4 in the morning, of last Sunday was three weeks, I met the prisoner at the bar in Buckle-street, with this iron here produced. I asked him where he was going with it, he said from Mr. Buttall's at the Gridiron, and was going to one Mr. Watkins's in White-cross-street. I said, I do not think you came honestly by it; he said, if you think so we will go to a night-house and have a pot of beer, and lodge it there till I bring proof where I had it; but instead of that, I carried him to the constable; the constable said he must go to the round-house; he ran away as fast as he could; and got quite off. On Monday morning I went to Mr. Buttall to enquire if he had lost such iron? he sent a man to see it, the man said it did not belong to him. It lay in the constable's hands about a fortnight till the prosecutor saw it. The prisoner was apprehended again in about 17 days.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Mr. Buttall let me know of this iron being stopt; I took the prisoner in White-cross-street, the constable brought him justice Welch's in Long-Acre, I sent for twenty my workmen, and desired the watchman to pick him out from the rest; he pitched upon him directly. I have been robbed within these 9 months of about fifty 100 wt. of iron.</p>

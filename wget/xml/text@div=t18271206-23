On the 9th of November I saw Mrs. Wells with a bundle, tied in a blue apron - I did not know what was in it; she asked me to take care of it; it was left on a board behind my seat - I did not see any thing done with it - I missed it about a minute before she returned - I have not seen it since.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Bartlett, who is employed in the market. On the 9th of November I saw the prisoner sitting at the watermen's plying-place - Roach's stall is near there - I saw a bundle near her stall, and called out to ask whose it was, three times - I did not see Roach near; the prisoner said, "Don't knock them about, they are mine" - I have known him some time, as working in the market, and am sure he is the person - I said, "Take it away - I want to put master's board away," and he took it away - I saw there was poultry in it, but cannot say what; a small part of the bundle was opened - Mr. Goldham brought him to master's stand on the 13th, and I said he was the man.</p>

             was? - The mother.</p>
               <p>Q.How old are the children? - Between fourteen and sixteen, as I understand by Mr. Griffiths.</p>
               <p>Q. I desire you will refresh your memory a little; you say the children only came to you; I desire to know again whether the children always came to you alone? - I don't recollect any thing of the prisoner at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear upon your oath that you never saw the prisoner in your shop? - I cannot charge my memory with it.</p>
               <p>Q What do you think about it? - All I know of the prisoner is when she was before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. I don't want to know what passed before the magistrate. Did you ever see the prisoner at your house? - I can venture to swear I did not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known her? - I never saw her before I saw her at the magistrates to my knowledge; I don't recollect ever seeing her before.</p>
               <p>Q. In your deposition you say you did not clearly recollect; that gives me some suspicion that you had some recollection; I desire you therefore to refresh your recollection and tell me on your oath whether you can tell me that you recollect or not? - I don't recollect on my oath; I knew nothing of the prisoner at all, or else I should be very happy to speak to her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the children? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know whose children they were? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they tell you where they lived? - They did, in Whitechapel.</p>
               <p>Q. How far away from you? - Close by.</p>
               <p>How many things might they pawn with you in this way? - There are four articles remaining.</p>
               <p>Q. How many might they pawn in all from the first to the last? - I cannot tell; they did not use the house long; I asked them the reason why the mother did not come? the answer was the mother was ill and could not come.</p>
               <p>Q. Now Mr. Rolfe there is only another question, which is, that these people living in the neighbourhood, and all these things being brought by these children, why you did not take the trouble to go down to the parents house to see whether all they said was true? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. I only ask you the other question, why? - The reason was because I asked them why the mother did not come? they said, the mother was ill and could not come.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were they in the course of pledging property? - It might be two months.</p>
               <p>Q. Then they were pledging things at different times for near two months and yet you would not step to a neighbour to enquire about this circumstance? - I did not step to be sure.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you just before you left your house see this counterpane? - I did; I had some papers that was in the trunk, and before I left home I went to the trunk and put them together, and this counterpane was there then, and when I examined the chest when I returned it was gone; I also lost a paper which entitles me to will 50 l. to whom I please, from a benefit society.</p>

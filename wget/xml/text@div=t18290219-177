I met the prisoner in Freeman's-court, with a hat on his head, and another under his arm; I followed him to Birchin-lane, and asked if he had been up Freeman's-court; he said No - I knew he had: I looked into the hat, and saw the initials of Mr. Godfrey, whom I knew, and brought him back.</p>

             SMITH. I am an officer, and was sent for - I searched the prisoner, and found on him 4s. or 5s.; he promised to go quietly, but when I got him to Sweeting's-alley he ran off as fast as he could - I called out, and he was stopped.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to the London-docks to sell those articles, and took a good deal of money; I met a Jew with five hats - I bought one for a young man in my house; I went to several places, and it appears I had mislaid this hat; I then went to the office, and asked if they wanted these articles - I saw this hat, and thought it was my own; I was so tipsy I never saw the gloves or any thing in it. <rs id="t18290219-177-verdict1021" type="verdictDescription">

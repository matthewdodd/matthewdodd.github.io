                  </hi>. I am secretary to the Boulinnikon Floor cloth Com<lb></lb>pany—it carries on its chief business in Manchester—there is an office in London, at 76, Queen Street, Cheapside—those premises were opened in June last—it is a registered company (<hi rend="italic">certificate put in, dated 21st Sep<lb></lb>tember</hi>, 1869)—the business at Manchester has been carried on for some years—Mr. Colville came into our employ in June last at a salary of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per annum, payable monthly—the engagement was ratified by resolution; I was present at the time—the resolution is not here—he received a per<lb></lb>centage on sales—goods were sent from Manchester as required for stock in London—Colville's duties were to call on all houses in the City of London and South and West of England, to receive orders, and to send particulars, after entering them in his own book, to Manchester—if he received money he was to remit it the same day to Manchester by post—when petty cash was required his duty was to write to Manchester for a cheque—it was pro<lb></lb>bably about a month after Colville came into our service that I first heard of Miller—when Colville was about to take his first journey I asked him if it was safe to leave the warehouse in charge of a porter, or should I find him assistance—he said it was not necessary, that he had a friend named Miller, who was a barrister's clerk, and it being vacation time he would look in occasionally to see that matters were all right—Spreadbury, a porter, was in our employ—neither Miller nor Colville had any right to pledge any of the goods in the London warehouse—neither of them informed me of the nine pieces of floorcloth which had been removed from the London office—I have seen them since, I identified eight rolls at Messrs. Russell&amp; Co.'s, pawnbrokers, Fore Street, Cripplegate—the day book is in Court and the delivery book also—I have looked through both and find no entries whatever to Mr. James nor to Mr. Dewsbury of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—there are other entries all about the same time; there is no entry of the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; there was no sale account whatever of these transactions sent down to Manchester (a <hi rend="italic">letter dated 18th August, written to Colville, was handed to the witness</hi>)—I sent this to Colville.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. MATHEWS</hi>. Colville was our sole representative in London, and with the exception of Spreadbury, the porter, he was the only person employed at the London premises—the resolution embodied the full terms of Colville's engagement—it did not contain the fact that he was to transmit payments to Manchester, on the day of their receipt—I gave him those instructions verbally, acting for the company—they were no part of the resolution that I am aware of—the resolution is contained in the minute-book of the company, that is in Manchester—we have two manufactories in Manchester, but none anywhere else—the books of the company are kept there—Colville used his own discretion as to how long he would be away—we had an agent before appointing him; Mr. Mountford, in Newgate Street—the company would not have allowed Colville to absent himself for the</p>

               <p>or three weeks; it is not a reasonable period—his commission was paid at stock taking time—no specific time was mentioned—the company were only indebted to him the amount of his commission when he was arrested—I cannot tell that amount without the books—these books (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are all upon which I have made investigation—it would have been perfectly legitimate for him to have entered any sales made in the country, in a rough diary—it would have been the ordinary course of business, and a transfer of the entries into the day-book, when he was in London—petty cash would be sent to him by open cheques—his salary was paid by cheque—I have the book relating to the prisoner's receipts—the Manchester "ledger," but I cannot get from it the amount of commission due to him—Miller never corresponded with me as manager—I may have written in reply to any query—Colville had instructions for the furtherence of the business—he was never told that he might be allowed commission of 12 1/2 per cent in addition to other sums—I did not know until I had made the investigation that that amount had been deducted—he could allow a discount upon sums so long as it was reasonable—the accounts passing between Manchester and London were daily, and Miller forwarded them in Colville's absence—the daily accounts are here—I was never informed of the nine pieces of cloth pledged at Russell's—I had a letter from Mr. Colville. (<hi rend="italic">This contained the passage,"It appears pieces of oilcloth have been pawned at Russell's, in Fore Street, these I will get out"</hi>) As a matter of fact it was not from Colville, I had the first intimation—we found the goods some days before—that letter is dated the 21st December, and the prisoner was arrested, I believe, on the 28th or 29th December—the petty cash was remitted immediately when asked for—we had to get the signatures of two directors, but did not wait for the weekly meeting—there may have been a delay of a day—I cannot say two days—the cheque was upon a Manchester banker—upon petty cash accounts there was something owing to the defendant when taken into custody, but only for accruing expenses—I cannot say to what extent; I have not taken possession of all documents and books that were at Queen Street—Colville removed some of them without our knowledge—I took all the books that were at Queen Street, at the time the prisoner was given into custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GRAIN</hi>. The company was established in 1869—it has been successful—we lost 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by a fire—that is not the reason we appointed Mr. Colville; I did not say when appointing him that the com<lb></lb>pany had been trading at a loss—we were not insured—we were certainly anxious to push the London trade—we had a very good recommendation with Colville—I believe he has been in New York; we were agreeable to his having Miller there as his friend—during Colville's absence I am not aware that Miller made large sales—we had an order, the amount of which was 240<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I do not know that Miller obtained it—I cannot say whether it was subsequent to Miller's taking up his position; it was in July (<hi rend="italic">referring to book</hi>)—I cannot say from memory when the arrangement was with Miller—it may have been in July—the order from Rope &amp; Davids, Covent Garden, amounting to 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., was in August last—I know Mr. Edmunds, of Bayswater, unfortunately, I am not aware of the amount of 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in respect of his order—Tunstall &amp; Co., St. Paul's Church Yard, we had an order from and various others, but I cannot say whether that was sub<lb></lb>sequent to Miller's going to Queen Street—I did go to the Isle of Man, and when there I received a communication from Miller, but no money orders</p>

               <p>sent by him, cither directly or indirectly from Manchester—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a letter</hi>) I beg your parden in that instance, I did; it was addressed to me personally—I cannot recollect whether during my stay at the Isle of Man I received from Miller, all communications through the Manchester house—I may have received some orders from Miller—there is no doubt we received some sale notes—not a great many—Miller had something to do with Mr. Edmunds and myself—a security was offered by Mr. Edmunds and Mr. Colville supplied him with goods—the security was never given—these transactions are entered in the books at Manchester—there is a considerable discount; from five to twenty per cent allowed to the trade—Mr. Edmunds owes us a little over 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the other larger amounts have been paid—I recollect an interview between Edmunds and Miller, with reference to a mortgage—I saw it, but did not look over it—I gave instructions for it to be sent to Manchester, to submit to the company's solicitors—Miller, Colville, and I dined together afterwards—I do not know that at that time Miller was pushing the business, and getting large quantities of orders—they came through Mr. Colville, as far as I understood up to the present moment—Miller may have sent me the regular accounts during Colville's absence—there is one in his own handwriting.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">It was read and contained the passage "Mr. Colville instructed me to attend in his absence"</hi>) He never made any demand to me for special remuneration for himself—that letter says exactly what he says, that he is there for Mr. Colville—he never made any demand upon the Company—I come to London about once a month—it is very probable I was up in September, October, and November—Colville never told me that the goods were sent to the pawnshop until that letter was sent, and I had discovered it from other sources—Colville was away the longest from the 6th to the 17th September, ten days—he was away once again I think later on—I have brought here every single sale note that was sent down whether by Miller or Colville—I was present last Sessions when the defendants asked for a postponement of the trial—I never had notice to produce a single paper or book on behalf of the defendants—Colville should have given three or four days notice for a cheque for the outgoings of the London office—he was never refused one—there was only a short delay in getting a cheque signed—he could have had one for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. if required.</p>

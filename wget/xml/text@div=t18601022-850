                  </hi>. I am a sergeant of the detective force—in consequence of instructions watched Messrs. Besley's premises in August and September last—I know the prisoner Holly—I knew him as being in the employment of Messrs. Besley—I observed him on more than one occasion leave the premises of Messrs. Besley, and I followed him—on most occasions he went to No. 8, Union-stret t, Hoxton New Town, which is a marine-store dealer's shop, kept by the prisoner Florance—Holly generally left his employment about aquarter past 7 at night—he was dressed as he is now, in a rough blue coat, and cord trousers—on the evening of 25th September I was in Goswell-street with another officer, named Legg—about 20 minutes past 7 I saw Holly coming from the direction of Fann-street—he went to Florence's shop, which is, I should think, three-quarters of a mile from Messrs. Besley's—I followed him into the shop and there stopped him, and asked what he had got about him—he said he had nothing, at the same time I felt hit person, and found he had some hard substance round his body—Florence was behind the counter—I brought Holly to the shop-door, put my hand into his trousers pocket, and took out these two pieces of copper (<hi rend="italic">producing them</hi>)—I handed him over to Legg—he said that that was the first thing he had overtaken—I told him I had watched him to that shop many times before—he made no reply—on the occasions when I have seen him enter Florence's shop I have watched him there various lengths of time—sometimes as long as an hour and a half—I am not aware where he was during that time; he always passed through the shop into the parlour—a partition divides the parlour from the shop, and there is a doorway through which he passed, and I lost sight of him; I could not see whether Florence accompanied him or not, or whether he was in the parlour—I subsequently took him to Moor-lane police-station—before that I searched the parlour into which I had always watched Holly go, and in that parlour I found nine pieces of metal with a quantity of other metal—it was on the floor, part under a chair, and the remainder under a bedstead, the chair being at the side of the bedstead—there was a bed in the parlour—there was a quantity of metal mixed, and oat of that I selected what I deemed expedient to take away—I produce it, and also some brass which I found in a shed—on my first going there Florence was behind the counter—I am not aware where he was when I found the property; he was not in the house, I inquired for him, but did not see him again that night—I remained there an hour and a half—after stopping Holly I went away for about two or three minutes, to get the assistance of another officer, and when I came back I did not see Florence—I made a further search in the back part of the premises, and in a shed at the back of the yard I found this parcel of brass, from which some pieces have been selected by some of the witnesses wrapped in two pieces of paper—I took possession of these nine ingots of metal, with the brass, and with other odd pieces of metal, and I left the premises with Holly—I did not see Florence any more that night—on the following Thursday morning, the 27th, about half-past 10, I went there again—I found Florence behind the counter—Legg was with me—I spoke to</p>

Besley—he said, "No; but they might I have formed part of 34 3/4 lbs. of brass," directing my attention to the entry under the date of 23d June, "Mr. Trout, Hoxton Old Town, 34 3/4 lbs. brass, "18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—I do not find the name of Holly in the book—I have examined it—he was then charged with receiving this property—I have carefully examined the book, and cannot find any entries corresponding with this property.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a partner of Mr. Besley's—I have examined the property produced; these ingots are ours—we have brass-ruling of precisely the same description as this on our premises, and to the best of my belief it formed a portion of it; I have brought some with me which exactly corresponds with it—these portions bear upon them private marks from having been made by our tools—in my judgment this broken ingot mould and the other piece produced formed one—it is the property of Mr. Besley and myself—we never sell ingots of metal in this state, they are made In this way for our own use.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a metal dealer and gas fitter of 15, Crown<lb></lb>street, Soho—I have seen Florance two or three times—I do a large busi<lb></lb>ness in the metal trade—there is nothing unusual in the appearance of this hard ingot—it is not plumber's solder, it is a sort of fictitious metal which is sometimes brought to be sold for plumber's solder, it is lead and antimony—I can tell you better with my nail than by looking at it—here is another sort—these are the sorts of metal likely to be turned out of a general dealer's shop—I do not find the name of Besley and Fox on them—this is the usual style in which such things are sold to the trade—I have got in my stock, four tons of lead, and perhaps a ton of brass and a ton of copper—it is not an unusual thing for a smelter to go round to the small marine store shops—I never heard that it was necessary to take out a license for that—there is nothing unusual in these pieces of brass—we have a great quantity which we buy; they call it printers' lines, and when the edge is very sharp a printer tells me that it is of no value, or if it becomes notched—I have plenty of it by me.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you mean to say that these have ever been used at all, are they not the mere cuttings of the manufacturers, new pieces of cuttings? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should not think they were new, they do not appear like it to me—some appear to have been used by a printer, but they have laid by in a damp place and become black.</p>

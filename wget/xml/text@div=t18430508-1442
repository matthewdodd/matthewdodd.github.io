                  </hi>. I live in Ebenezer-place, in the parish of St Ann, Limehouse—it is my dwelling-house. On the 15th of April, about eight o'clock in the morning, the two prisoners came into the shop—Thompson asked for a pair of trowser-straps—I tried on one, which did not suit—I tried on two or three others, and cut them to fit him—Dixon was near the door, and Thompson came right into the shop, and put his foot up on a ladder, keeping himself between me and the door, to conceal Dixon and the doorway from me—while I was trying the straps, Dixon had a cloak over his arm, which he seemed to move from one arm to the other—I know that more from the rustling noise and the shadow, I did not see him, but I noticed that he took the cloak, and, as I thought, was putting it on—I lost sight of him, and saw by the shadow that he went out of the door—in a few minutes he returned—I very soon then fitted Thompson with straps, and</p>

               <p>they walked out, Dixon rather before Thompson, but he loitered a little till Thompson went out to him, which was not half a minute, and they walked away arm in arm—the moment they left the door I noticed the empty shelf, where the waistcoat-pieces had been, and the noise Dixon made I am cer<lb></lb>tain was his moving them—all the articles named in the indictment were on one shelf—I had seen them safe, and handled them seven or eight minutes before they came in—nobody had been into the shop between my seeing them safe and the prisoners coming in, either from the street or from my house—none of the property has been found—I directed my apprentice to follow them instantly—I followed them myself, and overtook them—I said I had lost a lot of waistcoating, and asked if they had seen any thing of them—they said, "O dear, no"—I threw open Dixon's cloak instinctively, and he took it off, but I did not find them—they were worth 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker.

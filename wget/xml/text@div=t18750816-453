                  </hi>. I am cashier to Messrs. Harrison &amp; Co., of Billiter Street, ship and insurance brokers—on Friday, 9th July, the prisoner came to our place with Captain Fisher, one of our customers—on Saturday 7th he called again, and asked for Captain Johansen—I told him he was not in—he said "If he calls, will you be kind enough-to tell him I shall be at the office at 5 o'clock"—he represented himself as Captain Schollar, of the ship <hi rend="italic">Robert Andrew</hi>, discharging in Victoria 'Dock, from New York; he said Charles Gumm &amp; Co., were the ship's brokers—he came again at 5 o'clock—I told him Captain Johansen had not called—he then said that he wanted to do some business with the firm, as he was dissatisfied with the other brokers—I told him the clerk who attended to the American department was not in—he then said "Can you let me have 121. or 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account of Captain Johansen"—I did not agree to that, but I said "As you represent yourself as Captain Schollar of the American ship <hi rend="italic">Robert Andrew</hi>, and also tell me your brokers are closed, I will let you have the money on your ship's account," and I gave him 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I filled up this form, and he signed it—he promised to call next day; he did not come, or the next day either—I met him at the Fenchurch Street Station, and gave him in charge—I parted with the 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. believing he was Captain Schollar of the <hi rend="italic">Robert W.

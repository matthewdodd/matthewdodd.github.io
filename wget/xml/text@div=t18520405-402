I am a widow, and live at No. 20, Artillery-lane—I keep a grinder's shop, and sell nails—Scott lived in my house with his father and mother, in the front room, on the first floor, which adjoins my bedroom, which is the back room—on 25th Feb. I bad 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, two sovereigns and a half sovereign, in a drawer in my bedroom, wrapped in separate papers—I saw them safe on Wednesday 25th Feb., and on Thursday night between 9 and 10 o'clock I went to the drawer to get change, and then for the first time I missed the money, all but the two sovereigns which were left—I also found my things strewed about the drawer, as if some one had been there—I had locked the door of my bedroom, and kept the key in my pocket—when I went to get the change this drawer had been forced open—two pincushions which I bad where the money was, were gone—I know the pincushions again, these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—about 7 on the Thursday night the prisoner Knight came into my shop, for a halfpennyworth of nails—I served him—he returned again with them, and wanted them changed, and I did change them—after Knight was</p>

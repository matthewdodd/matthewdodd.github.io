               <p>Should you know them again? - I was so terrified I could not undertake to swear to them, though I saw them at the Justice's.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. You told my Lord, you was so terrified that you cannot swear to the persons? - I think it is the prisoner at the bar, but I cannot swear to him.</p>
               <p>Do you remember saying that you thought both the men that came into your house were taller than those you saw at the Justice's? - I saw him at the Justice's, and when he had the hanger in his hand, I really thought him to be a head taller.</p>
               <p>I believe you said very honestly, being so much terrified you would not for the world swear to him? - That is the truth.</p>
               <p>Do you know a man of the name of Lyon a thieftaker? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What has he said to you and the little girl about the reward? - He said, as he broke no locks, that there was no reward; that they had nothing for their trouble, and did it all at their own expences.</p>
               <p>Did not Lyon say something about swearing that the outer door was shut when they came in? - They looked particularly at the latch; it was a spring latch.</p>
               <p>What has the thieftaker Lyon said to you about the door? has not he said this to you, that if the door was not broke they would have nothing at all? - Really I do not remember; he said, if the door had been locked, then there would have been forty pounds; and I asked this thieftaker, says I, and you will have part of this forty pounds? no; says he, as they broke no locks there will be no reward of forty pounds.</p>
               <p>This was said in the hearing of your little girl? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I take it for granted you left the business of indicting this young man entirely to them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did they ever tell you that they had indicted this young man for a burglary? - No, I thought it would come to transportation as he broke no locks; I enquired of them what it would be; I believe it was only said, to get a shilling or two out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Court. The street door you say was open? - Yes, it was hooked back.</p>
               <p>Was the shop door shut or open? - The shop door was shut with a spring latch.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. How old are you? - Thirteen.</p>
               <p>Do you know the nature of an oath? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you know when you are sworn what you are bound to do? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you know what you ought to do when you take an oath? - Tell the truth.</p>
               <p>What will happen to you if you do not tell the truth? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Have you never heard, if you were to tell a falsehood when you take an oath what would become of you? - I should go to Hell.</p>
               <p>That is a bad place, is it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Will any thing happen to you here before you die if you take a false oath? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you know that people that swear falsely are punished here by the law and the officers of justice? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. Well then, I will tell you that they are, therefore take care to tell the truth? - I was in the shop with Mrs. Bearblock when these men came in; the street door was hooked back; the shop door was shut, and upon the latch; they came in and shut the street door after them; they did not lock it, only shut it; then they opened the shop door, and shut it after them, then they drew a hanger or a cutlass, and said to my mistress, your money or your life; then my mistress said, I keep no ill; I have no money; then my mistress came behind the counter, and the man came and looked behind a little curtan, and took two tea spoons; then they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178612130084"></xptr> put one hand in one pocket and the other in the other, and took what money there was; I did not see what money it was; then they said, they would not go away with what they had; then my mistress took her watch and laid it on the table.</p>
               <p>Did they say any thing that you recollect before she gave them her watch? - They asked her for her watch two or three times before she gave it them; they said, they would have it, they would not go away without it.</p>
               <p>Did they say they would do any thing if they had it not? - They said, they would not go away with what they had, and they asked my mistress for her watch two or three times; then she took her watch from her side and laid it upon the table.</p>
               <p>Did you say any thing? - No.</p>
               <p>You do not remember that you said any thing at that time? - I do not remember I said any thing.</p>
               <p>Were you much frightened at that time? - Very much; after they had got the watch, they took the candle and put it down in the entry; then they took the key of the street door, and opened the door and took the key and double locked it and went away, and took the key with them.</p>
               <p>Have you your recollection well enough to know the men afterwards? - I know this one.</p>
               <p>How soon did you see him afterwards? - I only saw him at the Justice's the very next day.</p>
               <p>Who sent for you to the Justice's? - The runners came for me, I do not know their names.</p>
               <p>What did they tell you when they came for you, what did they say to you? - I do not know indeed what they said.</p>
               <p>Recollect as well as you can? - They shewed us this young man.</p>
               <p>But before you went, when they came for you to go to the office, did they tell you what you were to go to the office for? - No, I do not know.</p>
               <p>What did they say? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Recollect my girl, tell us as well as you can, recollect what the people said when they came for you to go to the office? - They said they were going to take me to the office.</p>
               <p>Did they tell you what they were taking you to the office for? - No, they did not; I went with my mistress.</p>
               <p>Did you know what you were going to the office for? - I went to the office in expectation of seeing somebody that was taken up, and to see whether this was the young man.</p>
               <p>When you got to the office who shewed you this young man? - The runners brought him out of a place into the office.</p>
               <p>They shewed him to you, and asked you if that was the person? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you know him when you saw him? Yes, directly.</p>
               <p>Was he dressed in the same clothes that he had on when he was in the shop? - Yes, all but the great coat; he had not the same great coat on.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that was the person? - Yes, Sir, very sure.</p>
               <p>Should you know the other man if you saw him? - No.</p>
               <p>Why do you think you should know the prisoner better than the other man? - Because he had been in the shop two or three times before he did it; I am sure he had been there three times.</p>
               <p>When was that? - I did not mind when it was; but I am sure I have seen him in the shop three times before.</p>
               <p>What to buy things? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When you saw him in the shop the night of the robbery did you recollect that you had seen him before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>If you had seen him any where else but at the office should you have known him? - Yes, Sir, any where.</p>
               <p>After they had taken your mistress's watch, did they say any thing to you in the shop? - No, I do not remember that they did.</p>
               <p>Have you told us all that you recollect about it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Now, my little girl, you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178612130085"></xptr> saw this young man at the office the very day after the robbery? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was you as positive to him then as you are now? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now, recollect.</p>
               <p>Court. Look out the examination at the Magistrate's.</p>
               <p>Did not you say this several times over,</p>
               <p>"I remember there were several people present, I am not sure to the man, I think the men that were in the shop were taller than the prisoner?" - My mistress said so.</p>
               <p>You heard her? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did not you say the same as your mistress several times over? - No, Sir, I did not.</p>
               <p>Was not you several times distinctly asked whether you were certain to him, and whether your answer was not several times over, that you was not sure that he was the man? - Yes, I think they did say something like that.</p>
               <p>Do not you recollect that you several times told him that you was not quite sure? Yes.</p>
               <p>Was not the very farthest that you got no farther than this, I verily believe that he is the man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>After a great deal of examination? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then before the Justice you never did say positively that he was the man? - I do not know whether I did or not.</p>
               <p>Did not you before the Justice say you thought they were taller? - I did not say so.</p>
               <p>Then did not you tell the Justice you thought your mistress was mistaken? - No, Sir, I did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, it seems to me to be a great grievance that they draw up the examinations in a legal form, and we never get them in the words of the witness.</p>
               <p>Court. The information should be taken in the words and language of the witness, and not corrected, even in false English afterwards; and there is the same grievance in drawing affidavits in our Courts, and still more so in drawing up interrogatories; I pay little attention to interrogatories; the case that we tried yesterday, on the trial of Griffiths, for the murder in Black-friars was as clear a case for the perfect acquittal of the prisoner as ever came before a Court of Justice; not withstanding which, upon the depositions, though they were the same witnesses, I thought it at the best, a very bad manslaughter, if not a murder.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Upon the circuit, Lord Loughborough took this course, there were confessions taken, and they were constantly put into legal shape, he constantly rejected them, and desired the Justices might know, that if they sent them in that form, he would constantly reject them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Now, my little girl, in the course of what your mistress said, you had heard her tell the Justice the men were a head taller than the man you then saw? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you mention to the Justice that you thought it was a mistake? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear positively that you did not say so? - I do.</p>
               <p>Now, when they came to take you to the office, they told you, you were going to the office? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did they tell you they had got one of the men who had committed the robbery? - They said, they believed they had one of the men that committed the robbery; that my mistress and me must go and see whether he was the man or not.</p>
               <p>Do you remember somebody asking you to go backwards and pick him out? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That was before this man was brought out to you? - No, Sir, it was not; for I saw this man; and then the next night they took me down into a room full of people.</p>
               <p>Did not you see this gentleman, Mr. Bowen, at the Justice's? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was it not proposed at the first to go and see whether you could pick him out? - No, Sir, I do not think he did.</p>
               <p>You are sure that he had not on the same<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178612130086"></xptr> great coat that he had on when he was in your shop? - I am quite sure he had not; in the shop he had a striped brown and white; when I saw him at the Justice's he had a dirty blue on.</p>
               <p>As different as my gown and your cloak? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know Lyon the thieftaker? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you had any talk with Lyon since this man was taken about this business? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Recollect what Lyon has said to you, about this man, and about the robbery? - He said, he belonged to creditable parents in Rathbone-place; and that was all he said.</p>
               <p>How came he to tell you that? - When he came to our shop.</p>
               <p>That was before you went to the Justice's, what else did he say at that time? - Nothing else.</p>
               <p>Did they say they were sure he was one of them? - No, but they believed that was the man.</p>
               <p>Did he tell you that he had found your mistress's watch upon him? - Yes, Sir, going into a pawnbroker's.</p>
               <p>That was before you went to the Justice's? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That made you sure that he must be the man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And that Lyon told your mistress and you, at your own house? - Yes, and another man that was with him brought the watch to my mistress, and shewed the seal, and said, he had found it on the person of this young man going into a pawnbroker's.</p>
               <p>Now, I want to know what Lyon has said to you since this young man was committed? - Nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Have you had no talk with Lyon or Mansfield, or Hyde, about a reward? - They said, there was a reward about it; I heard them say two or three times, that they believed it was, but they were not sure, as there was no lock broke.</p>
               <p>Now, if there was a lock broke, what was the reward to be? - I do not know, forty pounds.</p>
               <p>How was that reward to be got? - It was to be divided amongst them all.</p>
               <p>Was you to have none of it? - No.</p>
               <p>How was it that Lyon told you to help him to this reward? - I was not to help him to it.</p>
               <p>What was you to have to help him to this reward? - Nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Have you ever had any conversation with him about the street door being shut or open? - They asked us if we were quite sure, and could swear, that the street door was on the latch.</p>
               <p>Why did they ask you that? - I do not know; about the reward.</p>
               <p>Why that would make all the difference? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who told you so? - All of them; I do not know whether it was the carrotty one.</p>
               <p>You like a good girl told them you would not swear more than was true? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When was it that Lyon asked you if you could be positive to the person of this young man? - I do not know what day.</p>
               <p>Did he yesterday? - I think he asked me just now since we was turned out of Court, whether I was sure and positive that that was the man at the bar.</p>
               <p>And that while your mistress was under examination? - Yes; I told him, I knew his face very well; but he was dressed all in black.</p>
               <p>What did he say to you? - He asked me if I could be sure of the man's person; I said, he was all in black, but I was sure of his face; he said no more, but walked backwards and forwards.</p>
               <p>Had he ever told you that unless you swore to him they would not get the reward? - They said, unless my mistress would swear to him they should not get the reward; she would not swear to him, because she was not sure.</p>
               <p>They said that in your hearing? - They did.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178612130087"></xptr>Had they said any thing of that sort to you before you was examined at the Justice's? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Did not they tell you at any time, that if you swore to the man you should have a part of the reward? - They said all along that I should have a part of the reward if I swore to the man, and if I did not, none of us would have it; I think it was Lyon that said so, the man in the carrotty hair, and he is the man that talked to me at the door.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you ever say at the Justice's or any where else, that you was not sure whether this was the man or not? - I said, at first, I was not sure; then they told me to look at him, and I looked at him a good while; and then I swore to him.</p>
               <p>Now speak honestly, and tell me whether you know him now, and whether you should have known him if you had seen him any where else? - Yes, I really should; and I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>You are sure, independent of what those men have said to you, that if you look attentively at this man you should have known him elsewhere? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you never think that both the men were taller than this man? - No, the other was a full head taller than this man; this was the man that riffled my mistress's pockets; the other did nothing.</p>
               <p>Jury. What induced you to change your opinion? - Because I looked at him.</p>
               <p>Court. There is at present no imputation on this young witness, but a very strong one on the conduct of these people; at first it did not come out, but now it does come out very strongly.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am an officer belonging to Litchfield-street; on the 8th of December, information came to the office about half after seven, or near eight, that the prosecutrix had been robbed; they mentioned the watch and other things that had been lost; in consequence of that information, I and two others went out to look after some people; I went into the Black Dog, St. Giles's, and at a pawnbroker's shop facing the Black Dog, we saw the prisoner and two other men at a distance with him; it was on that same night about half past nine; it was at the corner of Bowl yard, in Broad St. Giles's; the prisoner was at the back door of the pawnbroker's shop in a dark passage.</p>
               <p>Whereabouts were the other two men? - They were more in the Broad part of St. Giles's; he was more up the passage.</p>
               <p>At what distance might they be? - They might be twenty feet from the prisoner; he was in the yard, and they were in the street, at the entrance into the yard.</p>
               <p>How far was he up the passage? - I believe it to be twenty feet from the back door to St. Giles's; the back door is under the gateway.</p>
               <p>How far up is the back door from the entrance of the gateway? - I believe it to be about twenty feet.</p>
               <p>Whereabouts was the prisoner? - He was at the back door, the other two men were in St. Giles's, at the corner of the gateway; I said, to the two young fellows that were with me, look after them; and they went and looked, and they began to move off; I went up to the prisoner and asked him if they sold gin in that shop; he said, no, it was a slap bang shop.</p>
               <p>What is the meaning of that? - I take it to mean where they sell leg of beef and pease soup.</p>
               <p>You understood it to be an eating-shop? Yes; I told him if it was, I would go in and have twopenny-worth; and I took hold of him at the same time; I sent Lyon into the shop to see if he had pawned any thing, while I kept him at the door; Lyon came out and said, bring him in; before we got in, Lyon took this watch from him.</p>
               <p>Did you see the watch? - Yes, it was in his hand.</p>
               <p>Where had the prisoner the watch? - He had it in his right hand pocket; I did<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178612130088"></xptr> not see the prisoner take the watch out of his pocket myself; I saw Lyon take it out of his hand.</p>
               <p>Have you had that watch in your possession ever since? - Ever since that night.</p>
               <p>What did the prisoner say when the watch was found upon him? - I asked him whose watch it was; he said, he was going to pawn it for a young woman, a relation of his; I asked him if he could tell the maker's name or number; he said, yes, he could; I called for a pen and ink to write it down, and he could not tell the maker's name, but he told the number.</p>
               <p>You had him in the shop then, he told the number right? - Yes; after that I left him in custody, while I went in pursuit of the others, but they got off.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Upon your oath were they not Oakes and Petit? - Upon my oath I do not know; I heard the prisoner mention one Oakes before the Magistrates; he might say he had this to pawn for Oakes; and that the two men were Oakes and Petit.</p>
               <p>Did not you hear him tell the Magistrate that he was going to pawn the watch for Oakes? - Yes; I did not tell the Justice.</p>
               <p>Have you never said, he told you at the pawnbroker's, that he was going to pawn this watch for Oakes? - No, never in my life.</p>
               <p>Have you been after a man of the name of Oakes and Petit for this robbery? - No; I heard

               <p>After you took this young man you had not the notice of this robbery? - I had not seen the information; but I had the notice second hand.</p>

               <p>As soon as you went up the passage and desired your companions to follow the other men they got off? - Yes.</p>
               <p>On your oath, do not you know who these two men are? - No, I do not, they were not old acquaintances of mine; I had not heard from Lyon or Hyde who they were; I had never seen them before to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>You searched this young man afterwards? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you find any key of any street door on him, any fire arms, any cutlass, any hanger? - No, nothing but a bad shilling and a good shilling.</p>

               <p>Have you heard any body talk about it? No.</p>

               <p>Have you been in his view ever since you have been out of Court? - Not all the time; I went into the porters room; I never saw any body take notice of the little girl.</p>
               <p>Have you had any conversation about the reward? - I have had no conversation about it; I did not give myself so much trouble; I have known Lyon about a couple or three months; he was there some years ago according to conversation; he is no particular acquaintance of mine.</p>
               <p>Does not he attend office regularly? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You know as little of Mr. Hyde since he returned from transportation I suppose? - I know so little of him I did not know he was there.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Court. You was with Mansfield when this young man was taken? - Yes, I went into the shop, I said to the prisoner, what have you got? says he, what is that to you? says I, I must see, you are upon no good, or something of that sort; Mansfield was out of doors standing on the steps, and Hyde was on the other side; says the prisoner I have got this, and pulled this watch out of his waistcoat pocket; says I, whose is this? says he my own; says I, this is not a man's watch, it is a lady's watch; upon which he said he was sent to pawn it; I asked him by whom; he told me he was sent by Mrs. Simpson, No. 4, Rathbone-place; we did not believe him, and took him to St. Ann's watch-house; we took him to the Cock first; he wanted to speak to Mr. M'Dolland; we let him speak to him; and then took him to the watch-house; he gave me nothing but the watch; the other man found the seal afterwards.</p>
               <p>Who did you give the watch to? - To one or other of them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did you write down No. 4, Rathbone-place? - No, I kept in my head, and the next morning I sent Hyde up there.</p>
               <p>Did you tell the Justice he had said so? - I was asked no questions at all, only whether I took the watch from him.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect the oath you took? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You did not tell the Justice what he said about Mrs. Simpson? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Did you see any body else near the pawnbroker's? - Yes, two men.</p>
               <p>Who were they? - I cannot tell for a certainty.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, who do you believe they are? - I believe they were some accomplices of his.</p>
               <p>Do not you believe they were Oakes and Petit? - I do not believe any thing about it; I have never been after them.</p>
               <p>Were the two men that you saw, taller or shorter than the prisoner? - They were both of them taller; he stood on the step, but they were a good deal taller.</p>
               <p>Was this young man examined in the same clothes at the Justice's that you took him in? - I believe he was, he had a great coat on.</p>
               <p>Was the watch shewn to the prosecutrix? - I do not know whether it was or no, I did not shew it her; Mumford had the watch.</p>
               <p>What trade was you? - I had been a painter and glazier.</p>
               <p>Whom might you work with? - For Mr. Southey in Wild street.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, do not you prosecute this young man for the reward? - I will answer you all legal questions; I do not wish for any reward, but if there is any reward to be given, I expect it.</p>
               <p>Have you talked to any people about the reward? - I talked to a good many people; you know young beginners want to learn; you know you called me a sucking thief-taker the other day.</p>
               <p>Young beginners, sucking thief-takers want to learn a little, do they? - So you said.</p>
               <p>What do you say to learning girls? - I do not deal with little girls.</p>
               <p>Have you had any particular conversation about the reward for this young man? - No more than what was said in open company; other people instructed me what to do.</p>
               <p>You gave instructions to indict this man? - I got the instructions made out.</p>
               <p>Was you so good as to instruct any body else about it? - I did not know</p>
               <p>Then of course you did not? - No, I did not, that I swear positively.</p>
               <p>You never told any body, that if he was sworn to positively, there would be a reward? - No, never in my life.</p>

               <p>If such a thing had happened this morning you would have remembered it? - I do not know but I should.</p>
               <p>Have you talked with any body this morning about it? - No, only with my people; I dare say you talk about business when you are with your people.</p>

               <p>What was her description? - One of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178612130091"></xptr> these persons was something about my size, dressed in dark colour clothes, round hat, and carrotty hair; the other was shorter, dressed in a striped great coat, with blue clothes; I did not know Oakes and Petit at that time; Oakes has since left his lodgings.</p>

               <p>I am an officer at Litchfield-street; I took Mrs. Bearblock's first description of the persons that committed the robbery; I have it in writing from her mouth, and the child.</p>
               <p>Read all you took? - She said that two persons came to the house about half after six, held a cutlass over her, and forcibly took from her person, a silver watch, gilt, and an outside tortoseshell case, &amp;c. one man was about five feet eight, about Pickering's height, brown coat and waistcoat, his hair tied, ruddy complexion, and pock-marked, some blotches in his face; the other shorter, about five feet four, fair faced, round, about nineteen, small curled hair, a boy's countenance, a great coat, striped brown and white; the under coat blue, and the waistcoat blue, and a round hat.</p>
               <p>Do you know a man by the name of Oakes? - I have been in search of him, but I cannot find him.</p>
               <p>Do you know Petit? - Only by description.</p>
               <p>Do either of those persons answer either of those descriptions? - Exactly both of them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Mansfield. How was the prisoner drest when you took him? - I cannot describe, but to the best of my knowledge with a blue great coat, I am not certain to the colour; a blue under coat to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Was he in the same dress before the Justice? - I cannot say that.</p>
               <p>To Dalton. Was you before the Justice the same time the girl was examined? - I was.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect what the girl said? - I do not; the girl told me she could swear to the tall man, and not to the other; and when I brought a tall man down, she told me she could swear to the tall one and none else.</p>

               <p>Court to prisoner. I think it right to tell you before you leave the bar; notwithstanding your youth, that the fact upon which you have been convicted on the clearest evidence, is of such an aggravated nature, and so extremely dangerous in its consequences, that you can expect no mercy from your Sovereign; you must therefore prepare yourself accordingly; the circumstance of your having been well brought up is an aggravation to your crime. I feel for your relations very much.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178612130092"></xptr>N. B. When sentence was passed on this prisoner and the other capital convicts, Mr. Recorder addressed the prisoner as follows: As to you

            , in particular; young as you are, you stand foremost in the enormity of your guilt: at an early period indeed of your life you have attained a degree of wickedness, which I thank God is seldom experienced; the crime itself of which you have been convicted, is one of the most dangerous nature; rushing into the house of a defenceless woman; locking the doors upon her; and with weapons calculated to do mischief, threatening the lives of her and a young girl; stripping her of her property, with threats of a repetition of the same crime; all these argue a degree of hardness and obduracy of heart which is seldom known: you stand too distinguished in another respect which renders you more inexcusable; for, without the excuse of ignorance, and armed with the principles of a better education than your miserable associates, and placed by your rank in life above those temptations they are exposed to; your crimes have proceeded from the wickedness of your heart alone: under these circumstances therefore, you in particular can entertain but little hopes of mercy from your Sovereign.</p>

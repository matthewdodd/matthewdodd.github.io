I have a glass case there in which I put things for shew, but do not live there; and my wife and daughter about 13 years of age have the care of it in the day-time. On the 4th of April, I missed the several things mentioned in the indictment, my daughter having the care of the shop that day.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is your daughter?</p>
               <p>Barrett. I thought she was too young to be examined, so I did not bring her here.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find them or any of them again?</p>
               <p>Barrett. By enquiring I found several of them in other people's possession; or at least I have great reason to believe them to be mine.</p>
               <p>Reves Edwards. I have known the prisoner about a year, I saw him with most of these things in his possession.</p>
               <p>Q. Name what you saw.</p>
               <p>Edwards. I saw a tortoiseshell snuff-box, a shirt-buckle, and a gold ring.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to see them?</p>
               <p>Edwards. The prisoner shewed them to me.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say when he shewed them to you?</p>
               <p>Edwards. He asked me to go to a society or club; and there he pulled out these things from his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you how he came by them?</p>
               <p>Edwards. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him where he got them?</p>
               <p>Edwards. No, I did not.</p>

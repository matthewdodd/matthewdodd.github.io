                  </hi>. I live in Fletcher-row, Clerkenwell. In June last I kept a beer-shop at Vauxhall—the prisoner was in the habit of com<lb></lb>ing there—on the 26th of June I left him in charge of the premises between two and three o'clock, locked the desk, took the key with me, and left the money stated in the indictment, safe—I went out to tea and left him to mind the business; his master, next door, being a pious man, I thought I could entrust him—I returned at half-past ten in the evening—I found</p>

               <p>no gas alight and the place locked up—I was obliged to get through the next house to get in—I found two policemen at the door, and the key of the gas-meter box taken out and used to force open the desk, and the mo<lb></lb>ney gone—a pair of scissors had also been used—I found the key in the desk bent—he never returned—he was apprehended a month afterwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. He forced the desk open himself, a week before, when he lost the key. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. I did not—I never lost the key.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. The prosecutor was aware I was going down to the country on Monday; he only left 29<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the desk for change, and left the key in it; he has got up this prosecution to extort money; he has endeavoured to get my friends to advance money—my brother gave him 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he owed his brewer 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and asked me to take out a loan in my name, and I should have half of it; he said as I was going to leave, they could not come on me for payment, and as he was going to leave, they would not find him; I refused. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. It is not so—out of feeling towards his father and mother I would not bring them as witnesses—the prisoner was appre<lb></lb>hended at the workhouse when he came there—he was very badly off before this, he wanted shoes—I said if he chose to get a loan I would be security for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but would not allow him to have more than half the money until I saw How he went on—it was to get him clothes, as I knew if he got sixpence he would spend it in drink—he had 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a-week from his master—the loan was to be for himself—I took the key of the desk with me—I also lost money from the till.</p>

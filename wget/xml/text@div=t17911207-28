I took down some coals on the 12th of November, to Execution Dock; I left the delivering a note to Fagan, and desired him to put the barge in, and deliver the coals, as soon as it was high water; on Saturday night, about eight o'clock, I again saw the barge; on Sunday morning, I went on board, and missed coals out of the middle room and fore room, but none out of the stern-room.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. I take it for granted, there was a great deal of the same kind of coals in the pool? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Fagan has been accustomed to this business? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Fagan said in his defence, that he never left the barge; and the coals he delivered, he thought was for the completion of his orders; that when he went on shore, a man in the tap-room threw down four shillings, and told him to take it, which by much persuasion he did, but could not judge what they were given him for, till he was apprehended.</p>

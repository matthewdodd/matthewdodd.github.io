               <p>EDWARD DANN. I work at the Commercial Docks, Rotherhithe. On the 10th of January I hired the cart and mare, to bring a load of fire-wood to town; I employed McCarthy for the day - I was to allow him part of the profit for selling the wood - I had known him about a month - he was with me in Thames-street, Rotherhithe, when the cart was loaded; I came to town with him, to take the money for the wood; I placed the cart at the corner of New-street, Shoe-lane; McCarthy ran away for a quarter of an hour, leaving me in the cart; he came back, saying he had got an order for four hundred bundles of wood, at a private house, and was to have 1l. for it; but first of all, I was to have one hundred and fifty in a basket to take down a court, as he said I could not take the horse down there - I went away, to deliver two hundred bundles, leaving him in care of the cart; when I returned, the horse and cart were gone - I found the mare and cart within half a mile of my house, at Rotherhithe, but the wood was gone- nobody was with the horse; I had not seen the other prisoners all day - I knew King before, but not Lee.</p>

            . I am a timber-dealer. On the 10th of January I saw McCarthy in the watch-house, which is opposite my house - I went to him and told him he had better make a confession; I afterwards heard him and King talking together - they did not know I was present - McCarthy said to King, "What are you here for?" he said, "You know;" McCarthy said, "I do not;" he said,"Oh, yes, you do; if you had not stated what you knew about the wood, yesterday I should not have been here; if you had not said what you did to Penny - I will get you transported, if I can."</p>

            . I live in Fleet-market. McCarthy called there, on Monday morning, and asked if I wanted any wood - he called again in the evening, with Mrs. Thompson; I said I was busy, and they had better go to my other house, in Blackfriars-road - they were to have left five hundred bundles there, but only left four hundred- I had paid them for five hundred; they called with some more on Thursday - McCarthy and Lee were present then.</p>

             M'CARTY sworn. - I am a watchman<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110021"></xptr>near Mr. Clarke's: I was calling half past eleven, and a neighbour called to me to call him up at four o'clock, and as I was putting the figure of four upon the shutter, I heard the foot of the beast coming, and I put my lanthorn behind me, and the prisoner came up with it; I had known the ass four years, I knew him again directly; when I first saw him, he was about six yards from the stable-door; I know the prisoner very well, I spoke to him in his name, he went by the name of Foreman, I stopped the jack-ass, and while I was stopping the jack-ass, he threw the halter over his back and ran away, and I took the jack-ass back to the stable; then I called up Tyler, the landlord of the stable, he called up Clarke, and I told him who the man was; about one o'clock that morning the prisoner came by again, with two women; I did not stop him, because Clarke told me there was such a gang of them I should be knocked on the head.</p>
               <p>JOHN KEENE sworn. - My partner told me, about half past eleven o'clock, that Mr. Clarke's stable had been broke open, and he asked me if I had seen Foreman, and told me what had happened; at one o'clock I saw Foreman with two women, and he asked me to give him some gin; that is all I know about it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I went to market and bought some goods, and when I came back, I was told Clarke had been to get an officer to take me up; says I, if I have done any misdemeanour, or any thing wrong, I will go to him directly; I went to him, and told him I would go with him any where, and I went with him to the office.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Clarke.) Did he call upon you the next morning? - A. Yes; he called upon me, and said, Clarke, do you say I broke your stable-door open; I said, no, I cannot say you did, but there are people to prove you did; he said I was a d-d liar; he did not offer to go with me till the watchman came and said he was the man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I staid there with him an hour.</p>
               <p>Clarke. He did not stay ten minutes; I went to the top of our place to get an officer, and I could not get him, and then I went with him myself.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He went and left me there by myself.</p>
               <p>Clarke. M'Carty was in the room, and my wife.</p>
               <p>M'Carty. Clarke left me in the room all the time he was gone.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called James Woodman, who had known him three or four months, and gave him a good character. <rs id="t17990911-7-verdict35" type="verdictDescription">

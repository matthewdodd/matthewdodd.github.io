            , the prisoner at the bar. The prisoner asked me what o'clock it was; I took out my watch to see what o'clock it was, and he took it by force out of my hand, and ran away.</p>
               <p>As it was dark at this time that the robbery happened; how do you venture to ascertain that the prisoner was the man? - There was no other person with me; he went out with me to see me safe home. I did not know him before that night. He continued with me till the robbery happened. I went out of Bray's-buildings.</p>
               <p>What, from a publick house? - No.</p>
               <p>From a private house? - Yes. I happened to be with him at the same house.</p>
               <p>What was the house? - It was a house of ill-fame.</p>
               <p>Was you sober? - No; I cannot say I was right sober.</p>
               <p>Was you so far in liquor as not to know what happened to you? - I was sober enough to know what happened to me.</p>
               <p>And you are sure it was the man that accompanied you from the house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How soon afterwards was the prisoner apprehended? - He was taken up on the Sunday night; I was robbed on the Thursday.</p>
               <p>Have you ever met with your watch again? - Yes, I have seen it since, from a pawnbroker's.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys, prisoner's counsel. What are you? - A <rs id="t17890114-63-viclabel327" type="occupation">groom</rs>

               <p>Do not you know that he is? - I cannot say that he is; I have heard say he was; I have heard him say so.</p>
               <p>Where had you been before you got to this house where you met with the prisoner? - I had been to Chancery-lane.</p>
               <p>What time was it that you met with the prisoner? - I cannot say: I was not sober when I came into the house, nor very tipsy.</p>
               <p>Where did you dine? - I do not know I had any dinner; I had been to many publick-houses.</p>
               <p>How many publick-houses do you think<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178901140089"></xptr>you think you might have been at? - Three or four.</p>
               <p>Can you say you did not go to more than four? - I cannot say positively.</p>
               <p>What time might you go into the first publick-house? - I do not recollect: about ten in the morning.</p>
               <p>From ten in the morning till ten at night, you had been drinking from publick-house to publick-house, the whole of the day? - No.</p>
               <p>You had drank at all the publick-houses? - Possibly I might.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect whether you had or not? - I do not.</p>
               <p>How much might you drink at this house, when you met with the prisoner? - We had two pots of beer, and sixpenny-worth of gin.</p>
               <p>Have you recollection enough to know who might pay for this, when you was there? - I paid for some of it.</p>
               <p>Will you swear that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not the prisoner advance you money while you was there? - I paid three-halfpence for the last pot; I had half-a-crown.</p>
               <p>Court. Was that when you came into the last house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Will you venture to say that the prisoner did not advance you money while you was in the house? - No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Will you swear that, in the state in which you was? - Yes, I will swear, so far that he lent me no money.</p>
               <p>Did he pay no money for you? - I do not know that he did: we had but very little conversation; we had only one pot of beer at the last, I had the other before.</p>
               <p>Was any body else with you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Will you again (young man, be cautious) take upon yourself to say, that, for some purposes in that house, he did not lend you money, or pay money for you? - I swear he did not lend me any.</p>
               <p>What time was it before you quitted the house? - Between eleven and twelve. I cannot say positively.</p>
               <p>How far is Bray's-buildings from Duke-street? - Goes into Duke-street.</p>
               <p>You say you pulled out your watch? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You was sober enough to know what you was doing at that time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Can you recollect what you said to him at the time? - I said I could tell, if he would give me time; and he took the watch out of my hand in the mean time.</p>
               <p>Did not you say, as you have laid out some money for me, you shall keep my watch till I see you again? - No.</p>
               <p>This struck you as very uncivil treatment, on his part. Perhaps you called out, stop thief? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>You might have got your watch again? - I might, if I had called out, perhaps; they might have stopped him.</p>
               <p>What became of yourself after that? - I went directly home.</p>
               <p>What time was it when you got home? - Twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>No more than twelve? - No.</p>
               <p>Then as soon as the man had taken your watch, you took no care about it, but went directly home? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When did you see the man afterwards? - On Sunday night; he was at the same house.</p>
               <p>Did you go there to look for him? - I went before, but he was not there: on the Sunday night, the man of the house came to tell me he was there.</p>
               <p>Did not you come by desire of the prisoner? - No.</p>
               <p>Did not he tell you that the prisoner was there waiting for you? - No.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath? - No.</p>
               <p>Did not you know where to find the prisoner? - No.</p>
               <p>When you came there, did not the prisoner tell you, you had not paid him that money which you ought to have paid him? - No.</p>
               <p>Between the Thursday and the Sunday, you gave yourself no farther trouble about it? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Court. What did you do? - I applied<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178901140090"></xptr>to one of the runners, to take him where they could find him.</p>
               <p>What runner? - Mr. Murray. I forget his name; it is Blacketer.</p>
               <p>Why do you talk about Murray? - I went for him, and could not find him; I never saw either of them before. I was recommended to go to Murray.</p>
               <p>Who recommended you? - A coachman.</p>
               <p>Are you in service now? - No; I left my place last Saturday.</p>

I was present.</p>

               <p>I went to search the prisoner's lodgings; he told me they were his lodgings; I searched the prisoner, and found two keys in his pocket; I asked him what keys they were. I left the prisoner at the office while I went to his lodgings; the prisoner told me that the great key was the key of a yard where his master's carriage used to stand, and the small key was the key of his box; I opened the box with the key that I took from the prisoner; the first thing that I found was a seal; and the prosecutor was there, he said that was his; then I searched all over the box to find the watch, as I found the seal; and I found several letters there, and I felt all the letters; and in one of the letters, I found the duplicate of the watch; I went immediately to the pawnbroker's, and fetched him down to the office.</p>

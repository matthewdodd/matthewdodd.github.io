I am a labourer and live at No. 9, St. Ann's Lane, Westminster—Thomas Butler lodged in the same house, in a room under me—John Butler lodged at No. 4, Taylor's Buildings—on 28th Dec., at half past 10 o'clock at night, I was in my room; the two prisoners came; John came in first, and spoke first; he said, "Now we have got you," and he hit me on the head with his fist—I could not see whether he had any thing in his hand—he broke my cap in two places—Thomas Butler then came up with a knife and struck me on the nose; I fell down, and John Butler kept kicking me on the sides—my daughter came up and begged them not to kill me—the constable came up and they were taken in charge—I had never had a word with either of them in my life—I was sober.</p>

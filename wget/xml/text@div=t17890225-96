               <p>Last Wednesday morning about half past three o'clock, I and my brother patrol heard a horse coming down the back road from the High-street, Hampstead; I stopped<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178902250119"></xptr>the man and the mare; I said where are you going friend, at this time of the morning? he jumped off the mare hoping to run away, he got two or three yards; we took him and examined him, as to whom the mare belonged; and he said he was to have a pot of beer to come through Hampstead town with the mare, and was upon her.</p>
               <p>How far is it from Hendon Common where you stopt him? - About a mile and a half; we took the mare to the Black Boy and Still; by the magistrate's order.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether Mr. Cooper saw the mare afterwards? - He saw her the same day, about three o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>The same mare you had taken from the prisoner? - Yes.</p>

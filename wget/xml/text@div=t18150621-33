The prisoner at the bar came into the shop on the 24th of May, he asked me to look him out some halfpence with lowered edges to them. I told him I had something else to do, and I went into the parlour, he followed me; I was very much alarmed. I went out and called Mr. Kirkley, as if he was at home. I saw the prisoner take the watch off the mantle piece. He was frightened, put it down again, and ran off. My husband came home almost immediately and I told him what had happened; and he went after the prisoner.</p>

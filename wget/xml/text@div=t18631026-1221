I live in Burton-street, Burton-crescent—I am the father of Goodwin—after he had been taken in custody I saw him in Newgate—he made a communication to me—I know the prisoner Nicholson—I have seen him come to my house—he came there on the morning that my son was apprehended, the 1st October, about twenty minutes after 8—my wife asked him where my son was, and begged him to tell her—he said he did not know where he was—she said he must know something about it as the detective has been there and searched his desk—I believe that was all he said for he turned round, and left the room—he appeared greatly excited.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been living with the prisoner for eleven years—I am not married to him—I live at No. 3, New-street—on Wednesday, the 26th of June, he went out to the Rockingham Arms, at the corner of the Kent-road—I went there to him, and remained there about two hours—we then came across the Kent-road—it was then about half-past twelve o'clock—the prisoner was intoxicated—at we came along he said I had been sending some boys after him to <hi rend="italic">chuck</hi> stones at him—I had not done so—he wanted to go into the Weymouth Arms, Weymouth-street, to have more drink—I refused, and said I would have nothing more to drink—directly I said those words, he put one arm round ray neck, and then I felt the knife on the right side of my neck—I struggled and called out as well as I could—I had not struck him, nor had any blows passed between us before—a great quantity of blood came from the wound—I did not see any thing in his hand—I fell with faint ness, and he was on the ground as well as me; I remember that—I was taken to the doctor at the corner of the London-road—the wound was sewed up, and I was conveyed to Guy's Hospital—I have been there ever since—I know this to be the prisoner's knife—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a penknife.</hi>)</p>

                  </hi>. I was passing through Weymouth-street on the 26th of June, about one o'clock in the day—I saw the prisoner and prosecutrix—I heard the woman say, "Poor children"—shortly afterwards I heard a scuffling ensue—I looked round, and observed the prisoner, as I thought, throttling the woman—I ran back, and when I had come up to them they were on the ground together, the man uppermost—I observed a penknife in his right hand, and the blood was flowing very freely from the woman's throat—I was in the act of stooping, when the prisoner dropped the knife, which I picked up, and gave to the policeman—he said he hoped he had killed her, and that he did it because he loved her—he was taken to the station-house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, in the London-road. Blog was brought into my house on the 26th of June, with a very severe cut across the threat, extending three or four inches, but not particularly deep—it was bleeding very profusely, and had a very ragged nasty appearance with it—I should have imagined it was inflicted with some instrument not very sharp—I made pressure on the throat, and found the blood ceased on making that pressure, therefore I ceased to examine more minutely—I got an assistant to continue the pressure, while I got a needle and thread and sewed it up—she was very faint—I should imagine it to be of a dangerous nature; but finding it yield to pressure I did not examine it farther, but continued the pressure, thinking that best—I sent her to Guy's Hospital.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I apprehended the prisoner—I neither threatened or made him any promise—I told him what he had to say be had better keep to say before the Magistrate; any thing he said to me I must give in evidence before the Magistrate—he did not appear to be drunk—he said she was not his wife, but she had lived with him eleven years; he loved her, and he was determined that no other man should enjoy her; if she was dead he would be happy—this was as we were walking along—he appeared perfectly cool then—when he got near the station-house he became a little agitated, and wished me to keep the crowd a little way behind from gazing on him—there was a great crowd—there was a considerable quantity of blood in front of his frock, which he gath<lb></lb>ered up to hide from the crowd—when he got to the station-house I asked him to pull it off, which he did—he fell into a chair, and fainted, and ex<lb></lb>claimed, "Jesus Christ, have mercy on me"—I should have supposed him drunk at that time, had I not seen him before—he became so very nervous and tremulous, and the perspiration and tears came over his face—he called for water, and drank about a pint—he remained in that state before the Magistrate, and as long as I saw him that day, for three hours he was in that state of agitation—I could not see any difference.</p>

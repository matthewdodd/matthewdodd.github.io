                  </hi>. I am a china dealer at 87, Lupus Street, Pamlico—I never dealt with the Ditchling Potteries Company—on the 29th September the prisoner came and said that he came from Johnson and Co., the Ditchling Potteries, Battersea, and ordered two dozen goblets, two dozen wine-glasses, a decanter, and some other articles—I believed his statement that he was authorized by Johnson and Co., and in consequence of that I sent my assistant with the goods at the time he indicated, between 6 and 7 o'clock in the evening—I ordered him to bring either money or goods back and he brought neither—only this letter, it is in Gray's handwriting—I also got another letter signed "J. Gray."</p>

I am errand boy to Mr. Macmullen—I remember the prisoner at the bar ordering goods which I afterwards took to the address he gave—that address was Mr. Johnson, Ditchling Potteries, Battersea—I was taking them there when he met me the other side of the bridge—he told me the Pottery was shut up and I could not get in, would I take them to Orkney Street, Battersea, and when we got into Lower Wandsworth Road he said he had no money, and went into a paper shop while I waited outside—I did not see what he did there—when we got up to Orkney Street he gave me a letter—it was in an envelope—that letter I gave to my master.</p>

I did not authorise the prisoner to order goods of Mr. Macmullen—he is not a customer of ours—I am not a customer of his—he has had no goods at all from the Ditchling Potteries Company—I am the sole agent in London of that Company—the letters produced are in the prisoner's handwriting—I did not sign them, or either of them—I was at home at Clapham when he wrote the last letter—my employers came down to see his father about the goods, and his father comes up to my office, and Mr. Johnson goes down to the prisoner's house, and it was arranged that his father was to come up next day with Graham, and Graham would not come—Graham was to come up at 4 o'clock the next afternoon, and I waited till 4 o'clock, and then went to see Mr. Johnson—Mr. Macmullen's boy and Graham came almost at the same time, almost met on the steps—Graham ran and got under the table—the boy left the note, and I said to Graham "Here is somebody for you," and he ran away as if he was frightened—he did not say anything afterwards; he said he had ordered the goods.</p>

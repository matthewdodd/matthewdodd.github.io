               <p>Q.Had you any other five-pound note? - A. No, I never changed one in my life before; I marked the note with my own name, at the time I parted with it, by the desire of the person I gave it to.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that note, and see if it has your mark upon it? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Garrow. I am al bouring man, at Hampton-court: On Monday, the 11th of May, in consequence of information, I went in pursuit of two women, and a man in a cart; I first went the London road, and after some information, I took the lewerl road; I was on horseback; in about a quarter of an hour, or twenty minutes, I overtook the horse and cart, with two women and a man in it.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a horse was it? - A. A little bay poney; I rode on the off side of them, and asked how far they were going; the man told me to Ewell.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you address them, as one traveller may ask another? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Not so as to excite any alarm? - A. No; I then said, you are the people that have just changed a note at Hampton-court, and you must return back along with me; then one of them, I cannot tell which, said, I do not know that we have been at Hampton-court; I told them they had bought a loaf of sugar, and so much tea; then one of them, but I cannot say which, said, if we did change a note, they should have looked to it at the time; we had nothing to do with it; I laid hold of the horse, and turned him round.</p>
               <p>Q.Recollect if any thing occurs to you, that the man said particularly? - A. I don't recollect any thing particular; I turned the horse round, and brought them back, as nigh as I can guess, one hundred yards, all three of them in the cart; then the man said, I will not go any further, you have nothing to do with me; then I said, I will go to Ewell, and fetch a chaise, and bring you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180107010035"></xptr>backs, upon that, the man returned his horse; the women got out, and he went on towards Ewell, and offered to give me change for the note; that was before the horse was turned round.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect which of them spoke, and what was said? - A. I cannot say which of them it was; but one of them said, we will give you change for the note, what more do you require of us; I told them I had nothing to do with their note or their money, they should go back with me; and then I turned the horse; the first time after the man was gone, the women came back with me almost to the Red-lion, walking alongside.</p>

               <p>Q. How far is that Red-lion from Hampton-court? - A. About four miles.</p>
               <p>Q.What time was it? - A.About ten o'clock, or it might be a little after, it was very dark; they went with me as far as the orchard hedge; one of the women, Mrs. Thomas, put her gown tail over her head, and jumped over the ditch, on to the common; I could not get the horse over; I got off and followed, but she was out of my sight in an instant, being so dark; and while I was pursuing her; I lost the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you since seen the person who is called Miriam? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is she the person who was with the two prisoners? - A. Yes; she was the other person; she was then in black.</p>
               <p>Q.Who was the man that you saw in the cart? - A.That is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the two persons at the bar, and Miriam, were the three persons, who were in the cart; - A. Yes.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180107010036"></xptr>Q.What application did he make to you? - A.He came to me on a Friday night, a little time after Christmas; he asked me if I could get him such articles as these forged notes; I told him I would try what I could do in the morning, and in the morning he came to our house, and I went with him up into Kenyon-street, and there I left him while I went to Cartwright's, in Livery-street; he gave me two notes to purchase them with.</p>
               <p>Q.What notes did he give you? - A. They were Bank of England notes, I believe; they were lapped up, and I did not open them: I received from Cartwright a small parcel of notes, but did not open them.</p>
               <p>Q.Could you see that they were papers which purported to be notes? - A. Yes; Thomas looked at them.</p>
               <p>Q. Were those blank, or filled up? - A. Those were filled up.</p>
               <p>Q.After you had delivered them to him, what became of the prisoner? - A. He went away, and I saw no more of him at that time: he said he should be in town again soon, and should call upon me.</p>
               <p>Q.When he said in town, you understood him Birmingham? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.How soon after this did the prisoner make you another visit? - A. It might be three weeks, or it might be more, I cannot say justly to the time; he came to our house again on the Sunday night, and asked me if I could get him any more notes; he said, he wished to have them got without being filled up, for the writing part to be filled up afterwards; he gave me a guinea, and I went on the Sunday night to one Beat, and got some.</p>
               <p>Q.How many did you get? - A. I cannot justly tell the number; a woman, who is the wife of Beat, told me to take them, and see if they were approved of; I brought them down to my house, where he was sitting waiting for my return; I did not shew them to him at that time, because there was a stranger in my house; he asked me if we would go, and see him set off, where his wife was, at the public-house.</p>
               <p>Q.Was that in the presence of the stranger? - A.The stranger did not hear it. I went, and they were going to tea, I drank tea with them.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you see his wife? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Was that the person at the bar? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. That was not Mrs. Laffecock's? - A. No; she there offered a one pound note.</p>

Yes; then we went, I believe, back again to Hampton-court, but I am not acquainted sufficiently with the place to say; we drove past Mrs. Lasscock's door; and Mr. Thomas said, there was a shop, or something of that sort, I cannot say exactly.</p>
               <p>Q.How far did you go past? - A. Not far; for while I was in Mr. Laffcock's shop waiting for the boy coming back with the change, I saw him standing at the head of his horse.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you think it was more than the length of this Court? - A. Yes, it might be rather more than twice the length of this Court.</p>
               <p>Q.Who did Mrs. Thomas bargain with at Laffcock's? - A. A little boy I think was in the shop at first, and then Mrs. Laffcock came in.</p>
               <p>Q. What articles did she purchase there? - A.Some tea and some loaf sugar, which she paid for with the 5l. note.</p>

               <p>Q.And that you had brought from Birmingham? - A. Yes; the boy went out to the public-house where the cart was-standing for change, the change was delivered to Mrs. Thomas, and then she and I went away, I believe I carried the tea, I am positive I carried one of the two; when he saw us coming, he went on with the cart for us to follow a little way; he went on one side of the road and we on the other.</p>

               <p>Q.Do you remember any observation being made about what the people of the shop should have done is it had been offered? - A. I don't recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. You and Mrs. Thomas then continued to walk with Groves? - A. Yes; we had not gone far before she flarterd, and left him and me together.</p>
               <p>Q.What became of her? - A.I do not know; it was so sudden, and so dark, I could not see; he wanted his horse to go after her, and the horse refused; and then he got off his horse, and left me.</p>
               <p>Q.And you had not the complaisance to wait for his return? - A. No, I walked straight on home, as they told me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon by profession. I was a partner in the late firm of Varnish and Co.—that partnership was dissolved twelve months ago—the business was that of silvering glass—the process is, depositing pure silver by a chemical process upon glass; the glass is blown double hollow—the silver was put in between the two surfaces and hermetic<lb></lb>ally sealed, and that makes it permanent and perfect, not to be injured either by the atmosphere, erasure, or by any other means, except by destroying the glass—after the dissolution, I carried on the business on my own account conjointly with another gentleman—I engaged the prisoner Mellish in the autumn of 1849—he was recommended to me by Mr. Powell, of the White-, friars glass works—he was to have six guineas a week—there was an agreement—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it before the firm was dissolved that you engaged Mellish? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I engaged him for the firm—I was in partnership with a Mr. Cock after the dissolution of the firm (<hi rend="italic">The agreement was here read</hi>)—this agreement refers to one of 15th Oct.; that was a verbal one which I made with him—it was that he should superintend at the glass works where I wished the glass to be made, and that he should also superintend the workmen for the purpose of cutting and polishing the glass—he stipulated, on coming into my service for that object, that he should have the sole control and manage<lb></lb>ment of the men, and not be interfered with in any way; he added that he had been long conversant with glass cutters, that he knew the merits of the different men that were required, and that, if he might take them entirely under his own control, he would be answerable for the work and responsible for the result of the business I proposed to carry on.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. DEARSLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you anything to do with the hiring of the men or the payment of their wages? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not in the least; I never saw the men, nor had I any knowledge of what wages they should obtain—it was particularly stipulated by Mellish that I should not interfere in anywise in that matter; and after he had hired the men, he told them immediately that they were to consider themselves entirely under his management—I have heard Mellish</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185205100022"></xptr>
               <p>say so over and over again that the men were to be responsible to him; I have heard him say so repeatedly to the men.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I thought you said you never saw the men? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not till they were hired; I heard him tell the men that they were to look to him only, and not to me or Mr. Varnish.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. DEARSLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you remember Douglas coming into the service? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, Mellish hired him; after Mellish had been some months in the firm, he stated that he was desirous of having a clerk to assist him, and that he knew a young man at Birmingham that he could very strongly recommend, that he had known him many years, and that he should like to have him—it was agreed that he should choose his own clerk, and Douglas came—he fixed the rate of wages for Douglas, and had him as completely under his own charge as he had the other men—he had from 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week at first, but I believe that was afterwards raised slightly—as soon as Douglas came a wages book was kept, and the names of all the workmen, both in door and out door, were entered weekly—their names were entered in columns, and the rate of wages and their attendance was entered every week, and a sum total made, and they were paid once a week—the wages book was entirely under Mellish's management—it was kept in his desk—he had to fix the wages and to regulate them entirely—it was his duty every Saturday to see that the wages book was correct, and to send it to Mr. Dean, the cashier, for the weekly amount that was required for the workmen—I know that, from seeing the book nearly every day on Mellish's desk, and his talking to me about the wages, and seeing the names of the men in the book—it is in the handwriting of Mellish's clerk—I have seen it lay before Mellish on his desk, he perusing it, with his pencil, looking over it fifty times at least constantly—I did not know of any double vouchers being kept until within about six weeks previous to Mellish leaving the firm—I very frequently spoke to Mel<lb></lb>lish as to how the business was going on—I was in his room two or three times every day, and of course frequently conversed with him on the whole subject—I did not discover that frauds had been committed on the firm until Mellish had left three or four months; he left in May, 1851—I made the discovery in consequence of receiving a letter from one of the workmen—Mellish was given into custody, I think, in Oct., 1851—there were men en<lb></lb>gaged as glass cutters and glass polishers—they worked on the premises; at one period there were, I suppose, thirty men working on the premises, and perhaps seven or eight outdoor workmen—Mellish paid their wages—he had the sole management of both outdoor and indoor men—when I say Mellish, he and his clerk, Douglas, had the management of it—I was not present when the wages were paid—they went to Mellish's room, and they were paid by his clerk and by his authority.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT SHEE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long had you been carrying on this business of silvering glass before you were introduced to Mr. Mellish, or Mr. Mellish to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About twelve months; he was not first introduced to me by Mr. Lund, of Fleet-street—Mr. Powell first spoke to me about him, and I then saw Mr. Lund—I rested entirely on Mr. Powell's knowledge as to his respectability, and I knew he was acquainted with Mr. Lund—they are both gentlemen of the highest respectability.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you first became acquainted with him, had he not an inkstand which belonged to Mr. Lund, which he was desirous of having silvered on your plan? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Some inkstands were sent, as I understood, by Mr. Lund, for me to try the process of silvering on, which I did—I cannot say whether Mellish brought them, but he knew of their being there—I believe he was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185205100023"></xptr>
               <p>busy about them for Mr. Lund before I engaged him—it was found that that inkstand, which was not a double hollow one, could not be so silvered as that the silver should resist the operation of the ink within it—Mulish did not then invent the double hollow inkstand which was afterwards silvered—I sug<lb></lb>gested it myself, in consequence of silvering Mr. Lund's inkstands and finding them fail—I suggested the idea of the double hollow to Mr. Mellish, and he, after a considerable period, did get one made at Messrs. Powell's by my direc<lb></lb>tion—I then silvered it over; that answered—I believe Mellish was working for me at the time—I believe it was not before—I cannot quite recollect, but to the best of my belief he was working for me, carrying out this at Messrs. Powell's—I hired him to go to Messrs. Powell's.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When was your first introduction to him by Mr. Powell? A, In the autumn of 1849; I had never seen him before—it was after that that this conversation took place about the inkstand—I believe it was after I had entered into the verbal agreement with him—I took him for the very pur<lb></lb>pose of making the inkstand and other things—I have no doubt in my own mind it was after, for I hired him especially to go to the glass house—before he came, I had been in the habit of silvering glass, but not enclosing it in the glass.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT SHEE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you first engaged him, was he to do work for you at his own premises in Great Portland-street? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Some things were to be carried on there because he had workmen already there, but the business he was to do for me was to be carried on at my own premises at the back of Burners-street—Mellish attended daily—he always attended for some portion of the day—he worked on his own premises for a very short time indeed—it was stipulated that when he entered into my service he was to give up great Portland-street, and devote himself entirely to Berners-street—that was understood between myself and Mr. Varnish—as soon as he could get glass cutters to come on my premises, which was within a few weeks, be came—the workmen were on my premises as soon as we could get the rooms ready—he brought his tools on my premises—he sold his tools to me, and his own carpenter fitted them up in my premises—I paid him several hundred pounds—that was a very few weeks before he came to me; he was paid by cash—it was after the written agreement—he spent the eight hours a day immedi<lb></lb>ately after the-signing of the agreement—he spent as much time at my pre<lb></lb>mises as it was thought necessary for the work that was in hand—I believe he took possession of a room and desk there as early as that: the rooms were fitted up immediately for him—he stipulated that he should have the entire control and management of the workmen, and the fixing of the rate of wages—I did not know what wages the men ought to receive—he told me he had known the men many years—in the course of his employment, I sanctioned the opening of a shop in Regent-street to be kept by his wife, in which my goods were to be sold; that was in the spring of 1850—a con<lb></lb>siderable quantity of goods was sent to that shop to be disposed of by Mrs. Mellish on my account; I should think more than 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of goods; but Mr. Dean, the cashier, can tell you exactly—I believe Mellish entirely fixed the cost and selling prices of those goods, and they were invoiced to his wife by us at his price—that course of business continued until he left in May, 1851—I believe stock was taken at various times during the interval between April, 1850, and May, 1851—I never suspected him of anything incorrect in that part of his dealing with me—I cannot say now that I have no reason to believe there was anything incorrect; I have the greatest doubts in my own mind that he did deal fairly by me with reference to the shop—I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185205100024"></xptr>
               <p>have reasons for my doubts; those reasons are, that an enormous sum of money had been paid for goods, to the amount of several thousands; and that in looking over what that money had been paid for, I do not see sufficient grounds to believe that I have been honestly dealt with, even in that department—it has not turned out profitably—I sent there from time to time 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-worth of goods—they have not paid their expenses under his management—when he left there was certainly no profit in the concern, not a shilling—I have great reason to doubt that all the goods sent there were fairly accounted for by him—I cannot state any goods that were not fairly accounted for; I can only look at the goods sent in, and the money returned, and, judging by the result, I am a great loser—that is not my only reason for judging that he did not act fairly by me; but also from seeing that so many acts of dishonesty as I believe, have been committed by Mr. Mellish, as I have found out; I mean with respect to these receipts—that is my reason, conjointly with finding that a great deal more money has been laid out, than I can at all account for now should have been laid out—those are my principal reasons—I believe Mr. Varnish is here; he was entrusted with the commercial part of the business—it was not his business to direct what goods should be sent to the shop in Regent-street, Mr. Mellish selected them himself, and had the entire management of the selection; Mr. Varnish did not overlook that; his department was what I should call the out-door commercial, calling upon merchants of different classes to see whether the goods could be introduced for general sale; but of the goods manufactured and sent to Regent-street he knew nothing, because they were entirely in Mellish's sole custody and management—I am not aware that he ascertained what goods were sent in, and what the returns for them were; I have great reason to doubt that he knew much about it, because an account was to be day by day returned to us by Mellish of what was really bought; but it accumulated from time to time, and we had to take it as a whole—I think stock was first taken of the goods in the shop in Regent-street at Christmas; I am not quite sure—I am not aware that any complaint was made; there were complaints that the thing was not answering the purpose, as had been represented to us; that the returns for the money were not so good as I expected—there was no complaint made to Mellish of any deficiency in the stock, or as to any article sent there not being accounted for—I used to say repeatedly, that it did not appear to me, from the money we were expending, that there was a sufficient return, or even a guarantee that there would be—I never called his attention to any ground of complaint, as to the manner in which he or his wife had dealt with the articles entrusted to them; nor did I t any subsequent stock-taking, nor when he left in May; stock was then taken, I believe, by Mr. Varnish and Mr. Dean—I believe no complaint was made then—I stated at the police-court, in Mellish's presence, that I had great misgivings on the subject, that was in Oct., 1851—I had no means of making inquiries as to how the stock had been disposed of, further than by looking over the invoices; I did look over the invoices, and I went to Regent-street and saw the stock; but I did not myself go over it; I never took stock myself—I took no other steps—I have no means of stating any single article that was sent to the shop which he did not account for—I have no means of proving a single article—I doubt extremely that every article was accounted for—I never called his attention to any article—I merely called his attention to what I thought an extravagant expenditure, without any apparent adequate return; I never went farther than that.</p>

               <p>exercise sufficient vigilance yourself about this matter to be able to say with certainty whether something wrong was done or not, in any individual instance? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not; but I have the strongest impression on my own mind, and have had ever since Mellish was first taken into custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT SHEE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was this shop taken for Mellish by your firm, or did he take it himself. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I really cannot answer that question—Mr. Varnish had more to do with it than I had—I really do not know whether Mellish took it, or Mr. Varnish—it was done by my afterwards consenting to it—I went there sometimes—there was a regular stock book kept—I cannot of my own know<lb></lb>ledge say whether when be left, the stock was checked by that book—Mr. Varnish and Mr. Dean can tell—in Aug. 1850, Mellish and I became joint patentees of an invention for improvements in cutting, staining, and silvering glass—it was understood if I look the patent out and paid for it, that he merely as my workman should assign it for a consideration—I asked him to fulfil the engagement he had made, and he declined to resign his interests in the patent—I may perhaps state that the patent was never completed, for the machinery to carry it out bad never been made—I believe I asked him to sign a paper, which had been prepared by Mr. Cookney, and be refused to do so—I was displeased at his refusal to do that which he had agreed to do—I did not express my displeasure strongly—I said very little about it—there was no coolness between us on that account at all—there was no coolness at all until within a very short period of his leaving the service—I do not recollect a coolness—some two or three months previous to his leaving me, I had spoken to him of the necessity of having a person who could take the higher grade of work, and that I should be obliged to associate such a person in the work, and that raised a great coolness—that was the only dis<lb></lb>agreement we had—my impression is that he left, in consequence of my telling him that I intended to associate a person with him who would super<lb></lb>sede him—he told me he should go—I cannot say whether he said be wished to leave on the next Monday—he said, he should go immediately—he gave a week's warning—he was a weekly servant—I am not aware that be came afterwards, and said if his going then was inconvenient to me, be would stay a week or a month—I never heard of it—no doubt something took place between him and Mr. Varnish, before he left—he did not when he left leave his papers behind him—there are a great many bills wanting, and many receipts that we cannot find—while he was in the service he bad a wages book, and a pattern book, and he had books of his own which I cannot enu<lb></lb>merate—I believe he had a cost price book—I am not quite sure whether he had the sole management of the cost price book, or conjointly with the cashier, but it was his pricing—it was his business to ascertain the cost price of every article—I believe the cost price book is here—I do not remember what other books he had—I cannot say whether he had a petty cash book he left the wages book and cost price book behind—after Douglas came, I believe it was his duty to keep the time of the men who were employed on the premises—I cannot say how he did it—this is the wages book—it con<lb></lb>tains the names of everybody employed on the premises with the number of hours each person was employed—with respect to the outdoor men, it was Douglas's duty to do what Mellish told him—he was to act as his check—this is Douglas's writing in this book.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In the course of the outdoor work, did it at one time become the course of business that there should be two bills of parcels made out, or two accounts, one stating the detail of the work, and the other merely the amount? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Such a circumstance took place, but it was totally unknown to me for many months—I knew nothing about it until within a very few weeks of</p>

               <p>Mellish leaving the concern—Mellish had the entire control—I had no power over him—Mr. Varnish did not suggest that mode of conducting the business—it only came to his knowledge at the time it came to mine—I know that—I believe Mr. Varnish is here—Mr. Dean is my cashier—I made constant inquiries as to the mode in which the business was conducted, between him and Mellish and Douglas, but I did not go into Mr. Dean's books, as that was Mr. Varnish's particular department—since tin's prosecution I have learnt that the system of double vouchers commenced immediately on Douglas coming—I have ascertained what the system was then—it was this—Douglas obtained from Mr. Dean every Saturday a certain amount of money, to pay the workmen—he sometimes gave an I O U, for that money—I am not quite sure what acknowledgment he gave Dean—I know that Dean gave the clerk money every Saturday to pay the workmen, and early in the next week he produced vouchers to Dean for it—I have since seen some of those vouchers.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

I was a partner of Mr. Thomson—my department was more the counting house department, the opposite side from the manufactory—the manufactory was in Wells'-mews, and the counting house, and warehouse department, was in Berner's-street—I was not acquainted with the course of dealing between Mellish and the workmen—we left it entirely to Mellish—before I went to join Mr. Thomson we were bound hand and foot to Mellish—he had made an agreement with him to leave him the whole and sole control, therefore I could have no control in the matter—I had the means of knowing generally what the course was, but not particularly—I do not recollect what the course was, before the system of double vouchers commenced—it did not come under my notice—money was advanced by me, for the workmen, in check to Mellish, before Douglas came—I gave a check every Saturday, to pay the sums required—I remember Mr. Dean, the cashier, desiring that he should have the vouchers given to him for the moneys which he disbursed, and I was told by Dean that Mellish in the strongest language refused to give them up—directly after I heard of it, I went over to Mellish and said, "Mellish, I understand you refuse to give up the original invoices, which I have been requiring from time to time, to check the accounts"—I had been passing accounts, for which I had no vouchers, and I objected to go on so any longer—he did not exactly give any reason for objecting to give up the vouchers, but immediately I asked him he seized up a roll of papers—I said, "I must have these things to assure me that such and such sums have been paid"—he went with me to the front of the premises, threw the roll of papers on the table, and said, "There, Sir, I have been in the habit of handing to Mr. Dean these vouchers from month to month, and he has steadily refused ever receiving them"—I asked, "What are these," and so on; and then I found for the first time that there had been a system of duplicate invoices—till that day I never knew of it—I do not think I had learnt it from Mr. Dean—the invoices that Mr. Mellish took up and brought into the front premises with me were not the detailed ones—I did not lock at them—Mr. Dean said those were not the things he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185205100027"></xptr>
               <p>wanted, he wanted the original invoices—Mellish told me his reason for keeping the detailed accounts was for reference—he did not say it was to make up the cost price book; but in case of need, if he wanted to see that the men did not over charge this month for what they had done last month, he could refer to the invoices to see what the price was—it was then that I for the first time ascertained that a system of duplicate accounts had been introduced, and I said to Mr. Dean, "Suppose we compound the thing in this way, to take the duplicate invoices, you first seeing that they agree with the original invoices?"—I do not think I can tax my recollection as to the date of this—it was not very long before I left—it must have been several months after Douglas came—I was the party to propose the compounding for the dupli<lb></lb>cates as we could not have the originals—after I had proposed that, the system of double vouchers commenced, and continued as long as I was there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then you proposed that they should have two sets of invoices? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; when I found two sets were in existence, I proposed that if Dean would put his initials with those of Mellish, I would, in that case, accept them as being correct; and if they were not correct, I blamed Mr. Dean for not seeing that they were true copies of the originals—I consulted Mr. Thomson, and we ultimately acquiesced in that arrangement, that Mellish should keep the originals, and that Dean should have examined copies—I understood it was Mellish's desire to have the originals for reference with respect to charges.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why would not the copies have done as well for Mellish at the originals? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should have thought they would have done quite as well—I do not think I suggested that to him, as he so strongly declared he would not part with the originals—it did not occur to me, for when I agreed that Dean's initials should verify them, I thought that would do.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT SHEE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not perfectly well understand that the duplicates, as you call them, were not exact copies, but what I call a per bill merely, not a detailed bill with items? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Exactly, merely amounts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> So you assented at that time to that course of business being continued, that a duplicate, as you call it, but the mere amount of the detailed bill, should be sent with the wages book to Dean, in order to satisfy him that the amount claimed by Douglas was the right sum for the wages, and that Mellish should keep the detailed bills which the tradesmen brought in? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was then so agreed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You mean a bill containing only the amount, "Smith's bill, 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;" "Brown's bill, 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," and so on?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Just so, that sort of bill-Dean ought to have compared those with the originals, and see that they were correct statements of the accounts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then there was a very good reason, of course, for those duplicates not doing so well for Mellish's purpose, as they did not contain the items? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> certainly, there was a good reason for his holding the originals.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT SHEE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In fact, was it not after that arrangement was made, the course that each tradesman or workman should bring two bills, one the summary, and the other the detailed one? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should say not, because it had been in existence some time—it continued afterwards as long as I was there—that was the course with the outdoor workmen—Dean had the wages book and the per bills presented to him, and either received from Douglas the difference of what he had paid to him on the Saturday previous, or gave him more money if he had not enough, and, in order to satisfy himself that the per bill was the correct account, he required to see Mellish's initials in the corner—Mellish kept the detailed bills, and certified by his initials that the amounts were</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185205100028"></xptr>
               <p>correct, and then the accounts were adjusted for each week between Dean and Douglas—from what My Lord has just now observed, I should say that Mellish certainly could not have made out the cost price book without keeping the detailed bills, containing the items—that was certainly a good reason for his keeping them—I left the concern just after Mellish—I think he left the item accounts behind him—I think he left almost everything, but I was very little in that department—he left the books—he must have left the item accounts, because they were discovered in his drawer—I can hardly say that he left on bad terms with Mr. Thomson—Mr. Thomson and Mellish did not agree—I do not know that Mellish insisted that some of his drawings should be destroyed before he left—when he left, he went back to his place in Great Portland-street—he remained in the neighbourhood, and was backwards and forwards in the trade as before—in the course of his employment I went with him three times to Paris—we were absent rather less than a week each time—I also went with him to Stourbridge, and he was at York for some time—that was after Douglas came—I have no doubt that all the stock of the shop in Regent-street was properly accounted for—it was not my department to attend to the taking of the stock, but I examined the accounts from week to week of money paid, and when the stock was taken I examined it twice, and it strictly agreed—I have no reason now to doubt that it was fairly conducted—I have no doubt that he conducted himself honestly and fairly in our employment in the transactions at Paris and elsewhere—he was constantly employed for us, from the morning till late at night frequently—in the evening he would go down to Messrs. Powell's glass works, and be there perhaps half the night, getting things made under his own inspection—they were things which he had designed, made drawings of, and carried out—that was perhaps three or four times a week—he was also obliged to examine every article which had been made under his direction by the outdoor workmen, and see that it was properly made and determine the price to be properly charged for it—he was constantly occupied in the business—his employment was quite general—he had the sole management—Mr. Thomson and myself had no control; we left it entirely to him—I had no knowledge of the trade myself, nor had Mr. Thomson—I simply brought in capital, and was not bound to he there at all, but I used to attend to the counting house department—Mellish saw the persons with whom we had to deal with respect to articles wanted to purchase—he was the only person that could answer—his time was quite occupied, I think a great deal more than the eight hours which he had engaged to devote to it—he had to superintend between thirty and forty workmen on the premises—he also, to our knowledge, carried on his business in Great Port-land-street during the time he was so employed by us—we objected to it, and wished him to get rid of it as soon as he could—I think it was somewhat inconsistent with our arrangement—it was agreed that he should go on for some time in order to see if his arrangement with Mr. Thomson suited him—that was, I think, up to June or July—we never made it a point that he should discontinue that business—we did not like it, but connived at it—we tried to get rid of it as soon as we could—at the time Douglas was employed, I was satisfied that Mellish had more business to attend to than he could manage—it was suggested both by myself and Mr. Thomson that he should have assistance long before Douglas came, and from time to time his answer was that he could not find a person to suit him, it was difficult.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Who were the tenants of the shop in Regent-street? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was conducted by Mrs. Mellish, and Mellish had the upper part of it for his own use, rent free—I think the rent of the house was 320<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT SHEE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long had this patent for silvering glass been in use for the sale of articles to the public? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not much above a twelvemonth; the first few months were lost in planning and designing—there was no absolute sale; there was no sale till Mellish came—it was he that invented the double hollow—I think that was invented from about a fortnight or three weeks to two months after he came into the employment—I do not think we made inquiries about Douglas before he was employed; I only ascertained who his connections were, and what he was previously, from what I heard in this Court the last time I was here—I do not know in what manner the time of the indoor workmen was taken, that did not come under my inspection.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Who are you called by now? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Well, I was called into Court, and I came in when my name was called—I am quite willing to give my evidence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you seen the attorney for Mellish since the first trial? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have seen him; I have not been to his house—I have had nothing at all to do with him—I have not been examined by him—I did not give him my examination—I did not write a paper for him; J wrote a paper for Mr. Lund and Mr. Powell—I did not send to Mellish's attorney any statement of what evidence I could give in his favour—I did not send it to anybody—I went with Mr. Lund, to an office in Guildhall-yard, and signed a paper, a declaration—that must have been two or three months ago; that was after I was examined in the first case—I never sanctioned anything in the form of double vouchers until Mellish told me he would not give up the originals—as near as I can recollect, that was about a month or six weeks before Mellish left—I have not found out how long Mellish had been keeping double vouchers; it was some months—I do not know whether it was ever<lb></lb>since Douglas came, but very likely—I assented to the double vouchers, because I could not get the originals.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Dean, I suppose, assented from the beginning? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; Dean refused, and I said, "I cannot go on any longer passing these sums without having something to vouch for their truth"—before that, we had gone on completely in the dark without any vouchers at all—I have no doubt that Dean had required them from the beginning, and had done all he possibly could to get them—he had not acquiesced in Mellish's plans—it was in this way: I said, "Again another month, and nothing to show for these sums"—there had been previous months, during which there bad been no invoices nor any memoranda at all, simply amounts, which I bad to pass as being correct without knowing whether they were so—the books were put before me at the end of the month, and I passed them without knowing whether they were correct or not, so I said, "I cannot go on any longer in this way; I most</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185205100030"></xptr>
               <p>have the originals before me"—Dean said, "I cannot get the originals; Mr. Mellish will not give them up"—Dean had merely taken a memorandum of the accounts, which I passed—afterwards, I made them more authentic by causing Dean to examine each of them with the original voucher, and see that the amount was correct, and causing Mellish to put his initials upon them—that was the compromise; as we could not get the originals, we took them so—Mr. Thomson and myself were quite ciphers as to the mode in which money was expended—we had the means of examining the books and inquiring, but we had such confidence in Mellish that we left it to him—if I or Mr. Thomson interfered it was unpalatable to Mellish, therefore we kept aloof somewhat in consequence.</p>

I should not have passed these bills for payment to Douglas but for Mellish's initials being to them—I paid the money to Douglas in a lump—after July or Aug. I should not have passed the bills without Mellish's initials, without making some inquiry—I have gone through the wages book, and find that in all the instances the amounts of the per bills are entered as the actual payments made; that is, the increased or false amounts—the wages book passed through my hands every week—I find in the cases of Perry, Kay, and Home, the larger amounts are entered, and for the weeks during which they were absent.</p>

               <p>raised about the initials at that time—I have tried to recollect the circumstances, and I cannot; I cannot say whether my employers knew of the system of bringing the per bills with the wages book, but they were always presented—after I had compared the per bills with the wages book, I returned them in the book, on the Monday or Tuesday, to Douglas—I kept them perhaps till Monday or Tuesday—I would have them for a few hours to balance my cash—if, on comparing them with the <hi rend="italic">wages</hi> book, I found the sum he had received was too much, he would pay me the difference; if it was not enough, I should pay him the difference—as to the correctness of his statement of the amount he had expended, I had no security except the initials of Mr. Mellish.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do not you remember yourself desiring that you should have some vouchers for the moneys you advanced, and asking to have the item bills? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think I do recollect something passing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you remember whether there was any time during which Mellish did not put his initials to these per bills? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I recollect the time when he did not—that began at a certain time, I think three, four, or perhaps five months after I was there; about three months, perhaps—I can<lb></lb>not recollect the circumstance how that came to begin—I have tried to do so, and cannot.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT SHEE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Let me endeavor to refresh your memory; was it not in consequence of a wish expressed by you that you should have some vouchers to keep for the moneys you disbursed, and a desire to have the ori<lb></lb>ginal bills that were sent in by the workmen? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have asked Douglas several times for the original bills; I do not recollect doing so before the system commenced of having per bills with Mellish's initials; I think it was not—the accounts came up rather loosely, and I wanted to see the original bills—they came up in little bits of paper in Douglas's writing—the original bills never came up, to my recollection—the accounts were receipted by the workmen, but were in Douglas's writing—I wanted the item bills to see that they agreed with the wages book—I did not want to keep them for any time; I had no use for them—I did not keep them more than a day or a day and a half—I balanced the cash once every week.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where were they, while you kept them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In my room, in Berners-street, a different part from the factory altogether; it is under the same roof, but some distance off—if there had been a pressing necessity to see them they could have been seen in five minutes—sometimes, during the time when Mellish's initials were put to the bills, I kept them a day or a day and a half—I was not particular to an hour or so—it is so long since, I cannot recollect—I never beard Mellish assign that as a reason for objecting to my having the original bills—I do not recollect that he said I kept the bills longer than was convenient—I do not recollect his making any objection, no more than he wanted to keep them to make up his price book—I think I must have been only informed of the result of the discussion on the subject between him and Mr. Varnish, without any reason being assigned to me—I could go to Mel<lb></lb>lish's office when I liked—I did not go to his private room unless he was there—if I had any difficulty respecting the bills, I could go down and insist on seeing the original bills; I never did so—I considered I was entitled to do so if I saw any reason—if I had had an idea anything was wrong I certainly should have done so—I never knew where the item bills were kept until the last trial—I heard at the last trial that there was a file in the office where Mellish and Douglas sat, on which accounts were placed—I do not know it of my own knowledge—I paid Mellish's wages—I was not present when any<lb></lb>thing passed between Mellish at the time he left and his employers—I never saw him on the premises after he finally left—I have seen him once or twice</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> This matter was not discovered until after Mellish left? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not till Oct.; he left in May—I had no means of knowing what wages were paid to the indoor servants, or what the amount of the bills were.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How did you give the money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In silver and gold gene<lb></lb>rally; the amount varied from 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—I generally paid it to Douglas—I may have put the bag into Mellish's hands, and said, "Here are the wages," but not generally speaking—the balance was struck every week—I generally made the settlement with Douglas; Mellish did not personally act in the matter with me—I may have handed the bag to Mellish in his office, Douglas not being there, that is, when I gave the lump sum; but when the balance was settled on the Monday or Tuesday that was always done by Douglas.</p>

                  </hi>. I was superintendent of the works at Mr. Thom<lb></lb>son's. I recollect 4th Oct. when Douglas was taken—I know the room that was occupied by Mellish on the premises—there was a library table there, and two boxes—the boxes were opened with a key found on Douglas; the same key fitted both boxes—the drawer of the table was opened by a lock<lb></lb>smith—some of these vouchers were found in the table and some in the boxes.</p>

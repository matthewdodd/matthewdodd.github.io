            . I went to a funeral on the 13th of December, and the prisoner was one of the party; we went into a public-house, and had about three gallons of beer; we then went to another house, and had some more- when I came out I pulled out my watch, and looked at it; I asked my brother-in-law the time, and the prisoner came and put his hand round me - I thought it was out of friendship; my watch was taken from me, and the prisoner put his hand behind him to his brother, as he called him - I kept the prisoner till he was taken,</p>

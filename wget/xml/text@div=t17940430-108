On the 17th of February, this boy and another were looking at my window, about half past seven in the evening; I saw the boys standing there; in a very little time I heard the window crack; I went immediately to the door, and before I could get to the door, they had drawn out five silk handkerchiefs, by a wire or some kind of tool; however I pursued them both down Snow hill, but I lost them; I am certain the prisoner was one of them. On the Monday evening following, which was that day week, the very same boys came again; my boy ran out to the door and laid hold of this; that evening they got nothing, they had very near got a card of lace, but they did not get it out.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your window an upright, one part no farther projects out than another? - No; it is exactly upright, within the upright of my house.</p>
               <p>Q. It is not a shew glass that takes in and out? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. And when you shut your windows at night, you enclose it within your house? - I certainly do.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was the window broke before? - Never.</p>

               <p>About seven in the evening, the 24th of January, I was standing behind our counter, tying up a parcel, Monday evening, and I heard one of the windows crack, with that I jumped over the counter and I opened the door, and I saw the prisoner at the bar and another run from the window; they attempted to make their escape round the corner, by Mr. Brewer's corner, and I pursued them and laid hold of this just by the corner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was walking down Newgate-street, and as I was coming down I was going to cross over at Snow-hill that lad catched hold of me, and said that I had been breaking his master's windows, and they took me into the shop and shewed me a broken window with a piece of tin against it, and the gentleman said that he put a piece of lace nigh there, thinking that he should catch some of us.</p>

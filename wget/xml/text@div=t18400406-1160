                  </hi>. I am in partnership with David Barlin, in St. John-street, Smithfield—we are cigar and tobacco-manufacturers—the prisoner was our errand-boy. On Friday, the 13th of March, I gave in<lb></lb>structions to inspector Shackell to watch the prisoner on his leaving the manufactory—on Saturday morning I heard he was in custody, and Shackell produced about seventeen cigars to me—it would be quite im<lb></lb>possible for me to swear that they were made by us.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of the G division. In conse<lb></lb>quence of information I received on the 13th of March, I went to the pro<lb></lb>secutor's shop, and watched the prisoner—he left work at eight o'clock that night—I followed him to the corner of Charter-house-lane, where he met another person—I went up to him, and asked what he had about him—he said, "Nothing"—I then commenced searching him, and as soon as I com<lb></lb>menced searching his jacket he put his two hands into his trowsers pocket, and commenced breaking up some cigars, as I supposed—he appeared to be moving his hands—I found as many cigars as I could hold in my hand in his side jacket pocket—the man he met ran away—the prisoner then showed great resistance, and tried to get away from me—I found the re<lb></lb>mainder of several cigars in his trowsers, pockets broken—I again asked him where he got those cigars which I found in his jacket pocket—he said he had found them—I then asked him again, "Now, where have you got these cigars?"—he then said he had purchased them—the prosecutor's brother came up to the prisoner, and said he was a pretty fellow for robbing him, and wanted to know how many times he had done so—he said it was</p>

               <p>the first time, and he hoped he would forgive him—I took him to the sta<lb></lb>tion-house, and he said there it was the first time he had robbed Mr. Barlin, but he had taken them from the shop, and hoped he would be as Ienient as possible—I afterwards compared the cigars and fragments. I found on the prisoner with those on the premises, and they appeared the same—cigars are much alike.</p>

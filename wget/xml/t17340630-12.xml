So I went to look for the Prisoner, and found him standing at the Angel Door, in Maid-Lane, in Wood-Street. His Breeches stood wide open, and there was a great Bulk strutted out, as big as my Fist. I clapp'd fast hold on it with my Hand, and said, This is mine, you Rogue!</p>
               <p>Court. But how did you know it was yours?</p>
               <p>Pattey. By the Condition it was in, for I felt it all wet, and I had lather'd it but a little before. Then he bid me let go, and step over to his Lodging, and he would endeavour to satisfy me. So I went with him into a Passage, on t'other side of the Way, and there he dropt the Shirt - I did not see him drop it, but a Boy came and took it up.</p>

I saw it was in a wet Condition, and she said, she had just given it a Lather. He pull'd it out of her Hand, and bid her go over the Way, and he'd make her easy. So we went into the Passage, and as we were standing together (no Body being there but she, and I, and the Prisoner) a Boy came by, and pick'd up the Shirt.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I went to drink with a Friend, at the Sun, and two Men there quarrell'd with my Friend, and therefore I desir'd him to come away. I went myself to the Door, and stay'd for him 4 or 5 Minutes; but he not coming, I went without him. Two or three Hours after, this Woman met me, and ran her Hand into my Breeches, and said, I had got her Shirt there. I told her, I had nothing there but what was my own, and if she would go to my Lodging, I would convince her of it, and so as we were going a Boy found a Shirt.</p>

At half past 1 o'clock, in the morning of 24th March, I was on duty at Potter's Bar—I saw a light in the house occupied by Mr. Disney—I stopped and watched—I saw the light disappear from the dwelling house and go into the shop—I heard a noise at the end of the shop—I went round the corner to that part and saw two men standing on the premises, close to a hole that had been made in the brickwork—I followed both of those men and took one of them; that was the prisoner—Iam sure he is one of the men who I had seen on the premises and run away—I did not lose sight of him from the time he left Mr. Disney's premises—Ifound a quantity of boots lying on the ground; a portion of them were lying on Mr. Disney's premises, and thirty-one pairs were lying on Mr. Baker's premises adjoining, about twenty yards from where the entry had been made—abouttwo minutes elapsed from my seeing the light in Mr. Disney's shop and my seeing the two men by the hole; the entrance had been made by that hole, it was about 2 feet by 18 inches.</p>

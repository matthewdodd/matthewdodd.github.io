On the 26th of March, about three o'clock in the afternoon I saw the prisoner taking a looking-glass out of the shop; I followed and overtook him thirty or forty yards from the shop with it - he said he did not take it, but some person gave it to him to carry - I said I knew better for I saw him take it; he denied it. I told him to give it to me, which he did. I took him back.</p>

            . I was near the prosecutor's shop, and saw the prisoner in company with another; they opened the door and went in, and each brought out a glass - they were not in the shop four minutes. The prisoner turned to the right; I did not see which way the other went. I ran into a shop, and got a man to help me follow the prisoner. I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see his face - A. Yes. The other came out of the shop first.</p>

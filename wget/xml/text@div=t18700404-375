On 26th February, about 8 p.m., I met Hardy on Blackfriars Bridge—he was bulky about the pockets, and I and two other officers, Berry and Davis, followed and stopped him—I said "What have you in your pockets?"—he said, "Only a bit of tea," producing this small packet of tea (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I said, "Have you anything more about you?"—he said, "Yes, this parcel of sugar"—I asked where he got them—he said, "From the Civil Service in Monk well Street"—the other officer asked if he had anything more about him—he said "No"—I told him he would have to go with us to the station—Berry then put his hand in Hardy's coat pocket and took out four composite candles—we asked him where he got them—he said that he found them among some rubbish at the Civil Service, Ward's Wharf, Lambeth—we charged him with unlawful possession—he said that we should find it all right—we took him to the station and charged him—he was searched in my presence, and two other candles were found on him and a few loose biscuits and some white twine—he gave his address 14, Aldred Street, Bermondsey New Road—I asked him whether he had any similar property there, as it would be necessary for me to go there—he said that he did not know—we went there; Mrs. Reynolds came to the door, and I asked</p>

               <p>her if a man named Hardy lodged there—she said "Yes"—I said, "We are police-officers; he is in custody for unlawful possession of some tea and sugar, and we want to search the room he occupies"—a room on the first floor was pointed out to us as Hardy's—we found two boxes there, which we opened with two keys we had found on him, and found a portion of a raw ham, a large quantity of biscuits loose, some honey-soap, corn-flour, spice, candles and other articles, and 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in money—we found in the room a bottle of champagne, and some canvas under the bed, also a pair of new gloves and some night<lb></lb>lights—I said to Reynolds, "Have you any objection to my searching your room?"—he hesitated a little, but afterwards consented—I asked Mrs. Reynolds if she knew that Hardy was bringing these things home, she said yes, and if she asked him how he came by them he told her to mind her own business, and that was all she could get from him—I searched their room in their presence, and found this canister of tea in the bed, placed where the pillow ought to have been—this portion of ham was in a pan under the bed—I said "How do you account for the possession of these?"—Reynolds said "I do not know how it came there; it must have been put there by Hardy—I found two small packets of tea in a box under the bed which the child was lying on, a small quantity of soap, a bottle or two of scent, four or five tint of mustard, some potted meat, some candles, spice, sauce, night<lb></lb>lights, and other articles, all concealed in different parts of the room, or in boxes and drawers—the boxes appeared to be the child's bedstead, and before you could ascertain what was there you had to remove the child from the bed—I told them I should have to take them in custody for receiving—Mrs. Reynolds begged me not to do so—Reynolds said "I told Hardy I should not put any more things away for him—at the station Hardy was fetched up and shown the property found in his room, and he was asked how be accounted for their possession—he looked at them and declined to say—next morning I went to his cell with Barry, and asked him if he wished to account for the possession of them then—he said "No; it will not lighten my sentence <hi rend="italic">any</hi>, and I shall not <hi rend="italic">split</hi> on any one"—he made a statement to us in his solicitor's presence, before he was taken before the Magistrate—he was at that time instructing his solicitor, and was attending to these papers (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which were found on him at the station—Mrs. Reynolds said that she did not see why they should suffer for all when there were others in it—Hardy also made a statement the next day; he had been in<lb></lb>structing his solicitor, and the Reynolds were then doing to, but I do not know whether the solicitor could hear it.</p>

I had a candle in my hand: I seized him, and asked him what he wanted: he said he had mistaken the chambers: I searched him, I found no arms on him; he made no resistance. I asked him his name; he said

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Brewster. I went down stairs with the child, to get it a tart. I left the door open, and when I came up again, the door was shut. The second set of chambers is my kitchen: I knocked at the door, and my master answered, Get up stairs, and take the child with you; and when I came up, the door was shut. I was a stranger to the place, and I could not find the knob of the door. I did not go in.</p>

               <p>Can you tell with certainty whether it was shut or not when you went out? - I cannot tell: I went out a little after eight.</p>

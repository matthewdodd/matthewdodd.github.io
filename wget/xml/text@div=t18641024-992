I live at 53, Herbert-street, Hoxton, and am secre<lb></lb>tary to the Friends of Labour Loan Society, held at the Crown and Anchor public-house, Swan-street, Minories—it is a society certified by Mr. Tidd Pratt—I have a copy of the rules certified by him—the prisoner was secretary of the Society in March last year, and continued. so up to about the 10th or 12th of November—he was then dismissed—I joined the society in April—I was not there in March—the secretary has in his possession a loan-book, in which he enters all sums received from debtors to the society—it is the duty of the secretary to keep that book—I have had access to the prisoner's loan-book, which was used by him when he</p>

Q.</hi> You know as a fact that he was given in custody, and brought off to prison at 9 o'clock at night? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—no communication was made to him before that was done—he has been out of the Society from list November—a communication was made to him in April, that there was a defalcation of 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I don't think he was required to pay that—I will swear he was not asked for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he paid the sum of 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. last Tuesday week—he sent it—he was applied to for it—it was the very same night he was taken—he left it at the bar of the public-house, and when I came from taking him into custody, I found it at the bar—I have been secretary since last November—he was secretary just previous to me—we are speaking of July, 1863—I had a loan of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the Society at the end of September—that is not con<lb></lb>trary to Rule 14—it was not too soon for me to have it—I was not refused that 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the prisoner did not oppose my having it, that I am aware of—I was auditor at the time—I audited his books—we could not find this defal<lb></lb>cation out then—we did not find this 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out till last Saturday week—we met every Tuesday, and the members paid their money to the secretary—the prisoner always took the books to his own house—I never had possession of them until after this difficulty occurred—the prisoner kept the books, and would not return them; we used to drink a little—not more than a pint of beer each, and pipes—the officers were never drinking or smoking—there was some squabbling going on about this time—the prisoner did not drink during business hours; somebody might pass the officers a glass—the prisoner never complained of the confusion or squabbling—I know that one night during that quarter his friends attempted to turn me out of the Society, and they closed the books, and would not have any more business; they wanted it passed by a resolution—the prisoner was turned out for his inattention to his duties by a resolution at a general meeting—he might have received from 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a quarter while he was secretary—there were about 140 members at 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per quarter each—we have somewhere about ninety loans outstanding—we have about 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. capital—the Society has been in exist<lb></lb>ence five years—the secretary would have to enter every member's payment opposite a number, and cast it up at the end of the quarter—I don't know that by law you can put three charges of embezzlement in one indictment; I swear that I have no other indictment but this—we made no charge about the others, because they were condoned by his friends—I gave the prisoner into custody—the present trustees authorized me to do so—I asked the advice of the Chief Clerk at the Mansion House, and he said, "You don't want a summons; give the man into custody the moment you see him, for embezzlement"—I heard something about his being defended by a subscrip<lb></lb>tion amongst his neighbours—I have seen one of the members of the Society here to give him a character, Mr. Samuel Pearce, one of the prisoner's friends; he is a defaulter to the Society, like Mr. White; they have been the pulling down of the Society—there are two or three of the defaulters coming up; there is no doubt about that. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

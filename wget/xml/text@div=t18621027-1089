Q.</hi> How far were you from your own door, when you met the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A very short distance; just from No. 3 to No. 4—when he passed me, and the crowd became so great, I went back and stood on my own door-step—that was between half-past 9 and 10, I cannot say exactly, for I have not a clock in my place—I know it was half-past 9, because about seven minutes before that I had been out to see, and it was then just upon half-past, and I had not sat down again when my husband told me to go on this errand—I have known the prisoner some time—I have fetched bread from his master's shop for the last two years.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Wellclose-square, and go out washing—I am married—I have seen Callaghan before—he said to me, <hi rend="italic">"Missus</hi>, I am very sorry about what I have done for your husband; if you give one shilling I was gone, if you give me a couple of shillings I was gone for your husband"—I said, "I will not give you a farthing"—I gave him nothing—he asked me where I lived, and I would not tell him—I said, "When you want to speak to me, go to the Black Dog."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Are you in the habit of visiting the Black Dog too? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; not often; I go there sometimes, I get washing there—it will be a fortnight next Saturday since I saw Callaghan; another person was with him, but nobody that I knew; that person has not been here to-day—I don't live with the prisoner—I wash for him.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 4, North-east-passage, and keep a shop there and at No. 8, New-road—I am a grocer and tobacconist—on the evening of 4th October I was standing outside my door, and saw the prisoner come down from Davy-street—I followed him in the direction of the crowd, and three minutes afterwards he was a prisoner—he was alone when I first saw him; there were three persons behind him coming down the same way—the <hi rend="italic">row</hi> was there about a quarter of an hour before the prisoner came up; they hallooed out that there had been a knife used—three minutes after he came down, I saw him struggling with the policeman opposite the railings in Wellclose-square—directly he got among the crowd some persons came up and got him between them—I did not like to go so close, and all at once I saw a struggle opposite by the side of the railing, and the policeman had him—some Englishman said that he took the wrong man—that was when the prisoner was taken in custody—I do not know whether the man who said that is here—I am certain that an Englishman did call that out—I have only known the prisoner by sight before.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

Coming cross the Market I saw the Warehouse was broke open, and going to light my Candle I saw Burnham, alias Vernham, with the 3 Flitches of Bacon on his Back; I call'd after him and ask'd where he was going with that Bacon, he made no Answer, but endeavour'd to run away, I pursued him, he threw down the Bacon, the which I tumbled over, but getting up again I overtook and seiz'd him.</p>

             thus made his Defence. Last Monday Morning I came from Chatham, took Water at Gravesend, and came to the Tilt-Boat at Billinsgate, where I drank a Mug of Beer; from thence I went to Leadenhall-Market, where I met with a Man in a great Coat, who says to me, Honest Fellow will you earn 6 d. Ay, Master, says I, with all my Heart if 'tis any Thing I can do; says he to me again, tis to carry these 3 Flitches of Bacon into Smithfield, so Sir I had no sooner got them upon my Back, but a Man asks me where I was going, the Man in the great Coat crics G - d D - you Dog run after me, so I follow'd him as fast as I could, but before I could come up with him I was stopt for a Thief, and never could see him since, but I am an honest Fellow, and have serv'd his Majesty King George, God bless his Holy Name.</p>
               <p>Then Marsh being ask'd what he had to say, proceeded as follows: I belong to the Nasaw, and being destitute of a Lodging and a little fuddled withal, I strouled into Leadenhall-Market, and laid me down on one of the Bulks, but it growing a little lighter I gets up and runs against a Place where I felt some Straw, and going to lie down to sleep I was stopt for a Thief, indeed there was some Bacon there but I did not meddle with it. Being ask'd if he had any Friend to speak to his Character, he answer'd, That he had neither Father nor Mother, Sister or Brother, nor any Friend else but his own dear Person.

            . My son had bought of the prisoner some goods, and I was told he left word I might hear of him at the Queen's Arms, Newgate-Street. I went there, and inquired of the people at the bar for such a person, by the name of Lowth, which he had wrote in our book, and they knew of no such person. Then I suspected he did not come honestly by the things he had sold.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is your shop?</p>
               <p>Palmer. It is at the bottom of Chick-Lane. He came again on the 25th of September with other goods, and ask'd if we would buy them. My son said, this is the man that I bought the cloaths of, on the Saturday before. I look'd at the cloaths, and said I would not buy them. He immediately tied them up in his handkerchief and went out, I followed him, and at the end of Field Lane (at a brasier's shop) he went in and left them, and said he'd call for them immediately. These are part of the goods here produced, for I had the looking of them over in my shop, and know them well. I went into the brasier's shop, and ask'd the man of the shop if he knew the man that left the bundle. He said, no. Then I said, it was clear to me that he stole them, and beg'd he'd stop him and the bundle when he came for them. The prisoner came back in about a quarter of an hour, and the brasier sent him to my shop; he said, Sir, what is the meaning you stop the cloaths which I left at Mr. Walker's? I said, because I suspect you stole them, and the others also, which my son bought. He said, I don't care to expose myself, I came honestly by them, and pray let me have them; I said, if you be an honest man you need not be uneasy. Then he agreed to my taking the cloaths into my possession, and said he'd give me an account where he liv'd. Then I went with him to Mr. Walker's, and when we came to the door he ran away. Then I concluded the things were stolen, and advertised them on the Wednesday following. Going to the Exchange about half an hour after twelve o'clock I saw the prisoner at a musick shop, facing Bow-Church. I knowing his face immediately follow'd him to a house in Cannon-Street, where he carried a letter, and there I took him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Thompson. On Wed<lb></lb>nesday evening, the 2nd of August, about nine o'clock, I was passing a pub<lb></lb>lic-house at the corner of Monmouth-court, I heard a piece of work, looked in, and saw the prisoner's husband and the prosecutor down on the ground, fighting with each other—I saw the prisoner stab the prosecutor with a pen-knife in the head—she had it in her hand, and was striking him down on the head and at the side—I went to push her back, and she struck me with her hand, not with the knife—she made an attempt to kick—I caught hold of her arm, and pulled her back—her husband was down on the ground at the time—I think Holburn had the worst of the fight—I cannot say whether the other man was stronger than him—they had not much power to fight on the ground, for there was another man kicking Holburn as well as the prisoner cutting him with the knife—when Holburn got up, he was bleeding very much—the wounds were in the crown of his head and the side—I saw the prisoner and her husband together, about two or three hours before this, passing up and down Monmouth-street, from the corner of White Lion-street to this public-house, and she was taking bitter oaths to her husband and the other man, that she would have Holburn's and his housekeeper's life—I know nothing of either of the parties, no further than I have washed for Mr. Holburn's house<lb></lb>keeper, Caroline Wilson—I do not know what offence they had given—by his housekeeper I mean a woman living with him—I do not know what quarrel there was—I do not know what the prosecutor is—when she declared she would take Holburn's life and the woman's, she had a knife under her apron—this is it—it was open then—she took it out, showing it to the man that she had with her—I saw him outside just now, as I came in—I do not know his name—I believe the officer can point him out—his name is John—I do not know his other name—that is the man I mean—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a man called Robert Peel</hi>)—I am sure he is the man who was in company with the prisoner and her husband—I am quite sure that, on both occasion, I saw a knife in the prisoner's hand, and that I actually saw her make use of the penknife.</p>

                  </hi> I am potman at the Spencer's Arms, in Monmouth-street. On the 2nd of August, between eight and nine o'clock in the even<lb></lb>ing, the prisoner came into our house, in company with two men—I have seen them both here to-day—Peel was one of them—they called for something to drink, and, in a minute the woman said to one of the men, "Go and see if he is at home"—Peel went after him, came back, and said he was not at home—about ten minutes after, she told him to go again and see if he was come home, and in about five minutes after he came back the second time the prosecutor came in—she asked him how he came to quarrel with or strike her young man the Saturday night before—I did not hear him make any answer, but he was suddenly attacked—the prisoner struck at him, and the men did the same—he was down on the ground immediately, and the prisoner on the top of him—Peel was attempting to kick at him, but I did all I could to prevent him, and I do not know whether he did—the prisoner struck at him several times while he was on the ground, making hits at him, but I did not see anything in her hand—she struck towards his head and I saw the blood flowing directly afterwards—I saw no instrument, but in keeping her back I received a sharp cut in my hand—it was done in an instant, but I saw no knife—it was such a wound as a knife would make—(<hi rend="italic">showing his hand</hi>)—here is the scar—I got the door to—the</p>

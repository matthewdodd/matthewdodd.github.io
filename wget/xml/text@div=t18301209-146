             - I was in the shop, and know the prisoner is the person who pawned it; I can speak positively to him - 1s. 6d. was lent on it; I think it was about one yard and a half long.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BUTCHER. This is my carpet - we do not sell such small quantities, except once in two or three years, for bed-rooms - we have sold none since March.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you sold any before March? A. Not of this pattern - I swear positively this has not been sold; it was made at Kidderminster - the manufacturer is an extensive dealer - he sends to another house besides me, but I do not think this carpet has been sent there; I have no private-mark on it.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS to MR. BOARDS. Q. I observed you took some time to look at the prisoner? A. I do not know that I did - I had seen him at the office; it was on the 23rd of March that he pawned this; I have a perfect recollection of his person - I am sure I have seen him more than once; I cannot swear whether it was evening or morning, but I think I could undertake to swear he had a fustian coat on - I am almost certain of that; I swear the prisoner pawned the carpets.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What is the last line on this duplicate? A. No. 9, Vincent-street, and L. for lodger - it is not because I see the name of Naggs on the duplicates that I swear to the prisoner; I know him so well I could not be mistaken in his name - I believe he had a fustian coat on, but I am not positive; I cannot tell whether it was in the day time or the evening.</p>
               <p>MR. BUTCHER. These have never been sold nor been in wear - they are remnants for bedside pieces; here is one I can swear to more particularly - I had it made to my own taste; it did not answer, and was thrown aside.</p>


               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not you swear to the other as positively as a man could swear to them? A. Yes, but I said there was another house had it, and this is a pattern not likely to be sent to the other house; I sent the pattern to Kidderminster, and the manufacturer might have made it.</p>

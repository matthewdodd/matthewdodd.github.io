            , a waterman, at Iron-gate, I knew him, and I asked him if the knew where I could get one, I thought he might have seen such a thing about; he told me, he thought he knew of one; and I told him to bring it on board the next time I came up; I went off, and returned again the next week, and the prisoner brought the anchor on board, about a month ago, or it may be a little more, William Day came along with him, I was then lying in Billingsgate Dock; I asked the prisoner the price of the anchor; he asked me two guineas and a half; I told him I had got one on board a hundred weight heavier that was bought for two guineas; Williamson said I should have it for two guineas; we went on shore and had a pot of liquor, we left the anchor on the vessel's deck; I gave Williamson a guinea, I had no more money, and told him I would give him the remainder next voyage; when I came the next voyage, I gave him half-a-guinea more, at a house in Darkhouse-lane, I had no more then; and about a fortnight after that, Busher came and claimed it; I told him, if it was his he must have it; I told him I bought it of such a man.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to employ a waterman to see for an anchor for you? - A. Because he knew the place better than I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the name of Busher upon it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Nor the weight? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not usual to mark anchor with the weight? - A. Yes, but they very often wear out; I did not see it till I came to use it.</p>

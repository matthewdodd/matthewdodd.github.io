The prisoner was admitted into the workhouse on the night of the 3rd of Oct., and slept in the casual-ward—I have charge of the keys—the workhouse was locked at ten o'clock at night, and the keys were delivered to me—I got up at six next morning, and, in consequence of information, between six and seven, I went into the yard and missed the articles stated from the tailor's workshop—there is a window to the shop, which works on a swivel, and is kept in its place by its own weight—I found it open—that shop is in the same enclosure as I reside in as servant to the board of guardians—I called over the muster-roll in the morn<lb></lb>ing, and the prisoner was the only person missing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable employed at the Union. On the morning of the 4th of Oct. I went into the tailors'-shop, and saw a stocking, which I produce—it is marked with the letter P, and was damp and muddy</p>

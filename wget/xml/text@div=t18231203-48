            's hands, and Hurd gave him twenty shillings, on behalf of Turner; they were to fight for the deposit. Turner stripped off his coat and handkerchief; the deceased did the same; they shook hands. Carroll said, "We will bear no animosity after the fight is over, but be good friends." They then fought for near fifty minutes; Carroll got a blow under the ear. Jones was Carroll's second, and Smith, Turner's. I did not see the blows inflicted. A brick-maker, and another young man, also took part, in seconding. Smith and Jones were not holding Carroll when he received the blow; he was carried off the ground by the brick-makers; we took him to the Whitmore's Head, public-house, where two medical men saw him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Carroll was a taller man than Turner - A. Yes; he had the best of it, and knocked Turner down several times. Smith and Jones were among the bye-standers, but seeing them fighting, picked them up. I did not hear them encourage the fight; they acted as seconds. I saw nothing unfair.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long were they permitted to fight - A. Fifty minutes; they were very much exhausted. Jones wished to put an end to the fight a quarter of an hour before it ended. Smith said they had better leave off, but they persisted in fighting. Carroll said he would be carried off the ground before he gave in. I did not express a wish<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182312030026"></xptr>for them to leave off; there were a great many brick-makers there, and I was afraid to interfere. I knew of the fight before Carroll called for me. I was present three weeks before, when there was a quarrel. I took Carroll to his house, in Baker's-buildings, Old Bethlem - Dr. Read saw him.</p>

            . I live in Ropemaker-street. Sarson's account is correct, as near as possible. I heard Jones persuade the deceased to leave off; he said he would be carried off the field first, and when Jones could not persuade him he had very little more to do with it; another young man took his place; Jones stood in the ring till the last. I saw Carroll fall - he was senseless after the blow was struck.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you hear Turner several times desire to leave off, and draw the money - A. Several persons in the ring said so. I went and persuaded Carroll to leave off, but he said he would be carried off the field first.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live in Jewin-street. I saw Carroll at his father's house, on the morning of the 27th; he was insensible, and afterwards died. I examined his head - his death was occasioned by an effusion of blood on the head, produced by external violence. The muscles of the head were very much contused - I thought it must have been produced by repeated blows. I removed three ounces of coagulated blood from the brain; he lived a month and two days after it happened. His death must have arisen from violence of the blows in the fight.</p>

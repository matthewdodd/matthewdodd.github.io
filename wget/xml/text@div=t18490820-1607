On the night of 8th August, I went to bed at twelve o'clock—I left my shop perfectly safe; it had been closed before nine, but I was there afterwards—at a quarter before seven in the morning I was called down, and found my shop all in confusion; boxes were emptied and strewed about, and a great number of things were packed up, ready to take away—the silver money was gone—it consisted of half-crowns, sixpences, and shillings to the amount of twenty-four shillings—the copper money was left behind.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Policeman</hi> 123). I was on duty with Potherell, on 14th January, in Fore Street, and saw Roberts—I watched him six or seven minutes—Churchlow joined him; he came out of the "Golden Lion" with this glass ornament in his hand, and joined him—I watched them into Falcon Square, and saw Churchlow go into a baker's—he came out in a few minutes, and was followed by Potherell, who took him—I took Roberts, and as I was taking him into Mr. Mitchell's shop, he dropped these two bad florins—I then opened his hand, and took from it three bad half-crowns, two of which were done up in paper—I went to the shop, and Brown gave me this piece of a bad half-crown, and told me in both prisoners' presence that she gave the other piece back to Churchlow—I took Roberts to the station, and found on him 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in good money, and on Churchlow 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—when the charge was read, Churchlow said "I am guilty"—Roberts said "I have nothing to say"—I went back and picked up the other portion of the bad half-crown on the same side of the way as Churchlow had walked.</p>

I am shop-woman to Robert Mitchell, of Falcon Street—Churchlow came in and asked for two penny biscuits—he put down a half-crown, which the little girl gave to me—I bent it in the detector, and gave him the largest portion back—he said that he had just received it for a basket—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the piece I kept.</p>

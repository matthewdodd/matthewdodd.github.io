                  </hi>. I am a first-class pensioner and military foreman of the Royal Engineers' Department, Woolwich—on 28th September a man under me named Miller was suspended, and on that day I observed a large boiler in one of the store-rooms—I missed it on October 14th, and after<lb></lb>wards saw it, to the best of my belief, at Mr. Ginman's—no one had had authority to take it away—Miller, up to his suspension for being drunk, had charge of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I asked Miller whether he had been foolish enough to</p>

               <p>deal with the copper when drunk—he told me he had not—he was twice charged before the Magistrate respecting the copper, and finally no charge was proceeded with—there was no Government mark on the copper—I think it was on October 17th that I spoke to Miller about it, and on the 18th I went to Ginman's and was there shown the copper—there are two other gates by which the yard can be entered—Miller has not charge of them—McManus took Miller's place temporarily when ho was suspended—a great number of Government people had access to the office where the keys of the stores were kept—there is no entry that I know of, of the copper in the Government books.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The copper was in the store on 28th September—it was a large copper, burnt through at the lower riveting-rim—a patch had been put in, and the patch was burnt through again—there were three skins to it—the copper I afterwards saw at Mr. Ginman's was a similar one, with all those peculiarities—I know Mr. Slaughter, the surgeon-major—this certificate is in his writing. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "McManus is very ill indeed.") I was present when the case was heard before the Magistrate—Miller was charged, and the prosecution was withdrawn—the prisoner was also charged, and was repre<lb></lb>sented by Mr. Hughes—he had an opportunity of cross-examining McManus—one of the two entrances leads up to the commandant's house, and the other direct to the office by steps—a cart could not go up them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The Deposition of Thomas McManus.</hi> "I am a sergeant of Engineers. On Monday, 30th September, I took Miller's post; he had been suspended on the 28th. I received the keys from Mr. Jacobs. I should say I received the keys between 11 and 1 o'clock, and from that time I had charge of the store. Mr. Miller's successor was appointed on Oct. 14. I ceased to be employed in that capacity. <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had not the stores given over to me officially—I would not consider myself respon<lb></lb>sible if half the things had gone away, the doors and windows being insecurely fastened—one of the windows had fallen by its own weight—I remember seeing a man named Jupp in the store for cement shortly before I had the keys—I could not say whether the copper was there then or not—there are two compartments in that store—I do not know in which compartment the copper was kept—I had heard Miller had complained of the insecure fastenings of the place—when you open the door of the store you can see into both compartments.</p>

I am a gardener, of 3, Millwood Street, Nightingale Line, Woolwich—on Saturday, 28th September, Miller spoke to me, and I spoke to Wagstaffe on Monday, and engaged with him to bring a horse, pony, and cart to the engineer's yard with me—he drove—some wood was loaded into the cart, but Mr. Terrell interfered, and the wood was taken out and the cart was driven away—I left, and afterwards saw a horse and van and a man outside the engineer's double gates, the only public entrance I know of, and I saw the van go in the yard.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Woolwich, and am employed by Mr. Hicks, a butcher—on Monday, 30th September, I was knocking at my master's door when I saw a four-wheel van pass with a very large copper in it—a man with a monkey-jacket (not a slop) and a felt hat was driving from the direction of the engineer's yard—I did not take any notice of the van. Richard Ginman. About 6.30 a.m. on Monday, 30th September, Piper came and asked me if would buy a copper—I said "Yes," and he brought it at about 7 o'clock in a van which I did not notice a name on—I did not notice the driver—I paid Piper 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—about a fortnight after Whitlock came and I showed him the copper.</p>

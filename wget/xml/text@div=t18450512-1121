                  </hi>. I live on Saffron-hill. On the 8th of May Gunsby brought the prisoner by the collar into my shop, and said, "He has stolen a pair of your boots"—I looked to my window, and missed a pair—I asked Gunsby where the boots were—he said, "He has thrown them into a clothes-shop on the other side of the way"—these now pro<lb></lb>duced are them.</p>

                  </hi>. On the 8th of May I saw the prisoner steal this pair of boots off the prosecutor's shop board, on Saffron-hill, about eleven o'clock in the daytime—he turned them up, looked at them, and then ran away—I pursued, and collared him—he threw the boots into a clothes-shop, on Saffron-hill, kept by Jacobs, a few yards from the prosecutor's.</p>

On the 4th of June, about the middle of the day, I agreed to let the prisoner the mare at 12 s. a day. I saw him - he hired it. My man was unwilling to let it at that price, and applied to me; I agreed to let it for that. I have not seen it since.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him go away with it - A. He went away with it, but not on it. My man lead it away. He said he was going to Stanmore, and mentioned the Abercorn Arms. He did not return with it. I went there next day, but could not find her.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you next see the prisoner - A. I saw him at Reading on the 24th of July. I had some hesitation at first in charging him with it. He said his name was Hanley, that he was not in the habit of hiring horses, and that I must be deceived in supposing him to be the man. I have not the slightest hesitation of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to lay hold of him, as you were convinced he was the person - I enquired of the landlord of the house, who said he was a commercial traveller, and he thought I must be deceived. I still believed him to be the man, and got from him the address of the house in town which he said he travelled for - I have it here - (reads) -</p>
               <p>"Mr. Hanley, at Messrs. Potts, Bora." I saw him write it. In consequence of this, and the landlord's assertion, I pursued him no farther. I went to the house of Messrs. Potts, vinegar-merchants, in the Borough, and could not find him there. It was the only house of that name I could find. He had stated that it was a vinegar house, and every body knew it.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him again - A. I met him in Quebec-street, Marylebone, within the last fortnight. I told him I considered him to be a person indebted to me, and that he had given me a false address when I saw him at Reading - he denied ever having been at Reading. I insisted on having his name and address; he said his name was

            , and that he lived at Bloomfield Cottage, Regent's Canal. I walked with him to my house, and questioned my lad, Patrick - he, at the moment, said he was in doubt. He said he had so little view of him that he could not say whether he was or was not the man. I sent my man with him to Bloomfield Cottage, and followed myself. I found he lived at a cottage, at the back of the Junction Canal. I wished for a reference - he took me to Mrs. Botelas, No. 37, King-street, Edgeware-road. I was not satisfied, and gave him in charge. The person who hired the mare gave me the name of Vincent, No. 42, Upper Berkley-street. I went there the following morning, but could find no such person.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you with him at Reading - A. I saw him three times in the course of the morning, and was about five minutes with him. On my oath, I have not the least doubt of his being the person I saw at Reading.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Have you, in your walks about town, seen a person very like the prisoner - A. I cannot say I have. A man living where the prisoner does would be often in Oxford-street.</p>
               <p>Q. You never met the prisoner, nor any one like him, except at Reading - A. No. I once saw a man in Oxford-street, whom I supposed to be the man. I looked at him, but then doubted, so I did not like to take him. This was after the affair at Reading. When I met the prisoner he gave me his direction, which I found to be right.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 24th of July you saw a man at Reading, who gave you the address, why not apprehend him - A. It was in consequence of what the landlord said.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not his giving of a different address excite your suspicion, if you had no doubt of his being the person - A. I had such an account of him as led me astray. I was not sure of him at Reading.</p>
               <p>Q. Why are you sure now - A. Because circumstances have transpired since his giving the false address. I did not know him absolutely to be the person at Reading, but I have had proof of it now from further intercourse with him. When be hired the mare he had top-boots and spurs on. I do not think he wore powder. He was dressed nearly the same at Reading. It was at the sign of the George.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Richards. On the 4th of June a person came to me, and asked if my master had got a horse to hire? I called the hostler. I did not see him again. The prisoner is the man, I am positive. I was not present when the horse was taken away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see him again - A. Not until he was taken up, I then saw him accidentally in the yard. I was not desired to look at him - I was sure he was the man; I did not say so. No conversation passed between us then.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. You had a momentary view of the man in June, and swear he is the person - A. I did not hear the other hostler say he was not sure of it. He had a pair of very shabby top-boots and spurs on. I do not know whether he had powder or not.</p>

            . I am the head hostler. I was called out to the man - he said he wanted a chesnut mare. To the best of my recollection the prisoner is the man, but I cannot speak with certainty. On his going off with the mare I asked him when he thought of returning? he said about eight or nine o'clock in the evening, and that he was going to Stanmore. On the 4th of January I saw him and Mr. Richards standing in the yard, and was asked if he was the person? I said I could not say with certainty whether he was or was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen a man like the prisoner between these times - A. I saw a man in Oxford-street, whom I believe to be the prisoner, and followed him about half a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182001120038"></xptr>mile. I thought he was the person, but did not like to act on my own opinion. I think this was in August.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You saw the man to whom he applied - A. Yes, he called me to him. I went with the man who hired the horse to the farrier's, and was there while the shoe was adjusting. I should think I was ten minutes or a quarter of an hour with him. He had a bright mixture coat, kerseymere breeches, and shabby top-boots and spurs. He had no wig nor powder I am sure - he had his own black hair and rather full whiskers.</p>
               <p>Q. You accompanied the prisoner to his own house - A. Yes; Mr. Richards followed. The prisoner took me to his house himself, and said if we were not satisfied he would take us to a lady with whom he had lodged, and took us to Mrs. Botelas's; he also took us to Mr. Mitchell, his landlord, next door. He went with us voluntarily to Mrs. Botelas - it was his own proposal.</p>

            . I am hostler at the Angel Inn, at Reading: I am positive I have seen the prisoner twice at Reading. He once put up at the Angel, and I saw him in the yard when he did not put up there. On the 24th of July I saw Richards at Reading - that was the day I met the prisoner in the yard. He asked me how I did, and how master and mistress were? We were talking together about five minutes. He slept at our house on Sunday, the 14th of March, preceding; he came about nine o'clock in the evening, and left between two and three next afternoon. He came on a black mare; I sold the mare for him for 10 l., I also sold the saddle and bridle.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you had a good view of him - A. Yes. I cannot possibly be mistaken; I am positively sure he is the man. I saw him again at Marlborough-street, and was sure of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You was examined before the Mayor of Reading. Was the time you sold the horse for him the first time you ever saw him - A. I believe I had seen him once before, about a year ago. I sold the mare to one Shelley. Mr. Jenkins claimed it before the Mayor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell the Mayor that you sold Shelley a black horse two years before - A. Yes; I said I had seen the prisoner twice before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say you had seen him frequently - A. I do not believe I did. When I saw him in March he did not wear powder - he had a brown coat, top-boots, and, I believe, light-coloured kerseymere breeches. He had his own black hair. He was dressed much the same in July.</p>

             re-examined. I saw him at Reading about nine o'clock in the morning, it was on a Saturday.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). Till now, I have through life maintained an irreproachable character. I was five years in the house of a respectable merchant, who procured me a situation in the Bank, where I was five years more, when my father remitted me a sum of money to go into business; I then left my situation, and joined a gentleman in partnership. About two years proved it did not answer, and by mutual consent it was dissolved. I then lived a retired life on my property, and took lodgings in King-street - I remained there from November, 1818. till August, 1819, and then took a small cottage by the Grand Junction Canal. I was going home when the prosecutor accosted me, saying he had seen me at Reading; I declared I was never there in my life - he was not satisfied. I walked up Oxford-street, he followed, and asked me to walk to his stables, which I did. I gave him my name and address; he wished one of his men to accompany me, to see if it was right, I made no objection, and the man found my statement quite correct. I informed him my landlord lived next door, he went, and appeared satisfied. My dinner was then ready, but I thought it necessary to leave no suspicion, and referred him to King-street. He left. I thought it would be more satisfactory for me to accompany him, and I did so. On our way, we met Richards and the constable, and all went to Mrs. Botelas's - she informed them that I had never slept out of her house while I lodged there. Richards still insisted that he had seen me at Reading, in July, 1819, and gave me in charge. When first I came to town I had my head shaved by the advice of a friend, as my own hair was, in fact, wool. I then wore a powdered wig, and continued to do so till within two months, I have always kept my head shaved, and have only within the last two months gone without my wig. I solemnly protest my innocence. I was never on horsback since I left my native country. It will, doubtless, appear strange, that so many witnesses should identify me. I call my Eternal Judge to witness that I am innocent.</p>

            . I live at No. 37, King-street, West, Bryanstone-square. My husband is a courier under Government; the prisoner and his wife lodged in my house; they came on the 2d of November, 1818, and continued till the 7th of August, 1819.</p>
               <p>Q. During that time did he ever sleep out of your house - A. I am confident he did not, nor was he ever absent long enough to go a journey of eighty miles - he could not have gone to Reading. He was a man of exceedingly regular habits, and lived extremely moderate. I never heard him talk of horses.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it possible he could have been at Reading on the 14th of March or the 24th of July - A. I am confident he was not, for I had a daughter unwell at the time, and he came into the room every morning to enquire after her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing occur on the 4th of June - A. I have brought to mind that he came that morning to my daughter, she had been talking about going to see the guns fired. I asked him if he was going? he said No, he must go to get Billing, in Clipstone-street, Fitzroy-square, to present a bill that was due. He always wore a powdered wig, I never saw him without - his hair was always kept close.</p>

            . I lodged in the same house with the prisoner, at Mrs. Botelas's, from November, 1818, until August, 1819, and was intimate with him - I used to spend almost every evening with him. I slept out on the 29th or 30th of May. I can positively say that he was never out twelve hours together - I cannot speak to these two nights. He was very frugal. We frequently went to the Gloucester coffee-house of an evening. He generally had nothing but a pint of porter. He has worn a powdered<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182001120039"></xptr>wig ever since I have known him, except within the last two months. His head was bald.</p>

            . My mother lodges at Mrs. Botalas's, and did so when the prisoner lodged there - we came in December, 1818. We were in the habit of seeing him and his wife every day. It was impossible he could have gone a journey of eighty miles without our knowing it. He always wore powder.</p>

            . I am proprietor of the cottage in which the prisoner lived - I live next door myself. He took it on the 20th of July. Some repairs were wanting, which were to be done at his expence. He came repeatedly to see the cottage, almost every day. He was not absent so long as to go to Reading. After he came to the cottage, which was on the 7th of August, I have seen him every day.</p>

            . I am a sculptor, and live in King-street, opposite Mrs. Botelas, and could see over his dressing-room from my study. He generally dressed himself between ten and eleven o'clock. I was in the habit of seeing him daily.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you lately had occasion to know a person very much resembling the prisoner - A. Providing the prisoner wore black hair and long whiskers, I never saw so great a resemblance - any person might mistake one for the other. He was sent out of the country in the last China fleet, by my advice - he is an East Indian; I saw him several times last summer. I returned from Paris the latter end of August, and have not seen him since.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to see the prisoner - A. Hearing he was a man of colour, I went to the prison yesterday - the features are remarkably strong. People of colour resemble each other a good deal.</p>

            , JUN. I have heard the account my father has given, and quite agree with it. I was in the habit of seeing the person. I think if the prisoner had black hair and black whiskers he might be fairly mistaken for the person.</p>

            . I am a merchant, and reside at Stamford-hill. My firm are agents to the prisoner's father - he was educated at Scotland. I have known him ever since 1806. When he first came he wore his own wool, but when we procured him a situation in the Bank he wore a powdered wig.</p>

            , ESQ. I live in Portland-place. I first knew the prisoner in 1815. I believe him to be a respectable honest man. He was introduced at our banking-house, and I believe he has a small balance in our hands now.</p>
               <p>MR. WEBB. I am a surgeon, and have been intimate with the prisoner seven years. I never saw him without powder and a wig. I know his hand-writing (looks at the direction given at Reading) - it is not a bit like it. He was well educated, and would not spell Borough, Bora.</p>
               <p>- JEGGINS. I am clerk to Rutherford and Co. I remember the prisoner's hand-writing, and am sure the direction is not his writing. When I first knew him he wore his own black wool. I suggested his shaving his head - he wore a wig after that, continually.</p>

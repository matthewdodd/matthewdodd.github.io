            . I am a Policeman. I went to the house; the prisoners occupy the back parlour - on entering the house I saw the back room door shut very quick; the serjeant went into the back yard, and called to one of them; he then called to me - I put my shoulder to the door, and pushed it; it gave way: the officer then came in with some things in his arms, and found the watch in the ashes - Jackson gave up this silver pencil-case, a segartube, and a small rule.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Edmonds put in a written Defence, stating that Jackson had employed him to assist in fetching the boxes, and on the Policemen coming, told him to throw the property out of window.</p>
               <p>Jackson put in a written Defence, stating, that a young woman had met him in the street, and desired him to fetch the boxes from No. 8, Dean-street, to take them to his lodging, and tie the contents in bundles; but on finding they contained property of value, his suspicion was excited, and he was putting them out of the way when the Policemen arrived.</p>

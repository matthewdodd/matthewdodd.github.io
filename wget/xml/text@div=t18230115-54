The prisoner came into my service on the 1st of January, with an excellent character, from a person in Bunhill-row. On Monday, the 6th, in consequence of suspicions, I tendered her her wages, and told her to quit my service; she refused to go, and I sent for Clinton, who found the articles stated in the indictment, in her box, or bundle. I believe her box was unlocked, her things were packed up, and brought down ready to go, but she refused to go. When they were found, she acknowledged them to be ours, and begged for mercy.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Was Mrs. Sewell present at the search. - A. Yes. I saw the officer open her box, he did it without a key. I saw her tie the bundle up in her room, and put the things in. She took the flannel from between the sacking of the bed in my sight - it is new; nobody slept with her.</p>
               <p>Q. This was while she was wrangling with you about going away - A. Yes, my wife was in the room when she took it from under the bed. I have no other female servant.</p>

            . The prisoner came into our service, on the 1st of January. I received a very good character of her from Mrs. Parry, of Bunhill-row; we discharged her on the 6th. I desired her to pack up all her things, and went into her room with her - she had a small box there; her behaviour was so suspicious, that I turned up her bed, and between it and the sacking, was about two yards of new flannel, I took it up, and she caught it out of my hand, saying it was hers. I desired her to be quick in putting her things up; she tied the flannel up with them, and took them all into the kitchen, then declared she would not go unless I paid for a coach to take her away; she was very abusive, and we sent for Clinton the officer. I did not notice what she put in her bundle; a pair of gown sleeves were found in it, which I kept in a work-closet; they were rather soiled, but not dirty; she had no business with them - we do not wash at home. The flannel is part of a piece of which Clinton has the fellow. I do not know whether I cut it off or not, but am certain it is mine, and was kept in the work-cupboard, in a room into which she was never desired to go.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. You desired her to be quick in packing up - A. Yes, she did not make haste, my husband was in the kitchen, while I was in her room; it is close to her room. I think it possible for a person to see into the room from there.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was fetched to Mr. Sewell's, and heard a violent noise up one pair of stairs, where the kitchen is. When I entered the room, Mr. and Mrs. Sewell, and the prisoner were there; her master said she had told many falsehoods, and pilfered a little, he wished to get rid of her, and there was her money; she afterwards said, she would not take her things away, unless her master paid a coach to take her away. I said, from her manner, I believed her to be a thief. Mrs. Sewell said,</p>
               <p>"Oh! I cannot think she has robbed me, she has only been with me four days." I asked where her things were, Mr. Sewell said, he had kicked them down stairs to get rid of her. I went down, she ran after me, scratched, and struck me. I got them up into the kitchen, and found two yards of new flannel in the bundle. Mrs. Sewell said,</p>
               <p>"I should like to look at that again."</p>
               <p>"Oh!" said she,</p>
               <p>"Ma'am, that is my flannel, I bought it and paid for it;" she attempted to take it out of my hand. I asked, where she bought it, she said, indeed she did not know the person's name, but knew the shop. I said, I would go to the shop with her; in the mean time, Mrs. Sewell fetched a piece of flannel, which upon being compared with the other, she said she had no doubt of its being her's, for there was the mark where it was torn off, the prisoner immediately acknowledged its being her's, and said it was all she had of Mrs. Sewell's. On searching further, I found a pair of muslin sleeves, and several pieces of shirt-frills and new cloth, all of which Mrs. Sewell claimed; she made no answer to it; one sleeve was in her box, and the other in the bundle. Before I got to the bottom of the box she attacked me, and said she would not let me search, for she had got a deal of property in it. I found nothing more of Mrs. Sewell's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. When the flannel was found, tell me the very words she said - A. She said,</p>
               <p>"Ma'am, that's all I have got of yours." I saw that the pieces corresponded; there was no lock on her box to the best of my recollection, it was tied round with a silk handkerchief, the things appeared to be put into the bundle with care and not in a hurry, they were folded up. She ran away from me in the street; the flannel is in the same state as I received it.</p>
               <p>MRS. SEWELL. I have every reason to believe the flannel is mine, it corresponds in every respect with what remained; the gown-sleeves are mine. I bought the flannel last week in Wood-street, I have no doubt of it being mine, it appears the same in quality and width. She refused to leave, because her character was implicated.</p>

               <p>I lodge at the Angel. On the 2d of August, when I came home, I saw the prisoner leading Gray in very much in liquor; he had hold of him under his arm, and a coat over the other arm; he took him into the parlour. I bid the prisoner put the coat down till he came to himself; he said it was not his, it belonged to Gray's comrade in the skittle-ground. I knew nothing to the contrary, as I never saw them before.</p>

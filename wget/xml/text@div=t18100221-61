These notes had found their way to Cobb, Brown, and Co. and there they have been paid; that we have from the evidence; in order to make them notes, which would be after to be paid again, a re-issue must take place; you must do some act of your house to issue them; they must get back to your house at Wotton Basset to be re-issued - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if they were taken in London, and the parcel had never got down to you, they were discharged from that payment, until you did the act of re-issuing them - A. Certainly.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did he live - A. I cannot tell you. I saw him on the 5th of January, about eleven, in Dover-street, in the Borough-road, he stopped me and said he had got two or three Wotton Bassett ten pound notes; he said he would give me a pound a piece if I would pass them for him; he said they were as good as could be; his brother had come from Wotton Basset, and had brought them with him; he said he would bring me one by four o'clock, and shew me; I saw no more of him on that day. On Sunday afternoon I met him at a house near Turnstile; he said he had passed two or three of the notes, he had passed one at a linen-drapers in Blackfriers-road for a tablecloth, another at a linen-drapers shop in the Borough, where he bought three pair of stockings, and he went to a linen-drapers shop in Holborn and bought some shirt cloth; he gave them a note, they did not give him the change until they sent to the bankers; they gave him a guinea to support him until Monday morning; they were as good notes as could be; and then he said he would give no more than half a guinea to pass them; he said he had got fourteen or fifteen hundred of them. On Monday morning I met him again, he took me to a linen-drapers shop through Temple bar, he bought a shawl and gave a pound for it; he paid for it with a Wotton Basset ten pound note, he got in change eight one pound bank notes, and a country one pound note; he then went to a linen-drapers shop in Holborn, where he had left the note on the Saturday evening, at Mr. Stroud's; he said he was going in for his change; he went in, I did not go in with him; he came out again; he said that the gentleman had sent his boy to the bankers, and that if he would call in half an hour he might have the change. He went again, I went with him and stood at the door; the gentleman said his lad had not come yet, if he would go and sit down till he came back. He came away; he told me he was going to his brother, he would go no more after the note; I left him in Middle-row. I went into a public house, he came back and said his brother's house had been searched on suspicion of stealing these notes; he said he would go in search of his brother and tell him to keep out of the way. Then he went to a public house in Shire-lane, he could not find him; they denied him; he said he would go and buy some clothes and disguise himself. I saw him on the next day, and then he said his brother had been taken up on suspicion of stealing the notes. I did not see him after until he was in custody.</p>

On the 23d of August, at eight o'clock at night, I fastened the shutters up - at a quarter before ten I went up stairs, and found the door of my bed-room forced open with a marling-spike and a piece of iron - a chest, which had three locks to it, was broken open, and 64 l. in notes, and 20 l. in silver, taken out; the chest was emptied - my watch was also taken from the head of my bed. When I fastened the door of my room it was necessary to have a candle.</p>

I know the watch, also one of the notes, which Harrison produced to me at Lambeth-street, a week after the robbery. I know it to be one of them, by a small handwriting and a mark in red ink, which is on it, also by one of the corners being torn off. I always tear my notes in this way to know them, as I cannot write. We lost 50 l. in 1 l. notes.</p>

            . I am headborough of Smithfield. On the 27th of August I went to the prisoner's house, and found him on the bed, quite drunk. I searched him, and found five sixpences on him - I left him. On the 29th of August he was brought to the watch-house, I then found three 1 l. notes in his fob, and asked him how he got them? he said he received them from a publican. I asked him to bring the publican forward, he never did. He said the publican lived in Whitechapel.</p>

On the 23d of August, the night of the robbery, I went over to get change for a sixpence - a man crossed, and sat on the step of the door; I asked him why he sat there? he made no answer - as I came out I put my hand on his shoulder. About ten minutes after, I heard of the robbery. I cannot swear positively to the prisoner, but to the best of my belief he is the man, he has every appearance of being the man; he was dressed as he is now. I went again after the robbery, and the person was gone.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a china dealer, in New Cross-road, Deptford. The prisoner was in my employ on 24th July, and had been for about seven weeks—on that day I gave him a cheque for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I gave him directions to go to the Bank and get it cashed—he was to appropriate some of the money, and bring the balance home to me at night—he left me, and returned that night—I was busy—he did not give me any money—this was on a Tuesday—he did not come on the Wednesday—I did not see him again till the Thursday week—I then found him in his own house—(I had gone to his house several times before, but was not able to find him)—I asked</p>

I paid in cash, and this acceptance of yours—you got me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Mr. Smith, and you said you had had some practice in a lawyer's office, and you would be able to execute my legal business—you executed a writ on James Smith for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the expenses were 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—you got the money—you collected other money, and brought it home—you appeared honest to this time—you said you had spent this money—that was before I gave you into custody—I asked you what you had done with the money—you said you had not a copper left—I did not call on your wife, and promise her that if you would return I would not do anything to you—I said you had better return, and, if you had not spent all the money, you might very easily make it up.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, of 224, High Holborn. The prisoner was my clerk, and was authorised to receive money on my account—it was his duty to enter the money in the till-book immediately he received it—it was balanced every evening—it was his duty to enter the money, and give it to the foreman, who kept the key of the till—this is the till-book, there it no entry here of 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on 12th Jan., nor of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—here is no entry of 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on 21st Sept.—I have the ledger here, in which I have an account of my credit customers—it was the prisoner's duty to make entries here from the cash-book, and to enter from the day-book into the cash-book, which was made up every Saturday—here is no entry of this 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the cash-book—when the customers paid, it was the prisoner's duty to strike it out of the ledger—here is Mr. Ryder's account, it is not made paid but carried on to 26th Feb.—here is Mr. Bentley's account—this does not appear to have been paid, or Mr. Beadle's account—there have been things had since, but the 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. is not paid—here is the invoice—I have not received any of these sums.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> The cash-book contains each separate amount, though it was posted up once a week? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; Stevenson was my foreman, he only had the key of the till, and he accounted to me every night for the cash—it was the prisoner's duty to pay him the money to put in the till, and to put the entry in the till-book—I have known the prisoner many years—he was apprenticed to me in 1832—he has been in business himself, and then he returned to me as a servant—I prosecuted Stevenson, but not in reference to these sums of money; he pleaded guilty this morning—he was taken into cus<lb></lb>tody before I charged the prisoner—I requested that the prisoner should not see</p>

               <p>him before he was given into custody—the prisoner said he believed him to be an honest man, but after he was taken he said he knew him to be a rogue, and that I had been robbed—the prisoner was discharged a week before he was taken into custody—I discharged him on the Tuesday, with the hatter—he did not say that if I wanted to see him, he should be at 22, Museum-street—I said to him, "It is very probable, when the foreman is remanded I shall want you," but I did not say what for—on the Saturday afterwards, when the foreman was charged with embezzling, he said, "The clerk is as guilty as I am"—the prisoner was given into custody on the Sunday morning—I did not see him from the Tuesday morning, when I sent him away—he did not say till after Stevenson was in custody, that he had sometimes given money to Stevenson without any intention of robbing me, and that Stevenson had given the money back again—entries have been made by the prisoner in the till-book, and the money handed over to me, but I did not know it at the time—I have received the money—he told me on the Monday before he was apprehended, that he had received the money of Beadle and Bentley, and I discharged him for it—I did not let him remain any longer—he did not offer to pay these sums, he wanted to make a memorandum of them—I was not going to his father to get the money, nor did Mrs. Adlard prevent me—he wanted me to go to his father, and I said what was I to go for—I thought he wanted to draw me into some trap, and I would not go—I did not then know that he was implicated at all—between his discharge and his being taken into custody, he sent me a letter; I did not answer it—Stevenson had been with me a little better than ten years—I am always in my business—I was not out all day regularly collecting accounts—I was nearly every day—Stevenson cut out the goods, and managed the business: he had the super-intendence of it—I used to sell in the shop, and attend to my customers, and I was out collecting, for when I sent the prisoner out to collect I could get no account from him.</p>

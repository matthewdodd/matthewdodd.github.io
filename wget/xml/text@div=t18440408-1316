                  </hi>. I am a linendraper, and live in High-street, Deptford, in partnership with my brothers. The prisoner was in our shop on the 30th of March, and I received information—I told the young man to go on serving her and let her go—after he had served her she was attracted to the other tide of the shop by a young man who was folding some shawls—I got into conversation with her, and invited her to come out and look at our window, which she did—I said there was one article I should like her to see—I took her again into the shop to another part—I then jumped over the counter, and said my young man told me she had got some handkerchiefs, and asked if she had any objection to be searched—she said "No"—I said to my young man, "Are you sure she has got the handkerchiefs?"—he said, "Yes, I will show you the same pattern in another colour "—these handkerchiefs were then lying at the prisoner's feet—I am sure they had not been there before—that part was three or four yards from where she stood at first—they are mine.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. Wade. On the 14th of March, a little after ten o'clock in the evening, the prisoner and another woman came to look at some handkerchiefs—while I was showing them some, my attention was aroused by seeing the prisoner try to draw the handkerchiefs from the counter—she then asked for some lighter ones, and while I was going to fetch them I communicated it to my employer, who told me to go on and serve her—I returned with the light handkerchief?, and the prisoner left the other woman, to decide on the handkerchief—I then saw the prisoner draw the handkerchiefs off the counter—shortly after she stooped, and I sup<lb></lb>posed picked them up, she made a wry face, as if she had a pain in her leg—after that she had some ribbon, which she gave to the other woman—Mr. John Smith was at the desk, and took the cash—he asked if I was certain about the matter, and I looked behind the counter and missed the handkerchiefs—these are the handkerchiefs I saw her draw from the counter—I swear to them—she was then invited by a young man on the opposite side to see some shawls, and then Mr. Wade took her outside—I looked at the place where she had been, and nothing was there—I looked at her dress, and nothing was clinging to it—she was brought back, and a place was cleared for her to go to—Mr. Wade said, "My young man has missed some handkerchiefs, will you allow me to search you?"—they said "Yes "—he searched the other woman first—I then saw the handkerchiefs on the ground in a crumpled state.</p>

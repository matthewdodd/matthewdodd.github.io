On the 25th of April, about eight o'clock, she came up to Mrs. Warner for money to buy tea and sugar; Mrs. Warner gave her 6 s. - she asked if she should not buy some meat, as we should want some next day, and asked for more money to buy if. Mrs, Warner refused; she went out, and never returned. I went to bed about twelve o'clock, and missed four half-crowns and a shilling from my pocket book, which was inside my bonnet - the bonnet was pinned in a paper bag, and laid on a press bedstead - I had seen it safe in the morning, after breakfast. Other persons had access to the room. In the morning I found a dirty bonnet was placed in the bag, as a substitute for my own; I had never seen the dirty one before; I had only unpinned the bag overnight, and taken the pocket book out, without looking at the bonnet. I saw the prisoner in custody the following morning, in Duke-street, Manchester-square, and afterwards at the office.</p>

            . I have been with Mrs. Warner since the 27th of March - the prisoner was servant there. On the night of the 25th of April, about eight o'clock, I met her as I came in on the landing place; she was going out - I said nothing to her - I did not see her again till she was taken. Next morning, about eight o'clock, I missed two sovereigns, and four half-crowns, which I had locked up in a writing desk, in my bed room, where Clues slept; it was safe on the preceding evening at six o'clock - I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182305140019"></xptr>found the lock forced open. Another young lady slept there besides us. We made the beds ourselves. The prisoner had occasion to go into the room that morning to clean it.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 26th of April, about half-past nine o'clock in the morning, I found the prisoner at No. 10, Calmell-buildings - I met her running down stairs, and stopped her, and said she must go with me to the watch-house; she said she must have her bonnet and shawl, and asked me what for - I said for robbing, but did not say whom. On our way to the watch-house, the two prosecutrixs were walking behind; I asked her if she knew them - she said she did; I then asked if she had not been taking some of their property. I neither promised or threatened her - she said she had taken some money from them; I asked what she had taken; she said a sovereign, and ten shillings of Miss Harrison's, and eleven shillings, and a bonnet of Miss Cluse's. I searched her at the watch-house, and found a sovereign, seven half-crowns, five shillings, and a sixpence upon her. I went back to the house by her desire, and asked for her bonnet, and one was given to me, with a cap and frills in it. I asked her if that was the bonnet she had taken of Miss Clues; she said it was.</p>

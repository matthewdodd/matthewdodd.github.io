On Saturday the 7th of December, going to my lodg<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150192"></xptr>ing I met with this woman in the street between eleven and twelve, I live at Nasson's place, St. Giles's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before? - No, I did not; I met her pretty near Broad-street, St. Giles's, she asked me where I was going? I told her I was going home; says she, will you go home along with me? I asked her where she lived? she said not far from here; I asked her if she had got an apartment of her own? she said yes. It being after my usual hour of being out of a Saturday night I did not like to disturb the people where I lodged, I agreed to go with her, she took me to her apartment; I did not like it, it was in <placeName id="t17940115-72-crimeloc387">Dyot-street</placeName>

               <p>Q. How many stairs did you go up at first? - I believe it was two or three, I went at first where her apartment was.</p>

            Where did you get a room at last? - In the same house, but lower down stairs. While I was asleep she took the money out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to bed? - I was in bed but she was not, I had no more to do with her than a child unborn.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you undress yourself? - Yes, I went to bed with an intent to stop there all night, because it was too late to go to my lodgings, and I did not like to disturb them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she come to bed with you? - No. I fell asleep immediately; she did not leave the room till I fell asleep.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you was perfectly sober? - I was sober, sit to do any business whatever.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, as a sober man, go with a common strumpet that walks the street in St. Giles's? What money was you to give her? - A shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you pay for the bed? - I paid a shilling for the bed to the woman of the house. When I went in, as I suppose, I had about fifteen or sixteen shillings, I went to bed and sell fast asleep, never locked the room.</p>
               <p>Q. She was not to have come to bed to you? - She was to do as she liked, she did not lay with me.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you awake in the morning? - About five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you slept from between twelve and one, till five? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you awaked about five, who was in the room? - The woman had gone down stairs, and said that I was sick in bed, and asked the woman in the house for a bottle to get something for me to drink, because I was very sick.</p>
               <p>

            Was you sick? - No. The woman told her she had not got a bottle, but she would let her have something else, accordingly she let her have something else, and she never returned; so the woman of the house suspected that I might be robbed, and she said to the watchman, I dare say the young man up stairs is robbed, the woman has come down stairs and said she wanted a vessel to get him something to drink, so the woman of the house described the person to the watchman and asked him if he knew her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the woman yourself? -  Yes, I am certain that is the woman. The watchman and the woman of the house came up stairs about five o'clock.</p>

            Then what happened between the hours of twelve and five you don't know? - I am certain she did not come to bed, because she was never in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. All that you know is that at five o'clock you missed your money? - It was all gone but one shilling. I know I had something about me under a pound, but not much.</p>

            When was she taken up? - A little before six in the morning. I gave charge of her, and the watchman took her to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you gave this woman only one shilling? - Yes, I am.</p>
               <p>DANIEL HOGAN sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a watchman. On the 8th of last month, which was of a Sunday, a little after five, I was called by a woman into the house where this robbery was committed. I came to the woman and she said she dare say there was a man up stairs that was robbed of some money; I went up stairs and spoke to the prosecutor, and asked him how much money he had lost? he was in bed asleep, it was on the first floor, the one pair of stairs, I believe, I am not positive; I asked him how much he had lost? he said half a guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you apprehend the woman? - Within a quarter to six, at the running horse in Tottenham-court-road, along with three or four men a drinking; I brought her to the same house, and the prosecutor he gave charge of her; I brought them both to the watch-house, and the watch-house keeper searched her and found five or six shillings on her, and a remarkable half crown, which the prosecutor swore to.</p>
               <p>- sworn.</p>
               <p>I am watch house keeper at St. Giles's; about six o'clock on Sunday, Hogan brought this prisoner to me, I searched her and found five shillings and a half crown; I put the money on the table and the prosecutor says, if there is a half crown with a hole on the tail side it is mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say that before he saw it? - Yes, he could not see the tail side because the tail side was on the table. I immediately turned the half crown up so, and I shewed it him, says he, that is my half crown.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is the same half crown, it is mine, I am certain of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Honoured gentlemen, pardon me an unhappy widow, if I should state my defence in writing, as my health is very much impaired by being in gaol this six weeks, which I believe will terminate in my ruin, having neither friend nor relation to assist me, and this unfortunate affair proceeds entirely from malice. Honoured gentlemen, I was robbed of eighteen guineas some time ago, which was to carry me to Scotland, my native place. This man, the prosecutor, is an acquaintance of the person who robbed me, whom he has put in my way to bring me into trouble. I met this man in Oxford-road, where I supped with him, he made me a present of half a crown to buy me a pair of gloves; he afterwards offered to sleep with me, which I refused, he being incensed at this repulse, immediately charged the watch with me, and I am the unhappy sufferer; I hope you will take my case into consideration; the society I have been among for these six weeks, being to me a representative of the lower regions; may God keep me from such, and I hope you will be made the instrument of keeping me out of inevitable ruin; and the heavens will shower his blessings on you. I have no witnesses.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I am sure I did not give her this half crown.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever know her before? - No, I never saw her to my knowledge.</p>

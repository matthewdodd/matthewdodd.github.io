             sworn - This woman had lived with me for about three weeks, we took her in as a lodger; I went out to work, and she owed me two or three shillings; I took her then to mind the baby; when my master had nothing to do for me, I told her to provide herself a better place; I could not afford to keep her. She went away from me, and came and slept one night in my place; she had been away four or five days; when she came back, I left her at home; when I went out, I left the sheets, a blanket, a child's frock, three night-caps, two white handkerchiefs, and one silk one that we found upon her head, on the lines; my husband's great coat was gone before; I had been out for two or three hours; I met her at the door, she had a bundle; I asked her if she had locked the door; she told me, yes; I unlocked the door, and looked at the lines where I left these things; the three handkerchiefs and frock I missed from off the lines. I went into the room, and missed the bed-clothes, and a shift of mine that lay in the room; I asked her, when I met her at the door, where she was going; she told me; I followed her, but she was not there; I went to another place, and she was not there; I found her in Holborn, near St. Andrew's church; we brought her back, and sent for a constable; she wanted to borrow a penny of me to get a drop of gin; when the constable came to search her, she had four shillings and twopence, my scissars, and my comb.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever found your blanket? - A. No, nothing but the handkerchiefs.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the bundle large or small that you met her with at the door? - A. It was pretty large; she had it under her arm, and her cloak put over it; she had nothing of the bundle when we found her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Her husband's great coat was gone two days before I returned to her house.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer: On the 10th of February, the prosecutor brought the prisoner, and gave me charge of her; I searched her, and found a spotted silk handkerchief on her head, which the prosecutor described to me, and said it was his; there was a hole in one corner that he had burnt with a pipe; when I took it off her head, I found it was exactly so; I found a comb, an old pair of scissars, a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180402150055"></xptr>few shillings, and about twenty-two penny pieces, and a great many duplicates.</p>
               <p>Q. There is no duplicates of these things? - A. No; she acknowledged before the Magistrate that she had made free with the handkerchief to put it on her head.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever traced the property? - A. Yes; I have searched the pawnbrokers; here are a great many duplicates of seven or eight shillings value.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. They are all mine.</p>
               <p>(The handkerchief produced and identified by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I have nothing to say, my dear sir; only, while I was washing for her, I put the handkerchief on my head; I did not think it was stealing, if I had I would not have put it on my head.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Neave.) Did you leave the woman in your room after your wife went out? - A. I left her in the room, when I went out, as I had a young family; I went out to a day's work.</p>

I know the prisoner Seall - on the 15th of April, he came to the house and asked me to go up stairs, and ask the nurse whether she would go to Astley's play-house - I said I would go up and ask her - he came into the passage, and I shut the door - I went up three pairs of stairs - I came down again, and when within three yards of the bottom, I thought I saw the door shut as quick as lightning - the prisoner was still there - he seemed very much agitated - I told him the nurse said she could not come, and he went away - that was about half-past seven o'clock in the morning - the nurse came down stairs about eight o'clock, and went into the parlour - I went in with her - and we then discovered that a cruet-stand, knife-rests, salt-spoons, and a coat were gone - the plate was standing on the sideboard, and the coat in the parlour closet - I had seen them just before Seall came - nobody but Seall had been at the street door, before I went up stairs that morning.</p>

I neither threatened nor promised him - I cautioned him - on our way to the station-house he stated something, but in the absence of the other prisoners - he seemed very agitated, and at last said, "I had nothing to do with the robbery - I certainly did open the door, and let the parties in, and while they were removing the property I stood behind the door"- I said, "As you have stated so much, the least you can do is to offer all the reparation in your power; and if you know where the property is, tell me" - he said, "I do not know" - I apprehended Simpson at the Mischief public-house, in Oxford-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Have you told us all that Seall said of himself? A. Yes. He told me he opened the door and beckoned to them, and they came in - it escaped me to mention that at the moment - I did not say he might as well tell me all about it - on the contrary, I told him if he said any thing, I should use it in all probability against him in evidence - it was when he was going from the station-house to Hatton-garden he mentioned about beckoning to the men, in the same conversation, but after that - I knew where to find him from information I received from Mr. Webber first, and subsequently from his servant - there are two servants - I think it was Cotter, not from the nursery-maid - they were both in the room at the time.</p>

               <p>MR. CRESSWELL. Q. Did you appear before the magistrate? A.

               <p>Q. If it has been said, he was at the Mischief at seven in the morning, that must be wrong? A. I cannot be certain of the time - it might be a little after seven that he came to me - the Mischief is about three minutes' walk from Holborn.</p>

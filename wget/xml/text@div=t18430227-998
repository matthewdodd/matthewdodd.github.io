On the 12th of February I was on duty in Turnham-green, about a quarter before three o'clock in the morn<lb></lb>ing—I saw the prisoner carrying this bundle and a basket—I asked where she was going, she said to Colnbrook, and she had left a situation at Clapton at four o'clock the afternoon before—that her father had come to meet her—he was gone on in a wagon, and had got her boxes—she said this bundle which she had contained her clothes—I took her towards the station, and on the road she told me that these cups and saucers she had taken from her mis<lb></lb>tress—and the statement she had made respecting her leaving her place at Clapton was all false—I examined the bundle at the station, and found these articles in it.</p>

I am the wife of Charles George Chapman, we live in Pelham-row South, Brompton—the prisoner came to me on the 3rd of Jan. as a servant, and left me on the 11th of Feb.—I went to bed that night about a quarter to twelve o'clock, also leaving her up and my husband—when I was in bed she bronght me the baby—she rubbed her eyes, and said she was very weary—I told her to tell her master to come up stairs, and she could go to bed—she slept in the kitchen—I heard no more of her till a quarter before five, when the policeman came to the door—I then discovered the prisoner was gone, and I missed this property—the cups and saucers had been in the kitchen-cupboard—we had used some of them for tea on that afternoon—the kitchen was in great confusion, and the window open—she had not given me notice to leave.</p>

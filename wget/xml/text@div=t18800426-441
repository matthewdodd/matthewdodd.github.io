                  </hi>. I live at 41, Mary Street, Hoxton—that is a chandler's shop—in December or January a tall, dark man, who is not here, came and asked me to take in some letters in the name of E. Vassey—a registered letter came addressed to Mr. Vassey about 6th January, and I refused to give it up because it was not the right man who came—I believe Cann is the man who came—he asked for Mr. Vassey—I said that he did not live there—he said that he had sent letters there, and his name was Sadler—I gave him some letters addressed to Vassey, and than this registered letter, and he said, "This is my writing"—I saw him twice that day, and have no doubt he is the man, but I thought the scar was on his left cheek (<hi rend="italic">Cann had a tear on his right cheek</hi>)—to the best of my belief he is the man.</p>

I am a licensed victualler, of Bound's-green, Tottenham—on Thursday evening, 28th August, at half-past 10 o'clock, the prisoners came there—Williams called for half a quartern of gin, and gave me a half-crown—I took it into the parlour, put it on the table, and brought back 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change, which I gave him—he called for another half-quartern five minutes afterwards, and paid me with 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—they shared the drink, and Brinckley then said, that as Williams had paid for that, he would stand another half-quartern; he gave me half a crown, which I gave to my grand<lb></lb>daughter, Mary Ann Papworth, who gave him his change, and they left together—that half-crown was put on the table with the other, and in about five minutes I found them bad—I gave them to a policeman next day.</p>

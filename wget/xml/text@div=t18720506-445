               <p>at present—on 4th March, I saw a man named Daniel Harris running in Caroline Place, leading into Lansdown Place, New Town, and I saw a per<lb></lb>son who I afterwards knew as Mr. Sykes—I did not see Harris taken into custody—I did not go before the Magistrate when Harris was in custody—on 20th March I was served with a subpoena about 0.45 in the morning—I did not leave my house for the purpose of going to the Court, I was going to the doctor's shop—I was passing Smith's house, which is No. 17, in Lans<lb></lb>down Place, where I lived, and I went into the room merely to speak to Mrs. Smith—there were a few children in the room, Mr. and Mrs. Smith, and the prisoner Murray—I said "What do you think, Mrs. Smith, I am subpoenaed up for that poor chap that stole the gold watch"—she said "For God's sake don't go, if you do you will be murdered"—Mr. Smith said directly "You had better say you don't know him, old <hi rend="italic">gal</hi>"—Mrs. Smith, referring to Murray, said "That is his wife"—Murray said "You had better come with me"—I was so terrified, knowing that she was his wife, and knowing what I had to go through, that I got out of doors as quickly at I could, and I heard her say directly "If they don't do for her, I will"—when I got out, the detective Upson was waiting outside for me, and I went with him to the Surrey Sessions—that was not above ten minutes or a quarter of an hour's walk—I did not see either of the prisoners as I was going into Court, or in Court—the Court was cleared while I was in Court, except the gallery—Harris was in the dock, being tried—I was examined as a witness, and said what I knew about him, that I had seen him running on 4th March, that was all—after the case was over, I went home—Upson went with me, and saw me safely home—I did not see the prisoners as I was leaving the Court—I saw Murray as I was going along, at Smith's door—I did not notice that she said anything—I walked along, and got into my house and shut the door—the officer left—that must have been about 6.30 or 6.40—after that, Murray was the first that came up to the window, making the expression "You bleeding old cow, I will gouge your eye out before the night is over"—I also saw Lynch and a great many more, but I did not take notice what they were all saying, I was too frightened—Lynch was against the window; they were all against the window—mine was the front parlour window—the street door was fastened—I was at the window—after a little while they went away, they all went quiet—I wanted some coals, and I looked out three times at the door to see if there was any there, being terrified—I only saw some children opposite, and I went out—I was only going about two doors off—this must have been about 7 o'clock, I daresay about twenty minutes or half an hour after they bad been there—I had got about two doom from my house, when Lynch came up on my left shoulder from behind, and hit me on the shoulder—I turned round like that, away from her, and my eye was out instantly by Murray—not a word was said—Murray had her fist like that, and hit me—I put my head down, and said "Murder, I am stabbed"—I felt pain, just as if it was forked lightning falling out of my eye—I was all blood all over—my eye was out so far as that, but I did not know it at the time—stuff came from my eye; I was smothered all in blood—I saw nothing of the prisoners afterwards, I got in doors as quick as I could—all my clothes were torn off my back as I was getting in doors—I can't say who did it, there were plenty of them—two constables afterwards came, and I was taken to Guy's Hospital—I did not know the prisoners before this, only by seeing them once or twice, not as friends to speak to; I only knew</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not know the Smiths very well; I did not know Mrs. Smith at all, and I did not know much of Mr. Smith—I did not go in to visit them, I spoke to them, but they were no acquaintance of mine; I went in to tell them I had got the subpoena, merely as I was passing, because Mrs. Smith was speaking to me when young Harris ran by—I had never met Murray at Smith's place before—I am quite sure Murray said "If they don't do for her, I will, "that was said to me as I was coming out of Smith's house—when she said "You had better come with me" I did not know where she meant; I did not think she meant to the Police Court—I did not see either Murray or Lynch in the Court, when I gave say evi<lb></lb>dence—in the evening, when I came out of my house, the first person who put her hand upon me was Lynch, she hit me on my shoulder; there was a great crowd afterwards, not at that moment; Murray was there afterwards, or else I should not have bad my eye out—there was nobody else there at that time that I saw, the street seemed quite clear, the crowd came up when I screamed "Murder I"—neither of the prisoners were in front of me when Lynch put her band on my shoulder, they were both behind—I turned suddenly round when Lynch put her hand on my shoulder, and the first thing I felt was Murray's fist in my face, whether there was anything in her hand you will bear—I found my eye was out; it might have been a blow of her fist; I thought at the time it was an instrument that I was stabbed with—I now believe it was a blow of the fist—it was done in an instant—I don't think it affected my senses, I certainly was. frightened—I did not fall against anything, I put up my hands and got in doors as quick as I could, I was only as it might be a window and a door from my own door; before I could get in, the mob came up and tore my clothes, the passage was all full of people—I daresay it must have been four or five minutes before I got into my house—I am quite sure I did not get a fall—the mob did not give me any blows that I am aware of, I did not feel any—when Murray came to my bedside at the hospital she said she had used no instrument—I am certain she said "I struck you a blow"—at the time I received the injury I did not hear Lynch say a word—I did not hear her use any threat towards me before I went to the Police Court or afterwards, but others heard it—I did not see either of the prisoners until I felt Lynch's hand upon my shoulder; they were both there then—the expression Murray used to me before that was "You bleeding old cow I will gouge your eye out before the night"—when she said "If they don't do it I will," I did not think she referred to the Smiths, I don't know who it was; there was no one else there.</p>

I took Daniel Harris into custody about 5.30 on the morning of 8th March, at No. 9, Amicable Row, St. George's New Town, Kent Street, Borough—he was in bed with Murray—I told him in her presence that I should take him into custody on a charge of highway robbery that was committed on the 4th of the same month—he said he knew nothing about it—Murray said nothing—I took him to the station; he was charged before the Magistrate, and committed for trial at the Surrey Sessions—from what I heard I found out where Snellgrove lived—Lansdown Place is about 300 yards from where I took Harris—on the morning of the trial, the 20th March, I went to fetch Snellgrove; I found her before I got to Lansdown Place, in Black Horse Court, close to where the robbery had been committed—I then went with her to the Surrey Ses<lb></lb>sions—she gave her evidence there—Harris was convicted, and sentenced to eight years' penal servitude and seven years' police supervision—I pro<lb></lb>duce the certificate of the conviction—I did not see the prisoners at the Court—I was directed by the Chairman of the Surrey Sessions to see Snell<lb></lb>grove home; I did so, and when passing Smith's door, which is some few doors from where Snellgrove lived, I saw Murray sitting on the threshold of a door; Snellgrove was some two or three paces in front of me, and as I passed Murray said "She will get her jaw broke to-night," or "She will get her jaw broke for what she has done;" I believe the words were "She will get her bleeding jaw broke for this"—I was in plain clothes, and am a stranger in that neighbourhood; they would not know me—I saw the pro<lb></lb>secutrix into her own house; her husband and the landlady were in the room when I went there—while I was in the room several females came to the door, and I heard some threatening language made use of outside, that she would be served out, that she would catch it for going up there as a witness against Harris—I don't know who made use of the threats; I did not see them—I then went out and saw Murray there, and I believe Lynch, but I am not positive about her; there were some half-dozen women and children—I then cautioned them all—I said "I have heard some threats made use of by somebody standing here; I don't know who it was made use of those threats, if I did I should take them into custody; and I will just tell you what the Chairman of the Surrey Sessions has said to-day, that if this woman is molested or ill-used in any way by anybody, if they can only be brought before him, he will deal very severely with them"—I then advised Snellgrove not to come out, and I went away—I received some in<lb></lb>formation that same evening, and looked after the prisoners—I was in search of them until they were both apprehended—I apprehended Lynch on 26th March, about 1.30 in the morning, in Great Dover Street, Borough, in the street—I said "I shall take you into custody for being concerned with a woman named Murray in assaulting and beating a woman named Snell<lb></lb>grove on the 20th of this month, and knocking her eye out"—she said "That bleeding <hi rend="italic">Liz</hi> Bassett has <hi rend="italic">rounded on</hi> me for this"—Bassett is a</p>

I was at the Southwark Police Station when Murray was brought there in custody—I said to her "Before I take the charge I shall take you down to the hospital, to the bedside of Susan Snellgrove, the injured woman"—on the way there she said "I own I struck her, and as soon as I did so she fell over a barrow against the wall; I did not strike her with any sharp instrument; there were several children there at the time, and they commenced to kick her Was the hospital I saw Snellgrove is bed; I said to her, in Murray's presence, "I want you to look at this woman, to set if you know her"—she looked at her and said "Yes, that is the woman that struck me when the other one turned me round"—Murray again said that she owned she struck her, but she did not strike her with any sharp instrument—at the station, after I returned, she said "If you get the right party I will <hi rend="italic">round</hi> upon her, but I won't say nothing until you do"—she cried and sobbed very much at the hospital, and seamed very sorry: she said she struck her in the eye once—on the 9th April I took Lynch to Snellgrove's bedside, she had then had her eye taken out—I said "I want you to look at this person to see if you know her"—she looked at her and said "Yes, that is the woman that turned me round"—Lynch said "Do you say that I turned you round?"—she said "Yes, you did"—Lynch then became very violent; she shook her fist and said "I wish I had stiffened you; may you lie there for ever, you bleeding old cow"—I then ordered the officers to take her out of the hospital.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I made a deposition about taking Lynch to the hospital, and they took a note of it, and I have told them it was not attached to the depositions when it was read over—Lynch denied that she was the person</p>

               <p>that turned her round—when Snellgrove said to Murray "You struck me," Murray replied "There were others struck you as well as me," and them Snellgrore said "No one else struck me but you"—Murray persisted in stating that she used no instrument, and Lynch persevered in her denial—she did not say she was not there, she said she did not strike her, that was before she said "I wish I had stiffened you."</p>

                  </hi>. On Wednesday night, 20th March, I was house surgeon at Guy's Hospital; Snellgrove was brought there about 10 o'clock—I examined her; there was a rupture of the right eye; she was then per<lb></lb>fectly blind of that eye; the rupture allowed the escape of the internal structures of the eye, they had come out; the parts all round were bruised, and on lifting the eye-ball yen could see a wound about a quarter of an inch in length running horizontally—the eye was not out of socket, it was in position, the parts were all tremendously swollen—what I call the internal structures of the eye are the lens and the fluid contained in the eye there was bleeding into the eye, and there was blood outside it—I think the injury could have been inflicted with a blow from a fist or a thumb-nail; either or both would do it—a blow would rupture the eyeball, it was not from the finger making a puncture—a blow from the fist might have caused it; it might have caused the wound a quarter of an inch long; both the rup<lb></lb>ture and the wound—I should think the blow was given from below upwards, so as to cause the eyeball to strike against the edge of the socket—I attended her up to the 19th of April—I removed the eye on 25th March, the Monday following her admission—there was a certain amount of irritation set up in the other eye; that is now free from danger; there was danger to it Until the injured eye was removed; there were no symptoms to require its removal before the Monday—I found no mark whatever of a graze, as if from a fell against a wall or a barrow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When I say the internal structures of the eye had come out, I mean that the lens and the fluid had escaped; of course I could hot see them escape, the parts gradually came away; I could not say what structures were gone until we opened the eye after it was removed; they were all gone then, there was nothing but blood Inside the eye, the lens and the fluid had run out of the wound; I don't mean that the eye came out; when I took the eye out all the internal structures were gone—they might have escaped before; I expect they did escape after the injury, from the opening in the eye—a process of inflammation was going on for some days after the injury—I thought first the first that it would be necessary to remove the eye; but there was no irritation set up in the other eye, and therefore there was no occasion to hurry—the sensation to the person from a blow on the eye is such as the prosecutrix has described as a flash of lightning; that would be the sensation from a blow with the fist on the ball of the eye; it might follow from a Violent blow of any kind—I do not think the injury could have been caused by her turning round suddenly against the fist, from the position of the Wound it must have been driven up against the edge of the orbit—I don't think a person could turn sharply round with sufficient violence against a stationary fist to have caused the injury—I think the appearance of the eye completely precluded the possi<lb></lb>bility of the injury being caused by a fall against a wall—I think it was most likely inflicted by the fist.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I suppose persons often get struck in the eye without having it ruptured? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Oh yes; it is not an ordinary occurrence for the eye to</p>

               <p>be ruptured by a mere blow of the fist—I never saw a person whose eye had been gouged out—I don't think I could say that there wag any indica<lb></lb>tion here of more than a blow—I remember once seeing a man at the hospital whose eye had been gouged out, but I did not examine the symptoms—I saw no graze or incision on the eyelid here, except a general swelling—I should imagine if the thumb nail were used it would leave a mark on the eyelid—I saw nothing inconsistent with gouging unless it was that there was no mark, as by a thumb nail—the lens of the eye is a solid; it is a bi-convex transparent body; it is a hard substance, it might break down, be dissolved and degenerate into matter; it is semi-cartilaginous—it might come away solid, or be dissolved and come away as matter—the lens is that part of the eye which becomes opaque, and so is called cataract—I cannot tell whether it was in the eye when I first saw the woman—our senior surgeon saw the case—I also showed it to the ophthalmic surgeon, and I attended the case under their direction—I removed the eye myself.</p>

                  </hi>—I live at 2, Queen Street, Mint Street, Borough, and am a hawker—on Wednesday, 20th March, between 6 and 7, I was going down Kent Street, and saw the prisoners together coming out of St. George's New Town—I knew Murray before—I asked her where she had been—she walked on, and Lynch caught hold of my frock and pulled me, and said "We have found the b—cow that <hi rend="italic">lagged</hi> him, and we have done it for her"—this was about 200 yards from Lansdown Place—I know nothing of Harris—I am a stranger that side of the bridge—I have seen him, but I don't know him—I knew him by seeing him with Murray once.</p>

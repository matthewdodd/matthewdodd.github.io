                  </hi> I am a shoe-maker. I rent a room in the parish of St. Luke's—the landlord does not live in the house—I have known the prisoner twelve Years—I went out at half-past four o'clock, on the 15th of Septem<lb></lb>ber, and met him at the door of the Crown public-house as I returned—he asked me to give him some beer to drink—I went into the house and stop<lb></lb>ped with him for a quarter of an hour—my little boy came and asked me for some halfpence to get some coals in—the prisoner left me in about five minutes, and asked me to stop there—the house is not fifty yards from the public-house—he returned to me in five minutes—when I got home I found my room door opened, and missed four pieces of leather—I spoke to him about it afterwards, and he denied it—I have not seen my leather since—It was about five o'clock when he left the house.</p>
               <p>---- <hi rend="smallCaps">LANE</hi>. I am the prosecutor's son. On the 15th of Septemper, I saw my father and the prisoner at the Crown—I asked my father for money for coals—he gave me some—I went home for something to carry them in, and as I returned, I saw the prisoner in Ball-yard, near the house—he had got nothing—I saw him at the top of the stairs, withthe leather in his apron—I saw them distinctly—I said nothing to him—he went away with them—they have not been found—I had the key of the room, and had locked the dour—I went up, and found the door broken open—It was forced in—I looked towards where the leather was, and found it was gone.</p>

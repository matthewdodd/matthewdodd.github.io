               <p>The Case stated by Mr. Pooley.</p>
               <p>MR. SKILLET. - Mr. Pooley. You are an apothecary. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner's wife before she died. - A. I did; I was first of all sent for on Friday the 17th of July, between two and three o'clock, I found her very ill, and rather convulsed; I first of all examined the child that she was delivered of, a female child; I found it very well; after that I found a black mark on her right eye. I sent her some medicine, and told them to let me know how she was at eleven o'clock; they sent me word that she was something better; I went the next morning, and found her something better; she complained then of a very sore throat, and a compression across her breast; on Saturday I called again, and found her worse, and very much convulsed; on Sunday morning I found her dead. I believe she died with an inflammation of the chest, and convulsions.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it possible that the blow she received under her eye, could be the occasion of her death. - A. No, it could not.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you more than one counter. - A. Yes, two counters. The prisoner addressed himself to me, he was in the same dress as he is now, I was not at the same counter as Mr. Davis. He asked to look at some ear-rings, in English, I understood him perfectly well, I shewed him some small gold ear rings, such as foreigners usually wear, he objected to them, and wished to see larger, I shewed him some large ones, he made an offer for them, but did not buy any.</p>

               <p>Q. When he went away did you miss any thing. - A. About five minutes afterwards, when the workman called for them, they were left out for the workman, upon the workmen calling, they were missing.</p>
               <p>Q. From the time that the prisoner quitted the shop, had any other customer come to the shop. - A. Only one customer came there, and that person we knew, that customer is not here, it was a Mr. Croker, a gentleman well known to me, he was the only person except the Italian.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you miss upon the workman coming.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181201150061"></xptr>- A. I missed five pearl ear rings, and a diamond hoop ring, value altogether about sixteen guineas.</p>

            . I am a servant at Mr. Hamlet's shop in Sidney's Alley. The prisoner came to his shop about one o'clock, he asked for ear-rings, I desired some to be shewn him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he stopped while in your shop. - A. I received some information from Mr. Pizey, in consequence of that I stopped him, I went for Perks the officer, I saw Perks search him, there was a tin case found behind him, that he put out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see his hand move. - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any tin case on the counter, before he was stopped. - A. No, I did not, it did not belong to our shop; and after he was stopped, there was a tin case close behind him on the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the tin case contain. - A. It contained five ear rings and the diamond hoop ring; then he was taken to Bow street.</p>
               <p>- PERKS. Q. You were sent for to Mr. Hamlet's shop. - A. Yes, I searched the prisoner's person, I found a passport on him.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the tin case when you went in. - A. I searched about him, and after that I found the tin case behind his back, containing the articles named in the indictment, together with a pair of cornelian ear rings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say any thing. - A. No. He pretended not to understand me, I told him to go about his business, he understood that and was going.</p>
               <p>Q. (to Pizey.) Were you in the shop at the time that this man was laid hold of by Perks. - A. Yes, I was in the shop, I informed Mr. Hamlet of such a person being about, we had missed a watch and a pair of ear rings while he was in the shop. When he was taken he was removed into another room where there was a counter, Mr. Hamlet removed every thing out of his reach.</p>
               <p>Q. After he was searched was there any thing on the counter. - A. Yes, he had put his hand behind him, Perks brought his hand forward and said, you rascal, what have you behind you, and then I saw the tin case on the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. (to Mr. Butler.) Look at these articles, and tell me whether these are the articles that you missed from the counter. - A. They are, I have no doubt whatever about them.</p>

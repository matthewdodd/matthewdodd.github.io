            . I am house-surgeon of Middlesex-hospital. On Wednesday, the 8th of August, between five and six o'clock in the morning, the deceased was brought to the hospital, labouring under symptoms of having received some injury in the head; he lived till the 16th; I opened his head afterwards, and found an effusion of blood on the brain, owing to the rupture of a vessel of the brain; in my judgment the rupture of the vessel of the brain caused his death - it was likely to arise from a fall off a ladder into a dray.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. How many horses were there to the prisoner's dray? A. I am confident there were two, but cannot say whether there were three; the prisoner might have meant what he said about sending his servant as a joke - my back was towards him; I did not see him take off his leading horse, nor whether it had the nose-bag on; I saw the wheel of the dray against the ladder.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What occasioned the horse to go on with the dray you do not know? A. No, I did not see it move to the ladder.</p>

            . I am a painter. I was at work at the brewhouse; the prisoner came to the gate with his dray - I said he must not go forward at present, because there was a man up the ladder; he said, with a laugh, that he would send his footman next time he came into the yard; no doubt he said that in a joke - Marks was at that time on the ladder; I saw the dray going forward; it had been there but a short time, and I saw Marks fall the dray shook the ladder on which he stood, and I saw him fall; I cannot say whether I had seen the leading horse taken off - I was not particularly looking at the time.</p>

            . I am a carpenter, and was at work in the brewhouse yard. I did not see the dray come in; I saw it after it was in - only the shaft-horse was in it then; I heard the dray move on - I turned round, and saw it come in contact with the ladder; I should not imagine that there was proper room for it to pass without touching the ladder; when I turned round, the prisoner was at the horse's head, with the bridle of the horse in his right hand - it appeared to me, that when he took the horse by the rein it moved on; I said, "Stop a moment," and I do not think it went four or five steps before the man stopped, but the dray had touched the ladder, and the man pitched off, and his head pitched on one of the planks of the dray - the dray was standing still when I came up, which was not half a minute before it happened.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I believe you are foreman to Mr. Cubit's men, who were at work there? A. Yes; I was not there when the dray arrived - horses sometimes will go on after others; I saw no other horse - whether the prisoner's taking hold of the rein was to stop the horse I cannot tell; I have known him four years - he bore a good character for humanity; I went to the hospital, and saw the prisoner there on the Friday, sitting down by the deceased's bed - I do not know whether he had been there more than once.</p>

            . I was at the brew house, and saw the dray come in - there were two horses to it; after it came into the yard it stopped, and the prisoner took one horse off, took the bit out of its mouth, and went down to the water with it; he then came back to take the nose-bag off the dray and his whip, and just put them inside the stable; while he did that, the horse drew on - he caught hold of the horse's head as soon as he could - the stable was close by; the horse stood very still then.</p>
               <p>Q. When the horse moved on, there was a cry to take care? A. I did not hear that; when the horse moved on, he came and caught hold of its head directly and stopped him, but was not able to stop it before it touched the ladder - he did all he could to stop it; the dray turned the ladder aside, and threw the man down; the prisoner had only gone two or three yards from the horse, and turned himself round, just to put his bags inside, he came back again, and the horse went on.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When he turned round, how far had he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183209060057"></xptr>got from the horse's head before the horse moved? A. It might be two or three yards; the ladder was before the dray, and almost in the middle of the carriage way - it could not go on without striking the ladder.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did he appear to you to use all the care and caution he should do? A. Yes; he was very sober and steady; the dray stood quite still while he took off the nose-bag - he might be two yards from the ladder. I am certain it was an accident; I have known him some years - he bore a good character for steadiness and care.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. If he had stood with his horse instead of turning his back, could he have prevented it going on? A. Yes, I should think so.</p>

I was at work in the yard, and was near the foot of the ladder on which Marks stood, at the time the dray came into the gateway - I remained there; the leading horse was taken off before I saw the dray - it had come by one ladder; I saw the dray stopping - it then went on again; the prisoner was then near the horse's head; when the dray went on he stood sideways, and I think he had hold of the reins; I do not know how the horse came to go on - I believe the bit was out of its mouth at the time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then the prisoner was at his horse's head when the dray moved on? A. Very near it, and had his hand on the rein; whether he led the horse on, or whether it moved of its own accord, I do not know.</p>

            . I am a drayman. I was in the yard standing against the counting-house door, about twenty yards from the dray, sideways - I did not see the prisoner take off the leading horse, but it was taken off; and the next I saw was, he went, took his nose-bags, put them into the stable, and while his back was turned the horse rode on - as soon as he got hold of him he caught him by the head and endeavoured to stop him, but could not before the ladder moved; it moved before he could catch the horse by the head.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The stable door was close to where the horse stood, was not it? A. Within about three yards- the nose-bags hung on the fore part of the dray; he was close to the horse when he came for the bag, and had not turned his head half a minute when the horse moved on; in my judgment it was purely accidental; he used every diligence to prevent it, when he saw what was about to happen.</p>

            . I am a painter. I was at work in the yard, and saw the horse move on - the prisoner at that time was gone into the stable with the nose-bags; he was in the stable when the horse first moved.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far is the stable from the dray? A. The pin for the nose-bags is close to the stable door - he had hardly turned round before the accident happened; the dray was too far in before, and the moment the horse moved the dray caught the ladder; he then ran, and caught the horse by the head and the man fell into the dray - I do not think he had any control over the horse at the time; the only fault was his coming too near at first.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. If he had not left the horse could not he have stopped it? A. Not in time, for it was close to the ladder before it moved.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I shut the spare horse outside the gate, and took them by the ladder; when I came back I put the other horse nearer up - I stopped the horse in the gateway, and while I took the nose-bags to the stable he moved on again.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my husband at 171, Drury Lane—about twenty minutes to eight in the evening of the 12th of November we left the house together—I locked the door and put the key in my pocket—I also had in my pocket a purse, 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, and 3 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper, and a handkerchief—we walked up towards Holborn—my husband went across the road to post a letter, leaving me standing at the corner of Newton Street—I noticed two women coming up the street under one shawl which was over their heads—I could not see their faces—when they got up to me, the prisoner Smith fell down at my feet and clutched my legs—I said, "What is the matter with the woman?"—the other one was holding the shawl over her head, while she was on the ground—I tried to get away, when Honey struck me in the face, and cut my cheek—the other woman put her hands up my dress and tore my pocket off—I tried to stop her, and she bit my hand—they went a little way and met a man—I saw them give something to him—I said to Smith," Give me my parcel"—she threw the shawl off and tore my hair—my husband came up and laid hold of her—he said, "Give back that purse or I shall get you locked up"—she said, "I have got no purse. You live in a bad placo in Newton Street; I will go for a policeman, and see where they go to"—when they saw a policeman coming they ran away.</p>

Q.</hi> You don't live in Newton Street, do you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I did not know they were Irish women—I am Irish, I know it is the custom for Irish women to walk about without a bonnet, and a shawl over their heads—I said before the Magistrate that they passed something to a man—I did not state that I saw her hand a pocket-handkerchief to the man—my husband said, "Give the purse up," and she said, "I have got no purse"—there was a great crowd.</p>

                  </hi>. I went out with my wife on the evening in question, and left her at the corner of Newton Street—I crossed over the way and was absent two or three minutes—when I came back I saw my wife crying and asked her what was the matter—the prisoners were there at the time, she said, "The women have been beating me and taking my purse"—I gaid, "You had better give the purse up or you will get yourselves locked up"—they said, "I will have revenge on you"—Smith tried to rush at her, but I stopped her—I went for a policeman, and when I came back they had got my wife on the ground—they ran away and I caught Honey.</p>

About twenty minutes before eight o'clock on the 12th November, a gentleman spoke to me, and I went to the corner of Newton Street, where there was a very large crowd; a gentleman pointed to Honey and said, "That is one of them"—she im-mediately ran away—she was stopped by Mr. Bridge—I took her into custody—Mrs. Bridge then came up and said that Honey was one that had robbed her of her purse, handkerchief, and a door key—another con-stable took Smith, and Mrs. Bridge said, "That is the other one"—I took them to the station—at the station Honey said to Smith, "You struck the woman, I did not"—nothing was found on them—the prosecutrix's dress was torn and her face bloody.</p>

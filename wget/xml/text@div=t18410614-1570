                  </hi>. I keep the Running Horse public house, in the Harrow-road. I employed the prisoner to repair clothes for me—I bought some cloth and got him to make a coat for me—on the 20th of June, last year, he was at my house, and I applied to him to make some alterations in the coat—he was to alter it in the house—I did not authorise him to take it home—I handed him the coat—I saw no more of him until eleven months after—I then gave him in charge—I found the coat in pledge—the duplicate was sent to me.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I live with James Weldon, a grocer, at Barnet; I know the prisoner at the bar; I know Sharman very well, he has come to our house to buy grocery of us several times for these three years past, he was a labourer in the neighbourhood. On Wednesday, the 10th day of October, I went from Barnet in a one-horse chaise to St. Alban's, with a young man of my acquaintance, but he did not return with me; about six o'clock I returned from St. Alban's; when I came to <placeName id="t17981205-13-crimeloc62">Mimms Wash-bridge</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17981205-13-crimeloc62" type="placeName" value="Mimms Wash-bridge"></interp>

               <p>Q. At the time he said if you did not immediately give it him, the worse should be the consequence, did he strike you? - A. He did not strike me. When I found he was obstinate, I gave him a leather pocket-book, containing sundry papers, and then immediately came up a man on the other side, who I believe to be Brown, though he is not in the dress he was then; then Sharman asked me again for the watch, still I told him I had not any, and he made use of the words again, that worse should be the consequence if I did not. I then gave my watch to Sharman, I think; then after they had got my watch, they beat me, they struck me three or four times; I cannot swear who struck me.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they strike you with? -

            They had short sticks, as long as my arm, and as thick as my wrist, they beat me down in the bottom of the chaise; when they went away I got up, but was not able to lay hold of the reins or whip; I spoke to the horse, and I got home about half after eight that night.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew Sharman before? - A. I knew Sharman for three years past, I had seen Brown before; I knew Sharman well, by coming to our house twice a week.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt of the person of Sharman? - A. I have not the least.</p>
               <p>Q. Now with respect to Brown, do you know Brown? - A. I have seen his person before, but I cannot positively swear to him, he is not in the same dress he was then, I believe it to be him, he was in a smock frock when he was at the chaise. I went the next morning with John Lloyd, a peace officer, in search of these persons, and we met a Mr. Herridge. I related the circumstance to Mr. Herridge, and described the persons: then we were coming round another way, and I met Mr. Herridge and Chidwell with the prisoners, and two other men, Turner and Fentom. When I saw the prisoners, I said, that was the person that robbed me, that was Sharman; we were in a one-horse cart, and we took the prisoner, Thomas Sharman, and brought him to Barnet, I and

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. John Warburg, a cigar-manufacturer in Mansell-street—the prisoner was in his employ as a stripper, and a porter. On the 10th of February I came out of the front shop to go into the manufactory—at the end of that there is a coach-house—I saw a figure there—I knew no one had any business there at that time, which was about twelve o'clock in the day—I went up to see who it was, and found the prisoner—I asked what he wanted—he said,</p>

On Sunday morning, the 9th of October, a little after six o'clock, I left my house, leaving nobody at home - nobody but myself and my housekeeper live there- I locked the house up, and took the keys in my pocket; I had fastened the windows - I returned at ten minutes after eight o'clock at night; I found the outer gate bolted inside - when I unlocked it I could not get in; I got over the wall into the yard - I had locked the outer gate and the door of the house; I found the door of the house had been burst open, but it was bolted inside at the top the same as the gate - I could not get in; I hallooed Thieves! and kicked at the door - I heard persons inside bursting open my bed-room door, and then heard more than one person running down stairs; I had locked my bed-room door - I heard them go to the wash-house, and then they got on the roof of the workshop. I am a carpenter. After that two or three young men came into my yard - the Policemen came in directly after them; I got a ladder, and Smith, the Policeman, got over, and found the prisoners on the roof of the workshop; I did not go on the roof myself- I afterwards went into the wash-house, got a light, and examined the house - I found my desk broken open, which stood in the front parlour - papers were taken out, and from a little tin box in the desk they had taken a guinea, a half-guinea, a 7s. piece, three silver tea-spoons, and four salts, two of them were silver, and two plated, with glasses, also a case of instruments, and a pair of spectacles and case; they were all taken out of my desk - I saw some of them at the Police-office the next day; an old knife and key were picked up - I found my spectacles and case of instruments thrown down in the wash-house that evening; persons must pass through the wash-house to get to the back yard from the house.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. I believe you cried Thieves! as soon as you found the premises disturbed? A. Yes; I was alone - it might be nearly ten minutes before the Policeman came up; two or three young men jumped over the wall before that, but they did not get on the roof; they scaled the outer wall to get to the front door, and after the Policeman got over more persons followed him; I saw nobody on the roof.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. On the Sunday in question I went to Waples' premises, hearing a cry of Thieves! I got there about four minutes after I heard the cry; I scaled the front wall, which is not above five or six feet - Waples put up a ladder, and I went over the roof of the workshop; I saw the figures of three persons running along the roof - it was dark; they dropped off the roof,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183110200007"></xptr>which is about twelve feet high, into the garden of No.6, Taunton-place - I dropped also; they ran across that garden to No. 5; I followed, and saw three men going across the garden, but lost sight of one of them in the garden of No. 5; I ran some spikes into my hand in getting over to No. 5 - 1 saw the other two run into a passage from the yard at No. 5; it is a private house - I called out Stop thief! Stop them! and heard them say, "We are not the men;" I followed them into the house, and saw Letter, Captain Ruffley's servant, with a light in his hand, and at the same time I saw Kitching and Langley, and took them into custody; they said, "We are assisting you - we are not the men - we followed you;" they had not followed me; they were in front of me all the way - Captain

             and another gentle man came out of the parlour to my assistance, and some ladies followed them; the prisoners were secured - I searched them both, and found on Kitching two silver saltstands, and glasses belonging to them in his trousers pocket- I also found on him two plated salts, and the glasses, a key and a knife; I searched Langley, and found on him a latch and a door key - there is nothing remarkable in them- I gave them in charge of the gentlemen while I went in pursuit of the other one, but did not find him; I returned and found Twiss and some more persons in the passage with them - we took them to the watch-house, and on the road they said they would have a coach, they would not walk, they would be d - d. if they would; they held by the iron rails of the houses, and kitching said if he had his liberty he would punish my bl - y head; Langley called Twiss a bl - y Irish b - r; he abused him all the way to the watch-house - I went with Twiss about seven o'clock on Monday morning, and searched the garden of No. 6, through which they had passed; the servant girl went with me, and I saw her pick up a jemmy, or small crowbar; the servant at No. 5 gave me nine skeleton-keys that morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. CLARKSON. Q. When you got to the house, some persons had already got over, besides the prisoners? A. No - there was nobody in the yard but the prisoners; nobody was in Captain

            's premises but the captain, a gentleman, and Letter - I am sure both the prisoners said, "We are not the men;" I believe Kitching was the only one who said he would not go without a coach - I know he said so.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. On Sunday, the 9th of October, in consequence of information, I went to the William the Fourth Public-house, in Exeter-street, Marylebone; it was very shortly after eleven o'clock - I saw Clayton sitting there, drinking; I knew him before - he was dressed in a fustian jacket, with a blue front, and black trousers; the sleeves of his jacket were fustain - I said, "Joe, I want you:" he asked what for - I said if he would come outside the room I would tell him; he came out, and I took him into custody, but did not tell him what I wanted him for - I took him into the parlour of the public-house, and searched him, but found nothing on him - he asked me at least three times what I took him for, but I did not tell him; I took him to the watch-house, and in Stafford-street he stopped, and requested I would tell him what I had got him for; I answered, "What have you done with the silver spoons?" he hesitated at first, and said, "Spoons? I know nothing about them;" there were three females following us, and on going up Harcourt-street one, whom he represented as his sister, said, "What have they got you in custody for, Joe, now?" he said, "For a burglary;" I directly turned to him, and said, "A burglary; how came you to know that I had got you for a burglary?" he hesitated and said, "I mean a felony. but I suppose they are both alike - I am not very learned; I don't know much about it; "I had not mentioned either felony or burglary to him - I searched him again, and found nothing, but observed that his trousers were torn in the seat, apparently by a tenter hook or spike.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. The linings inside are not torn in the least? A. They are not, only the trousers are torn; it is just such a tear as I should expect to find if I hitched my trousers on a hook.</p>

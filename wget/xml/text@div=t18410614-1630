On the 1st of June, about half past four o'clock, I saw him go out at the west-wicket—I followed, and asked if he worked for the Company—he said he did—I asked him to come back—he did so, and I said, "I suspect you have got something in your hat, have you any thing?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "What is it?"—he said, "A little opium"—I took his hat off, and found in it these four pieces of opium—I made him no promises or threat—I said, "Where did you get this?"—he said, "I took it from the floor of the warehouse."</p>

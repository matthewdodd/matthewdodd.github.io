                  </hi> I live at 20, St. James-street. On the 18th of Aug., about half-past one o'clock in the night, I was by the National-gallery—I had been drinking a little—two girls came up to me—I went with them to a house, and had some wine—they afterwards gave me something in a tea-cup, which they said would do me good, as I had had too much wine—it made me insensible immediately—when I came to myself I was on the floor—I had a watch with guard and brequet-chains to it, and five sovereigns and 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—when I swoke they were gone—I had not a penny left—I came down at half-past six or seven o'clock in the morning—I saw two soldiers, who I firmly believe to be the prisoners, come out of the next door—I was able to know I had got my watch and money when I went to the house—I had been dining with a friend—I could talk and understand as well as I can now—I drank two glasses more wine at this house, but it was vinegar rather than wine—I was perfectly sensible until I drank what was in the tea-cup—the watch and chain are worth thirty guineas, they cost 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi> I am a pawnbroker, and live at St. George's-street. On the evening of the 19th of Aug. the prisoners came to my shop with a gold watch and chain, and asked 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on it—Stordy brought it—they offered it together—I asked to whom it belonged—Stordy said it was his property—I asked his name—he said, "James Howell, of St. George's-barracks, Charing-cross"—he said he had had it nineteen years, and it was left him by his father, who had had it fifty-five years—Darby immediately said, "You need not be afraid, I know it to be my comrade's property, I am a relative of his, and have seen it in his possession several years"—I went to the station, brought the sergeant, gave them into custody, and they were taken to the station.</p>

I went to Mr. Byass', and took the prisoners—I asked Stordy what account he gave of the watch—he said he had had it in his possession eight years, and that it was given him by his father in Cumberland, who had had it fifteen years, and said, "My cousin knows that"—Darby said, "Yes, I know him to have had it that time"—I said I should lock them up—Stordy said "It is no use, it was given us by two girls, they are in public-house close by"—I took them to several public-houses and could not find them, and the following morning he said he was led into it, and the watch was given to him by Darby—Darby was pre<lb></lb>sent, and said he knew nothing about it.</p>

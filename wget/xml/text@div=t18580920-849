                  </hi>. I am a merchant's clerk, and live in Botolph-lane—on 11th Sept., about 3 in the afternoon, I was in Thames-street—there was a great crowd, and I was trying to make my way through, but the prisoner, who was in front of me, obstructed me—I stepped back a pace or two, he did the same, and I immediately missed my watch, which had been on a chain round my neck—I found the chain hanging down—I walked across the street after the prisoner about four yards, laid hold of him by the collar, and charged him with stealing my watch—he said "Your watch," and immediately got up a scuffle, tried to get back into the crowd, and dragged me with him—when he got me on the pavement he suddenly stopped—I heard something fall, and saw my watch on the pavement—I seized it—the ring was then broken—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it; it is worth 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I am sure the prisoner is the man.</p>

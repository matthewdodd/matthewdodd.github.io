                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Rogers. On 19th Nov., about a quarter to 3 o'clock, I was walking in Fleet-street—I felt a pull at my pocket, looked round immediately, and saw the prisoner close beside me—there was a man close by, who pushed me, which made me stumble—he appeared to be with the prisoner—I recovered myself, ran after the prisoner, and seized him—I missed my purse, which contained 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., from my pocket—I had had it safe five minutes before—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I seized the prisoner, and said, "You have got my purse"—he said he had not—I insisted that he had; and he took it from his pocket, and held it in his hand—I afterwards saw a lady pick it up, and she gave it to me.</p>

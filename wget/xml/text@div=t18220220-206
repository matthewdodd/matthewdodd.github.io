            . On Saturday night, the 17th of February, about half-past twelve o'clock, my business caused me to be in Clare-market. I was coming home, and was going into a public-house in <placeName id="t18220220-206-crimeloc1108">Drury-lane</placeName>

I seized him and called to the watch, Callahan came to his assistance, and got him from me. I then seized Callahan, he pulled me across the road, and as I was calling Watch! he called to Caps for assistance, and said,</p>
               <p>"Don't go away," Caps, then came and joined him. I was contending with them both, they got off, and my wife and myself called out Watch! the constable came up and rushed among the crowd, and took me into a shop - I was bleeding, I said I should know the man again, and went to look for them in Queen-street, and on coming into Drury-lane, Jones pointed over the way; I saw Caps run over, I said,</p>
               <p>"That is the man who robbed me." Callahan was taken the same night in Drury-lane, about one o'clock - I am certain they are the men.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. What are you - A. I buy bread of bakers, and carry it about to sell - I deal with several people. Sir Richard Birnie examined me twice on this business.</p>

            . On Saturday night, between twelve and one o'clock, I was in Drury lane, and saw the prosecutor holding Callahan, who was striking him; Caps was standing by, they came into the middle of the street, when Caps seized the prosecutor and turned him on one side - the prosecutor kept calling for the watchman all the time. They got on the pavement, and the prosecutor seized Caps again, but they escaped, and went down Stewards rents; I followed them, but not knowing the man was robbed, I turned back. After hearing he was robbed, I went after them, and in Wild-street I saw Caps; he saw me, and went into Little Wild-street, then took to his heels and ran off - I followed him across Queen-street, into Drury-lane, and then turned back; the prosecutor and constable then came up - I pointed him out, and the prosecutor said</p>
               <p>"That is one of the men who robbed me."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What are you - A. A tailor. I did not know the prosecutor, he had cried Watch! but not Stop thief! when the watchman came up, he said,</p>
               <p>"I have been robbed of my watch." I said,</p>
               <p>"It is odd you should fight with the man so long, and not say you was robbed." Caps ran away as soon as he came.</p>

            . I am a constable of St. Giles's. About twenty minutes after twelve o'clock, I was going to bed, but heard a violent cry of</p>
               <p>"Watch! Watch! I will not let him go;" considering that there was a watchman near, I did not go out immediately; but as the cry continued, I went and found the prosecutor covered with blood - I took him into a baker's shop, he said he had lost his watch. The people were complaining that no watchman was to be found, there ought to have been three near the spot. As soon as I got up, there was a rush down Stewarts-rents; I ran round into Wild-street, and Drury-lane, and just at the corner, the prosecutor ran across, and stopped Caps, who was going towards Broad-court, he said,</p>
               <p>"This is the man," I immediately collared him, and said,</p>
               <p>"Harry, it is you." The prosecutor said he should know the other man, and Bartlett said he had seen a man with Caps, who he knew; a person fetched us to the corner of Clare-court, where Bartlett took Callahan; he said to Bartlett,</p>
               <p>"I'll go with you, you have been a friend to me, if I had taken your advice, I should not have been in this."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The prosecutor said he was ill used - A. Yes. I asked if he had lost any thing, he said his watch; he was confused. The people thought it was a fight.</p>

I was coming down Drury-lane, and by the burial ground, I saw the prosecutor and Callahan wrestling, he got away; Caps came between them, and forced them, apart and both ran down the court - I went with the constable after them round Wild-street; he went over the way and collared Caps. I went with them to the watch-house, and saw Callahan standing near Clare-court - I knew him directly, and pointed him out; I had heard the prosecutor calling out,</p>
               <p>"Watch! You shall not go;" they were struggling together - Callahan said nothing when he was taken.</p>

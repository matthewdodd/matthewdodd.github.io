             asked for an ounce of returns - I went into the shop rather quick, and found 8 s. 6 d., or 9 s., which I had left on the parlour table behind the shop, was gone. I had been gone about a minute and a half, and left no one in my shop but my little boy, who is seven years old. I think it was six or seven shillings, and the rest sixpences, and about 3 s. 6 d. in copper besides; the money was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182406030086"></xptr>loose; I had been giving change for a sovereign -

             gave me 6 d. in payment for the tobacco - I went in, and got the three-halfpence, and detained them till my husband came. I then got two officers, who took them into custody; they were searched at the door.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. How long were you gone - A. Not more than a minute or a minute and a half; I only went as far as the coach-stand; I could not keep my eye upon the door all the while; my back was turned towards it, and there was time for them to go into my shop and come back to the sill of my door. I am certain no one else went in; there was not time for it. I have no doubt the prisoners had intended to go; but they did not make any attempt to run away. I believe the officer said, one of them had got 1 s. 6 d. in his pocket; I saw them moving as if they had been in, and they were standing on the sill of the door - I did tell the officer there was 12 s. 6 d. on the table; but there was that sum, with the halfpence and all; the halfpence were not touched. I can swear that the silver was from 8 s. 6 d. to 9 s. 6 d. I am certain there was not 10 s., because I had given change for a sovereign. A man and his wife and four children occupy my first floor - I am certain they did not come down - they were at dinner.</p>
               <p>- WELCH. I am seven years old - (this witness perfectly undertood the obligation of an oath.) I recollect my mother going out; she was gone but a short time; these men (the prisoners) came to the shop - I was at the door, but they did not speak to me - the one with a black hat on went into the room for about a minute, and then came to the other - my mother came directly afterwards, and then he asked for some returns. I had seen the money on the table. I had been at home all the while my mother was out, and nobody else came in but these men.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Your mother came home, and these boys were taken up, and you did not say anything about it for a long while after - A. My mother went to Hatton-garden before I did; I went there last Saturday.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not tell your mother when she came home,</p>
               <p>"Mother, these boys have been taking your money;" - A. No. I do not know why; I said nothing till I heard her say,</p>
               <p>"These boys have been robbing me;" - it was about two o'clock.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When your mother came home, and asked you about it, did you tell the same story as you do now - A. Yes; and went to the office, and told the same story.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was sent for to Welch's house - the prosecutrix came and fetched me; we found two or three hundred people there; Barnett had a white hat on, and the other a black one - they were charged with stealing some silver. I took them into the parlour - one of them said,</p>
               <p>"Don't expose us;" - A. Abrahams sat down on a chair, and he had some tobacco in his hand - I saw his hand in his pocket, and found seven shillings, three sixpences, and three halfpence in his breeches pocket. Thompson asked him where he got it - he was going to say, but the other checked him. I took them to the office.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you search the other prisoner - A. Yes; and found on him a sovereign and some silver; he said it was his own money; I gave it him back again. Mrs. Welch said as we came along, that there were nine or ten shillings; she was in a flurry; this little boy said nothing about it in my presence - I don't think I saw him. I knew nothing of it until they had two examinations at Hatton-garden; the boy was not present until the second time; he was not taken at first because he had not said that he knew anything about it.</p>

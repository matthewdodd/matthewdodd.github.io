            . On the 31st of July, between five and six o'clock, I was at a <placeName id="t18270913-81-crimeloc483">public-house called the Chequers</placeName>

I thought at first it was only a lark - but the others used me very ill; they got an old hat and knocked it on my head, and prevented my getting out for some time - when I got out I found an officer, and told him.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH PRICE. The prosecutor told me what had happened, and described the prisoner. I knew him, and went to look for him, but he kept out of the way till the 11th of August - the prosecutor was quite sober.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He was quite in liquor, and fell off the form - he awoke, and accused some other person of taking his hat - he then said it was me, and he would give charge of me. I said if he did not give charge of me directly I must go in about an hour, which I did.</p>

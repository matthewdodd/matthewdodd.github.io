             sworn. Examined by Mr. Alley. I belong to the Thames police office; on the 29th of January, about nine o'clock in the evening, I met the prisoner in Nightingale Lane with a coal scuttle concealed under her apron. I asked her what she had got, she told me a coal scuttle, that her master sent her for it; she told me where she was going to carry it: going along with her she turned up an inn, about a quarter of a mile from the place, then she said that a man had given it to her to carry; I took her in custody, and brought her to the police office; the next day the owner was found Mr. Cooper.</p>

             sworn. Examined Mr. Alley. Q. Look at that coal scuttle, and tell me whether you lost it. - A. I lost it sometime on the 29th, I had it on that day, in the house, it was standing on my counter in the shop, I have no doubt but it is mine.</p>

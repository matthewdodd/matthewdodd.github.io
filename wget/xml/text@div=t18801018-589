                  </hi>. I am single, and live at 14, Gurney Street, New Kent Road—on Wednesday, 29th September, about 8.30 p.m., I went to the pillar box at the corner of Gurney Street to post a letter—I saw the prisoner moving a wire in the pillar box with his left hand—I was about three yards from him—I saw two letters in his hand—as I approached he moved away to the lamp-post—he held a letter up to the lamp—I could see it; no stamp was on it; this is it—I then went to put my letter in the box, but I saw this wire (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and did not post it—Mr. Tucker passed, and I called him; he stopped the prisoner, a policeman came, and he was taken into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Messrs. Kelly, publishers, of 49; Pollock Road, Old Kent Road—on the evening of 29th September I was going home, and saw the prisoner about three yards from the pillar box, towards the Elephant and Castle; the lamp-post was about three yards the other side—Miss Scott said loud enough for the prisoner to hear "This man has been moving this wire up and down"—the end of the wire was then protruding from the aperture in the box—the prisoner replied "I was going to post a letter"—as he had no letter in his hand I said "Where is the letter?" he then took two letters from his inside coat pocket; one was addressed to Mr. Witt, tobacconist, Hackney Road, the other was opened, and was to Mr. J. Berry, 59, Hackney Road—this is it—I asked if he had any more, and he took from the same pocket four or five more, all addressed to himself, and, I believe, opened—I asked him his name, and he said it was Mr. Berry, residing at 59, Hackney Road—I said "You will have to stop till a policeman comes"—I detained him about 10 minutes, till a policeman, who was sent for, came—he was taken into custody—I handed the letters to the inspector.</p>

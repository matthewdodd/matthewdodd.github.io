                  </hi>. I live at Westbourne-mews; the prisoner is my cousin's husband; they live in the same house as me.

(<hi rend="italic">The witness's deposition being read, stated</hi>:—"I am not certain that I sealed it;" "I believe the prisoner was aware there was a duplicate in it, but I said nothing about it;" "I believe I sealed the letter.") The prisoner was aware there was a ticket in it—I have not been talking it over with any one since—Mr. Yule had then returned to town, but I did not know his private address; Horseferry-road is his public address—I know now that he lives at 28, Pulford-street, Millbank—I always understood that if a ticket was out of time the articles became forfeited—the articles mentioned in this duplicate were out of time.</p>

About a year ago I sent Mary Goring some duplicates to take care of for me, and from time to time had them back all but one, which was for a silver watch and chain pawned at Mr. Dobree's, in Charlotte-street, Fitzroy-square—I have since seen that in the pawnbroker's hands—I am disposed to say this (<hi rend="italic">produced by Bliss</hi>) is it—it is the same handwriting, and for the same articles.</p>

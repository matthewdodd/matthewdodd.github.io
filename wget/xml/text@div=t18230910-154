On Saturday, the 15th of July, a piece of cloth laid on a pile, near where the prisoner was working, and on Monday I found it had been undone, and a yard and three-quarters cut, and rolled up in a different manner - it was torn across. I put it in the same situation, and desired the foreman to look at it every time he went up, and about two o'clock he gave me information; I found a hand round it, which I had not put on. I fetched an officer, who searched the prisoner, and found three-quarters of a yard concealed under her gown. I then measured the cloth, and found that quantity deficient - my servant girl found it on her. I compared it with my cloth, and found it corresponded exactly.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you any interest in the business - A. None; he has no partner. The prisoner and her mother were occasionally employed by us; it is not the custom to pay women with remnants of cloth, nor are they perquisites. I may have given her mother a remnant of cloth, and may have given her a bit, perhaps, as broad as my hand. The cloth this was cut from, is delivered to the person who sent it to us. I have no mark on it - it is superfine cloth; the list corresponds. I have sold her cloth of various descriptions.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did she say that anybody had given it her - A. No, my Lord; she begged for mercy.</p>

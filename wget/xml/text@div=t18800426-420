                  </hi>. I am a sergeant-major in the Army, stationed at Woolwich—I have examined the books of drugs supplied and served from 1st April to 20th March, with other medical officers who are members of the Board—I got a return from Sergeant Hawkey, who had taken stock—I find a deficiency after making due allowance for waste, etc., of over 181b. 10oz. of potassium, 71b. 7oz. of iron and quinine, 3lb. 7 1/2oz. of sulphate of quinine, 5lb. 15 3/4oz. of opium, 5lb. 2 1/2oz. of chloroform—it was the prisoner's duty to keep some of the books—others are kept by the medical officers—he entered the prescriptions—they are then fifed—I told the prisoner the amount of the deficiencies—he said, "If that is the deficiency it would take a donkey-cart to remove them"—I asked him if he had any explanation to offer—he said, "Owing to pressure of work, prescriptions which I have had to repeat have not been entered"—the prisoner was brought up before the Board on 23rd March—he said nine months' prescriptions had not been entered—I adjourned the Board for him to produce prescriptions which had not been booked—he produced five, three of which had not been entered—the prescriptions would remain in the care of the sergeant—they were of no use, but still should not be destroyed—of course we gave the prisoner credit for the remaining stock—an inspection was made of the Auxiliary Hospital—an entry of it would be made in the books of the Herbert Hospital.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prescriptions should be entered when repeated, even when given verbally—they are often given verbally—I have not often seen one like this, "repeat as often as required"—about ten or twelve doctors would be entitled to give orders about prescriptions, including two civilians—I have known the prisoner during the two years I have been at Woolwich—he bears a good character—he has been in the Army, I believe, over 20 years.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> He must have been a soldier—he had been two years a compounder—only a man of good character would be selected for that post, and every confidence would be placed in him.</p>

               <p>at the Herbert Hospital—I have known the prisoner 18 months as Duplegley—a deficiency in the stores was discovered, and I spoke to the prisoner in the presence of Inspector Littlechild and another officer on 18th March—I said, "These are two detective officers, who are investi<lb></lb>gating the sale of some drugs which are supposed to have been sold or made away with by you"—he replied, "Me! no, never"—Littlechild said, "Do you know a man of the name of Ashley?"—he said, "I do"—he was asked by the chief medical officer "Have you given Ashley any drugs?"—he said, "No, never"—I placed the prisoner under military arrest—afterwards I asked him, "Has anybody besides yourself had access to the stores?"—he replied, "Yes, Corporal Brown, but he is honest, and would in no way interfere with the stores"—the next day he was brought before his commanding officer—Ashley was there asked where he got the drugs from—they were all produced there—Ashley said, "I received them as security from the prisoner for money lent, amount<lb></lb>ing to between 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—the prisoner was asked why he sold them—he did not reply—then Ashley was asked, "Why did you sell them, having received them as security?"—he said, "Because I wanted the money"—the prisoner was then asked in the usual way whether he had anything to say—he replied, "I never sold medicines, I only gave them to Ashley; lam not guilty"—he remained under arrest till 25th March, when he was handed over to the police at Woolwich.</p>

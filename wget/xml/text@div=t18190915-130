            , who is a Manchester warehouseman, and lives in Ironmonger-lane - Mr. Hatblock is a customer of ours. On the 14th of July, in consequence of what Summerling told me, I got an officer, and followed Hughes, who had got a piece of muslin from our shop. I saw the prisoner beckon to him in Cheapside. He followed the prisoner down Queen-street, and delivered the muslin to him - we secured him.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Dickinson. Hughes came into the shop, and asked for a piece of muslin for Mr. Hatblock; I delivered it to him. I suspected him, and informed Simpkins. The prisoner was brought to the warehouse in about five minutes, and said he was sent by one White, who was to meet him at the Dog-row.</p>
               <p>RICHARD HUGHES. I am fourteen years old, and live in East Smithfield, my father works in the London Docks. On the 14th of July I was going to my sister's when I was in Ironmonger-lane the prisoner touched me on the shoulder, and asked me if I would go an errand for him? I never saw him before. He pointed out Mr. Dickinson's and told me to go and ask for a piece of muslin for Mr. Hatblock, and he would meet me at the corner of Queen-street. I went, and at last they gave it to me. I told them who I came from, then went out, and the prisoner beckoned me over to Queen-street, I delivered it to him. He asked me if I would have a little beer? I refused, and the officer took him</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">interpreted</hi>). I am a ship carpenter, my vessel is lying at Rotherhithe—at 11.30 at night on the 5th August I went on board and went astern first, and then to the forecastle—the doors were shut—when I tried to open the doors the prisoner called from within and asked if I was the carpenter—the prisoner and another man rushed out—the prisoner then took me by the shoulders and and the other man round my arms—I said to the prisoner "What do you want with me?" and felt a blow on my neck, and he afterwards cut me in five other places on the head, neck, and breast, and he let go his hold and ran away—I threw an oil can after him after he stabbed me.</p>

I am a surgeon, of 70, Union Road, Rotherhithe—I was called to the prosecutor on Sunday morning, the 6th August, about 1 o'clock—I found him in the police-station bleeding from several wounds—I discovered two on that occasion and two the following morning—they were incised wounds such as might have been inflicted with a knife; they have not turned out to be dangerous; they were in dangerous parts—I found the prisoner also had a cut on the head and two on one of his hands; I think they were lacerated wounds and there was a cut between the thumb and finger which seemed to be incised—the wound in the head might have arisen from a can having fallen upon it; it was a contused wound—the prosecutor is well now.</p>

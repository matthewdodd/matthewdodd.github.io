                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, N</hi> 53). I produce two certificates of marriage, (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi>)—"Hamilton, (<hi rend="italic">Scotland</hi>), 3d September, 1844. Robert Brown and Margaret Chennells have been regularly proclaimed to be married bv me, before the witnesses Alexander Laing and John Charlesley, <hi rend="italic">Signed—John</hi> Taylor M'Farlane"—"St. Bartholomew's Church, Moor-lane—Robert Wat<lb></lb>nough Fletcher and Elizabeth Darby married by banns, May 3d, 1857"—I received information which induced me to go after the prisoner, and on 8th May went with his wife to 6, Two Brewers'-court, Golden-lane, and inquired of the second wife, if Mr. Fletcher lived there—she said, "Yes;" T asked to see him, and saw the prisoner, who said that his name was Fletcher—I said that I was an officer, and wanted him on a charge of bigamy—he said, "What, bigamy! who has preferred that charge against me?" I said that it was his former wife who he had married in Scotland—he seemed very much confused, and said, "It is too true, and I suppose I must submit"—he said to his second wife that I was going to take him away on a charge of bigamy, that he had married another woman in Scotland some years pre<lb></lb>vious to his knowing her, and he wished her, the second wife, to forgive him—I took him to the station and he gave his proper name, Robert Brown.</p>

                  </hi>. I was married to the prisoner on May 3d, 1857, at St. Bartholomew's, Little Moorfields—I had known him nine years; we were living togother before we were married, and I afterwards persuaded him to marry me—I never heard him speak about his wife, I thought he was a bachelor—I have had six children by him—he lived with me and sup<lb></lb>ported me and the children—during the whole of that time I never saw any wife and did not know of his visiting anybody—he is a cooper—I became acquainted with him in London.</p>

                  </hi>. I am minister of Brandon-street Presby<lb></lb>terian Church, Hamilton, North Britain—on 4th October, 1844,1 celebrated the marriage mentioned in this certificate, in conformity with the laws of Scotland, but not in a Church; all marriages in Scotland are celebrated in private houses—I appended a religious ceremony to it—the prisoner is the man—I saw him frequently for several years after his marriage—he lived with his wife—I have lost sight of him for the last ten or twelve years—I have no doubt of his being the man—they had two children as far as I recollect—I saw his wife alive last Monday morning, I knew her.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I was married in 1844, in Scotland, and after living with my wife three years adverse circumstances separated us; I went to sea as captain of a sailing vessel and returned in 1849, when I communicated with my wife's family repeatedly but had no reply, though my address was</p>

               <p>given in tihe letter. I did not think then that she was dead, but thought they would not correspond with a mined and penniless man. I afterwards heard from two of my fellow townsmen that she was dead, and afterwards married my present wife. I intreat you to believe that I had no guilty knowledge: fifteen year elapsed between the first and the second marriage. I had no motive or inducement to break the law, as Elizabeth Darby had no money or property, she being only a domestic servant; neither could it be for the purpose of possessing her person, for I had already lived with her, as my wife, previous to marriage: my only aim in doing so arose from her sense of the disgraceful way in which we were living. I have been five weeks in prison and have five children who have no bread winner but myself.</p>

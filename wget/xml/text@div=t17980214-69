               <p>Q. Where were the things found? - A. Two handkerchiefs in the bureau below stairs, belonging to the prisoner, and part up stairs in the prisoner's bed-room.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did the bureau belong to them both? - A. I believe so, they are married; a pair of silk stockings was found in the bureau below, my sister was present when they were found.</p>
               <p>Q.In consequence of that, they were committed for trial? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Had you missed any other property, since they lived with you, at any time? - A. I have missed several things, but do not know how they went.</p>

               <p>Q.Mind what you say, did you ever enquire for them? - A. I enquired for the Bank-notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not talk about notes, I shall show you some of your own notes by-and-by that have not been paid - had you ever enquired for these things? - A.Out of delicacy, for fear they should think that I thought them thieves, I had not enquired for them.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that note, that has not been paid, due at Lockhart's? - A. That is not my note, it is my brother's.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179802140090"></xptr>Q.Your brother and you were partners, were not you? - A. Yes, formerly.</p>
               <p>Q.Were not you at the time this note is dated? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. It is dated the 27th of May, 1797? - A. I do not recollect exactly; I had the misfortune to to have my affairs given over to my creditors, and since that, my brother and I have not been partners; I cannot recollect whether it was before or after my misfortune.</p>
               <p>Q. You can say, whether it was before or after your bankruptcy? - A. No, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did not you pay that to the prisoner, in satisfaction of ten pounds due from you to him? - A. Upon my oath, I not only did not give that note, but it is after my misfortune I recollect, and it is my brother's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pay that to the prisoner? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You never borrowed ten pounds of the prisoner? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor any sum of money? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Take care, are you sure of that? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. This happened on the Saturday night that you took these people up, by a warrant? - A. Sunday.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not expect to be arrested, on the Monday, for fifty-one pounds? - A.No, not at all; I did not owe it.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not expect to be arrested at the suit of the prisoner on the Monday following the Sunday? - A. No, I did not; they could arrest me, but I did not owe them that money.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, had they not threatered you before you took them up by the warrant? - A. They had threatened, but I did not care a fig for it.</p>
               <p>Q. For how much? - A. For a false bill of fifty-one pounds.</p>
               <p>Q.And so you took them up by a warrant on the Sunday? - A. Not to prevent that, I assure you.</p>
               <p>Q. But you did take them up the very day before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Then you did not place these things, that were found in their trunk, in the hands of the woman yourself? - A. No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, had she not them to wash for you? - A.Several months before she washed for me; and as I missed my linen, and she happened to he ill, I told her not to wash any more for me, because she was ill; out of courtesy I would not tell her I thought her a thief.</p>
               <p>Q. A little before this there was a little dispute about a still, that they were afraid would set the house on fire? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. They told you they would not live in the house for fear of fire, from this private still? - A. I heard that they objected to it, but they did not do so to me.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe this house was a good deal furnished with these people's own furniture? - A. The kitchen and the front room, and six chairs besides.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not the woman prisoner the entire care of your linen? - A. No, she never had; for I kept it locked up.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you, and I tell you now, there are several people who heard you say so - I am going to ask you, upon your oath, have you never said, that you would not have taken these people up, but they were going to arrest you? - A. I never did; I said, that they had acted so bad, and provoked me so often, that they obliged me to be severe with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never said, and I tell you there are people who have heard you - have you never said, that you would not have taken these people up but they threatened to arrest you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You never have said so? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor any thing like that? - A. I said, if they had not provoked me so long, that I would certainly have let them have gone perfectly content.</p>
               <p>Q.Then you never said, that you would not have taken them up if they had not threatened to arrest you? - A. No. I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell Rivet, the officer, that you had given these things into the woman's possession? - A. I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he then ask you, if you had ever demanded the property? - A. I do not recollect that he did ask me that question.</p>
               <p>Q. It happened only last Sunday se'nnight - did not he ask you, whether you ever asked the woman for the things? - A. I cannot recollect positively.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did not the officer say, then how could you charge the prisoner with robbing you? - A. I cannot recollect that, positively, upon my oath.</p>
               <p>Q. Though it passed only last Sunday se'nnight? - A. I cannot recollect, upon my oath.</p>
               <p>Q. He might have said so, and you forgot it? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q.Now, I ask you - did not the two prisoners at the bar demand of you fifty-one pounds, upon the very Saturday that you went to apply for a warrant? - A. They did not; but when my Solicitor asked them if they had any further demand, when I closed my bill, they said they had a demand of fifty-one pounds; I said it was a false demand, and they had no right to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you not offer to give a note of hand for thirteen pounds, for money due to him, if he would give you a receipt in full? - A. I shall, upon that, candidly tell you the truth; I saw things going all wrong, and I thought best to get did of them in a quiet way without exposing them too much; I had a law-suit on account of property<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179802140091"></xptr>lost from where I lived, which amounted to three pounds, or three guineas, and I had a note of my brother's for ten pounds, I thought best to get rid of them, and I said, I will give you that, I have no objection; and as this was my own brother, I would do any thing to serve him; I should be very glad to give them that, and if you like it I will give you a note of hand for thirteen pounds, in order not to expose them to the public, and to do them a favour; but I know very well that I have a right to arrest them, and expose them, which I have done now.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did offer to give him a note, at two months, for thirteen pounds? - A. A month, or two months; during my travels in Scotland, a man took a piece of wood from my premises, and charged the prisoner at the bar with stealing it from him, and the man was obliged to prosecute him to clear himself from having not stole it.</p>
               <p>Q. So you offered him your note for thirteen pounds to settle all disputes? - A. Yes; which I did not owe him.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, have you not said, that if it had not been for the kindness of the prisoners in assisting you, you would not have had a bed to lie upon? - A. It is a great lie as can be told.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that gentleman there, Mr. Jarvis? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps he will tell that lie? - A. It is completely false.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you not often given them articles of wearing apparel to pledge for you in time of distress? - A. Not often, I suppose, it has been done four or five times.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear it has not been done forty times; and remember Mr. Shannon is here? - A. I will swear it was not twenty times, nor ten times.</p>
               <p>Q. That you swear positively? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Thomas? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner's sister? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.You have applied to borrow money of her, have not you? - A. I never made any proposal to her.</p>
               <p>Q.But to him, to borrow of her for you? - A. That, perhaps, has happened.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, do not you know that you made such a request to the prisoner, to borrow money of his sister for you for your sister? - A. I recollect something of it, I cannot say positively.</p>
               <p>Q.What sum was it? - A. It might be something of ten pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. How long ago is that? - A. Four or five months ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, have not you repeatedly borrowed money from the prisoner himself from time to time? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, have you never said you would not have carried on this prosecution unless you had been persuaded to it; and if any harm came from it you would never forgive yourself? - A. No; I only said I would not have been severe upon them, but as they were so provoking, and used me so bad.</p>
               <p>Q.So provoking, for what - because they threatened to arrest you? - A.For four weeks they had been provoking.</p>
               <p>Q.They had been complaining for four weeks about this private still? - A. It was not a private still.</p>
               <p>Q.You never said you would not have arrested them if they had not been so provoking as to threaten to arrest you? - A. No; I said they were so provoking, and even spoke of arresting me, but he had no right, for I did not owe him a halfpenny.</p>
               <p>Q.And if they had not been provoking you would not have prosecuted them? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.You have given them things to pawn for you? - A. Sometimes I have; and I say there is no harm in pawning if you want to make up a bill; I gave these things into their possession to take care of; I dressed myself always at my sister's house, and my linen was there.</p>
               <p>Q. And was not your linen washed there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you not often been indulged, now, with a cravat, or a neckcloth, of her husband's - have you not been often indulged with wearing the prisoner's linen? - A. Only twice; and that only a handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. They are the same things you have charged these people with stealing? - A. The same sort of things.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. How long has the woman prisoner been discontinued from washing for you? - A. I suppose she has not washed for me for five or six months.</p>
               <p>Q. The things you have missed has been since the time that she ceased to wash for you? - A. I can only say I missed, from time to time, things without knowing how.</p>
               <p>Q. You put on your clothes at your sister's? - A. Commonly; I sometimes put on a shirt, and may leave it at my own house.</p>
               <p>Q. Those things that you left there, did you keep always locked up in your own press? - A. Yes; I took particular care of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any pretence in the prisoners at the bar for calling upon you for a debt of fifty-one pounds? - A. When I paid the prisoners, I paid them twenty-three pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you, at the time they threatened you with an action for fifty-one pounds, was there any truth in that demand? - A. No truth at all.</p>
               <p>Q.How long a time do you suppose you had been missing this property? - A. I perceived that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179802140092"></xptr>amongst my handkerchiefs and shirts that I found they diminished, for the course of six or eight months.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you begin to suspect the prisoners were concerned in the taking of these things? - A. At the time she began to be ill, about six months ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you wish, or had you any inclination to prosecute, till you could find you had no peace in your house? - A.Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it that they threatened you with this action that you say is false? - A. The Saturday before the Sunday that I took out the warrant.</p>


               <p>Q. Was it not from the provocation that they made in the house, that you were induced to prosecute? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How came you to say they never lent you any money, when you say you had paid them twenty-three pounds? - A. That was the amount of wages and the day-book.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Had any of these articles that you now miss been missing during the last six months? - A. Some of them must have been stolen since that time, because one was a new handkerchief that I bought not long ago.</p>
               <p>Q. You paid her for washing your linen independent of what she had as a servant? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What else has there been missing? - A. The linen of my sister and the linen of my brother.</p>
               <p>Q. That passed within the last six months? - A. I cannot say, it was a good while ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any other article of your own that you can swear to have missed within these last six months? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you believe that all these articles were stolen before the time that she ceased to wash for you? - A. I cannot speak to any of them with certainty since.</p>
               <p>Court. These being all the articles of linen that she had to wash, and being paid separately for that, I cannot say that that is a felony.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. There is a yard and a half of silk and a net purse. (Miller, the officer, produces it).</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Do you think this looks as if it had ever been washed? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Eckbart.) Did you ever -</p>
               <p>Court. I think as to any property that was taken before the time that she ceased to work for him as a washerwoman, an action of Trover might be brought for not delivering it up, but it cannot be charged as a felony; therefore the case must be now reduced to these articles not delivered to her as a washerwoman.</p>

               <p>Q. Was that by his appointment and by his direction? - A.

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I live at Knightsbridge: I know Mr. Eckhardt very well, and I know the prisoners at the bar, they are very honest industrious people: On the Tuesday, or Wednesday, after they were taken up, I was standing at my door, in the morning, he said to me, Mr. Thomas, I suppose that you have heard of what has happened; I said, yes, Sir, I have; but what can it all be about; why, says he, they have put it all wrong in the papers -</p>
               <p>Q. It had appeared in the newspapers? - A. Yes, but I have not seen it; says he, about the two 20l. notes; says he, a gentleman brought me a bill of 511. for chairs, and furniture, in Hatton-garden, but I did promise to pay them a note there, belonging to my brother, of 10l. I offered to give them a new note for 13l. at two months, to ged rid of them; I heard him also say, had I not taken this measure he would have arrested me for this false debt on the Monday morning.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. (To Eckhardt.) Q. You have heard what Mr. Jarvis stated just now; upon your oath, was what Mr. Jarvis stated, upon his oath, true? - A. I say it is a compleat untruth; I swear to God, that I never have said a single word, or a single letter, that I can say before God, and my conscience; I defy him to say I ever said so; as to these people that come to swear that I said I took them up because they threatened to arrest me, they accosted me to know how this business went on; and I had mentioned to them, that among other things, they had demanded a bill of 51l. and that I had taken them up.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. You know you have answered me<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179802140095"></xptr>some questions upon this - do you now admit, that their threatening was one of the reasons, mixed with others, that induced you to take them up? - A. To be sure; all the atrocity together.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did say that was one reason, amongst others? - A. Yes; I did when I told it to Mr. Stovin; he said, he would be bail for me immediately if they did arrest me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you then tell these people that their threatening to arrest you for 51l. was one reason amongst others why you took them up? - A. All the atrocity together; they had behaved so bad, and so disrespectful to me, that they had even gone so far as to threaten to arrest me for it.</p>
               <p>Q.Then did you or not, say to these people, that their threatening to arrest you for 51l. was one of the reasons that induced you to take them up? - A. It was one of my reasons, of course.</p>

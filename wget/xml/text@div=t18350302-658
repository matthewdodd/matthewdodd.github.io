                  </hi>. I keep the Dolphin Tavern in Mare-street, in the parish of St. John, at Hackney. The prisoner had been in my service three or four months, to carry out beer and wait in the public-house—he slept in the house—on the morning of the 7th or 8th of February I re<lb></lb>ceived some information, and on the 11th of February this happened.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You were examined about this on the 7th of February? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On the morning of the day I was examined I heard the prisoner come down stairs about six o'clock—I partly dressed myself and came down a few stairs—I heard him strike a light, and open the parlour shutters in the passage, and I saw him open the street door—I was on the staircase—I saw him come back and go into the front parlour, and take a chair, which he took out at the front door—I then went up stairs into the Assembly Room, which is directly over the parlour—I had left the Assembly Room window open previously, about eleven o'clock at night, before I went to bed, having suspicion—I looked out and saw him place the chair under the bar-parlour window, which was not open—he had a candle and candlestick in his hand—the chair was outside in the street—just as he placed the chair there, a customer came and asked him for some<lb></lb>thing to drink—he said his master would not be up for an hour—I then went into my bed-room, fearing he might come up—I had not been there two minutes before I heard the bar-parlour window pushed up—I went to the window, and saw him getting into the bar-parlour—I ran down stairs, saw him go into the bar to the till, put his hands into it, and take copper money out—I had left nothing in the till but copper money—it was partly marked, and partly unmarked—I was directly opposite him, at a sash-window—there is a blind outside the win<lb></lb>dow, so that he could not see me—I stood at the bar door, which is in the passage—that door was locked, but the door communicating with the bar-parlour is never locked—I was standing by a glass door, which had a blind</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183503020007"></xptr>
               <p>to it, which prevented him seeing me; but the blind being outside, I turned it a little on one side, which gave me an opportunity of seeing what he was about—he had a light with him, and I had none—I saw him open the till, and take copper money out, and put it into his jacket pocket—it was quite dark at the time—I then saw him go into the bar-parlour, and get out of the window—the till is in the bar, which joins the bar-parlour—he got out at the same window—he put the blind as it was left the night before, shut the window down, and brought the chair in—I went up stairs and stood in my bed-room listening for half or three quarters of an hour—I heard nobody come in; and about seven o'clock the prisoner, as usual, came up and knocked at my bed-room door—I came down stairs directly—the pri<lb></lb>soner went into the cellar to clean the knives and forks—I unlocked the bar door, counted the money, and missed twenty-eight penny-pieces, all of which I had marked—the till was not locked—any body in the bar might open it—I immediately sent a person for a constable, and gave the prisoner into custody—I accused him of taking the money, which he denied—he was searched in my presence, but nothing was found on him—I went into the cellar, where he had been cleaning his knives, and found one penny-piece only, marked, close by an empty rum-puncheon, at the back of it—he had been in the cellar about twenty-five minutes—I am sure it was one of the penny-pieces I had marked and put into the till the night before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How is the bar-parlour accessible in the house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> By a door from the passage, and then you can walk from the bar into the bar-parlour—when the sash bar door is locked at night, nobody can get in without break<lb></lb>ing the lock—the door is between the passage and the bar-parlour—I had locked the bar and parlour door the night before, and I noticed that this, window was left unfastened, about a quarter before twelve o'clock—it was the prisoner's duty to fasten it—he had gone to bed then—I did not fasten it myself, having some suspicion—this might be on the 7th of February—I had no character with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q</hi>. When you saw me in the bar-parlour, why not take me? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because I thought somebody else was concerned in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. It was never my orders to fasten up the front of the house—the parlour shutters were never more than put to, and the window had no catch to it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you observe whether the shutters are fast before you go to bed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We always leave it to the prisoner—I never found them un<lb></lb>fastened—he did not break the shutter open, nor the window—two gen<lb></lb>tlemen have since tried to open the shutters outside, and they thought it impossible to do so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But you saw the prisoner do it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have no reason to think he had been out? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I sent him out with a message before I sent for a constable—he was not out more than three or four minutes—he had not been in the cellar after he returned—no silver was found on him.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my uncle, William Jackson; he keeps the White Lion public-house, in Brick-lane, Old-street, St. Luke's. About seven o'clock, on the 9th of February, the prisoner came to the bar for half a pint of porter—I turned my back to him—the till was not in my sight—I heard some money drop, and the till shut—there was no one there to shut it but the prisoner—I had seen it a little while before, and there was 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in it—I just caught sight of the prisoner as he got out of the door—I examined the till, there was one half-crown and one shilling left, instead of 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—there had been three half-crowns and the rest in shillings—I am sure he is the man, there was no one else in the place.</p>

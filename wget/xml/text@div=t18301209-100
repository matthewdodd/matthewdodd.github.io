            . I am a porter to the prosecutors. On the 27th of November I had been to the Sun Fire-office with some things, and when I came back I saw the prisoner inside the shop door, with the portfolio in his hand; there was somebody in care of the shop - he had not been laid hold of; I asked what he was going to do with the portfolio - he said he was going to look at it; he was near the door, which opens close to the counter - there was nothing but stamps in the portfolio; I took hold of him - Mr. Irons then came from the other end of the shop; I told him this person had got the portfolio - he then put it on the counter - I said he had said he took it to look at: Mr. Irons sent for an officer, who had it delivered to him, I think.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see the officer come? A. Yes, and heard all that passed - I never saw music in the shop; Mr. Irons is not here - he was serving a customer.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether the prisoner was waiting till Mr. Irons had done with the customer and then to ask for what he wanted, you cannot say? A. No. - he made no attempt to run away; no other property of ours was found on him - the shop door was partly open when I came in; it is the same sort of portfolio as paper would be kept in - nobody could tell there were stamps in it.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was sent for, and took charge of him with the portfolio - some of the stamps are cut and some not; I only found three halfpence on the prisoner - he had a great coat on his arm; he said he had a wife and four children, and he went down on his knees for forgiveness; Mr. Irons, Mr. Bull, and Mr. Lodge were in the shop when I went in.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The stamps were all in the book? A. Yes, he had taken none out - if I had not been at the shop before I should not have known it contained stamps.</p>
               <p>MR. STEPHENS. This is the portfolio - it did not lay on the counter when I left the shop; it laid on the bench of the window, behind the counter - he could get it by reaching over the counter, without going round.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Can you tell whether it might not have been moved in your absence? A. No - the door opens against the counter, but it must be closed again before he could reach the stamps; he might certainly have got out of the door if he had had time - the shop is a long one; a man could buy 1d. worth of paper at our shop.</p>

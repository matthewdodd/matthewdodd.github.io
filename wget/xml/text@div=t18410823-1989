                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Mr. George Tern's Whel<lb></lb>bourn, chemist and druggist, in Judd-street, the prisoner was in our em<lb></lb>ploy. On the 7th of July I marked some halfpence, and put them into the till—I was the only person that had access to the till till the prisoner was taken up, on the 10th of July—I did not pay away any of the marked money—he had been out, and when he came home I asked if he had been to the till, he told me he had not—I said I missed some money, he said he had not taken any—I desired him to sit down, and a policeman was called—I was in the habit of giving the prisoner money in the morning to get milk for breakfast, but that morning I gave him none—he had not asked for any—my partner was not there.</p>

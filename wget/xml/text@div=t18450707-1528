                  </hi>. I am a pensioner of Chelsea College. About twelve o'clock at night, on the 2nd of July, I was going home to the college—I got to Hospital-row—I did not see the prisoner, but he jumped upon my back, and took me by the throat, and put his hand into my right pocket—I seized him by the left arm, we struggled, and fell down together—the policeman was coming up, and the prisoner made his escape up a court—I had nothing in the pocket that he put his hand into but two keys.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Franklin-row, Chelsea. I was passing Hospital-row at ten minutes past twelve o'clock that night—I saw the prisoner put his arm round the prosecutor's neck, and put his right hand into his pocket—he caught hold of his arm, and threw the prosecutor down—they both fell, and soon after the prisoner ran up the court.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You did not do anything to assist the prosecutor? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I picked him up—I was about half a dozen yards off while they were struggling—I stood and looked—I did not go to him—I lived at a public house last—I was paid while I was there—that was at the Barley Mow, at Islington—I left as my master and I had a few words—I did not rob him, and he did not say I did—I had rather not mention what it was—since then I have been working a little at one place and a little at another—I have worked for a plumber lately—I had been over to Islington that night, and parted with a few friends, that made me out so late—I knew the po<lb></lb>liceman who came up, for three years—I was rather surprised to find him just on the spot at that moment—I had made no appointment to meet him—I had met him several times before—I believe I had seen him the day before.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable B</hi> 134.) I saw the prisoner and the prosecutor on the ground—I went up and the prisoner ran up Jubilee-court,—I knew him well, and I apprehended him about an hour and a half afterwards—I spoke to him about it, and he said he did not take anything—he had had a glass, but he could run as well as I could, and he was sober—the prosecutor had had a glass or two, but he was quite comfortable.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Who picked the prosecutor up? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Marsh—I am not acquainted with him—I do not know his name—I have seen him for years—he has been a waiter at a public-house, and since that a labourer at a plumber's—I had not seen him the day before to my knowledge—this case was heard at Westminster—there was a person there who wanted a duplicate of a watch which I took from the prisoner.</p>

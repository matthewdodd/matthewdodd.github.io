I am stationed at Hounslow—between the night and morning of 28th and 29th of January, I was on duty in the High-street—I received a communication, and proceeded towards Hounslow Church—I saw the prisoner, about a quarter-past 3, walking very fast down the town—he had some clothes with him, which I produce here; a coat, two shirts, two scarfs, and one collar—they have been identified—I stopped the prisoner and asked him what he had got—he said some clothes that he had picked up in the park—he then said there had been a shop broken into, and two men had gone down the lane—I said he must go back with me, and in going back we met Mr. Douglas—I stopped the prisoner about 200 yards from Mr. Cooper's house—he was then coming in the direc<lb></lb>tion from Cooper's—I took him back to the shop—we found the shop had been broken into, part of the property was lying outside, two shutters were down, and a large square of plate glass broken—there was some blood on the glass—when we got to the station I looked at the prisoner's hands, and found his finger cut, and blood on it—I had seen the premises shortly before this, and the shutters were quite secure then.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon at Hounslow, and live opposite Mr. Cooper's—on the morning of 29th January, about 3 o'clock, I was awoke by the breaking of glass—I got out of bed, went into another room, looked out of the window, and saw the figure of a man at Mr. Cooper's shop-window, in a crouching position—I did not see his face—it was moonlight—I opened the window, and said, "What are you doing?" "Who are you?" or some such words—he did not answer me at first, and then said, "All's right"—I then said, "What are you doing?" and he said,</p>

               <p>"Come and see"—from the tone of his voice, my impression was that he was an Irishman—I dressed myself as quickly as possible, went through my surgery, and across the road—I cried "Police!" first two or three times, and the man said, "There are no police here, "and then began calling" Police! "himself, and walked off quickly—when I crossed the road, I found some clothes there and the shop broken into—I rang the bell and aroused them—I did not notice, when the man walked away, whether he had clothes with him—I saw the prisoner in the hands of the police—I could not swear to his being the person who was at the shop—I did not see his face—I recognised his voice—I have heard him speak since he has been in custody—to the best of my belief he is the same person I saw at the shop.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clothier at Hounslow—on the night of 28th January, we went to bed about 12—my house was in perfect safety at that time—these articles produced are my property—I missed them from my stock on the Friday morning—I saw the prisoner in the hands of the police.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I work for the 11th Hussars, at Hounslow, and have been in that neighbourhood over six months. On that night I was taking a drop of ale at the White Horse, and was afterwards going home to see if my lodgings were open. I passed by this shop, and two men came out and threw this bundle down, which I picked up. I took up a piece of glass at the same time, turned round, and saw the window broke. I bawled out "Police!" I did not go twenty yards away. I have a wife and four chil<lb></lb>dren in London, and I support them by honest labour.</p>

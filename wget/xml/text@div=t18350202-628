                  </hi>. I live in King-street, Lower-road, Islington, and am a grocer. This is my sugar—my name is on the wrapper—I left my shop, on the 5th of February, a few minutes after nine o'clock, and never saw the sugar again, till it was at the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Queen-street, Islington. About eleven o'clock that morning, I was about a dozen doors from the prosecutor's, and saw the prisoner and another boy lurking about the shop—the other boy went into the shop, brought out the loaf of sugar, and gave it to the prisoner, who put it into his apron, and walked away—Mrs. Lewis came out, and said, "Wingrove, stop him."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. The other boy went in, and came out and dropped the sugar on the edge of the door—it rolled down to the kennel—I did not have it at all—I hardly know what dress the other boy had on. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. they were together for five minutes before he went in—I was loading dung—Mrs. Lewis took up the sugar—I took the prisoner—he kneeled down and begged for pardon and mercy—my horse was towards Mrs. Lewis's shop—I watched them, I may say, ten minutes—the prisoner appeared to be waiting for the other while he went in—my partner caught the other boy, but he was let go.</p>

On the 2d of October, a little after one in the morning, as I was coming home to my own house, five women came out of <placeName id="t17811017-55-crimeloc276">Coventry-court</placeName>

They pulled me about, struck me, and used me exceeding ill; and they took by force 28 s. a guinea, two half-crowns, and 2 s. out of my pocket. They got me down on the ground. I called out for the watch, and cried out, Murder!</p>
               <p>Did you represent your case thus when you preferred the indictment? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you no conversation with any one of them? - No: they all came upon me together.</p>
               <p>Did you know any of them? - No; I never saw them in my life. I catched the prisoner's hand in my pocket. I did not loose her hand. Another woman took the money from her. They said, they would cut my hand off, to make me loose my hand. At last, a watchman came. One of the women went to him, and, I believe, gave him something; upon which he said, It was out of his beat, and he would not assist me. I kept hold of the prisoner till another person came and secured her.</p>
               <p>Was you sober, or in liquor? - As sober as I am this minute: I had only supped with my landlord, and drank part of two pots of beer between five of us.</p>
               <p>Did you see her give the money to the other woman? - Yes; it was a very moonlight night.</p>

               <p>I never saw the gentleman till he laid hold of me in the Hay-market, and they said I was one of the women; that was after he called the watch. I went up the court, to see what he called about, and he said I was one of the women.</p>
               <p>To the Prosecutor. Are you sure you never loosed her till you called the watch? - I am sure of it. They beat me, and kicked me; and when the watch came, the others ran away.</p>

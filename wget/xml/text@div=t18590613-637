Q.</hi> Were you present at the trial at Chelmsford? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I gave the same evidence as I have to-day—Goldstein told me they were sample slippers—I should say I was making inquiries for six or seven days, if not more, after he gave me the information—he came to me several times afterwards, and I told him I was still prosecuting my inquiries—when he told me it was the half-past 9 train I knew immediately to whom I was to apply, and I knew Buckland would be up in town again—I made written inquiries at the stations on the line.</p>

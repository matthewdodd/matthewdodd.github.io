D. of Dublin—I live at Hornsey—about 7.45 in the morning of 23rd September I was called to 24, in the Grove, and found Mrs. Black in the front room ground floor in a fainting condition, and bleeding profusely—I examined her and found a cut about three inches long transversely across the throat—it was not very deep—it did not sever any important vessel—there were also two</p>

I feel positive about the lung being penetrated, because of the very profuse hemorrhage, and from the fact of there being air under the skin—air could be felt for several inches round the wound, that is a sure sign—I did not hear the prisoner make any remark—I was attending to the woman, and had no conversation with him and had no opportunity of noticing whether he was in liquor—from the position of the wound, quite in the middle of the throat, not more on one side than the other, and from its length and straightness I cannot understand how it 'could have been! caused by an accidental fall on the knife—I could not form a judgment whether it had been done with the right hand or left—it was not deeper; on one side than the other—in a slight wound of this nature that would afford no indication whether it was an intentional or accidental wound; the knife is not at all sharp—the woman is quite out of danger now.</p>

She said "No, I mean to buy myself a pair of boots with the money. I said "Jane, we. have had two or three rows about ibis back rent; I will go round to Mr. Beall, toy landlord, and tell him to take what he likes for the rent I did so; he said he did not want to take my goods, so my wife paid one week's rent, and I sold some things to a man on Crouch Hill for two guineas. I went and had some drink, and about 10.30 or 11 o'clock I went home, pulled off my boots, and laid down on the bed—I said to my wife two or three times in the night "Why don't you come to bed. "She said" I will not "I got up about 4 o'clock and said" Jane, come into bed and kiss me and shake hands and make it up," which she did. I got up about 7.15 and went into the yard I cut a, bit of stick and pointed it with my knife to take something out of my teeth. As I came back into the room my wife was just going out; she had her bonnet on. I said "Where are you going?"She said "To work." I said "You shall not go. "She said "I will," and made a rush to the door, and, not thinking of the knife, I pushed her and she screamed "Murder!"I twisted her round and we both fell on a box, and as she was getting up I put my arm round her neck to kiss her and she ran <hi rend="italic">but</hi> I had no intention of doing it.

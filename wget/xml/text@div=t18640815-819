                  </hi>. I live at 14, New Montague-street, which leads into Osborn-street, High-street, Whitechapel—on the evening of 6th July, at 11 o'clock, I fastened the shutters of my room, and put the window down—I slept down-stairs, just under the window—I went to bed, and was awoke by a noise at half-past 2—I sat up in bed and saw that the shutters were unbolted, and I saw a man's hand take a piece of black skirt out of the window; a dress, which was rolled round the rod in front of the window, was gone—this is the property (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I have no doubt about it—the black dress is partly made up—the male prisoner was the man who took it out; I saw him distinctly by the light of the gas-lamp, which is right opposite my window—I afterwards picked him out from five others at the police-station—I gave information to the police at the Spitalfields station.</p>

I went with her towards Thrall-street, where she lives. I stayed talking to her about ten minutes, and then went towards Shoreditch with her, which was when the policeman saw us together. I went to my lodgings, and left her at the coffee-shop. When I came back there I found she was gone. I came back, and turned down Flower and Dean-street, and stood at the corner. She came to the other end of the street, and called me, and I went up to her. Then a police<lb></lb>man called me, and said, "I must detain you." I asked what was the mat<lb></lb>ter, and he said, "I don't know; I have only got to detain you. "We then went up into the girl's room, and found a policeman there, and she said she had bought the things. I thought she had bought them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a convict keeper on board the <hi rend="italic">Warrior</hi> hulk. I did live in Charles-street, Woolwich—I left there the latter end of April—during the time I occupied that house, the two prisoners had a furnished room in it—they occupied it about three weeks—I lived there when they took the apartment, and then I removed to No. 5, Albion-road—when I left the house in Charles-street, I still continued to hold it—I am absent from home myself sometimes for two days and three nights—about a week or a fort<lb></lb>night after I removed, I received information that the prisoners were gone—I went, and everything was taken out of the room that belonged to me, except three chairs—the house was left empty and locked up, but they had not shut the front window—the prisoners had agreed to take four empty rooms of me, and they removed the furniture from the upper room into the lower room—besides the furniture which was in the room they occupied, we missed a great many things that were not let to them; a bed, a counterpane, three blankets, four pillows, two saucepans, some flat irons, fire irons, a table cover, some pillow-cases, and other things—my wife will tell you better than I can—I discovered where the prisoners were living, in White-street, in the Borough—I went there with Mr. Keefe, and took a constable with me—I found some of my property in the room where the prisoners were—these things my wife can speak to better than I can—here is a towel marked with ink, and a pillow case marked with my own name on it—I had not given the prisoners any authority to take away the things.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Spearing's Defence (written</hi>). I beg you will believe the statement I am about to make, on account of my poor children, which are four in number, all under the age of seven years, and one is quite a cripple; I was residing at Gosport, my husband being a seaman on board the <hi rend="italic">Winchester;</hi> as I have only 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a month to support us all, I was obliged to work very hard at my needle to maintain my family, when I was persuaded by William Weathers and his wife to come to London with them, and they would get me plenty of work; they stayed with me till I had parted with everything I had, even to the bed from under me; they then left me alone in the house with their brother, the lad now before you; he told me if I would take a furnished room in his name, he would get work, and pay the rent, as his brother and sister had acted so cruelly to me; I accordingly took a room of Mr. Grant, my prosecutor; I was there a week, when I paid him, and gave up the room; he removed out of the house, and left us four empty rooms, and lent the young man, Joseph Weathers, a few things till he could get some of his own; I knew nothing about the things being pledged, and I had nothing to do with pledging any, or taking anything away; my reason for troubling you with this statement is to assure you that I have not been living with Weathers in an improper way, and I know nothing of the things he had pledged.</p>

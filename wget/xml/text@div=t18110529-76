            . On the 9th of May last, about half past six in the evening I was in the little room next to the shop making my bed, I heard the shop door open, I saw a man come into the shop, I immediately ran to the shop window where the stockings were and I saw a man run out of the door with a bundle of stockings out of the window, he ran into <placeName id="t18110529-76-crimeloc438">Princes-court</placeName>

Mrs. Mackgee brought me the stockings in about five minutes, these are them, I am sure they are the stockings that were taken out of my window, I had seen them in the window in the morning, and I am sure the prisoner is the person that was in my shop, I saw him put the stockings under his arm in my shop, and I saw his face in the shop, his face was towards me. The stockings were in paper when taken from my shop and they were in paper when Mrs. Mackgee brought them, there is now my husband's mark on the paper the price of the stockings, and they are worth nine shillings.</p>

            . On the 9th of May, when Mrs. Wotton called stop thief I immediately came out of my shop and went to Princes-court, the prisoner could not go through he was returning, I took him, I asked him if he had not been in the shop next to me, he said no, I might search him, I took him to Mrs. Wotton's shop and the stockings were produced by Mrs. Mackgee while he was there. There was no other person in the court nor running untill after I had hold of him.</p>

On the 9th of May I picked up the stockings, they were in paper, I heard them fall all in the yard, they were picked up by a person working with me and given to me, I took them immediately to Mrs. Wotton, the prisoner was there; I asked Mrs. Wotton if that was the parcel she had lost, she said yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. There were three or four people running at the time that I was taken, Mr. Bowles collared me, he said I had taken something out of that woman's shop, I said I had not. I knew myself innocent. I was willing to go back.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness who gave him a good character.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Thomas—we live in Lower Chapman-street—on the 10th March, about one o'clock in the morning, I and my husband went home from Whitechapel church in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I had two shawls on when I got into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> I am quite sure, and just as I got in the passage I had both on I am quite sure—when I got up stairs to the room one was gone—this is it—how it went I cannot tell.</p>

I am the witness's husband—we had been spending the evening out, and came home in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> from Whitechapel church—when we arrived at the door I got out and escorted my wife into the passage—I paid the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>man over her shoulder—she had then the shawl on—when she came up stairs I found she had no shawl on—I said, "Where is your shawl?"—she said, "I dare say I have dropped it in the passage, or on the stairs"—I could not find it—I found the policeman who showed us into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> in Brick-lane, and gave him information about the shawl—the next morning the policeman brought the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>man and the shawl.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You do not burn a gas-light in your passage? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I went up stairs to get a light—my wife was not quite well—the policeman handed her along by my request as the stones were up in Brick-lane—she was a little the worse for liquor—she came from our friends very well—she walked to Brick-lane very well, and then became worse.</p>

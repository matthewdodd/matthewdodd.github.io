               <p>Q.Could that have been? - A. No; I was very particular in it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. I understood, you let your warpers take a number of bobbins away to work them up at their houses; now, suppose last Wednesday she had so many bobbins, she ought to bring them back perhaps on Saturday, and perhaps they may not bring them home till Monday; they may not always bring them home at the exact time? - A. They always do, or should do.</p>
               <p>Q. Now the bobbins that she had in her pocket, she might be mistaken as to the time, whether it was a fortnight, or three weeks, or two months; when you went to look at the bag, was the mouth of the bag next the scale? - A. I cannot say; Mr. Titford shook the bag before I could notice it.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether they were at the top at first, you cannot say, Mr. Titford might have shook them to the bottom; was the mouth of the bag open or shut? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How much does your scale hold? - A. It will hold two hundred bobbins very well, without any danger of falling out.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Was any white silk delivered to the prisoner? - A. About two months before.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. When you deliver the silk, you weigh it out to your workwomen, and when they bring it back, you weigh it again? - Yes, but we are not particular to half an ounce, and sometimes they keep it a week; we give them another day, when they cannot finish it.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not give them two months? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. On the prisoner being brought to the room where you were, did you see any white silk that was found in her pocket? - A. Yes, five bobbins of white silk.</p>
               <p>Q. You then went and examined the bag? - A. I took the bag up with both my hands, and opened the bag at the counter; I opened the bag, and said, here they are, and took out five bobbins of black and one of white silk.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your scale like any thing full? - A. No, the scale is a very large scale, it is totally impossible; (Mr. Titford looks at the bobbins, and identifies them); the value of the six bobbins found in the bag is about six shillings, the value of the five bobbins of white silk found in her pocket about three shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not sell any silk in that unmanufactured state? - A. Never in that state.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called six witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

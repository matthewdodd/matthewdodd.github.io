             sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Born: On Friday the 10th of October, between eleven and twelve O'clock, the prisoner came into the parlour and called for a glass of ale, for which he gave me two penny-pieces, and told me to keep the halfpenny; as I was going to fetch the pot-horse in, I saw him come from the fire-place to where the candlesticks were, and I went, into the parlour and missed two; I asked him if he had got any candlesticks, he said, no, he had not, and then he went out; I told my master, and he ran after him, and brought him back with the candlesticks, they were in his pocket. (Produces them).</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. May it please your Lordship; and you Gentlemen of the Jury. At the time this happened, I was very much distressed indeed, having been seven weeks in the hospital; after my deliver ance from there, I endeavoured to get an honest situation, during which time I was under the necessity of pledging my watch and wearing apparel; and I solemnly declare, that for three days previous to this I had not eat any victuals; Mr. Born offered me to serve his Majesty by land or sea, and an application was made for that purpose, but I was found too old for service; I throw myself upon your Lordship's mercy to inflict what punishment you please upon me.</p>

            . I am a salesman in East Smithfield, the prosecutor came to me, and asked me the price of a coat that I had hanging up for sale at my door on Tuesday, he said, it was his, I bought it on Monday the 23rd of the prisoner; I gave the prisoner eight shillings for the coat, and two pence for a glass of gin; I apprehended the prisoner myself, and took him to the office; I am sure that he is the man, that is all that I know of it. This is the coat that I bought of the prisoner, and it is the coat the prosecutor claimed.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is my coat.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. A friend of mine gave me that coat.</p>

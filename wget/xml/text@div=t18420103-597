                  </hi>. I am in the service of Abraham Craw<lb></lb>cour, of Lower Marsh. I have seen two chimney-glasses and two swing glasses with my mark on them—they are worth 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I saw them safe in my master's shop in November, and I think on the 26th—I went to No. 6, St. George's-market, and saw the prisoner coming down the stain—Brook was with me—we went up stairs, and I saw Brook find some duplicates, one relating to a glass pawned in the London-road—I found a chimney-glass and a swing-glass in the room below, which I knew to be ours—the prisoner said he had bought them twelve months ago of a hawker—I did not listen to the conversation, for I was not exactly in the room at the time, I was in the yard—the signature to this deposition is my hand<lb></lb>writing—it was read over to me.</p>

CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you keep these sort of things in the shop? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We have had a good many of the same kind—I do not always mark them in the same sort of style—my mark is "30" at the corner on this sized glass—this large glass was fitted up in the ground-floor of the prisoner's house—I know the one found at the pawnbroker's by this flaw at the corner, that is all—it is the make of the glasses we sell, and I think it is one I have lost—I lost one that size in November—we sell a great many of them, I cannot say how many, for we have five shops in the trade—I can say these were our property, but whether they were in our possession at that time I cannot say—this third one was found in the prisoner's parlour—there is "21" and "22" on that, which means the size of the frame—that is my handwriting—it had the mark of "20" when it went from me, but that is not on it now, if it is the same glass,</p>

               <p>or it has a new back to it—the "20" was in pencil—all the glasses of this size on our premises would be marked "21" and "22"—I swear I had one like it in our shop—on looking over my stock-book I find we have sold several of that size, which would have the same marks, several within eighteen months or two years.</p>

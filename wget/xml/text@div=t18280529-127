               <p>Prisoner. When this gentleman met me in Rosemary-lane he made me sign a bill for 2l. 10s., for the time I had been in the house - the clothes were lent to me. Witness. No - there was no writing between us.</p>

            . I was interpreter to the prisoner at the office, on the 19th of May, and the Magistrate told me to ask whether he had paid the prosecutor for any board or lodging; he said, No; the Magistrate then told me to ask if these clothes were Dalton's, and he said Yes, and he asked how much he had to pay for them- he put his hand into his pocket and said, "Will 1l. 14s. pay it?"; the Magistrate made me take out the clothes again, and ask if he had paid for them, and told him if he could not pay it with money he must be tried.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The prosecutor's wife and daughter lent me the clothes - I was not to pay for them, but I wanted to pay 14s. for my lodging for two days; he said he would have the money for a whole week - I left my tools and a jacket of my own at his house.</p>

My servants went to bed over night by ten o' clock; I was in bed myself by twelve, the waiter secured the out doors. I fastened the door at the bottom of the stair case; I always make it a rule to fasten that; there are two<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177804290034"></xptr> bolts in the inside. At about one o'clock (I believe it was) in the morning I heard a noise in my kitchen, which was repeated; I then got up and found that people were in my house, I hoped to have driven them away by calling to my servants by several fictitious names in order to give them the idea of my having a large family about me, but the door upon the stair case was soon forced open, and the door of my room, which is upon the first landing place; the lower pannel was broke through, and the lock was forced off; the first person that made his appearance, had his face blacked, or a crape over it, and a round frock over his clothes; the next had a handkerchief tied up to his eyes, and a taller man had a dark lanthorn. I myself had fire arms in my room, which they immediately seized; the tall man d - d me, and asked me if that was my guard? they took them from me; then they broke open my bureau, in which were writings; I gave them my pokets; they broke the front of a chest of drawers, and they took my clothes and linen; my money, which I kept in a purse in one of the drawers, I had taken and concealed upon the first alarm, between the bed and the sacking; a wainscot desk, containing my plate, I had thrown under the bed on the first alarm, in hopes they might have escaped their search; one, that they called captain, said, he was certain that I had plate, and in my fright I was obliged to tell them where it was; they broke open the desk in which the plate was and took the plate; among other things they took a pair of buckles, set with stone. I begged for my clothes, but they took them all; they went down stairs and after some time three returned and threatened my life; one, which I take to be the tallest, had a cutlass; the second a pocket pistol; and the third, a shorter man, stood at the foot of the bed, they demanded my money, and said, they were well informed I had money: I heard a fourth voice upon the landing place, saying, don't ask her questions, cut her throat! I had a child of seven years old in the bed with me, very much frightened; I endeavoured to pacify the child, they threatened to dash the child's brains out if it made a noise; in the end I told them where the money was, and they took it and my watch which hung at the bed's head; there was about fifty guineas, and there was some money taken from my pocket, and some that lay loose in the drawer; they went down stairs very merry, and sung; there were bottles of wine found upon the table next day, from which it appeared they had been drinking; after some time one came half way up the stairs and asked how I did, and said, the beef was exceeding good, and they should call again in half an hour. I had a cold buttock of beef which they had been eating, and cold mince pies. Just as they went away, I heard a pistol fired off, I heard one say, you did not think it was me when you shot, I am wounded, I am afraid I shall be lame; this was repeated twice. They came into the house at about one o'clock, I think they staid till about four o'clock, there were some shot sticking in the mantle-piece.</p>

               <p>I am a waiter at Copenhagen House. I made fast the doors and windows, I was waked in the night by my mistress calling to me between one and two; two persons came into my room, and asked me who was in the house; they said that they would blow my brains out if I did not tell the truth. I told them; they went into the maid's room, but she was not to be found; they said they would cut her to pieces. She called from the top of the house, and said she had hid herself, because she was frightened; she came down stairs upon their bidding her, and got into her bed; they tied me on my bed and left me so. I got up about seven in the morning, and found the doors of the kitchen, the cellar, and the street doors, and the windows were all open; it appeared that the thieves got in at the kitchen window, for there were the marks of iron crows there, and the bolts were bent double. Upon the first alarm, before they came up into my room, I had put a gun out at the window, and had threatened to fire. I was answered by one from below, d - n you, fire away! if you don't I will, and upon that I heard the report of a pistol, and they were up stairs instantly. I found upon examination the next morning, that there were swan-shot and cut lead sticking in the chimney-piece, the contents, as I supposed, of that pistol which was fired into the kitchen,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177804290035"></xptr> and there were appearances of a pistol having burst, for there were pieces of the barrel of a pistol, and some of the guard there: there was a light near my room, if not brought into it; but I did not see any body; for the first thing they ordered me was, not to look at them, threatening to blow my brains out; they bid me lie on my face, and then they tied me.</p>

               <p>All the three prisoners were concerned with me in committing this burglary. We met in the Borough in the morning, and we met at my lodging in the evening in Feather-bed-lane, Cold-Bath-Fields; we set out and went the back way to Copenhagen-house. Turner had the crow; Davis and I broke the kitchen window; Turner and Jordan got in first; then a man called out from the house that he would fire. Davis said, if you don't put your head in I will shoot you; they who were got in called to us without to come in: I jumped with my two hands upon the window in order to get in, and in so doing an old horse pistol I had in my hand went off and burst, and cut my finger sadly; it jarred my arm so as quite to benumb it: we all went up stairs; I suppose the stair-foot door, which had been bolted on the inside, must have been forced before I got in, for I found no impediment; we all got in; Turner forced a pannel of the mistress's room; Turner bid me stay there and take care of her, and to shoot her if she offered to move. I objected to going higher up stairs, because the waiter knew me; therefore I was left in the room, while they went up and secured the waiter. Turner opened the doors. I and Davis had waggoners frocks on; Davis had a brown masque on, the others had black crapes on; I had a handkerchief across my face; I think Davis had a dark lanthorn; we found a box under the bed; Turner said, take the things out one by one. I answered, yes, Captain, I will. After we had taken the things out, we went down and got some beer, mince pies and beef: then Turner said, I will go up and pinch her again; he went up with Davis, and Jordan went up half way; soon after I heard money rattle, and Turner came down singing with a purse with thirty-two guineas in it, which we divided immediately. Davis and Jordan then tried their pistols whether they would go off or not, not meaning to do any mischief with them, and two of them went off. I made a complaint of my arm, and said that I was afraid I should be lame: we returned by a back way, (having lost our way in the fields) to my lodgings: the three prisoners took the things away to the other side of the water, because I did not care to have them in my lodgings. Turner said he would let the two women at the Dolphin in Red-Cross-street, in the Borough, have the two gowns; we had been at that house in the morning before we went upon this expedition; we met again on the Sunday, I and Turner went up stairs and bargained with the woman, while the other two staid below. Turner made them a present of the stone-buckles into the bargain: we sold the gowns for three guineas; there was a blue gown, a black gown, and an old fashioned gown, with white flowers. I was not taken up for this robbery, nor indeed any other. I was in company with some persons, and Sir

               <p>I keep a public house in Red-Cross-street, in the Borough. I know these three prisoners and Carleton who passed by the name of Andrews. I bought three gowns of them on the Sunday morning following Christmas Day; they were all in the house, but whether they came all in together on that day, I cannot say. There was a blue gown, a black gown, and a grey gown, with white flowers. They had a pair of stone buckles, which they asked half a guinea for. I gave three guineas for the gowns, and had the buckles into the bargain. They passed for smugglers; they all had used my house before, and all seemed acquainted with each other; the bargain was made in the club room, up one pair of stairs; Turner and Carleton only were present, but I saw the others afterwards in the house.</p>

               <p>Can you recollect whether they were at your house a few days before they made this bargain? - I cannot recollect the little man Jordan, they used to call Little Harry; he and Davis were with Turner that Sunday at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177804290036"></xptr> my house after this bargain; Carleton, I think, went away, I afterwards delivered the gowns and buckles to Mr. Clarke. I agreed with Carleton for the gowns; I cannot say whether Turner had any thing to do with them or not; he did not say any thing while they were making the bargain. Turner brought the gowns to me a day or two before this bargain for them was made; he represented that there was a person who had three gowns to dispose of, and he would leave them with me to see if I should like to buy them.</p>

               <p>On the 1st of April, about twelve at noon, I apprehended the three prisoners on the other side of the water. Jordan was up; Turner and Davis in bed; there was but one bed in the room; there were five pistols in the room by the bed side, two crows, a dark lanthorn, and some gunpowder; the pistols were all loaded. The landlord delivered up to me a blunderbuss, which Turner afterwards claimed as his property.</p>

               <p>Court. He is a witness that must be permitted to be examined. His credit the jury will determine upon, when they compare his testimony with the rest of the evidence.</p>

               <p>Turner. When he was taken into custody, he was sworn to by four people to be concerned in robberies at Finchley, before ever he spoke about any thing of the kind; then he sent a letter, desiring to be admitted an evidence to save his own life.</p>

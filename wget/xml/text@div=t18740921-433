                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> This is the only book I have—I began these journeys on the 18th, and went on up to about 27th August—I could not say how-many times I have travelled up and down between 18th July and 22nd August—I could not tell without <hi rend="italic">my book. (Referring</hi>)—it was seven times by the prisoner's <hi rend="italic">bus</hi>—I could not say how many times by other <hi rend="italic">busses</hi>—I have been on several <hi rend="italic">busses</hi>—I could not say within twenty, thirty, forty, or fifty-times—I could not say how many—I am a witness in three of these cases—I am a witness against two other men who are awaiting their trial on these same charges—the system I adopted was to carry the number of passengers in my head, until I had an opportunity of making the entries at the end of each journey—that was so every time I travelled; no other check—I don't know the distance of the journey from Camberwell to Shore-ditch, I am a stranger about that part—I should say it would take about an hour—I was not at this every day from 18th July to 25th August—we left off from 1st August to the 24th, and then went on from the 24th to the 27th—I can't tell the number of passengers that travelled, or any of the particulars, without consulting my book—all these entries relate to different <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> conductors—I can't say whether some of the days were showery or not, they might have been—I could not say whether the 21st July was showery or not, or the 25th August—I know that it is the custom for gentlemen to change from outside to in if it rains—I have not known a gentleman to get outside to oblige a lady, I never saw it while I was travelling—I know that sometimes several passengers get in at once—I sometimes sat at the further end, and sometimes in the centre—I can't tell you where I sat on 21st July—on the 25th August I rode outside on the seat at the top—I always sat at the end near the driver—I could not see the conductor when he stood off the step on the ground—I can't say how often I counted the passengers from the Gate to the Elephant—it might have been 150 or 200 times—I never got confused or muddled with the passengers—I counted them as they got in and got off—I could not have made any mistake in the number of passengers—I cannot recollect without the book where I got down on the different occasions, or at what timer I always made my entries in the street, about a minute or two after I got out of the <hi rend="italic">bus</hi>, when I got into a convenient spot—without looking at my book. I could not recollect what <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> I checked on 22nd July, and that applies to every day—I distinguish the <hi rend="italic">busses</hi> by the letters, I mean by the letters P. S. and 1,304—the <hi rend="italic">busses</hi> have different letters on them—I put down the letters and the number of the <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> beforehand—I did not notice any monies being paid—I did not make any copy of this book, we made a return after we completed our journey; Dove did—on one occasion I altered the figures I had made—I did not make a mistake—I did not write a 4 over a 5 or a 5 over a 4—I wrote the figures down, and I thought I should not have room enough to travel on another journey, so I put the figures up higher—there has not been anything rubbed out here, only worked out by my finger writing over it—this is "11.30 a.m., Elephant and Castle, thirteen inside," and then 12.38 p.m.; 11.30 was the time I entered the <hi rend="italic">bus</hi>, and 12.38 was the time I got out, nothing has been rubbed out there—I did not say before the Magistrate "I made the entry at the</p>

               <p>Elephant and Castle, it is written over a mark, I can't say what was there before, or who rubbed anything out"—I explained to the Magistrate that I thought I had not sufficient room to write it down there, so I left off there and wrote it higher up, and it might have got rubbed out by the working of my fingers—I mean to swear that I never said before the Magistrate "I can't say what was there before, or who rubbed anything out"—I said I could not say what was there—I don't recollect saying "or who rubbed anything out"—I did not say that, I am quite certain of that; I explained to the Magistrate how it was—I said "I can't say whether anything else has been rubbed out;" that was referring to the "1;" I could not see it without a glass, I mean the "1" alongside the "12.45"—I was referring to that particular entry—I had a magnifying glass given me to look through, I could see then that there had been a mark, not that there had been a rubbing out, unless it was with my finger in putting it down with the pen—there had been something there before—I am not aware that I at any time wrote a 5 over a 4 or a 4 over a 5—I was asked that before the Magistrate—this is the entry. (<hi rend="italic">Pointing it out</hi>), the 5 has not been written over some thing, that I am quite sure of—the "Oh" at the end of the word "Borough" has not been touched up with a pencil afterwards after the other letters had been written; that is where I wetted my pencil, as it marked dull.</p>
               <p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi>). I don't remember that I have ever received any of these way-bills from the prisoner personally—I have spoken to him about some errors which he has made, once or twice, and I had the way-bills before me when I pointed, out the errors—I can't recollect now what the errors were—the writing on the way-bills I have spoken to him about, resembled the writing on these way-bills—I can recollect the writing he always used to send in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The way-bills were put into a box by the different con<lb></lb>ductors,</p>

               <p>and were all mixed up—I can't tell the date when I spoke to the prisoner about any way-bill, but I know I have spoken to him about errors he has made, of 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or something of that kind—I have spoken to other conductors in the district I have command over—there are eighty or eighty-five conductors—I am not prepared to speak to the handwriting of those eighty-five conductors—I have spoken to a great many of them at different times.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The way-bills are all signed and the summary is signed—I can't recollect how many months the prisoner has been in the service; three or four I think—I have the whole of the way-bills and the summaries for P. S. omnibus, for the three days in question—it went eight journeys in the day—I have here the whole of the way-bills and the summary for the 21st August.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">submitted that there was not sufficient evidence to go to the Jury, there being no proof of the prisoner's handwriting to the waybills.</hi> Mr. Poland <hi rend="italic">contended that as it was proved that the prisoner was the conductor of that particular omnibus on the day in question, that was sufficient to connect him with the waybills.</hi> The Recorder <hi rend="italic">did not consider the evidence satisfactory, and</hi> Mr. Poland <hi rend="italic">therefore called the prisoner's solicitor.</hi>

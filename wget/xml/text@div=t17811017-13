               <p>I am Master-porter to the Vintners Company. I was at the Queen's-Head, with all the rest of the men at dinner, on Monday, the 17th of September: Mr. Peters came out of the box to me, and said the prisoner had taken our rope away. Mr. Clifton,

            , and myself, stopped him with the rope on his shoulder. It cost about 30 s. and is worth a guinea now. I asked him where he was going with it: first he said he took it for his own use: then he said a man hired him to carry it: then he said he took it for fun: afterwards, that he took it to exercise himself. As we were taking him to the Mansion-house, he took out a knife, and swore, he would rip every Englishman up like pork. He tried to make his escape three times, but we hindered him. It was about fifty yards long: we call it a pulley-rope: we have a piece of yarn through all our rope: I know it to belong to the Vintners Company: we catched him with it, four doors from where he took it up.</p>

               <p>On the 17th of last month, I saw the prisoner take the rope from the yard. I told the porters, and they went out, and stopped him with the cord on his back.</p>
               <p>(The rope was produced in court, and several witnesses deposed that it was the property of the Vintners Company.)</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>Going along Tower-street, a man came, and asked me to take that rope to Milk-street: he said they had some wine to pull up: he was dressed as the wine-porters are. I had not gone far before they laid hold of me. They often employ us. We carry ropes all over the town for them: we never ask whose property they are. I am as innocent as the child unborn. If they were to give it me, I should not know what to do with it.</p>
               <p>One of the witnesses. He said, the man had a great coat on, that he thought the man made a joke of him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. They used me very ill. I wanted to go to the place, to see if the man would come, that hired me to carry it.</p>

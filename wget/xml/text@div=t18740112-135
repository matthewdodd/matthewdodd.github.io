                  </hi>. I live at Lambeth, and am in the betting profession—on 30th November, at 12.10, I was in the Strand, speaking to a female friend, the prisoner came up and struck her with an umbrella—she screamed "Murder!"—I said "Jack, you have done that for nothing"—he said "I will do similar to you"—we had some words and fought one or two rounds—we used nothing but our fists then—we all three went then across Water<lb></lb>loo Bridge—we all got <hi rend="italic">snagging</hi> on the bridge—a policeman said "You had better go that way, and let them go this way"—they were soon out of my sight, and I was going home quietly, but when I got across the bridge the prisoner and four or five more sang out "Here he is! I am going to do him!"—he stabbed me in the chest, and was going to stab me again, but I moved my head and got it in the shoulder—I said "If you want to fight, fight fair; you have a knife"—he said "Yes, I will have your guts out"—I went to the toll-house and said "Let me sit down, I feel sick," but the toll-man ordered me out; when I got outside I staggered down on my side, as I felt sick, and I then felt the knife go into my side three times—I saw the prisoner there, and said "Jack, you are doing wrong"—he said "Are you going to pinch me?"—I said "No, I am not going to pinch you; I shall do something else when I am well"—I was taken to the hospital by strangers.</p>

               <p>and I tried to make his bleed—I was talking to Kate Keefe, the girl he lives with—I suppose he is engaged to her—she was present on Waterloo Bridge when I was struck—it happened at the first parapet—she was not called before the Magistrate—it was in Waterloo Road I was struck with the knife, after we had gone over the bridge—one man who was present has got six weeks, and there were three more—I should know them again—several other persons said that they would pitch into me, and one of them has got six weeks for the same assault—I had not got my fist up when I ith the knife—there were no blows except with the knife—I was struck twice with the knife before I went to the toll-house—I was struck five times with the knife altogether—I had not seen a knife in the prisoner's hand before that; it was a white handle knife—I have seen a white handle knife since, and was told it belonged to the prisoner—I was not on bad terms with the prisoner—I lent him 23<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to get out of the militia—I remember running after him in the Borough Road when he had to go to his mother's for protection—he then got a carving-knife, and I went into a shop and took up a weight and said "Let him use the knife and I will use this"—I may have said something about dashing his brains out.</p>

I am a shoemaker, of Lambeth—on 30th November, between 12.15 and 12.30 I was coming over Waterloo Bridge—I saw a mob on the Surrey side—I crossed the road and saw Kitson rising from the ground—he entered the toll-house for protection—the toll-keeper pushed him out, and he took off his coat and said "I am stabbed, and I want to go to St. Thomas's Hospital"—I then saw he was bleeding from his right side.</p>

I was house surgeon at St. Thomas's Hospital—I did not see Kitson till the Monday morning, he was then suffering from three punctured wounds on the right side of his chest, two slighter ones at the back, and one in the front—there was a slight injury to his lungs, but under treatment and care he has become quite well—one wound was just below the collar-bone, which was dangerous for a week.</p>

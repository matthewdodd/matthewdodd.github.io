                  </hi>. I live at 47, Highbury Quadrant, and am manageress of a cloth factory—some time after 11 p.m. on the 28th May I was dis-turbed by seeing a man at my dressing-table in a stooping position—I called out "Jim "twice—I thought it was ray uncle Jim downstairs—he did not answer—I thought he had come in without knocking, and I laid down again—in about ten minutes I was disturbed again, and I heard some strong breathing under my bed—I got up and called out "Jim" again—he did not answer, and I looked the other side of the bed—then I went on my knees and looked over the foot and saw a man's feet—I jumped up and took the key from inside the door and put it outside—I did not lock the door be<lb></lb>cause my little niece sleeps with me, and I called out in Welsh three times, "Jim," and Mr. Humphries and Mr. Thomas came up, and they pulled the prisoner out from under the bed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Thomas Humphries, of 47, Highbury Quadrant—I have seen the prisoner painting the house—he was working there on the 28th May—I suppose he went away about 6 o'clock—I was upstairs at about 7 o'clock—he came back and said he had come to put the brushes away—I did not go to see what he was doing—I was ironing, and was going out—I afterwards met him in Highbury Vale, and left him about 9.30, and returned to the house and went to bed soon after—after some time I heard Miss Griffiths calling out very loud, and after a while I went up and saw Mrs. Humphries and Mr. Thomas pulling the prisoner out from under the bed—they said he had no boots on, and I went to look for them—I found nothing but his hat outside Miss Griffiths's. belroom door—he was sober.</p>

I am an accountant of Lincoln, and was on a visit at the house in question—I was the last to come in that night and locked and bolted the front door—all the others had gone to bed—Miss Griffiths came down to the pantry and got my supper as the servants had gone to bed—she went upstairs, and not long after she called out to me to go to bed—I heard her calling out a second time very loudly in Welsh, saying a man was under the bed—I rushed upstairs, and was immediately followed by Mr. Humphries, and we pulled the prisoner out from under the bed—he seemed to me to be in a deep sleep or drunk—I went for a constable, and on my return I found Mr. Humphries had brought him down to the door.</p>

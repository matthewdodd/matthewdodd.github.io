On the 12th of May, between six and eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoners came into the shop together, and asked to look at some gown prints; I was serving a customer, and told them to wait - I afterwards showed them some prints, and they fixed upon one. Ford looked confused, which made me suspect them. They asked me to take 18 d. off the print. I went round the counter, and told Ford to move from the counter, which she did. Walters stumbled against my foot, and a piece of linen fell from under her petticoats; she was then about half a yard from the counter. I am certain it fell from her person; she had a shawl on; she said she was never caught in the act before. I gave them in charge. The gown they chose would come to 7 s. 4 d.</p>

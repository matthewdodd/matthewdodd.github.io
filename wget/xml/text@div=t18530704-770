                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Mr. Imer, carrying on business in Geneva, with a branch establishment in London, which is conducted by me. In Aug., 1852, I engaged the prisoner as clerk and traveller at a salary of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week and his expenses—his duty was to collect orders and sell goods when I sent him for them—I used to take stock every month, and come to an understanding with the prisoner of what had been done by him—I was in the habit of entrusting watches to him for the purposes of sale for me, and he was to bring me back the money or the watches—I took stock in Nov., and missed four watches—I told the prisoner of it; he said he had them at home, and would bring them the day after, or in a few days—I had given them to him to sell, and ho had never returned them—I took stock on 3rd Jan., and missed then thirty-five watches, including the four I had previously missed—I believe I had entrusted twenty-six watches to him in Dec, or perhaps not quite so many—I then missed seven other watches which I had not entrusted to him; they had been taken from my stock without my knowledge—I told the prisoner I missed seven watches, and that I was quite surprised about it—he said he did not know anything about it, but he thought I was right—he then said he would bring the whole of the watches on 6th Jan.—on 7th Jan. the prisoner sent me two letters; this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is one of them—some duplicates were enclosed in it, in consequence of which I made inquiries at the various pawnbrokers indicated on the tickets, and found the watches in pledge—Russell, the police officer, came to me, and I went with him to the prisoner's lodgings several times, and made efforts to take him, but we were unsuccessful—from 7th Jan., until the prisoner was seen at Westminster Hall, I had no opportunity of taking him—</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> After Purey had left you, and had robbed you, you sent the bill to Switzerland to get money to pay him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I swear that—I expected that the bill would have been paid, and I should then have paid the money to Mr. Purey, but he was not in custody and I could not—he afterwards became a witness in a case against me, and I gave him into custody; I never could take him before—the bill I received for 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. has been paid—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the two I O U's I received—they have not been paid—one is the I O U of a Mr. Green—I do not know him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker, of Skinner-street, Snow-hill. I have known the prisoner rive or six years—I do not particularly recollect seeing him at my shop on 29th Oct.; but on that day two gold watches were pledged at my shop, to which this ticket (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) refers—it is in the name of John Purey, for two gold watches, pledgedfor 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the prisoner was there on 3rd Nov., and pawned three silver watches for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and on 24th Nov. a silver watch for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and on 7th Jan. five silver watches for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the watch pawned on 7th Jan. had been previously pawned—I do not recollect seeing the prisoner at my shop on 7th Jan.; he merely paid the interest on the watches, and got a fresh ticket.</p>

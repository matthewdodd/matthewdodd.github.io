On the 10th of March, the house was all fastened up. About half-past eight o'clock at night I heard the alarm, ran up stairs, into the garret, found my trunk open, and missed the articles stated in the indictment, out of it. I found the window open - it had been shut down before, but was not fastened; the persons must have pushed the window up, to get in. The whole of the property is worth 10 l.; I had been in the room, about half-past three o'clock in the afternoon. The thieves must have come in at the window - you can go from one house to the other; I saw my things next day at the office.</p>
               <p>CHARLES JUDE. On the evening of the 10th of March, in consequence of information, I went to an empty house, No. 15, Colledge-street, Westminster, which is one door from the prosecutrix's; I tried to get in, but could not, and heard somebody talking inside. I went through the next house, and got over the wall, into the yard of the empty house. I found the yard-door of the empty house open. I went towards the street-door, found it bolted at the top and bottom, the lock taken off, and laying in the middle of the passage. I got a light, and at the bottom of the stairs I found the property tied up in a handkerchief - I found nobody in the house. Gillmor, Lavender, and two or three more officers were with me.</p>

            . On the 10th of March, I went with Dew, and saw the prisoner, Nicholson, get over a wall into No. 15. I got over the wall of No. 13 myself, and saw a man drop from the garden-wall of No. 15, into the garden of No. 16. I then saw Nicholson drop from the wall of No. 15, into No. 16 - it was dark, but I had a candle; there is a parapet runs along the houses. I got into the garden of the empty house, and saw the figure of a man drop from a wall, into Cowley-street; I also saw the trees shake towards Barton-street. Two soldiers came to our assistance, and got over the wall of No. 16,; I saw one pick up a bundle and a stick, which he delivered to me. I gave information, and the next day Cooper brought the prisoners to the office; Sandyford had been taken the same night, by the watchman. I observed that a pearl button was off the knee of Nicholson's breeches. A few nights before the robbery, I saw both the prisoners together in King-street; each of them had a stick, like that found in the garden. I stopped them, and asked them where they were going? Another stick was delivered to me, by Tribe, with a small crow, and a pair of mens' shoes; he found them in the garden of No. 16, where I saw Nicholson drop. The prosecutrix's house, is in the parish of St. John the Evangelist, Westminster.</p>

I told the woman, who was there to watch, and she called me soon after. I went, and found the privy fast; I opened it, and found Sandyford there - it was about a quarter before nine o'clock; he must have got over the wall to get into the privy.

            . I am servant to Mr. Pace, who lives next door to the empty house. I heard the alarm, ran into the garden, and saw a man on the roof of the tool-house. My master called me back to mind the thieves did not run down off the roof of the house. A few minutes after, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181904210005"></xptr>heard that one was taken; I went into the garden, and found a stick and a crow-bar. I also found a pair of shoes on the roof of the tool-house, where I had seen the man.

               <p>JOHN CHURCHILL. I lived in the empty house before his. Hearing of the robbery, I went to the house, and found Gillmor there. Next morning I went to Pace's, and found a pearl button on the roof of his tool-house, among some leaves, which I have kept ever since. I went to Queen-square Office, and found Nicholson had the same sort of buttons on his breeches, and one was off. I cut another off, and produce them to shew they are the same. That found on the tool-house was without a shank - there was no shank left on his breeches.</p>

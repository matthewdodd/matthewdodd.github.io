                  </hi>. I am a tailor, of 8, Ramsay Place, Westminster—on Sunday, 17th February, between eleven and twelve at night, I was in the road in Great Chapel Street, Westminster, and was assailed by two men; the prisoner is one of them—the other one held my feet while the prisoner took my watch and chain—I was thrown down, but they did not strike me with violence—the other man ran away—I kept my eye on the prisoner till he went into a watering place—I saw him come out; he ran across Chapel Street into Victoria Road, till he got to Union Street, when he went into a house, and a policeman went in and brought him out—I identified him and gave him in charge.</p>

I am a plasterer's boy, and live at 20, Broadway, Westminster—I heard a cry of "Police!" and saw the prisoner strike Latty and knock him down; he then ran into an urinal, and Latty came up—I went into the urinal and said, "If you give the gentleman his watch he will not lock you up"—he said, "I have not got it: Albert Downey has it"—I know Albert Douney, and have seen him since in the Broadway—I knew the prisoner before—I saw him come out of the watering-place, run across Victoria Road, and go into Union Court—Latty was halloaing "Stop thief!" all the time.</p>

I heard cries of "Police!" and saw persons run across Victoria Road into Union Court—I went through No. 8, and in a yard at the back found the prisoner concealed behind a soldier in a corner of the yard—I pulled him out and kept him till Latty came and said, "That is the man"—I took Downey, who I knew by sight, but Latty would not swear to him.</p>

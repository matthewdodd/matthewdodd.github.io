               <p>WILLIAM HULL. I am foreman to Mr. Slinn - he left town about five days before this happened; while he was absent I received the money from the different customers, and there was some money left in the drawer when he left town - I kept the money in the iron safe; I did not keep the key, but I had it the night previous. On the night of the 21st of October I put into the drawer, in the iron safe, 38l. 18s. 9 1/2d. - there were more than ten sovereigns among it; the prisoner slept in the house that night - I balanced the cash, and took the key of the iron safe up with me; the money was all safe: in the morning, about half-past seven o'clock, before I was up, the prisoner came up to me and asked for change for a sovereign, as he said he had a customer waiting for change; he did not say how much he wanted - he said the customer had bought a pair of shoes; I could not give him the difference - I told him the key of the chest was in my pocket, that he might take it, and I should be down shortly; as nobody else was up I knew he could not go out to get change - I went down myself in about an hour; he was not there - I never saw him again till he was taken up, which was thirteen weeks after; when I got down I found the chest open, the key in the lock, and all the money except 3 1/2d. gone; Mr. Slinn came home next day, and I told him what had happened - I had a great coat and hat taken at the same time; there was a pair of gloves in my great coat pocket - I saw the gloves at the Compter; I saw Sapwell take them from the prisoner, either from his coat pocket or his hat; they were on the table - I have not found the coat or hat; I am quite sure the gloves are mine.</p>

I was Mr. Slinn's servant of all work at this time - the prisoner slept in the house; I recollect his coming down on the morning in question, about six o'clock - I did not see him go to the safe; he had given me no intimation that he was going to leave - he went away about eight, as near as I can guess: I had not seen the iron chest before he went - he never returned; Hull told me what had happened to the chest about half-past eight o'clock - Hull's hat and coat were kept in the same closet as the chest.</p>

            . On the 29th of January I was sent for, and found the prisoner at the Compter; I searched him, and found two pairs of gloves in his pockets - Hull claimed one pair - I told the prisoner Mr. Slinn had been robbed. and on the following morning, going to the Mansion-house, (I did not hold him out either threat or promise.) I asked where he had been; he said at the Malt and Shovel, at Chatham, and from there he went to Brighton, and was robbed of part of the property - he did not say what property; I asked what he had done with the coat and hat - he said he had sold the coat; I do not think he said any thing about the hat.</p>

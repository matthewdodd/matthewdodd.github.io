On the night of the 29th May, when in bed, I heard screams, and I went to 5, Priory Road, Acton Green, where the prisoner and his wife live—I found the wife lying on the door<lb></lb>step with her face covered with blood and bleeding from the mouth and left arm and partly insensible—I lifted her up, and from what she told me I went to the room occupied by the prisoner, where I found the prisoner lying on the bed—his wife said, "That is the man who done it; that is my husband; he has stabbed me in the back as well as the arm with a knife"—I told the prisoner I should take him into custody for assaulting his wife—he had been drinking, but knew what he was about—he said, "What, me? I couldn't do it; I have got no knife"—I then took him to the police-station, and the charge was read to him—he then said, "I tell you how it was done; she is in the habit of cutting up fire-wood with a knife, and in doing so she must have cut herself"—she said, "You did it; I could not stab myself in the back and kick myself in the mouth—he made no reply.</p>

I am the prisoner's wife—on the night in question I had been to the public-house for my husband, and met him in Church Road, Acton—he had taken away some things belonging to the children, to sell I suppose—he went into a public-house and I said, "What have you done with those things of the children's?"—ho struck mo and knocked, me down and kicked me in the mouth—he got home before me—when I got home I went in-doors—there was no candle—when I lit a candle I saw my husband sitting in a chair—I said to him "Look what you have done; look at my mouth"—he struck me again and I felt a kick and the candle went out—I rose and received a stab here and there (<hi rend="italic">pointing</hi>)—then I turned round and gave my husband a blow and he fell down, and I got out and sat on the door-step until the constable came—I received five stabs—two in the arm and three in the body—he had been drinking lately—he is a very good husband when he is sober, and a good father.</p>

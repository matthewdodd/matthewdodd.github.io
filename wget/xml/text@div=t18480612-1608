                  </hi>. I am a turnkey in the Queen's Prison, and superintendentof the night-watch. On 17th May the prisoner was confined there as a Crownprisoner, among the third class of debtors—in consequence of somethingthat occurred about half-past eight o'clock, I went with Dennis and Martin, two other officers, to his room to search for spirits—Dennis said he bad cometo search the room by order of the Governor—the prisoner said, "Search," or"Search away"—Dennis went to one corner of the room and I to another—the prisoner said to Dennis, "You have been annoying my family for sometime"—he directly Ald hold of Dennis by the collar and struck him—I wentto his assistance, and he struck me also—he then made a rush to the oppo<lb></lb>siteside of the room, where there was a cupboard, snatched up a knife in onehand, and a knife and fork in the other—I followed close after him, supposingit was his intention to destroy some spirits—when I saw the knife in onehand, and the knife and fork in the other, I rather shrunk back, and herushed at Dennis—I ran towards him and attempted to lay hold of him, andhe stabbed me in the left wrist—I have not been able to use my arm since—Major Hawkes and the prisoner's wife and daughter were in the room.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a turnkey in the Queen's Prison. I accom-panied Carr to the prisoner's room on this evening—I said, "Mr. Stickland, we are sent to search your room"—I do not think 1 said what for—he said, "Then search away"—I went to a tub where there were some bottles, tookthem out of the tub, and placed them on the table—the prisoner thenturned round to a shelf, took a jug, and began to pour its contents into somevessel on the floor—I told him he must not do that, supposing it to be spirits, and put out my hand to take the jug from him—he turned round, seized meby the neck, and struck me several blows in the breast and side, and said, "You have been in the habit of annoying my family for some time past"—Carr then came to my assistance, and he struck him also—he then flew tothe opposite side of the room to a cupboard, and took out a knife and fork inthe left hand, and a knife in the right hand, and turned round and stabbed meand Carr—I then took hold of him, and told him he must go with me to the Governor—Carr was not able to hold him, so we could not take him by force—Captain M'Kenzie took the knives from him—he then turned round againand took two bottles from the cupboard, placed one in each coat pocket, satdown on the chair, and said he was in his room, and there he should remain—I turned my head to look at some one at the-door, and he threw a bottle atme, which struck me in the back of the neck—I turned, and he was in theact of throwing another—I stooped and avoided the blow, and it broke inpieces against the wall—I then left the room, to report it to the Governor—they ivere half-pint glass bottles—Major Hawkes, Mr. Stickland, and hislittle girl were there—Captain M'Kenzie, who is a prisoner there, came inafter the stabs were given.</p>

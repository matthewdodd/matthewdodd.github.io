On 10th July, between 6 and 7 o'clock in the evening, the prisoner was brought to the Police court, Rochester Row, on a warrant, charged with wilful damage—she was placed in a cell by herself—I visited her several times. about 8 o'clock I went to the cell, and found her lying on the floor insensible, with a wound in her throat, and blood flowing from it—I found those scissors laying beside her, there was blood on the point—I took her in a cab to the Westminister Hospital, she remained there till the 16th, and was then taken before the Magistrate and committed—I think she had been drinking—she has a husband—she said she could not think what made her do it.</p>

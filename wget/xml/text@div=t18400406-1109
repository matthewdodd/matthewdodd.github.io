                  </hi>. I am a farmer, and live at Heston—the prisoner was my carter. On the 18th of March he was sent to London with a load of vegetables—he had to go nearly twelve miles—I allow the carter, to take about 14 lbs. of hay for each horse, and the nose-bags, containing corn mixed with chaff, to feed them on the road—he had no business to take any sack—he had two horses that night—I received information from the officers, and found the prisoner in custody at Hounslow station with two nose-bags filled with corn and chaff for the hones, a bundle of about 25 bs. of hay tied to the side of the cart, a four-bushel sack nearly full of mixed corn and chaff, and another sack with nearly half a bushel of oats and beans—I have compared the two sacks with my other corn, and believe it to be mine—the prisoner had no authority to take more than was in the nose-bags for the horses—he had two bandies of hay, one about 25lbs., for his horses, and another about 49 lbs.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I saw the prisoner coming along Hounslow with his master's cart and horses, on the 13th, soon after eleven o'clock—I saw him leave his master's yard, and observed on his hay ladder a bundle of hay tied with one band, and another tied with two bands—I fol<lb></lb>lowed him on the road, and never lost tight of him till he came opposite the station-house—I then asked what he did with all that hay—he said it was for his horses, which his master allowed to them, and what they did not eat he should take back again—I took him to the station-house, searched his cart, and at the top of the sacks I found a four-bushel sack nearly full of oats, clover, chaff, and beans; and another sack between the sacks of trunips, containing half a bushel of oats and beans mixed—I found in the</p>

                  </hi>. I am a merchant, and live in Queen-street, May<lb></lb>fair. About one o'clock in the morning, on the 1st of March, I was in St. James-street, returning home—the prisoner took hold of my arm, and asked me to go with her, which I refused—she came with me as far as the corner of Bury-street—I told her she need not go any further, as I was going home—I felt in my trowsers' pocket, and my purse was gone—it had been there a few minutes before—I had only parted with a friend two minutes before—I caught hold of the prisoner's wrist—I told her I had lost my purse, and she must have it—I never let her go, but called, "po<lb></lb>lice!"—two or three women came up, and two men came—one of them tried to take her from me, but I kept her, and gave her in charge—this is my purse—it had four sovereigns in it.</p>

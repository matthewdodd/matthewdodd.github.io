                  </hi>. I am the wife of William White, a shoemaker. In Jan. last we lived in Summers-street, Back-hill, Hatton-garden, in the same house with the prisoners—I lived in the front room first-floor, and they in the back room—on the Saturday before the inquest the male prisoner went out about eight o'clock—they had two children, a boy and a girl; the boy had been ill on the Friday—I went to the door about half-past nine, and asked the female prisoner how the child was—she said he was better; it was only a fit he had had—I did not go into the room; she held the door half shut—I did not tee the child—she went out twice or three times in the' course of an hour, and the last time she went out I saw her go across the road to Mrs. Parker, with her little girl—I saw her from my window—she was there about three minutes—I did not hear any noise in their room while she was away—I heard her come back; she opened her door very quickly, as if it was not locked—she had left the girl at Mrs. Parker's—she walked half across the room, and then stopped, and began to scream—she came to me immediately, and said her boy bad burnt himself—I followed her into her room—she took the child up in her arm; it was near the fireplace; I cannot say whether it was sitting or standing; I think it was sitting—she then pulled its clothes off, and sat it on. its bottom—the room was full of smoke—the child bad a brown stuff frock on and a pinafore—the clothes were very much burnt, and smouldered a good deal after they were taken off; they were burnt in front—the child said, "Mother, I have been screaming for you;" but he said it so low I could scarcely hear it—there was no fender before the fire, and there was very little fire in the grate; it was red behind, and a little on each side—it is a very small fireplace, and has only three bars—there was no fire in front—I put my hand in between the bars; I did not touch them—I put my stuff-apron between the bars, and held it there an instant, and the fire did not catch it; there was no flame—I said to the female prisoner, "My good woman, the child could not have burnt itself at that fire; did you leave any lucifers or any paper about?"—she said, "No"—I said, "How could he do it?"—she said he was a tiresome contrary child; he would do what the told him not to do—she put some oil on the child's neck—I said she had better take it to the hospital, but she would have the doctor sent for—Mrs. Parker came in about ten minutes after, and she said she would send her girl for the doctor, and she went away immediately—the doctor came immediately, and told her to take the child to the hospital, because he wanted immediate attention—when I went in there was a saucepan on the hob, and a little one on the fire, with the handle sticking out—the female prisoner said to the child, while he was sitting on her knee, "You naughty boy, why did you do it did not I tell you not to touch the fire? I begged of you before I went out not to meddle with the fire"—the child's aunt took it to the hospital.</p>

               <p>there were some chairs and two tables—I believe there was a bit of meat on the fire, which had been given her by the doctor the day before—I believe there was a saucepan on the fire, with some broth in it—the child asked for water, and they gave it some of the broth.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. I was called to attend the child on the Friday, the day before the burning—it then appeared in a state of collapse; it was in a fit—I ordered its feet into hot water, and some castor oil to be brought, which I gave it—it was in a very weak, emaciated state, and required nourishment, and I sent some meat for it—I was called on the following day, and found it on the mother's lap—I examined it, found it was very much burnt, and ordered it to be sent to the hospital immediately—I saw the clothes; they appeared to have been burnt by a smouldering fire—the mother was rubbing the child with oil; as a domestic remedy that was as good a thing as she could apply at the moment—I noticed the fire; it is possible that if the child had been trying to reach the saucepan, in which the broth was, it might have pulled a hot cinder on to its lap.</p>

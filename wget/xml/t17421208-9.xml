             . On the 13th of October last, the Prisoner brought me a Silver Pint Pot, and offered it to sell: I saw him in a great Amazement, and stopped the Pot on Suspicion. About an Hour afterwards I found, by an Advertisement, it was Mr Ellis's , and a Guinea Reward offer'd for it: He had the Pot, and gave me the Guinea, and said, Cast the Man, and I shall be obliged to you. About seven Days after the Prisoner came again, and called for a Pint of Beer. I went to Mr Ellis's, and he came and took him.</p>
               <p>Ellis. I do not know any thing of the Prisoner, his Brother I believe stole it. When I carried the Pot with me to Mr Austen's , on his being detain'd, he fell upon his Knees, and said, It was my Pot, and no Body could suffer for it but himself.</p>

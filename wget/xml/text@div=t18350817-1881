                  </hi>. I am a gentleman's coachman. I lodged at the Cock and Lion, in Wigmore-street—I was in town with my mistress, on the 20th of August—I had in my jacket pocket, a canvass bag, containing this money—I pulled off my jacket and hung it on the screen in the kitchen—I saw the prisoner go into the kitchen in a few minutes, and he went away directly—I then went to the jacket, and my purse and money were gone—I went after the prisoner, charged him with it, and took the bag and money out of his right hand.</p>

I live at Shaftesbury-terrace, Kensington—the pri<lb></lb>soner was housemaid in my service—on 10th April last, on going to bed, I went to a drawer in my bedroom to put some papers away—I found the lock had been tampered with—after some time I succeeded in opening it, and on examining my money I missed a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and three sovereigns—there had been 83<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. there, 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in notes, and thirteen sovereigns—I spoke to the female prisoner about it a day or two afterwards; after I had made inquiry about the matter—I told her and the other servant that this money had been stolen from my drawer, and asked if they knew anything about it—they both said they knew nothing about it—the female prisoner had given warning to leave a few days before this—I had received the notes from Messrs. Price and Boustead—I had paid away some of them—I have here a memorandum of the numbers, which I made at the time—I received five 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes—Nos. 69,311 and 69,314 were the notes remaining in the drawer—I had paid away two of the notes to my daughter, Mrs. Wilson, who lives with me—they were Nos. 69,316 and 69,317, and the note lost was 69,315.</p>

Two other Evidences confirm'd his having own'd the taking the Money, at several Times. The Prisoner pleaded, That he having had Money of his Mother to lay up, his Mother suspecting him, tax'd him with robbing him; and after using Many Menaces, threatned to send him to Newgate; he being terrified, that he might not be sent to Newgate, he did confess the taking of about 27 s. but his Master still threatning to send him to Newgate, telling him his former Confession would not do, he did, by Direction of those about him, write upon a Piece of Paper, as he thinks to the Value of 3 l. 6 s. although he never wrong'd him of any Thing. That as so the Sleeves, he had them of a Servant Maid that had liv'd in the Family, who being gone to live in the Country, he had sent for her, but could not hear of her. The Prisoner call'd several credible Persons to his Reputation, who gave him an extraordinary Character, as an honest, industrious, young Man. The Master and Mistress being examin'd, deny'd their terrifying him into a Confession, except that in finding the Key that would open his Trunk, he did say to him, You Villain, I am afraid this Key will bring you to Newgate.

                  </hi>. I live in Castle-street, Leicester-square. On the 22nd of February I went to a house, No. 19, Castle-street, Leicester-square, with a few friends—we were all neighbours, and we staid there to spend half an hour—I had my coat on my back, and took it off, being very warm, and laid it on a box—I saw no more of the coat—the next morning I was informed about it—I was not quite sober when I went to Castle-street—I had been to a raffle—I was sober enough to see that I put the coat down on a box—it was a private house—when we got there it was between one and two o'clock in the morning—it is right opposite my door—this is my great-coat.</p>

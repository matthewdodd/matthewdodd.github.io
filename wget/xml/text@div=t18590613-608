                  </hi>. I am a tailor of Long-alley, Moorfields—on 30th May, about a quarter to 9 at night, I met the prisoner and a companion of his, whose name I do not know, in Bell-alley—I asked the other man who was carrying a box, where he was going to—I never spoke to the prisoner, but he turned round and said that he was a better man than I was—he was rather intoxicated and perhaps he mistook my words—I said that very likely he was—he swore that he was a b—y sight better, and knocked me down and kicked me on the forehead—I got up and told him I would give him in custody—he turned back to strike me again; I stepped back to avoid it, he rose his leg, kicked me in the lower part of my person, and knocked me down—I got up and endeavoured to hold him till a constable came, and then gave him in custody—I went to a doctor next day—I was unable to work for the first week in consequence of the injury I received from the kick—I never gave him the slightest provocation whatever.</p>

I am a surgeon of 74, Sun-street—I examined the prosecutor on 30th May, and found him bleeding very profusely from the penis, which had been injured considerably by external violence—it will terminate in stricture, and it may terminate in stricture of a very severe kind—he had also a small wound on the temple.</p>

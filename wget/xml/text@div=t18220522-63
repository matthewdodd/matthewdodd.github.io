I had a pony, cart, and harness, which I locked up on the night of the 27th of April in a stable, at a quarter past ten o'clock. I went again at a quarter before eight o'clock in the morning, and they were gone. I found them on Tuesday last in a stable-yard, in care of Elkington - they are mine. I had had the pony ever since the 5th of September, and I knew him by a star on the forehead, and a half circle on the hoof. My name was on the cart and is now.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. What do you keep a cart for - A. My wife is a laundress, and I use it to take linen to town.</p>

            . I keep the Horse and Groom, St. John-street. I received the pony, cart, and harness of the prisoner, on the 28th of April, about a quarter before eleven o'clock. He told me to take his horse, and take care of it, and he should not be there again before Wednesday. I never saw him after.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He never came for it - A. He was there for it, but I did not see him. He left it with me three weeks and two days.</p>
               <p>Q. He might have said,</p>
               <p>"Take care of this horse and cart, which a man sent me with" - A. No. He did not, I am positive. I noticed what he said, and am sure he said it was his.</p>

             re-examined. On Tuesday last he came into the yard while I was washing the horse's legs; he said,</p>
               <p>"You have been out with the horse," I said,</p>
               <p>"Yes I have taken it to Whitechapel to exercise it;" he said that was right. I had been told it was stolen half an hour before this, and sent for the constable, who took him.</p>

               <p>"I have brought this horse and cart to put up;" he said very well, and I left. Last Tuesday I met a man at the corner of Aylesbury-street, he said</p>

             re-examined. Q. Did he ask you 9 l. for it - A. Yes, my Lord, and I said I would give 7 l. He said I had done very right in exercising it, and said</p>
               <p>"I think I shall sell him, for he is hardly big enough for my cart;" I said</p>
               <p>"If you like to sell it, I will buy it, and sell you a bigger." I went into the stable, and shewed him a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182205220026"></xptr>bigger horse, and offered him 7 l. for his. Hayford whom I had sent for, came in and took him in charge.</p>

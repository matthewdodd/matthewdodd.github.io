On the 17th of December I saw the two prisoners going towards his shop; I saw each of them take a lock from the board outside his shop, and walk on - I followed them till the Police-man took them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q.What time was it? A.Between seven and eight o'clock in the evening; I live next door to the prosecutor - I was confined three months for a piece of timber.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM IRELAND. I am a Police-constable. I took the prisoners; I found all this property on Keys, none on Flanagan.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What is all this? A. Four locks, a knife, and a book; I took them eighty or a hundred yards from the prosecutor's.</p>
               <p>DAVID WHITE. I had such locks as these, but they have no marks on them; I missed them when I was told of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many did you miss? A. Four or five; we have them in a row - if one is taken we can tell; these are the same size as those I lost - perhaps there were eight or nine on the board; I have sold a great many locks - Mr. Leary lives next door; my house is very handy to him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you lose such locks as these? A. Yes; I believe these to be mine.</p>
               <p>Key's Defence. I saw two boys running in Henrietta-street; they dropped these locks, and I took them up.</p>

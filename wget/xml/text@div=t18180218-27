            ) business, he is a general merchant, and lives in George-street, in the Minories. The prisoner came there on the 2d of January, and asked for Mr. Laing, I told him he was in the country, but I would attend him. He said he understood we had some coal-sacking to sell, and asked the price. I asked him his name, he said Rumsey. I asked him if he was Mr. Rumsey, of Bankside? he said, yes. I said, I was glad at the prospect of doing business with him. There is only one Mr. Rumsey, of Bankside, he is a coal-merchant. He said, "You will often see my name on the coal-waggons." I gave him a list of the prices, he said they were too high. I said, that as his consumption was large, I would take 1s. off, to open an account with him. He asked me what discount we took off for money? I said I would engage in a six months running account with him, which he told me to put on the card - I did so. He appointed to call the next day - I said I should be at Bankside, and would call on him; he said he would call on me, and went away. He was afterwards apprehended, and offered to give up the sacking, if I would not prosecute.</p>

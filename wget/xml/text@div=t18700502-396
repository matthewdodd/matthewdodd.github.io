I live at 7, Albion Street Caledonian Road—on Monday, 11th April, between 8 and 4 o'clock in the afternoon, I was going home, and when I got to my own house three lads came up before me, looked in my face, and then the biggest of the three knocked me down on my back, and held me there while the other two picked my pocket of my watch—they then all three ran down Haward Street—I followed—a gentlemen came up and followed with me, and the prisoner was stopped—he was the biggest of the three—he is the man who knocked me down—I identified him—my watch cost me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

I reside at 264, Pentonville Road, and am a traveller—on 11th April I was in Albion Street, with my trap—I saw the prosecutor, the prisoner, and two others, all wrestling together on the ground—they got up, and the gentleman ran after the prisoner—I asked him what he was running after him for, and he said "He has stolen my watch"—I said "I will go for you," and I chased after him as far as the Great Northern Station—I caught the prisoner and gave him into custody.</p>

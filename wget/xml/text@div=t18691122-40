                  </hi>. I am temporary clerk at St. Peter's Church, Islington—I produce the Register of Marriages for 1850—on the 25th July I find that William Baynes Netherwood, of full age, late Captain of Madras Infantry, was married to Martha Pearce, of fall age.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, of Duke Street, Manchester Square—I knew the prisoner before his first marriage, in 1850—I acted as his solicitor—I also knew Martha Pearce—I acted as solicitor to her mistress—I did not know of the marriage until afterwards—the signature in this register, "William Baynes Netherwood," is the prisoner's handwriting, and I believe this to be Martha Pearce's—I afterwards knew them to live together as man and wife—I acted as their solicitor—they separated in 1856 or 1857 without a deed—I afterwards obtained a Protecting Order for the wife—I saw her last night—she called on me—I last saw the prisoner and her together about three weeks ago; but I had not seen them together before that for eight or nine years, about 1857—I have refreshed my memory since I was before the Magistrate, by looking at my books and papers—I have not got them with me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you say before the Magistrate, "Some nine or ten years ago I remember them meeting; I was then in an office in Orchard Street?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is true—that would bring it to 1859, and it might be in 1859 that I last saw them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You do not mean the end of 1859? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Well, if I could fix a date, I should say it was in 1858, because soon after 1858 I removed from Orchard Street—the prisoner served in the Crimean war—Now I can fix a date; he returned from the Crimea in 1857, and I saw them once, a few months after that, so that they separated in 1858—they separated in consequence of certain matters that came to the prisoner's knowledge, which occurred during his absence—he has not, to my knowledge, lived with her since—I saw the prisoner living with the prose<lb></lb>cutrix in Rutford Place—I am aware they lived together two years before the second marriage, which was on the 12th June, 1867—I was not present at the marriage—before the second marriage he gave me instructions to make inquiries about his first wife—I caused inquiries to be made—she was not known at the last address she gave me, and we were informed she was dead—the Protection Order was not brought to the prisoner's notice in any way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LEWIS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You knew of the Protection Order being obtained in 1864? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—when the prisoner applied to me about his wife, I did not tell him that she was alive in 1864, and that I had obtained a Protection Order against him—after that Order I lost sight of her altogether—I believe it was registered—I made inquiries in Commercial Road East, where my letters had always found her, that is all.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LEWIS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You did not advertise for her? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—the prisoner did not tell me he wanted to marry the second time—I made many other inquiries besides, but could get no information about her—my clerk is now instructing counsel who defends the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Peareth—he was a cornet in one of Her Majesty's cavalry regiments—I was married to him about the 25th June, 1807—I married the prisoner at the Registrar's Office, Ken<lb></lb>sington—I had run away with him before marriage, at his solicitation—a week or two after we had been married I heard he had been married before, and spoke to him about it—he represented himself to me as a bachelor—when I spoke to him about it he said he had not been married before—I did not exactly live with him at all—it could not have been more than a few months, and then he did not pay, and he was turned out—I still live in the same place.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I believe your name originally was Emily Hunt Waterman? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I first met the prisoner at Paddock Wood station about four years ago—two months after that he asked me to run away and marry him, and I came up to London and lived with him—I lived with him because I did not wish to marry him—I went to an hotel with him for about a fortnight, and then left him—I met him after that, and lived with him again—I mean to tell the Jury that he lived with me at an hotel, but there was no relation of man and wife between us—the only injury he did me was by marrying me, because I was engaged to be married—I have married a gentleman now.</p>

             came into my yard on Wednesday morning, about eight, the 23d of June, and asked me if I had lost a mare, and he told me he had the man and my mare very safe; I went with this person immediately to town, and I found the mare in a livery stable, and the man was committed to New Prison.</p>

               <p>I met the prisoner about three o'clock on the 28th of June, in St. John-street, and he asked me the way for Cow-cross, I asked him who he wanted at Cow-cross, he said he wanted to sell that horse; I asked him if he wanted to sell it to the horse flesh people for the dogs; he told me that he did; I told him I thought it was too good a horse to sell for that, I asked him how he came by it, he said it was his own property; he said I did not know the disorder of the horse, it was very much glandered and partly rotten, not knowing the nature of it, I let him pass, and in about ten minutes Baker came and brought the prisoner to me to the watch-house, telling me he had stopped a man with a horse, suspecting he had stolen him; I asked Baker if he was glandered, he said no, it was a very found horse; then I went and took the prisoner into the watch-house, and I told him, says I, I do suspect you, and after talking to him some time, he told me he had stole it from one Mr. Harrison, at Bush Farm, that he had taken it through distress, that he had four children in the country; I then took the horse to the livery stable, I went and told Mr. Harrison, and he came up to town with me.</p>

               <p>On the 23d of last month, I was going to work about half after three o'clock, and I met the prisoner, he asked me his way to Sharpe's-alley, he went down there and offered a horse for sale, and wanted a guinea for it, he said it was his own, and it was glandered; I examined it and found the horse had no glanders, and I thought him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178407070063"></xptr> too good for that purpose, I taxed him with it, and he denied it strongly, then I took him to the watch-house, and delivered him to Mr. Poole the constable.</p>
               <p>Did you afterwards see that horse in Harrison's possession? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was that the same horse you took from the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That was your horse, Harrison? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Baker. He said he was drove to distress, and had four children, and I believe that to be the case, for I never saw a man so terrified in my life.</p>

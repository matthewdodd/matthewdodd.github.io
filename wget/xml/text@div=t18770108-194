                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. Hall, the tenant of Little Bar<lb></lb>rington Hall Farm, Hatfield Broad Oak, Essex—on the night of 8th December, about 10.40 I went into the premises and saw a barley stack on fire—I had been called by cries of "Fire"—it was the stack which was nearest to the road which was on fire—it was about 10 rods from the road I should say—there are 5 1/2 yards to a rod; that would be about 55 yards—another stack behind it at right angles to it, caught fire and some buildings also—I saw the prisoner throwing the burning <hi rend="italic">haulm</hi> with a fork high up into the air—the wind was blowing towards the buildings, and it blew the burning particles towards the buildings which are now standing, but not towards those which are burned—some of them told the prisoner to leave it alone, they called him <hi rend="italic">Lump;</hi> they said "Leave it alone <hi rend="italic">Lump</hi>"—that is his nickname—the prisoner said "Let it burn, it wants to burn, let it burn you b—"—as soon as the fire was got under, my attention was called to some foot marks going to the stack; they were a few feet from the stack which first caught fire—I cannot read and I do not understand this map (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—on the Sunday afternoon I went with the prisoner and constables Hitch and Gall, to the footmarks—we then traced footmarks away from the stack; they went round by the hedge, but there is no path there, only a horse path; there is no right of way there—we traced them to the road again which leads to Barrington Hall—the constables had two pair of boots with them, they each had a pair—I saw them compare the boots with the foot prints—one pair of boots corresponded with the prints and one pair did not—the prisoner said that they corresponded with one pair.</p>

                  </hi>. I belong to the Essex Constabulary—en the evening of 8th December I as on duty in Tateley, which is about 2 1/2 miles by road from Little Barrington Hall—I saw this fire commence—I saw a light flash up in the air as if a lucifer had been just struck and I saw smoke—I went home and looked out from the upstairs window and could then see the flames from Little Barrington Hall—that was about 10.30—I proceeded to the spot and got there about 11.15—I took out my watch at 10.20 and looked at the time—when I got there I saw the straw stack all but consumed, and a stack of hay was burning also—I assisted in putting out the fire and saw the prisoner there—I watched him very narrowly—he was going about in the kitchen instead of helping' at the fire, and I was obliged to order him out—he assisted a little when the engine came at 3 o'clock in the morning—next morning I observed footmarks on the road going to the stack-yard; that is the road which leads from Bush End, where the prisoner lives—I understand the Ordinance Map (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—this is where the fire was, and the footmarks were along this gateway by the side of this fence to this point; they came straight to the stack and went along here, up this cart path—there is no footpath or right of way there—those were the footsteps going to the stack and they were the proper length of the boot, but going away they were on the slip—when a man is running, his feet slip, and the impression is very distinct of the heels and there are long strides—before going to the road he</p>

               <p>has stopped at a privet hedge and then got over into the road and went along the edge of the forest—this iron fence runs by the edge of the forest—just under the privet hedge I could see that some person had been standing there for some time, by the numerous foot-steps, it is a ploughed field, and the steps were on the ridges—there was grass within about 30 feet of the stack, so that the footsteps could not be traced—the footsteps that could be traced to and from the stack came directly to the corner of it—I went down to the prisoner's house which is on the Green opposite the Ancient Forester's public house—I saw footsteps in the garden leading to his house, which were the same as those I traced along the fields—I went into his house—I fetched him from the Ancient Forester's beer house—the policeman Gall was with me all the time—he asked the prisoner where the boots were which he went to the fire with—this was on the Sunday, at 2 o'clock p.m.—he brought them from another room, and said "These are the boots I had on," handing them to Gall—they were dry, and I could tell as soon as I saw them that they were not the pair I wanted, and I went into the other room, and saw this pair (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the dirt was all round here, and wet—there was ashes and slate on them—there was plenty of it on them at that time—I took possession of them; they both want toe-irons—there had, no doubt, been a toe-piece of some kind, a piece of metal—they are in the same state as they were when I found them—the sole of one them had four nails in the front, and the heel has four in front and two behind, and there is a little nail with the head knocked off; the other boot has three and two, and this little nail made a scratch as he was running; that is on the left boot—there is not a similar nail in the right; there are four there—the prisoner was then apprehended by Gall, and told the charge; he said that he did not know anything about it; he went straight to the fire by the road, and never left the road that night—when I brought the boots out, I said "Whose boots are these?"—he said "They are not my boots, they are my father's"—I know his father, he was not at the fire up to 1 o'clock, which was after we found these marks—from 11.15 that night, to. I o'clock on Saturday his father was not there, and that was after I found the marks—Gall and I took these boots, and in the prisoner's presence compared them with the footprints, and that pair agreed with the footprints in every particular, heels, and everything, through the whole of the track that is marked on the map, and in his own garden as well—in the footprints leaving the stack, I noticed the slip made by the one with the nail; the other boot made larger marks—they corresponded in every possible way both as to the right and left boot—the heel iron is removed from the left boot, and there are three nails in front and two in the centre—the prisoner was with me when 1 compared them, and he could see that they compared, but he said "I did not come round this way; I did not make them"—I have measured the distance from the prisoner's house to the stack which is burnt, it is 244 rods—there are 5 1/2, yards to a rod—from the stack to the prisoner's house, going by the fields is 104 rods further, from the point where you would get into the road is 104 rods additional—going round the field would be 104 rods further out of his way.</p>

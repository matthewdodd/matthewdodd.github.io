                  </hi>. I am a soap-manufacturer, and live in Dock-street, Rosemary-lane.

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's foreman. On Tuesday, the 22nd of August, I was up stairs, by the boiler in the factory, about four o'clock in the afternoon, and heard a noise below—I looked down, and saw Scott wheeling a tub of oil along the floor—I had been to that tub before, and had taken oil out to trim the lamps—he wheeled it from the soap frame to the outer gate, in Dock-street—I went down, and found Scott had got the cask in his arms, on the outer step; he was going to lift it into a truck, and Garrod was holding the handle of the truck up to receive it—I said to Scott, "What have you got there?"—he said, "Only a little water, which belongs to me"—I said, "It is not water, it is oil; I have had some out to trim the lamps"—he said, "Nonsense"—I said, "I am positive it is oil, for Mr. Fe<lb></lb>rina saw me take some out"—he then said, "Well, if Mr. Ferina has seen it I will put it back"—he wheeled it back again to the soap frame, where it was taken from—he then wanted me to have some beer—I said, "No"—he went away, and said, "For God's sake, don't mention it to them up stairs," meaning the other two men—I saw some iron hoops in the truck—I said, "They don't belong to you"—he said they were not worth 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I told Garrod they did not belong to Scott, they must be put back again—Garrod said, "Well, if they don't belong to him I will put them back, of course"—there were fourteen iron hoops in the truck, and an iron chain and hook—they belong to my master—I said I could not let anything go off Mr. Jones's premises without his knowledge—Garrod said, "Very well"—he was at the truck all the time—we had been clearing the place, and had put the hoops all up together—when I took the things out of the truck, and Garrod helped me to put them on the floor of the factory, he said he had been hired by Scott; he had been moving goods for Scott all day—he knew Scott had been in Mr. Jones's em<lb></lb>ploy—I did not know what to do—I knew both the men, and I let them go—as soon as Mr. Jones came next morning I told him, and, by his direction, I got a policeman, and went after the prisoners—Scott was taken that morning, and Garrod in the evening.</p>

On Monday the 27th of August last; I called the hour of twelve; I then went to my box, and leaned over the latch. I heard an uncommon noise in the market; I went over to Mr. Mason's shop, on the other side of the market. I found the shutters up, but loose; one of the shutters I took down; I found the prisoner inside, sitting on the block. I asked him what brought him there; he said he was Mr. Mason's servant, he came there to sleep. I told him I was pretty sure he was not Mason's servant, I knew all the men that were in his employ; if he wanted to sleep there why did not he get the key of Mr. Mason. I took him in custody; I took him to the watchhouse, and gave him in charge of the constable, and on searching him we found a saw upon him.</p>

            . I was constable of the night. When the prisoner was brought in the watchhouse I found these tools upon him, a saw, a gimblet, a large spike, a tinder box with a candle; the tinder box had tinder in it, a flint, steel, and matches, and a screw-driver. Finding these on him, I booked the charge, and took him to the Compter.

             is dead. When Mr. Mason was sent for at the watchhouse I went down with Mr. Mason to his shop; I tried the gimblet to a hole in the shulters that the prisoner had bored; it fitted, and this spike nail I fitted to the mark of the shulter at the bottom, where the prisoner had wrenched it down. Mr. Mason went with us to prefer the hill; he is since dead.</p>
               <p>Stevens. I was a watchman there three years. Mr. Mason's shop is in the front of my box. The prisoner had not been Mr. Mason's servant for three or four years past.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say when you took him up - A. He appeared tipsey, but when I took him to the watchhouse he appeared quite sober.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Seeing the shutters down, I went to sleep there</p>
               <p>Stevens. The shutters were not down. I had been by there half an hour before; it was all fast, and shut up.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wheelwright. On the 7th of October the prisoner came to my shop, at six o'clock in the morning—he stated that he had come on the night before, and he borrowed a truck for two hours—I desired him not to keep it longer, as a neighbour had engaged it at eight o'clock—he said he would return it in less than two hours—he had hired a truck the day before, and paid for it—he took away the truck, and I have not seen it since—he was to pay twopence an hour for it—I did not see the prisoner again till the 22nd of October, when my apprentice brought him to me—the truck was worth 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I had hired the truck the night before—I took it home, and asked if I could have it the next morning, as I was going to Charing-cross, and I took it out, not bargaining for any time—I went to Charing-cross, and waited till nine o'clock for a gentleman, and he did not come—as I was going back over the bridge, a boy who was with me, said he had no money to pay for it, and we left it in some ruins in the Waterloo-road, and told the prosecutor so. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> He denied to me that he ever had the truck in his life—he told the Magistrate he had left it there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police-constable. I received charge of the priosner from the prosecutor in Kent-street—on the way to the station—house I asked him what he had done with the truck—he said he knew nothing of it at all—when we got to the end of Mount-street he said he had had it, and taken it away, but at that time he should not tell where it was.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> It is false; I never told him a single word—I walked all the way without saying any thing—the truck was not sold—I told him where the other boy lived. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> Yes; he said he lived at the Red—house, in the Mint—I went there on the 23rd—there had been such a boy there, but he had absconded for a fortnight.</p>

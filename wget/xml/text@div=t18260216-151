            . I am a cork-cutter. I was near William John Thompson's house, in <placeName id="t18260216-151-crimeloc801">Gracechurch-street</placeName>

I saw the prisoner (as near as I could tell by his coat) untwist a piece of string at Mr. Thompson's door, and take the shoes, which hung on a nail at the step of the door. I had no idea of a theft till I saw him pass them into the apron of a man who was with him; I put my head in at the door and said "The man has taken your shoes;" "Which man?" said Mr. Thompson; "That man in the brown coat," said I. I did not pursue him but Mr. Thompson did. I believe it to have been the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Of course when you were looking into the shop, you could not be looking at the man in the brown coat? A. No, I could not.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM JOHN THOMPSON. I keep a shoemaker's shop in Gracechurch-street. Mr. Thorpe put his head into my shop, and said "There goes the man who has taken your shoes" - I ran after him and pushed him into a neighbour's house - he had nothing upon him.</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on business in Manchester, and at 63, Fleet-street, London, as a washing-machine manufacturer—I employed the prisoner at Manchester as an assistant clerk at wages of 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—I subsequently caused him to come to London to manage the business there Mr. Giles is my managing man there—the prisoner's duties were to receive money and take orders, and to send whatever money there was beyond paying the servant's wages, to Manchester every week—when he received money he had to enter it in the cash-book—in consequence of information I received, I came to London and spoke to the prisoner—I had previously been up to London and discovered something wrong, but he had not given me a full statement of what was wrong; and when I came up on 16th, he handed me this book in his writing—on the previous occasion I said to him, "There is something wrong here, Bate"—that was about three weeks ago—I had got some papers that he had left, which I showed him, and he said, "Yes, there is Sir; I confess that I have been doing wrong"—I said, "Well, now tell me what you have done, whether it is 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., let me know the worst"—he then gave me this list in writing (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the amount then deficient was about 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said there was 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd which he had not accounted for—I said to him, "Mr. Giles is coming back to-night: you must go through the books, or I cannot allow you to go from here"—I returned to Manchester and subsequently came to town again on 16th—I then bad another conversation with the prisoner—I said I was very sorry to see that he had not told me all—he was silent—I said it was a very serious matter as to whether he thought I could stand it—he begged for mercy, and said, "Well, Sir, I confess that I have done wrong"—I said, "What have you done with the money?"—he said, "I have spent it."</p>

"—he said, "Yes I will make you a list of them"—the list was made and it amounted to about 67<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was transferred to the cash-book, which is in the prisoner's writing—Nichols and Harle are the two in the indictment—I was much suprised when I saw the amount, and asked him what he had done with the money—he said, "I have been foolish, and have spent it upon women," or words to that effect—that amount from Nichols, 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., was never paid over to me by the prisoner, or the amount 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Harles—they were not entered in the ledger or cash-book.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I engaged with Mr. Bradford about five months ago; my salary was to be 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, expenses paid. I had to come up to London to take Mr. Giles's place, and put up at a coffee-house; I thought I was only to come up for two or three days; it cost me 26<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week there. I had to buy fresh clothes, as I had only brought one change of linen. As regards Mr. Hade's account, I recollect the circumstance very well; he said he owed another balance and would come and pay it shortly. It is not likely that I should deliberately and dishonestly take money; it is very probable that money was paid to me and I have put it in my pocket when I was called away for something else; it is possible that certain accounts, without intention, were omitted. As to embezzling or stealing I totally deny that I have done it; I could have run away with double or treble the amount. I surrendered myself; is it likely that if I was guilty I should have done that? I was put into a situation that I knew nothing about; I am a bad book-keeper, and could not live on 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week; that is my only fault.</p>

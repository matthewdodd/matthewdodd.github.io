                  </hi>. I am barmaid at the Fellmongers' Arms, Willow Walk, Bermondsey—on 16th November the prisoner gave me a bad half-crown for some gin—I asked him where he got it—he said from a public-house in Whitechapel in change for a sove<lb></lb>reign—I handed it to Mrs. young, and saw her show it to Mr. Young, who bent it and put it on the counter—the prisoner took it up, broke it, threw one piece on the floor, and put the other in his pocket—a carman afterwards picked the piece up and it was given to the constable.</p>

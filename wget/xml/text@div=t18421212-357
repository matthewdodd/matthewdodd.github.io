I stopped the prisoner in Tottenham Court-road—she was running away, and there was a cry of "Stop thief"—she had a handkerchief and a bundle in her apron—I said, "What have you there?"—she said, "A handkerchief I have picked up"—I said "You have stolen something"—the people said, "Hold her tight"—a gen<lb></lb>tleman came, she gave the handkerchief to him, and he gave her into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am ten years old, and live in Cheyne's-place, Tottenham Court-road. About half-past seven o'clock in the evening of the 2nd of Dec., I was out with my little sister Eliza—I was going to Donovan's, facing the coffee-shop in Tottenham Court-road—the prisoner came to me, and said, "Let me take bold of the baby, as it is quite cold"—I let her take hold of the child, which had a handkerchief tied round its neck—the prisoner these gave me a halfpenny, and told me to go and fetch a farthing sugar-stick, and bring a farthing back—she said, "You take the baby now, and take the handkerchief off the baby's neck, it will blow off"—I said, "No, you gift it to me"—she said, "No, I will mind it till you come back"—I went to buy the sweet-stick—the man was not there—when I came back the prisoner was running away—this is the handkerchief—it belongs to my father, John Sack—a gentleman took it out of the prisoner's hand, and gave it to me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Michael Oliver. I assist Mr. Phillips, who keeps the Jolly Farmer beer-shop, at Shadwell—the prisoner came there on 9th May, in company with another man, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon—he asked for a pint of beer, and gave me a half-crown—I put it in my pocket—I had no other there—I gave him change—about nine the same evening, the prisoner came again, alone, for a pint of porter, and gave me a second half-crown—I said to him, "You are all in the half-crown way; this is the second I have taken of you to-day"—he made no reply—I gave the half-crown to the little boy to get change, but before he returned I made up change and gave it to the prisoner, and he went—the little boy came back and said the half-crown was bad—I then looked at the first half-crown which was in my pocket, and found that was bad—I wrapped them both up in paper, put them in my dress-pocket, and kept them separate from other money—next day the prisoner came again, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, in company with the same man who came with him, at first—they asked for a pint of porter, and put down another half-crown—I had previously got a policeman, as I quite expected he would come again—I said, "I charge this man with passing two bad half-crowns yester<lb></lb>day, and I expect he has brought another," but that proved to be good—the prisoner said, "You make a mistake; I never was in your house before"—I am quite certain he is the man.</p>

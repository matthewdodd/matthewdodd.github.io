            , my apprentice, brought me a parcel, and asked for 2s. 6d. for the carriage; the shop bell rung, Smith ran down, and I told him to send the boy for the money; I gave the boy the half-crown to pay for the parcel - 2s. 6d. was written on it, as the charge for carriage; upon opening it I found two letters in it - one which was unsealed, contained an order for goods to be packed and sent to No. 14, Houndsditch, that evening; I was busy, having an order to complete for his Majesty, and sent Smith to Houndsditch to ask if they could wait for the goods.</p>
               <p>GEORGE SMITH. I am an apprentice to Mrs. Ustonson. On the 13th of June, between two and four o'clock, the prisoner brought this parcel to the shop, directed to Mrs. Ustonson; he said there was half a crown to pay for it - I took it up stairs - my mistress sent half a crown down by the boy, who I saw delivered it to the prisoner; I afterwards went to Houndsditch, but could find no No. 14; I found a Mr. Johnson, an ironmonger, in Houndsditch, but his name was not John; we have not supplied him with any articles - the prisoner said he brought the parcel from the Edinburgh mail.</p>

That I delivered the parcel, I acknowledge - but I believe there are a thousand cases in London similar to that in which I was placed; it is nothing uncommon for parcels to be delivered by strangers; it was delivered to me by a stranger, who had all the appearance of a guard (belonging, as he told me, to the Edinburgh coach) he offered me 6d. to deliver it to the lady; distress would not have caused me to do it, had I known I was doing wrong; I have been made the dupe of another man.</p>

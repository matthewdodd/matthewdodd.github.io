On the 29th of July he was not selling any thing, but the property was in the auction-room; I saw the prisoner in the room, and about half-past five o'clock I saw him take up a plated waiter, put it under his coat, and turn to walk out - I called to Mr. Bullock's man, and asked him if he saw the man take the waiter; he said,"No, stop him." I followed him up Southampton-street; I called Stop thief! and saw him take it out of his coat, and throw it down an area - I followed him to Silver-street, and brought him back; he said, "What is the matter?" -I said, "There is not much the matter, but you must go back with me." This is the waiter.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. This is a public auction-room? A. Yes; there were four or five persons there - I did not particularly notice him while he was in the room, but I can swear he is the man; I did not lose sight of him after he left the room - I suppose it was found about fifty yards from where it was taken; I swear this is the waiter - it was given me from the area; I suppose the prisoner went twenty yards from the area before he was taken - I do not know that this is the one he threw down.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see him take one from the room? A. Yes, he appeared to me to be sober; he walked and ran very steadily.</p>

            . I am a porter to Mr. Bullock. I was in the back room when the prisoner took this out of the auction room; I did not see it taken, but saw it down Mr. Luke's area - the servant took it up and gave it me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not the prisoner run a distance after it was said he had thrown this down? A. Yes, I suppose twenty yards; I lost sight of the waiter while I followed him - I then came back and knocked at the door, and they gave it me; there is no particular mark on it - here is a sort of cross; the servant came to the door - I should not like to swear this is the waiter; it is not my duty to inspect the plate - I know nothing about the waiter but what has been told me by the last witness.</p>

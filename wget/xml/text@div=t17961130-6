               <p>Q. (To the Prosecutor.) Who had the shoes; who did you receive them from? - A. I never had them again at all.</p>

               <p>Han. The man that received the shoes was never brought back, nor the shoes.</p>
               <p>Q. (To the Prosecutor.) Q. Had you any shoes hanging at your door, the 26th of October, on a peg? - A. Yes, about twenty-six pair; I missed one pair when she gave me notice, she shewed me the man; I was not well, I could not catch him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I know nothing about the shoes, I was not guilty of it; I never had them in my hands.</p>
               <p>Jury. (To Mrs. Han.) Q. What occasioned you to go to the prison? - A My landlady, where I lived, was taken up for robbing the India warehouse, I went to see her in prison; the prisoner beckoned to me, and said, I hope you will not say I am the man. That is the man I am sure.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the son of William Morris, of Lee, in Kent—the prisoner was in our service between two and three months, at 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week. On the 31st of May he went with a wagon to town—I saw the wagon go out of the yard with a quantity of hay in it, which he had no right to have—in consequence of suspicion, I followed him, and saw him deliver the hay at the Rose, just by New Cross-turnpike—he remained there some time, and then drove away, leaving the hay behind him—I have since examined that hay, and it is of the same quality as the hay on our premises—it was a truss—I followed and overtook him after he left the Rose, and asked what he had done with the hay he had in his wagon—he said he had left it at the Rose to bait his horses on his return from London—I asked what quantity he had left—he said a small parcel, a quantity that he could put under his arm—I asked if he had not left any more—he said no—I said, "I am sure you are telling me a story, you left more"—he denied it again—I said, "I am convinced that you left a truss, for I saw you deliver it"—he denied it—I had seen him put it out into a rack which they feed the horses out of, and a bundle of hay besides</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184206130218"></xptr>
               <p>—I gave the hay in charge of a policeman—the small bundle was quite sufficient for the horses, with the corn he had, independent of the truss—they could not have eaten the truss in the time they would be gone—they left our yard at four in the afternoon, and would return about twelve—they had three nose-bags full of corn, besides a bushel of corn, the bundle of hay, and the truss.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable R</hi> 49.) On the 31st of May I re<lb></lb>ceived information, and watched the prisoner—I saw him at the Rose-he stopped the wagon, and called the ostler, who brought the rack—the pri<lb></lb>soner got up into the wagon, and put down a small bundle of bay, and a truss—he then got down, untwisted the two hay-bands, and the horses eat some of the truss—he went inside with the ostler, came out in about ten minutes, and went on—the bundle of hay was removed by the ostler to the side of the house, and put into another crib—I took the prisoner into custody next morning—I asked if he knew what I wanted him for—he said he did not—I said it was for stealing a truss of hay from his master's premises—he said he did not, what hay he had taken, he meant to bait his horses with, when he came back from London—I said, "Did not you see me?"—he said, "No"—I said, "I saw you deliver a truss of hay to the ostler, besides a small bundle"—he said he did not—the weight of the hay I took possession of, including two halters, with which we tied it up in<lb></lb>stead of the two bands, was 541bs.—the three horses had only fed on it ten minutes.</p>

Q.</hi> When did the ostler take the bundle? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> When he called for the crib, the bundle and the truss were put out—the small bundle was removed by the under ostler, and the truss was put before the horses—the small bundle was put into a rack by the side of the house—where no horses were feeding—none of it was removed inside—I returned to the public-house in two minutes—I only went off the bridge to see that he had no hay in his wagon, and when I returned I found the prosecutor</p>

               <p>demanding his hay—the ostler had removed the rack to the side of the house—I did not ask the ostler any questions—I apprehended the under ostler next day—the upper ostler was there, but he took no part in the proceeding—horses may eat a good deal of hay in a quarter of an hour.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">re-examined.</hi> The wagon was going to Barclay's brewbouse for grains—it is six or seven miles from my house—we did not allow the men to take any hay at all—I should say three large horses might eat half a truss on their return from London—there was 10lbs. or 12lbs. of hay in the bundle, but they had considerably more than they could have eaten in their nose-bags, and corn besides, had they stopped out till eight or nine next morning—we had been robbed previous to this, and ever since then have refused the men having bay—it is unnecessary—a carter would sooner take corn than hay for his horses—I do not think I had spoken to the prisoner personally about it, as he was only two or three months in our service—my father hired him—he came from Mr. Egerton's service, with whom he lived five or six years; even if we did allow hay, this would be an unreasonable quantity—the horses had been in the stable baiting, three or four hours before they started—they would return between twelve and one in the night—when I first saw the hay in the wagon, I said nothing about it, because I was determined to see whe<lb></lb>ther he made a property of it or not.</p>

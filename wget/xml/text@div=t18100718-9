On Saturday night, the 23d of June, I was coming home from my pay table, I saw the prisoner Kane, standing at his quarters, in the Broadway, Westminster, at the door of the King's Head public house.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known Kane before - A. Yes, he asked me whether I would give him any thing to drink; I went into the public house with him and treated him.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the night was that - A. About nine o'clock; I paid for three or four pots of beer, and a pint of gin; it was for him, his comrade, and me, we all three then went.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you pay for it - A. I received one pound nine shillings and threepence at my pay table, there was a five shilling paper of halfpence, I paid for it out of that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pull out your pocket book or purse in which your other money was - A. No, it was in my pocket, I cannot say that my money was in my purse; I had a one pound note and some silver.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay in this public house drinking - A. Till between nine and ten o'clock, then I went to another public house with the prisoner; after we had been to the second public house, he asked me to go the way by <placeName id="t18100718-9-crimeloc50">Great George-street, Westminster</placeName>

               <p>Q. Was that the pocket your money was in - A. Yes, I asked him what business his hand had in my pocket; he left me after that, I do not recollect what he said, I was in liquor. I went home to bed at my lodgings, in Great Peter-street, I did not examine my pocket. On Sunday morning I awoke between six and seven o'clock, I felt in my pocket, I had no money left.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the last time that you felt you had your money in your pocket - A. The very last public house. I left, I put my hand into my pocket and felt it there.</p>

               <p>Q. Now besides the note and the silver that you had in your pocket, had you a purse in your pocket - A. Yes, a leather purse and three duplicates in it of things that I had pawned. I saw the purse again the next morning.</p>

            . In consequence of a person applying to me, not the prosecutor, I went to the King's Head, in the Broadway, Westminster. I asked the corporal and the Serjeant for the prisoner's room, they shewed me his room; I asked the serjeant where his jacket was, he told me under his head; I took it from there, I then searched his right hand jacket pocket, I took out this purse, there were nineteen shillings in silver in it, and the duplicates; the prisoner owned the jacket afterwards, and put it on; soon after he awaked I took<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181007180008"></xptr>him in custody, the prosecutor said it was his purse, and there were three duplicates in it, I found it as he described.</p>

            . I came into the room while Skinner was there; I said, I was sorry to see a young man like him, who was a soldier, to bring disgrace upon himself and his comrades; he said, he did not care a d - n for himself, or his comrades, all that he wanted was to get rid of the charge. He changed the one pound note at the Cock public house, with Mr. Scregler, he is not here.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He has spoken false, I never spoke to him.</p>
               <p>Gillmore. I most positively swear that those were his words.</p>

On the 23d of June, this young man came down to the house where I was quartered; he asked me to have something to drink, I told him I would, we went in there, and then went to another public house, and on his looking for money in his purse, and finding none, he threw it down, and said, he 
did not want it; I knowing of him, took it up to take care of it for him.</p>

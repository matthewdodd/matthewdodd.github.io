             . Last Monday was three weeks I found an ass of my master's.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find it?</p>
               <p>Dimmock . In Bloomsbury-square, by my Lady Northampton's .</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the ass with?</p>
               <p>Dimmock. Mr. Read's servant, a lad was driving it.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know the lad was servant to this Read?</p>
               <p>Dimmock. Because he told me so. I asked him how his master came by that ass ; he said his master had bought her about three weeks.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174805260036"></xptr>Q. Did he say of whom?</p>
               <p>Dimmock . He said he bought her of the Lord of the manor ; and I took the ass along with me.</p>
               <p>Q. So this boy was driving this ass among others.</p>
               <p>Dimmock. No , it was by itself .</p>
               <p>Q. So you took the ass away.</p>
               <p>Dimmock. Yes, I had known the ass 7 years.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know this Read?</p>
               <p>Dimmock. Yes, he lives in Tyburn-Road, he deals in asses .</p>
               <p>Pris. Co. to Mr. Davis. Did you never hear how Mr. Read came by this ass?</p>
               <p>Davis. I was told , that he bought her at Kilburn .</p>
               <p>Pris. Co. Did you ever talk with Mr. Hayley about this ?</p>
               <p>Davis. Yes .</p>
               <p>Pris. Co. I ask you, whether Mr. Hayley did not tell you, that he sold the ass to the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Davis. I don't remember that he said so; but if it is a stray ass , must he sell it outright?</p>
               <p>Pris. Coun . So instead of bringing an action, you would indict him for a felony: Did not Mr. Montgomery advise you to this prosecution?</p>
               <p>Davis . I have no occasion to give any answer to that questi on .</p>
               <p>Mr. Hayley. I live at Kilburn , I belong to the pound and to the farm, and I sold the ass to Mr. Read.</p>
               <p>Pris. Co. Did you know Mr. Read?</p>
               <p>Hayley. I have known him twenty years.</p>
               <p>Pris. Co. How long had you the ass before you sold it to him?</p>
               <p>Hayley. I had it from about last Michaelmas to the 22d or 23d of April last.</p>
               <p>Pris. Co . How did you come by the ass?</p>
               <p>Hayley . It strayed into my yard, and I pounded it.</p>
               <p>Pris. Co. Did you ever tell Mr. Davis that you sold Mr. Read the ass?</p>
               <p>Hayley. Yes , I have told him so.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you sell the ass for?</p>
               <p>Hayley. I sold it for 4 l. - I don't know the value of asses, for I never had an ass before.</p>
               <p>It appearing that the ass was bought, it made it a case of a civil nature, and the Prisoner was honourably <rs id="t17480526-38-verdict218" type="verdictDescription">
                     <interp inst="t17480526-38-verdict218" type="verdictCategory" value="notGuilty"></interp>
               acquitted
            </rs>.</p>
               <p>Court to Davis. How came you to carry this prosecution on in this manner ?</p>
               <p>Davis. Because my servant found the ass in the Prisoner's custody . I would have made it up in any way, but I was bound over to prosecute.</p>
               <p>Court . You ought to ask the Prisoner pardon .</p>
               <p>Davis. Very well, my lord; I am mistaken; I know he is as honest a man as any of the trade.</p>

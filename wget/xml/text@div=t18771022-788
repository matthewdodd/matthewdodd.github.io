                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective</hi>). On the 11th inst. I went, in company with constables Osborne and Maroni and Mr. Coulden, the prosecutor, to Shenstone's shop, 83, Goswell Road—I went in alone—I should call it an ordinary manufacturing fur-shop—I saw Mrs. Shen<lb></lb>stone there, and afterwards the others came in—I said to Cain, in the presence of Shenstone, "Is this the person to whom you" sold the skins?"—he said "Yes"—I then said to Shenstone "Have you bought any skins of this lad?"—she said "Yes"—I said "How many?"—she said "It might be two or three dozen"—I said "How much did you give for them?"—she said "1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each"—she pointed to a shelf in the shop, and a person in the shop fetched down a large quantity of prepared skins, some of these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—she and her son sorted out three dozen—she said "There they are; I don't know whether they are all Mr. Coulden's"—I then said "Do you know this lad?" (<hi rend="italic">pointing to Cain</hi>)—she said "No"—I afterwards said "Don't you know what he is?"—she said "No; a furrier, I thought," or "I think," I won't be sure which—I said "Have you bought any more?"—she said "No"—I said "I want <hi rend="italic">two</hi> dozen and nine more"—she said "I have not bought any more"—I said "We are going to take these away (<hi rend="italic">Referring to the three dozen skins</hi>), and you will be charged with receiving them knowing them to be stolen"—she said "Oh, the vaga<lb></lb>bond! I wish I had never seen them"—she said to Mr. Coulden "How many are there, how much are they?"—he said "I cannot have any<lb></lb>thing to do with it"—she then went to the back of the shop with the other officer, Osborne—I afterwards searched the shop, and brought away another ten dozen skins similar to these.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I should think Shenstone went to the back of the shop with Osborne to put her shawl and bonnet on, and to see that she did not run away—they were out of my sight—I have no idea whether they were alone together—it was she who mentioned Mr. Coulden's name—I had not mentioned it, I am quite sure—Mr. Coulden was in the shop all the time.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective</hi>). About three o'clock on the 11th October I went with detectives Maroni and Westwood to the warehouse of Messrs. Coulden and Son, 44, Gresham Street, where we saw the prisoner France—I took him into custody, and he was conveyed with Cain to the police station—from information we received from France and Cain, Westwood, Maroni, and myself went to Shenstone's shop in the Goswell Road on the same day, the 11th—she expressed a wish to go to the back yard, and I went with her—she went for a certain pur<lb></lb>pose, and then washed her hands—she said "I am sorry I bought them, bat you know what it is when things like that are offered by a boy; it is a great temptation, and you want to get them as cheap as you can, I suppose it is only a leaden penalty," which expression was accompanied by her putting her hand under her apron and rattling something like money—at that time one of the G Division Metro<lb></lb>politan Police came into the shop—we had sent for him—we generally make it a practice of doing so—Shenstone said "What does that police<lb></lb>man want"—I said "You have denied buying any more skins—I believe you have two dozen and nine more, and we are going to search the place for them"—her son then came to her, and she pointed to a shelf and said "You will find them there"—and there was a number produced from the shelf—Mrs. Shenstone and her son selected two dozen and nine—she said she thought they were them, and pointed to the lad Cain, and said she gave a shilling each for them, the same as she did for the others—she was then taken to the station and the charge read over to her—she said "I admit buying the five dozen and nine of the boy, but those are mine," pointing to a bundle of ten dozen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> That bundle is here—what I have related was her own statement without any questions from me—there was a remand in the case—I was examined on the first occasion, and gave part of my evidence, not the whole, because it was taken by the Court to affect each prisoner—I gave evidence, and Mr. Vesey informed the Court that he should have to recall me—I gave evidence against Mrs. Shenstone on the second occasion—she was in the dock on the first occasion, and my giving evidence against her was, with Mr. Wontner's concurrence, left till the next remand—I do not mean that I suppressed or kept back evidence with Mr. Wontner's concurrence—I did not say on the first occasion anything about Shenstone going into the back premises, but I was prepared to say it—it was a very busy day at Guildhall—Mr. Pratt opened the case, and I gave evidence, and left the box without saying a word about this supposed conversation—I said I had other evidence to give personally—I spoke of the appre<lb></lb>hension of Cain, and what he said in answer to the charge; and I was then about to commence about Mrs. Shenstone, when Mr. Pratt said to Mr. Martin there was evidence, but proposed to take the next fitness, and Mr. Martin, the Chief Clerk, concurred—she was taken into custody by Westwood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The first evidence I gave was only in reference to Cain and France—the other two officers, Westwood and Maroni, gave their evidence upon the first occasion—Mr. Pratt was the solicitor for the prosecution at that time—he said in open Court before the Alderman that Osborne would give further evidence with respect to Mrs. Shenstone, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187710220066"></xptr>
               <p>the Chief Clerk consulted with the Alderman, and they thought there was sufficient evidence for a remand.</p>

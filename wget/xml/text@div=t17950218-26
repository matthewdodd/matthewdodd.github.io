               <p>WILLIAM REEVE sworn.</p>
               <p>I live next door to Mr. Waithman, I am in the collar way.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner take the property? - I will tell you as briefly as I can. It was the 16th of January, between five and six in the evening, near six, it was after dark; I see the prisoner and two in company with him; I see them standing about the shop window, indeed one of my servants told me they were about; I went out and watched them, and I see the prisoner open Mr. Waithman's shop door, put his hand in and draw a piece of linen from the window; he had it about half way from the window, when I caught hold of his hand, and had a scuffle with him, and dragged him into the shop, and there was a patrol coming by at the time, and he was given charge of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe how this linen was, in a bundle or loose, or how? - It was in the window, as linen drapers generally have for a shew.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the whole dragged out? - No, it was not, it was a large piece about ten yards, and only part of it was dragged out.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say from the situation in which you found him, and from the situation in which it was at the window, that every part was removed from the window? - No, I do not believe the whole was removed, the greatest part was.</p>

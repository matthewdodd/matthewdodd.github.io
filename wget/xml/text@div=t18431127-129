                  </hi>. I am carman to Mr. Conyngham. On Thursday, the 26th of Oct., he told me to take a package of goods from the West India Docks—the prisoner was standing by the cart at the time, and his brother was there—by directions of Conyngham, I took the package of goods to Cornhill—when I got to No. 16, Cornhill, I found in the lower part of the house the business of a tailor carried on by Challis and Co.—I went into the shop first—they told us to put it in the passage—I put it in the passage—the pri<lb></lb>soner's brother assisted me—the prisoner was sitting in the cart—the package was placed in the passage of the private door—Pickiss, the lad, showed us where to put it in the passage—I did not go in to get the bill receipted, the prisoner's brother did, and I went in behind him—he went into the shop with the delivery paper—I had it from him before he came out—I saw the paper signed—I then went on to Princes-street, with the prisoner and his brother they left me there, and said, "Good night"—I never saw them again till the prisoner was taken.</p>

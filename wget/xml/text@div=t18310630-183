On the 10th of June the prisoner Thompson came and asked me to let him look at some gold seals,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183106300094"></xptr>which I did - he then asked me to rub one of them with a bit of leather, that he might see how it looked; I had the leather close by me, and I rubbed it - he then said it was too large, and he wished to know what I would make him two for, between the sizes of those I had - I said I could not tell him, as my husband was not at home - he then put his hand into his pocket, pulled out a chased gold key, and asked if I could make him one exactly like that, with a cornelian stone in it, for 25s. - I said I could not tell myself; at that time the other prisoner came in, and asked for some shirt-studs - I thought things were not right, and I said, rather abruptly, "When I have done with this customer I will attend to you;" Thompson then asked me the price of this ring which I have in my purse, and I said, "I told you, 5s. 6d.;" he then dropped it down - I told him he had got some more; he said he had not, but I said,"You have, Sir;" he then shook these three rings and this seal out of the cuff of his coat - he said, "There they are, there they are;" I said he had more - he said he had not, and out he ran; I said to the children in the shop, "Look sharp!" and I ran after him - I lost sight of him, but I am able to say he is the same man; I was standing in Swan-street about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour afterwards, and saw him coming up - he had changed his coat, but I was quite certain of his features; I followed him to Brick-lane - he went into a house, and was there taken; I cannot swear to Wilkinson, but it was a man much like him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. What coloured coat had the man on, who first came about the seals? A. A brown frock-coat; when I saw Thompson in Swan-street he had an old blue coat on - he had the same trousers; about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes had passed - I lost three rings, two smaller ones, and a brooch, and five the officer has; I brought Thompson back to the shop, and delivered him to an officer - I did not at that time charge any body else with it; the other man was not near my goods; I said, before the Justice, that I had no room to suspect him, and I say so still; my servant is not weak in the head - she is not very brisk, but she knows a person again; there was nothing found on Thompson - I think it was on Friday week; there was a charge made against Wilkinson - the Policeman said he knew he lived in the same house with Thompson.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.What time did the prisoner leave your shop? A. I think between one and two o'clock.</p>

            . I live in Church-street, Bethnalgreen, and am a hair-dresser. I heard a cry of Stop thief! on Friday, the 10th of June, about two o'clock in the afternoon; I went out, and saw Mrs. Lampard - I pursued a man, who I believe was Thompson, but I could not swear to him, as he had changed his coat when I caught him; I followed him to Hare-street, which is thirty or forty yards from Swan-street, and there I lost sight of him; I afterwards saw Thompson in Swan-street, who, I believe, was the man I saw before - I followed him to a green-grocer's shop, where he was taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.When you saw him in Swan-street, how was he dressed? A.In a blue coat and brown trousers, and the man I first saw had an olive frock coat on, either an olive brown or an olive green - the man in brown looked round once or twice, while I was pursuing him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. From the two or three times he looked round, had you such an observation of his face as to be able to give any opinion, as to whether he is the man? A. I believe he is.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live in Ratcliff. I was at Stepney-fair on the 17th of April—I felt a tug at my pocket—I turned, and saw the prisoner quite close to me, handing over a sixpence wrapped up in a bit of newspaper, which had been in my pocket—I put my hand into my pocket, and missed the sixpence—I took hold of him, and accused him—a gentle<lb></lb>man came and took him to a policeman—the prisoner denied it—I know I had had it in my pocket not five minutes before—I had only just taken my hand out of my pocket.</p>

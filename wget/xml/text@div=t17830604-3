               <p>Court. You keep them as tame rabbits? - Yes, my Lord, they are.</p>

               <p>Court. What were the rabbits worth? - The young ones I sold for eleven-pence a piece, and the old ones were worth three or four shillings, there were eleven found alive in the fields, two days after they were lost.</p>
               <p>Court. How do you apprehend they came there? - I pursued them, I mistrusted them coming, and I set up, I had seen that there had been somebody over the pales at the rabbit house door, but it was locked, and I went to bed, at about four o'clock, I heard a noise of a bell, which I fixed round the rabbit-house door, and one bell into my room, and one into my son's, I got up, and my son thinking I called him, spoke louder than common, with that I suppose they run away, I pursued them to Kensington town, I sent my son to Oxford-road, I met a butcher, and desired him to tell me if he heard of any such things.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a butcher at Kensington, my boy told me, that the prosecutor had lost some rabbits; Harris lives about two miles from me, as I was going to town with my cart, between five and six I overtook another man first before; the prisoner and the other person had a basket on his back, and he set it down to rest, I stopped the cart, and looked at him very hard, it was in the open road, I saw some white sleek on it, and the prisoner was about two hundred yards off this man, seeing this sleek, gave me suspicion that they were the men that took the rabbits, and I went a little further on, they kept following me, and I got to Hyde Park Corner, they then were one on the one side the way, and the other on the other.</p>
               <p>Court. Had the prisoner any bag or basket, or any thing? - Yes, he had.</p>
               <p>Was you by yourself? - No, another person was with me.</p>
               <p>What had the prisoner in his bag? - He had a basket, I got out of the cart, seeing me get out they turned back again, I said nothing to them then.</p>
               <p>How near might they be to you when they turned back again? - About thirty yards.</p>
               <p>Both turned back at the same instant? - Yes, the prisoner went into a public house with his basket, and the other after him, there was a thorough-fare in the house, and the prisoner went through that way and got off, but left his basket at the public house.</p>
               <p>How do you know it was his basket, and not his companion's? - Both the baskets was there, the other party staid, but got off after, I went and spoke to him.</p>
               <p>Are you sure they were the same baskets? - I cannot say one from the other, I went in and said to the other man, Mr. Cordway how do you do, he asked me how I did, says I, what have you in this bag, says he, it does not belong to me, it belongs to the man that run out just now, I said they were rabbits, says he, I will shew you who they belong to, he made out of the door and ran away, and as he ran one of the rabbits tumbled out of his great coat pocket; I cannot say how many rabbits, I found in these baskets, there were more than a dozen, all alive, they were white and grey, and black and white, there were 17 to the best of my knowledge; I put the rabbits in the turnpike house, and sent for my horse, and went on to my business, and returned about nine o'clock.</p>

               <p>I had been as far as Mortlake, and at the corner of Brompton-row, I met this man with two baskets, he asked me to carry one of them as far as the turnpike, I said, I could not, says he, then carry it to the public house, and call for a pint of purl, I did so, I went in, and there was no fire, and I went about my business where I was going, I have witnesses to my character.</p>
               <p>Court. How came you to run away from the public house? - Because I called for a pint of purl, and there was no fire.</p>
               <p>Jury. Why did you leave the rabbits behind you? - I was ordered to leave them there, and he would return after me.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you a married or single man? - A single man.</p>
               <p>What business do you follow? - <rs id="t17830604-3-deflabel16" type="occupation">Butchering</rs>

               <p>Court. I have a great objection to a public whipping, unless a man has lost his character, it is taking away his bread for life; unless a man is quite abandoned I never give him a public whipping; let him be <rs id="t17830604-3-punish18" type="punishmentDescription">

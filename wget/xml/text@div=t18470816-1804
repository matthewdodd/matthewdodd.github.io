                  </hi> I live in High-street, Kensington, and am a hat and cap-maker—I have a shop at Notting-hill—the prisoner was in my ser<lb></lb>vice, and had the care of that shop—it was his duty to account to me daily, except on Saturday nights, for what sums he received there—I have not had 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of him for a cap sold to Lovell on the 5th of June, nor 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. paid by Foster on the 12th of June—on the 28th of June I went up to the shop, and said to him, "A cap has been sold"—he said he had sold a cap for 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was paid off it, which shilling he gave me—I said, "Let me look at the cap?"—he said, "It is sold and gone, the person is to pay a shilling a-week, she is a brick-maker's wife, who works in the field opposite"—I found he had received one shilling first, and on the 28th he had received the other two shillings—he did not account for the first shilling till the whole was paid.</p>

I went into a little parlour and laid the bundle down on a table. Mr. Venables and an acquaintance of his were sitting at the other side of a round table, drinking; they went out, and in about two or three minutes after I missed the bundle.</p>
               <p>Was you sitting at the table where your bundle was? - No; at another table where the prisoner was; when they went out they went by the table where the bundle was, there was not any one in the room but the prisoner, the other man, and I; upon missing the bundle, the landlord and I went out in pursuit of the prisoner and the other man; I was out about an hour and an half, looking into every public-house for them; when I returned, I ran through the bar into the back<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178002230082"></xptr>room and saw my bundle lying on the table. I said, it is no matter my bundle is come back.</p>
               <p>Was it lying on the same table? - No; on the little table by the back window.</p>
               <p>Who was in the parlour when you went back again? - No one, to the best of my knowledge; I understood that the landlord had taken the prisoner, and carried him to the watch-house.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of this bundle which was lost at your house? - Yes. Mr. Stevenson came in with a bundle and laid it down on the table in the back parlour. He sat down in company with the prisoner and another man who was with him; the prisoner and the other man went out; Stevenson missed his bundle. He said to me Mather do you know any thing of my bundle? I said, there had been none in the room but the prisoner, and the other man. I went out after the prisoner, and took him in Holborn with the bundle. I brought him back to the house, and delivered him to a constable; before the justice he said he kicked the bundle before him in the passage.</p>
               <p>You are sure you found the bundle upon him? - Yes; he had it in his left hand, the other man was with him; he said he did not know that he had the bundle till I took hold of it.</p>
               <p>(The coat and handkerchief were produced in court.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This coat is my property; I am sure it was made on my shop-board.</p>
               <p>Is the handkerchief your's? - I bought it.</p>

               <p>Is that the bundle you laid on the table in Mather's house? - This is the bundle.</p>
               <p>PRISONER DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>Though I am before a court of judicature, I hope I have a jury which will look in an impartial manner on every thing; I went into the publick-house to have a pint of beer; meeting with some agreeable company, especially the prosecutor, I stayed the whole evening. I then was going away; a man who was there asked me where I was going. I went out with him; as I was going along he asked me to hold the bundle while he made water; as I was holding it, the publican came up, and the other man ran away.</p>
               <p>To Mather . Did they both come in together? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When you took the prisoner, did the other man run away? - No; he came back to see what was the matter.</p>
               <p>To the prosecutor. Did the prisoner appear to be drunk or sober when he was in the house? - He might be intoxicated, I cannot pretend to say.</p>
               <p>To Mather. Did he appear to be drunk or sober? - He could not be sober; he had been there four or five hours.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five witnesses who gave him a good character</p>

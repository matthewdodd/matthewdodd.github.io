                  </hi>. I am a jeweller, of 5, Balham Terrace—on Saturday night, 24th January, I went to bed at 11.30, leaving the windows and doors fastened—I was disturbed by a noise about 3.30, went down into the parlour behind the shop and found the window open sufficiently to allow a man to get in; a pane of glass had been taken out and the window fasten<lb></lb>ing undone—the door communicating with the shop was open—I missed from the shop six watches, between two and three dozen rings, a dozen sets of studs, and other articles—I have never received any of them, but I have since seen one stud—a policeman who had alarmed us was waiting outside—I have never seen the prisoners before—I found these things (<hi rend="italic">a crowbar and a stick</hi>) left in the shop.</p>

On Sunday morning, 25th January, about 1.30, I was in Crescent Lane, Clapham, and heard footsteps quickly behind me; I turned round and saw the two prisoners—I had known Scannell previously—I detained them just while I searched them, they had nothing—they went on towards the prosecutors house—at about 2.45 I was in Balham Road with Sergeant Le Co cq, and heard a noise at the rear of Mr. Norman's house—it was not very dark—when we got to the rear we saw three persons getting up on to the wall as if coming away from the house—they were about three yards from me—I turned my bull's eye on and saw the two prisoners and Woodward, who has been arrested and taken before the Magistrate and committed for trial next Session—I said "You scoundrels, is this where you are now?"—they ran on the wall and I followed and gave a description of them to an officer who arrested them.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Sergeant W</hi>). I was with the last witness and took Buckley—I told him he was charged with breaking into a jeweller's shop in Balham Road—he said "Which one?"—I said "The one where you were looking round the corner just now and saw me"—I was at the rear of the house and saw them both peeping round the corner—I took him to the back of the house into a garden, took his boots off, and compared them with some impressions on the soil—the right foot corresponded, but the soil was soft, and I could not compare the left—there were the footmarks of three persons—T made an impression by the side of one with this boot, and was so satisfied that I afterwards placed the boot in it—I took him to the station, placed him with twenty-one or twenty-two other men who I selected as being dressed as nearly like the prisoner as possible—I then called in Halpin, and he picked out the prisoner.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Scannell's Defence.</hi> The sergeant said that if I told him where the <hi rend="italic">stuff</hi> was he would give me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and would get 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the master for me. I told him I knew nothing at all about it, and I mentioned two persons names who I was almost sure had done it, because I heard them say they were going to do it, and I saw them outside the shop at 1.30 on Sunday morning, and Buckley saw them as well. If the constable saw us close enough to recognise us, he was near enough to catch us.</p>

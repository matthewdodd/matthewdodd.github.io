On the 2d of January, between twelve and one, my landlord came and told me my door was broke open. I came home and found the prisoner in the custody of an officer. The things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them) were taken out of my box, and lay open on the bed. I left my box and room door both locked when I went out in the morning. I understood that the prisoner was taken in the room.</p>

               <p>The prosecutrix lodges in my house. On Saturday, between twelve and one o'clock, I went to the chandler's shop, about six or seven doors off, when I returned I heard somebody over my head, in the one-pair-of-stairs room; I thought it was very odd any body should be in the room, knowing the people were out. I went up and found the prisoner in the room, with the things in her apron. She emptied them in the room before my face. The room was broke open. I got assistance and secured her. I asked her how she came there, she said a person gave her sixpence to bring the things into the room.</p>
               <p>(The things were produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutrix.)</p>

I went up stairs; I saw the prisoner standing in the room, and asked how she came to do such a thing; she said a person gave her sixpence to bring the things into the room. I said I thought they were the woman's things that lodged in the room, because they had news-papers over them; they were lying on the bed. I sent to the Rotation-office, and an officer came and took charge of her.</p>

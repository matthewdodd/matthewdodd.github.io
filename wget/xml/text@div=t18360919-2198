                  </hi>. I am a policeman. About half-past four o'clock in the morning on the 27th of August, I was at the Islington turnpike<lb></lb>gate, watching—it was day-light—I saw the five prisoners come from George-yard—Jones and Bishop were riding in a donkey-cart, which Henry Cubbage was driving—James Cubbage and Manning were walking by the side of it—I followed them to the Peacock—they were talking together, as if in company—Henry Cubbage then got out of the cart—I followed them to the Blue-coat Boy, about 150 yards from George-yard—I stopped the cart there, and Jones jumped out and ran away—Bishop and Henry Cub<lb></lb>bage were taken out of the cart—James Cubbage was secured, and Manning ran away—he was brought back by Savory and Virtue—I went over to the station-house with the prisoners in custody—I had to pass George-yard in the way, and saw Jones there—he was secured, and taken to the station-house—I saw Knott, another constable, find three half-crowns in the cart, wrapped up in an old sack—they were given to the sergeant—the name of Henry Cubbage was painted on the cart—I knew him before.</p>

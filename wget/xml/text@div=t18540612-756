I went to what the prosecutor told me was the prisoner's lodging, at Wentworth-street, Spitalfields—I saw the landlady there, and received from her this bag with these things in it; they were in the back room on the ground floor—I went to the door, and the landlady fetched them out—here is a pair of boots, a pair of goloshes, a pair of drawers, four shirts, five fronts, a pair of stockings, a letter stamp, and a seal—I took the prisoner—he had this handkerchief round his neck—he was running down Dock-street, and the prosecutor after him, hallooing, "Stop thief!"—I could not understand what he said.</p>

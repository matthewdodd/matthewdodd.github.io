                  </hi>. I am a commercial traveller, and live at 123 Manor-street, Clapham—on the evening of 21st April I was directly oppo-site Fishmonger's-hall, while Garibaldi was there, I believe—the prisoner came up and asked me if I knew how long Garibaldi had been there—I told him that I was not aware that he was there at all, for I had not been standing there above two or three minutes—directly after he spoke to me I felt something at my pocket; I looked down, and saw the guard of my watch fall from the prisoner's hand—I had this kind of coat on, and the watch was attached in the manner it is now—I cannot remember whether my coat was unbuttoned or not; it was only the top button if it was buttoned at all—I felt directly in my pocket, and my watch was gone—the prisoner wheeled round to the right, and was joined by three or four others—I had not courage to take hold of him then, for I had a good <hi rend="italic">bit</hi> of money about me; I had been collecting that day—the prisoner and the others went about thirty yards towards the city; I watched them very particularly—the prisoner turned round, left the others, and came back about three parts of the way from where he started, and got into a cab—I then took hold of him, and accused him of taking my watch—he said, "I have not got it, "and he put his hand in his pocket and threw something out of the opposite door of the cab—I could not see what it was, but I have no doubt it was my watch—I heard it fall on the stones—the prisoner got away from me, and got out at the other side of the cab—I called "Stop thief," and he was stopped by the people on the other side; there was a crowd there—I did not lose sight of him—I saw him stopped and given into custody—my watch has not been found.</p>

On the evening of 21st February, I was on duty in Adelaide-place, facing Fishmonger's-hall—I saw the prisoner going hurriedly through the mob, and heard a cry of" Stop thief"—I stopped him; he was almost breathless, and quite exhausted—I heard some one hallo out, "That is the man; he stole my watch"—at that moment the prisoner took this watch from his pocket, and said, "Look here, police-man, in coming through the crowd they have endeavoured to steal my watch, you see the bow is broken;" he had this guard round his neck, it was not attached to the watch—I took the watch from his hand, and asked the prosecutor if that was his watch; he said, "No"—I asked him if he was quite positive the prisoner had taken his watch, and he said, "Yes, quite positive"—I took him to the station and charged him.</p>

                  </hi>. I manage the Eight Bells Public-house, at Greenwich, for my brother—In May lout I engaged the prisoner as barman—from certain suspicions that I had, on saturday 16th July, I called in a constable named Alvin—I marked two half-crowns and gave them to him to have them passed over the bar—that was about 7 o'clock—I afterwards looked in the till and found that they were there and subsequently I found that one was gone, one remained—about 11 o'clock when the business closed 1 called both the barmen into the bar—I told them I thought I was being robbed, and that I imagined the prisoner was the man that was robbing me—I then asked the prisoner if he had any objection to being searched—he said, "No," all he had in his possession belonged to him, and won what he had saved—we then went up stairs into his room, and in his box we found 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in small silver, rolled up in paper, and a silver watch—he had 34 or 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on his person, and amongst the money the constable discovered the half-crown that I had marked—I recognised it directly—I have not the least doubt it was the same—on the prisoner being taken before the Magistrate on the remand we searched his box again, and found another pound in silver wrapped up in paper, and 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. more in another piece of paper—we never allow a barman to give change from his own pocket, we always have sufficient money in the till—when I looked in and saw the half-crown I should imagine there was about 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of silver in the till—when the prisoner came into my service, he asked me to intercede and get his money weekly, which is very contrary in the trade—he said he was short of money he bad 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. advanced to him, and I afterwards let him have 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that was some weeks before the night in question—he was in my service altogether eleven weeks.</p>

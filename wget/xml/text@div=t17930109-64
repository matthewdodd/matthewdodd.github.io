On the 13th of December, I think Thursday, I will not be positive, I and my fellow servant, Carter, was going by the side of Fleet-market, he is a patrole the same as I am; I observed the two prisoners at the bar going by me, they were together, they passed us about a step or two; I observed the prisoner at the bar, Kinsman, to have something of a bundle in his hand; I directly turned back to him and said, Kinsman what have you got there? he told me he had got a gown and he was going to take it to his mother's; I asked him where he had brought it from? he told me from a young fellow in the market who was an apprentice in the market; I forgot his name now, and he was going to his mother, and he said afterwards, he was going to the apprentice's wife to to carry a pair of stockings, who lived just by Moorfields; I took him to the Compter directly on suspicion of its being stolen; I found besides in Kinsman's pocket a pair of coat sleeves, two sleeves; after I had taken them to the Compter I went to the mother, and I could not find the mother at home; from thence I went over to Moorfields to the place where he told me he was going to carry the stockings. The next day we had them before the Alderman; I did not advertise them till Saturday; Kinsman said first of all, that he had received them of Delforce; Delforce said nothing at all to that. On Sunday evening, according to advertisement, the prosecutor and prosecutrix came to my house, and brought a piece of the gown, and it matched. I have kept the things till now; they did not see the property till Monday.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you make any offer of compromise to the patroles? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Where the patroles present when you made it to other people? - They were; but they went away when we went to talk about the money, they said they must not then be seen.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the day the last witness speaks of? - It was the night before last; Mr. and Mrs. Hayman wanted three guineas; I conversed with them both on my oath.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they mention the sum or you? - They mentioned the sum, Mr. Hayman and Mrs. Hayman both together, at the time that the three guineas were mentioned; the night before last Mr. Oates was with us, we took him as a witness, there was present myself, the prosecutor, Mr. Hayman, Mrs. Kinsman and another man, I don't know his name, he lodges at the house, he was there every time we met; they went out two or three times this man that received the money and the prosecutor, and came back and said, they would not make it up without three guineas; Hayman went out and his lodger; we told them they must do as they would; we parted that night and we went back again and told them that we had made away with the things off our backs to make the guinea a piece, then the prosecutor said, you must go and make another half guinea; we had only got out at the door before we returned and told him we could make no more; and then he whispered to his wife, and called out to his wife to the door; the prosecutor came back and said, it must be half a guinea more for them, for the patroles would have a guinea, and he must have a guinea and a half, I said it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179301090098"></xptr>does not signify going away, they are fatherless children both of them; so he called his wife out of the room, we were in the room set down again, and they were out the value of ten minutes, and they went out, the prosecutor, his wife, and the man, to consult whether they would take the two guineas or not, then they came in again all three, and the wife set down and the man set down; I says to this gentleman, I hope, says I, you will have mercy, I will pay you the guinea, the same as the other woman, the man said, you must pay me the money, for he must not take the money, for it is felony compounding, or something of that sort, then sir, said I, there is mine, and the other woman got up, and said, there is mine, and we came away.</p>
               <p>Court to Hayman. Did you take any money at all? - I took no money at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you sware that no money was offered to you directly or indirectly? Did you or did you not refuse the money? - I never received any money.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not true what these people have all sworn concerning taking the money? - I never employed any person to take the money for me.</p>
               <p>Q. On what account was this money paid? - I did not consent it should be paid to me, I know nothing of the man being in the passage; I have no such man lodger in my house, I went into the passage with a man, but I did not go into the passage with a lodger.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you and your wife go into the passage or not? - We did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you swear that no man went out of the room with you and your wife. - There were three went out of the room into the passage. The man is not here at present, but he is not a lodger of mine.</p>
               <p>Q Now what did you three go out for? - To consult about business of our own.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that after all these people have sworn that you went out of the room and that you had no conversation about the compromise? Will you swear that when you went out with your wife and that man, you did not go out and talk about this business? - No, I don't know that any thing passed about this business.</p>
               <p>Q. The money was mentioned. Do you deny that what these people say is true? - I deny that.</p>
               <p>Q. You still insist on it that the man that received that money did not receive it for making up the felony? - I am sure I don't know what money was left in that man's hands. They offered me money to soften the affair and not to bring the indictment on capitally; for to soften the matter as much as I could.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that money offered to you for that? - They said they would make me any satisfaction I required; I told them I required no satisfaction at all.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the money paid for? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever received it? - No.</p>

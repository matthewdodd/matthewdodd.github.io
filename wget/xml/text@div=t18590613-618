                  </hi>. I am a warehouseman, and live in St. Helen's-place—on Saturday evening, 21st May, I was in St. Mary Axe, between 10 and 11 o'clock, on my road home—the prisoner Bartrum came up and spoke to me; she said she thought she knew me, and had seen me before—I told her she was mistaken—she continued talking to me, and said she knew some<lb></lb>body very much like me—she followed me to near Great St. Helen's—it was there a narrow part, and I did not like to go through that part with her—while we were there the constable passed, and he had hardly got out of sight when she made a <hi rend="italic">grab</hi> at my watch—I seized her hand with the watch in it—she made a <hi rend="italic">hem,</hi> and immediately I was seized by another man, not the prisoner Macklin—he got his knee in my back and tried to get me down, and used very vile language—I called the police, and another woman came and held my wrist back, and Bartrum got the watch off the swivel and ran away—the man who had hold of me tried to stop my mouth—I struck him and he let me go—I lost Bartrum, and Macklin was standing by—Bartrum ran by him, and apparently put something in his hand, and he put his hand in his pocket—the policeman came and took Bartrum and I seized Macklin, and said I thought he had got my watch—he said directly, "That woman is my wife"—the other two that had had hold of me came up, and one seized Bartrum's arm and pulled her away from the policeman—she ran towards the square, and there is no getting out there—I seized Macklin, and the policeman came and took him—Bartrum was taken by another person—I am sure the prisoners are the persons—when we got to the station they both said they had not seen me.</p>

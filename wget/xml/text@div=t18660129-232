                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Through an interpreter</hi>). I am a Frenchman—about 1st January I was steward on board an American ship, which came to the Victoria Dock—the male prisoner came to me and asked me if I wanted meat—the female prisoner asked if I wanted my clothes washed—I told them to come on board at 7 o'clock to fetch me away to go on shore with them—we all three dined together on board the ship—the next day, I went with the prisoner and his wife to the American Consul to receive some money—I received 54<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—there were about ten sovereigns, and the remainder in half-sovereigns—we dined together, and I paid for the dinner, as well as for a bottle of wine—after dinner we went for a walk, and the prisoner, his wife, and I went to a pawnbroker's to fetch a watch of the male prisoner's, which he had taken there—I redeemed it for him, having bought the ticket of it—I also bought a chain, but not from him—I cannot recollect whether I went to his house or not that night—he took me to a house where I am still lodging—the next morning we went out for a walk and called at several public-houses, and drank together—I have since been told by the landlord that I had my purse all right in the evening—the next morning when I awoke I had only 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. remaining—my watch and chain, which were taken from me, were afterwards returned—I cannot recollect very well who took me to the lodging—I believe it was the female prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Alfred Mills, who keeps the Lion beer-house, Victoria Dock-road—I remember John Cotton coming to my house and asking me if I would undertake to let three gentlemen have what they might require, also to sleep till the steward got his money, which might be a day or two—I said I would—all three of them slept that night, Monday, in a double-bedded room—the prosecutor and two shipmates—on the Thursday evening following, the prosecutor was brought home the worse for liquor by John Cotton, who had said he would see my bill paid—the prosecutor took out the money and paid my bill, which was 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I did not see what money there was in his hand—they then sat down together, and the prosecutor fell asleep with his head on the table—Cotton drew up his chair to the side of the table, and put his hand into the Frenchman's pocket—I said, "What are you doing there? I won't allow that in my house"—"Well, "he said, "You've got your money; he owes me money, and I shall keep this watch till I get it"—he took the watch—I asked him to leave it with me, but he said, "I shan't; it's no business of yours; you've got your money"—he did not say what the amount was which he had lent him—my husband came in, and said, "I must have my house closed; this gentleman must go to bed; I won't have him here"—Cotton said, "Oh, I think I can manage him best," and he took him up to bed, and as he always wanted something very early in the morning, my husband took him up a pint of beer, and put it in his bedroom—we all went to bed, and Cotton remained up in the bedroom with the prosecutor—during the night I heard some one knocking—my husband got up, and found it was the male prisoner, who wanted to go home—the next morning, the prosecutor came down to breakfast, and before he sat down asked about his watch—Mrs. Cotton brought it in—I afterwards saw John Cotton come into the house again to take the prosecutor out for a walk—they went out, and I did not see the prosecutor again until the evening (Friday)—he was then very much agitated, and made a complaint—I am not sure whether he was drunk or not.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a printer and stationer, of East Avenue—on 15th October, about 9 o'clock p.m, I was in Wilson Street, Finsbury—I went up a court, and the prisoner followed me and began hustling me about—I said, "Let me go," and a big fellow came up and took my watch—I said, "I am robbed, you thieves," and followed, crying, "Stop thief!" but no one helped me—I missed my watch and chain while the woman was hustling me—it was worth between 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What were you up that court for? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> For a natural purpose, and also to catch my train on the North London Railway—the woman was not with me half a minute—it was done momentarily—I wear glasses, but I can see very well through them—I missed my watch and chain the very instant that the woman caught hold of me.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How was the chain attached? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> With rather a small bar, and I generally had it unbuttoned, and by a small pull it would come out—it was a thin French watch, not thicker than a half-crown—there was a gas-light facing her in the court, and I saw her features.</p>

I took the prisoner on 18th October—she was asked at the station where she lived—she said, "I sleep at a coffee-house when I get money enough"—Mr. Shews identified her at the cells at Guildhall, where she was placed with four other women, and directly she came out of the cell he laid, "That is the woman."</p>

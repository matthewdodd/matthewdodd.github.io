                  </hi>. I am a corn-factor, and have an office in Bush-lane. I have a cottage at Finchley, which I was desirous of letting—the prisoner Norman called on me at my office, and represented herself by the name of Ann Streeton—she said she had seen my cottage, and wished to take it—we very shortly agreed about the terms, which were 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-year—she said she had lived at the New-forest, Southampton, for some considerable time, and that she would give me a reference to her late land<lb></lb>lord's brother, whom she had a house of there—that he was the best possible reference, as he knew how she had paid her rent, and she referred me to Mr. Hobbs, (the prisoner,) New Manor-street, Chelsea—we came to an agreement, and I wrote it out, stating the terms for three years, for which time she was to take the house—I wanted her to take it for five years, but she said it was impossible, she would not be tied to a house so long—she called for the agreement, and said she must have pos<lb></lb>session immediately, the following day or two, as her furniture was on its way from Southampton, and she must have the house to go to at once, which I agreed to—on the second day, when she called to sign the agree<lb></lb>ment, she asked if I had a wine-merchant, and I named my wine-mer<lb></lb>chants, Messrs. Gill &amp; Co. of Mark-lane—this was on Monday or Tues<lb></lb>day, I think on the Friday following I received information, and went down to my cottage on the Sunday morning—I found there the prisoners Norman, Grafton, and Foster—I asked Norman how she could account for her conduct—she said it was all over now, and there was no help for it—I found them nearly destitute—there was no furniture in the house—they had used the kitchen drawers for tables and chairs, and there was a dirty old bed on the floor, which was all I could see—they were taken on the Wednesday, by the policeman, to Edge ware, and I think from there to prison.</p>

An order was left at my house, when I was not at home, for a sack of coals, to be taken to Rose Cottage—I took the coals to the cottage—I saw Grafton and Foster—I had the coals in two sacks—I shot one down in the little passage, and the other I left in the sack, in the scullery, according to their request—I received an order for grapes, apples, greens, and such things, from Grafton and Foster—they were acting as servants in the house, to the best of my knowledge—I delivered goods to the amount of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.-both Grafton and Foster said I was to take my bill on the Monday, and I should be paid on the Tuesday following, at nine o'clock—I went upon the Sunday afternoon, like the rest of the sufferers, the tradespeople of Finchley—I cannot say how many there were—I believe I heard Foster say, it served us right for not going on the Friday night.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Crown and Anchor, Great Garden-street, Whitechapel, On Tuesday evening, the 6th of May, the prisoner came to my bar—I knew him—he had a quartern of gin with a stone-mason who he brought in with him, they then went into the parlour and sat down—the deceased came in about half an hour after, and soon after he drew the attention of the prisoner away from the stone-mason, as they met on business—I did not hear what passed—when the prisoner came out of the parlour Cobet came out after him, and Cobet said "You recollect, Mr. Zabell, I lent you a sovereign."—Zabell said, "You lend me a sovereign!"—Cobet turned round and said to me, "You hear this Mr. Hough"—I said, "Yes, I do"—Cobet walked into the parlour and fetched out a butcher named Taylor, and said, "Now speak as a man: did you see me lend this man any money"—Taylor said, I did"—he said, "What did I lend him"—he said, "A sovereign"—Za<lb></lb>bell put his hand into his pocket, pulled out a lot of notes and gold and said, "You see I did not want to borrow a sovereign, I have plenty of money of my own"—he put his hand into his pocket, pulled out 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., threw it on the counter and said to Cobet, "There is your money"—Cobet said, "I lent you a sovereign, I will not take 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it, I am a poor man, I want my money"—neither of them would take up the money—(I took up the money and placed it in a glass after they left my bar)—Zabell went to the door and said, "If you will come out I will knock your nose as flat, as your a—s"—Cobet said, "I have no wish to fight, I know myself better"—Zabell went out and Cobet followed him, I thought to reason with him—I got on a chair in the bar, looked out of the window, and saw Zabell strike him on the chest—I could see that Cobet did not strike him first or at all—he pushed him away after being struck on the chest—Zabell then struck him on the eye, and a third blow on the cheek—Cobet then went right backward senseless on the ground—Newlan picked him up—I saw the back of his head all over blood—they brought him in doors—I saw he was insensible, and advised them to take him to the hospital—he was taken there—Zabell came in—I told him he had done wrong and had better go to the hospital and attend to him—I went there in about ten minutes and found Zabell there paying all the attention he could to him—he</p>

                  </hi>. I deal in grocery—I was at the public-house—Cobet and the prisoner were wrangling about a sovereign, and on going out of the door I heard Cobet say, "What do you want of me?" soon as they got out, Zabell sparred up to Cobet and made a blow—Zabell sparred up again and gave him a blow just over the mouth (Cobet caught the first blow on his arm)—Cobet instantly fell backward with his head on the ground—I immediately ran and lifted his bead from the pavement, and there was a pool of blood—he was insensible, and was carried into the house, and then to the hospital—hit bead was dressed there, and he came to his senses—I accompanied him home in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I saw him again on Wednesday morning, he was very bad, and again onf Thursday afternoon, he was then dead.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were you drunk or sober? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Quite sober—I saw the beginning of it outside—he fell nearly towards the wall on his left side, not the right—his head "contracted" to the pavement, towards the wall—the blow on the mouth would not knock a sober man down—he was much taller than the prisoner and about eight years younger.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single—I am the sister of Mary Whittaker Greene—I was present on 2nd February, 1848, when she was married to the prisoner—on 5th August, after it was discovered that he had been married before, I accused him of it, and he said his first wife had been kinder to him than my sister—my sister is about thirty-eight years old—I received this letter from him on 6th August—I know his writing, and believe it to be his—(<hi rend="italic">This letter being principally in French, was translated by Mr. Clerk the bar<lb></lb>rister as follows: Addressed, Miss E. Green.</hi> "Monday evening.—Made<lb></lb>moiselle,—I have prayed you almost on my knees to permit me to see for one instant my dear companion that God has given me, my wife, in your pre<lb></lb>sence. You have not had the heart to grant me this last favour. I swear before God that there exists no mortal being who dared to prevent me. You have not chosen that this should be done under the cloak of discretion, that all the blame should fall on you. To the insults which I have received from a member of the family I attach no importance at all. I regret that innocent persons have had to suffer for your obstinacy. I understand that it was easy to frighten a child with a policeman, but not me. Hide yourself—hide your sister, my cherished wife, if it appears good to you, but nothing in the world will prevent me from reclaiming her from you—it signifies not where you may go, even to Australia. You would not act so while you inhabited the house of that noble old man who is no longer in this world; and when you write to me that I wish my marriage to be kept secret, and let your sister disclose it to her family when she thinks proper; and when you pray me not to come to Richmond, that it would be only injuring you; and if the Colone✗) knew any<lb></lb>thing the consequences for you would be dreadful. I have not those letters, and what I heard of this morning at Richmond I dare not repeat. Bring me before any court of justices if you please, you will not spare the money, you will not find a jury to acquit you. I have friends who will protect me, but I promise you the public will have an historical romance to write which will not be a little interesting. There remains but little time for you to reflect before taking your part—reflect well. I insist once more to see my wife; refuse me if you dare.—I have the honour to be, &amp;c")</p>

               <p>mother, Sophia, older than her—I do not recollect whether Mary was thirty-eight or thirty-nine when she was married—I was living at Richmond at the time with Colonel Rose, as his daughter—both my sisters are on the continent, Sophia is at Boulogne, where she has resided many years—I cannot say exactly where Mary is; she left Dover the week before last—Mary lived at Paris before this marriage, and came to London on purpose to be married—I was sent for from Richmond, and acted as bridesmaid—I had only received an intimation from my sister that she was going to be married four days before—I never saw the prisoner before half an hour before the ceremony; they left immediately after, and I went back to Richmond—I first heard that he had a wife living, in July or Aug., 1849, from my sister Mary—Colonel Rose died last Nov.—he left me Borne money; he did not leave my sister any—the attorney, Mr. Routh, who is conducting this prosecution, is my brother-in-law.</p>

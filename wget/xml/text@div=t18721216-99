                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, and live in Hinton Street, Camberwell—on the night of 8th December, about 12.30, I was walking quick down the London Road to the Elephant and Castle; just as I got near Garden Row there were three or four men standing on the pavement; as I tried to pass on the houses side of them one of them laid hold of my great coat, which was unbuttoned, the under coat was buttoned with one button, at the top; it was pulled open by the force of the pull, and the prisoner snatched at my watch chain—he was in front of me, the others were on my left side—my guard broke, and the prisoner went off with my watch—I pursued him round the corner of Garden Row, where I saw a constable, and told him—we chased him through Garden Row, across St. George's Road, and I saw him brought back by a policeman—I had only lost sight of him just as he rounded the corner of West Square, and that was not for more than half-a-minute at most—I am positive he is the man—I never recovered my watch.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It was not more than two minutes from the time it happened till the constable had him—I don't know what became of the others, they all ran away—nothing happened to me except losing my watch.</p>

On this night, at 12.20, I was on duty at the corner of Garden Row, London Road—I saw the prisoner run round the corner, out of London Road, and a moment afterwards the prosecutor came up, and said" That man has robbed me of my watch"—we ran after him into West Square, and as we turned the corner another constable had him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I first saw him running in the London Road—there were a great number of people passing—after the prosecutor spoke to me I ran after the prisoner and shouted "Stop thief!"—I saw persons running behind him, not in front.</p>

I was in West Square—I heard the cry of "Stop thief!" and saw the prisoner coming down West Street, leading into the square—there was no one before him—I caught him by the arm; he got away from me—I chased him into the square, and there caught him—he said he was in pursuit of the thief, the man who stole the watch—I did not at that time know the charge—as I was taking him back I met the others—he was out of breath from running.</p>

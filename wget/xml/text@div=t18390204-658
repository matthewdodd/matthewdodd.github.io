                  </hi>. I am groom to Samuel Pearce, surgeon, of Bethnal-green-road. On the 9th of January his chaise was standing at the stable gate, at the back of the house—I was told of something and missed my cloak and coat from the chaise—I had seen them safe not two minutes, before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am going on for 11 years of age—my father lives in Thomson-street, Bethnal-green-road. On the afternoon of the 9th of January, I was standing at my father's door, and saw the prisoner run by with a cloak and coat across his arm—I knew they were Mr. Drake's, and told my father—the prisoner went down into Manchester-street, and into a court opposite our gateway—I knew him before well, by his selling things about the streets often—he had on a white flannel jacket, a straw hat, and a blue apron—I saw him come out of his house about half an hour afterwards with a ragged jacket on, and his arm in a sling—he had, nothing with him then.</p>

I received information and ascertained the description of the prisoner—I went to his residence in the evening about six o'clock—I found him sitting by the fire—I said, "Isaac, I want you"—he said, "What is amiss?"—I said, "A cloak and coat were taken from Mr. Pearce's, you must go £o the station-house and state what you know about it"—he said he knew nothing about them—I did not search him, because I knew where the property went, and I did not expect to find it there.</p>

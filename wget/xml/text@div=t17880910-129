             sworn.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. You are a constable? - I belong to the Rotation-office in Litchfield-street.</p>
               <p>Do you know the prisoner? - I have known the prisoner between six and seven years; on Wednesday the 3d of September I saw him in the Wheatsheaf public-house in Smithfield; I had been in Bartholomew-fair; coming along, I saw some suspicious people at the door, and just in the passage I saw the prisoner; he had just put a glass out of his hand; the woman says to him, this is a bad sixpence; her name is Mrs. Cotterell, the landlady of the house; the prisoner took the sixpence from the landlady, and turned round as it were to look at it; and immediately as he turned round I took it out of his hand; I am sure it is the same sixpence; I have had it ever since; I got him into the parlour, we scuffled for about twenty minutes; I threw him down across some chairs, and two sixpences sell from his hand, which I picked up and put into my mouth; he wanted to get away; I caught hold of him, as well as I could, in my other hand, and in the struggle something fell down; I thought there was money in his mouth; I called to the people to pick up what money fell; a man picked up a shilling and two sixpences, which he gave to me; I kept them; (produced) after that, two of the city officers came to my assistance, and we took him to the Compter; he was searched in the Compter; there were ten shillings, and some halfpence found on him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Agur. Mr. Beamish, my learned friend has called you a constable, that was his soft expression, but you are a thief-taker? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You happened to be in luck that morning? - I do not know much about that, not much luck there.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, do not you know there is a reward? - Upon my oath, I know it is no such thing, and so does the Court know it.</p>
               <p>There is a reward of forty pounds, and if the sheriff does not give it immediately on application, it is increased to eighty pounds: why you are not in general ignorant of these cases, in which you have a prize? - There is none there, to my knowledge, but if there is any, I shall be very happy to have it.</p>
               <p>How long have you been a thief-taker? - Nine years.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178809100150"></xptr>How came you to say, that as soon as you saw this man, you suspected something? - I will explain it if you wish it, because, a few years back I knew he was apprehended.</p>
               <p>You knew he had been convicted? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And having been once convicted, you knew he was a good prize? - I did not know it, nor neither do I know it now; I shall have no objection to know it now, if you please.</p>
               <p>You did not see the prisoner give that sixpence to the landlady? - No.</p>
               <p>The fact is, that in your presence this prisoner tendered no money to any body whatever? - No.</p>
               <p>You never heard of such a thing, as a shilling and a sixpence, by a dexterous thief-taker, being dropped as if it came from a prisoner? - I never heard of any such thing; I have attended this court nine years, and I believe my character has never been impeached.</p>
               <p>What did you understand by suspicious people? - By what I could learn, they were utterers of bad money; they made their escape.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the other man you speak of near Mrs. Cotterell at the time she gave the sixpence to the prisoner? - No, he was not.</p>

               <p>My husband keeps the Wheatsheaf; his name is Richard; I remember a man coming to me, on the 3d of September; he did not ask for any thing at first; Beamish came in after; there was a man standing at the bar; he lent me sixpence first of all.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. You know you are sworn to tell the whole truth? - Yes.</p>
               <p>If you conceal any part of the truth, or do not tell the whole, you are as much perjured as if you misrepresented; your oath is to speak the truth, the whole truth.</p>
               <p>Mr. Agur. And nothing but the truth? - I was giving change at the bar to two different people; not to this prisoner; and I wanted to borrow sixpence; the good man, the prisoner, said, I can lend you one, Mrs. Cotterell.</p>
               <p>Look at the prisoner? - To the best of my knowledge that was the man; he gave me a sixpence; it was a very bad one; and I returned it; he had not had any liquor at that time; about ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour after, he had a penny glass of gin; then the constable took him.</p>
               <p>Now upon your oath, because it may be serious by and by; did he offer you any thing to pay for the liquor? - He gave me a penny for the gin.</p>
               <p>Now, madam, he did not tender you any other money? - No, sir, not afterwards.</p>
               <p>Did he at any time? - He gave me a sixpence first of all into my hand, that was to lend me; the officer has it; he laid hold of him in about a minute.</p>
               <p>Did you say a word about lending before the alderman? - No, he only asked me whether it was the same sixpence; I never saw the prisoner before, nor he never tendered me any bad money; he lent me the sixpence; to the best of my knowledge that is the same sixpence; he had no glass in his hand, when I returned him the sixpence; not before the scuffle in the parlour; he had only one glass of me, and that was after the scuffle.</p>

               <p>How long have you known Mr. Dring? - Two or three years back.</p>
               <p>Did you know him in 1784? - No, I had no more acquaintance with him than another neighbour; I know his wife and daughter; he has two daughters and a son.</p>
               <p>Where are the daughters, upon your oath? - Somewhere about this place; I dare say, in the yard.</p>
               <p>Are they within the walls? - They are within the walls here.</p>
               <p>Mr. Agur. Do you mean to say, that they are in gaol? - No, they are here, by the door.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Take care what you say; do you mean to say, that you know the daughters, and that they are neither of them under confinement? - No, they are not; they are both at the door; I never saw Beamish before that time; I have seen him since at this place; I had no conversation with him; I attended before the alderman when Mr. Dring was examined; and the Jew tried to push me out, and he could not; and Beamish helped him, and did push me out, because I should not tell the truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178809100152"></xptr>Now you mean to swear, that you never had any conversation with Beamish? - No, never in my life.</p>
               <p>Then it is not true, that you offered him two guineas to get the bill thrown out? - No, I never did in my life, no never in my life.</p>
               <p>What is the name of your landlord? - I am sure I cannot tell; it is next to the barber's; it is a room with my own furniture; I have known the prisoner three or four years; I never heard any other but a good character; an industrious honest man; and great business in his shop.</p>
               <p>Jury. Had the prisoner any good money in his pocket at the time the bad money was taken from him? - None but two pennyworth of halfpence with that bad silver, and three halfpence farthing in another pocket.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had seven shillings in my watch-pocket.</p>
               <p>Court to Roberts. Had he any other silver about him than that which you found? - None.</p>
               <p>Mr. Agur. Did you feel in his watch pocket? - I felt on the outside; I did not put my hand in.</p>
               <p>There might be silver then in his watch-pocket? - I felt none.</p>

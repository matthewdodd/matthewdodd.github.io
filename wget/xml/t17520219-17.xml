               <p>Richardson. I have many a time. (He is show'd<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175202190010"></xptr> a paper ) I wrote the body of this, and Captain

               <p>Q. from the Prisoner Agnue. Did you ever hear the Captain talk of me?</p>
               <p>Richardson. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you ever seen him write?</p>
               <p>Steward. I once saw him write a letter in my lodgings, at my table, and afterwards he gave it to me, and I read it; his name was to it, I know his hand writing as well as I know my own.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he die?</p>
               <p>Steward. He died on the 1st of May. (He is shew'd several papers.) Two of these are my hand writing : the note mentioned in the indictment is not my writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the name to that his hand writing?</p>
               <p>Steward. It is not at all like his; here is not a letter in it like his writing; I used to be extreamly intimate with the captain for many years.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever heard him speak of the Prisoner,

I dont believe any part of this is the Captain's hand writing: I dont think, had the Captain endeavour'd to have wrote like this, he could have done it.

               <p>Q. Did he talk of being related that first time?</p>
               <p>Casterd. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever heard of him before?</p>
               <p>Casterd. No, Sir.</p>

               <p>Casterd. No, my Lord, as he had not told me his name nor his business, I did not speak to my master about him.</p>

            ; he granted a warrant; then I took Mr. Welch and Mr. Mackenzey with me to the Rose Tavern ; we had not been there long before the three prisoners and Mr. Saunders came in, this was on the 4th of January. I first produced the note to Mr. Saunders, and asked him whether that was the note he gave me, and whether

             whether Capt. Agnue gave him that note, and whether he had given value for it? he said, yes, and made some protestation, what it was I can't exactly recollect, was it the last day he had to live, or something like it; he said the money paid by him, to Capt. Agnue, was 24 guineas, in order to carry on a law suit.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you understand by that?</p>
               <p>Dagg. I understood him that he had deposited it in the Captain's hand, in order to pay the expence of a law suit which was coming on. Then I examin'd Fox, he told me he was a Surgeon in Cornhill, at the sign of the Wheat-Sheaf, and that on the 3d of February he was drinking with

             advance to Capt. Agnue 24 guineas, and saw Capt. Agnue sign the note which I had produced. I then examined Gale; he said very little but this, I can swear the same to every thing that Mr. Fox has said; he said also he was a Broker, and liv'd behind Guy's Hospital.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you shew them the note?</p>
               <p>Dagg I think Fox took it out of my hand as I held it ; I shew'd Gale the note, he looking upon it said, he saw it signed by Capt. Agnue. I kept the note, and charged Mr. Welch with the three prisoners. I was with them before the Justice of Peace, they were examined separately; they agreed in this, that they were all three at the Lebeck's Head with Capt. Agnue when he signed the note and received the money; that they were drinking a pint of hot red wine; I knowing he had not drank red wine for some time before he died, I asked whether he drank one or two glasses, they could not tell; they all gave a different account of their coming there; one said Capt. Agnue and they came together; another said they met him as they were going in, and another said they came separate.</p>
               <p>Q. to Colonel Steward. Had Capt. Agnue us'd to drink red wine lately?</p>
               <p>Col. Steward. He drank no red wine for a year and half before he died.</p>
               <p>Q. from Gale. Did not I say, I did not know Capt. Agnue?</p>
               <p>Dagg. He did, before the Justice; but he had owned before he had seen Capt. Agnue sign it. I wanted him to be an evidence; he said, if I would put him on the back of the bill, he would do what service he could; said I, can you prove the forgery? he said he could not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Webb. I am the High Constable of Holborn division: I was at the Rose Tavern : I can only say what Mr. Dagg has said, which I know to be truth. Fox, as a confirmation, said, the piece of paper, on which the note was wrote, was taken out of his pocket-book, but there was no pocket-book produced.</p>
               <p>Mr. Mackenzey. What Mr. Dagg has said is the truth of the case. Fox said he knew the Captain very well, for he was the son of Sir

             said he had been the first man that had sent an account into Scotland of the Captain's death to his friends, and had been of very great service to the family; this he said to satisfy us that he knew him.</p>
               <p>Agnue's defence.</p>
               <p>I went to Capt. Agnue, when he return'd from Gibraltar, to one Mr. Syms's to pay my respects to him, we being acquainted. I told him what the Duke of Cumberland had proposed to do for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175202190013"></xptr> me in the last rebellion, and told the Captain I did not know which way to get a petition given to him : he said he would give none, nor carry any to him : I asked him, if he knew any friend that would? he said, if I would get one drawn up, he would find a friend who would: I got a petition drawn, and gave it him, and I gave him twenty-four guineas to carry on a law-suit for me, thinking he being a gentleman, would prevail on an attorney better than I: and

            , an attorney, had got my money, and had kept it two years, and I wanted him to help me to another: I offered him my papers to look at; he told me he never employed any attorney in London: said I, if you don't know of one, will you preserve this money for me; he said he'd do me all the favour possible : I gave him it: he said, I'll give you a memorandum: said I, if it was for a thousand pounds, I am sure of it; there was a young gentleman with him said, yes, you shall have a memorandum: he called for a pen and ink and gave it to the gentleman, I never minded it more till he handed me the paper.</p>
               <p>Fox's defence.</p>
               <p>As Mr. Gale and I were coming from Chairing-Cross, Mr. Agnue called me in at the Lebeck's Head, where I saw the gentleman whom they called Captain ; they were busy in talking together; he asked about money, whether it was giving or receving, I cannot tell, it was not my business; I saw some money deposited on the table, how much, or the use of it, I cannot tell. I can say no more, I may as well be hang'd for nothing.</p>
               <p>Gale's defence.</p>
               <p>There was some money on the table, but for what I can't tell; afterwards he said there were twenty-four guineas; it was something about a law-suit; I am pretty old and my memory fails me; I never saw the Captain before in my life.</p>

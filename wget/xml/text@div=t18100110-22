               <p>Q. What became of your companions at that time. - A. I left them in the house; when I got outside of the house, they laid hold of me, and said, they would lodge me in the watchhouse; I forceably got out of their arms, and stood there about a minute about two yards from the door, to see what they were going to do with me; Britain came up and gave me a blow, knocked me down.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Solomons then. - A. Solomons stood close by, I arose, they both hustled round me, and then I felt one of their hands go into my waistcoat pocket; I then missed the dollar, and the three shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they left you then. - A. Yes; I missed it directly they were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. They had not demanded any money of you. - A. No; they went into the public-house again, and I directly went to the Police-office.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not go into the public-house again. - A. No; I directly went to the Police-office.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were in the house, and suspected that their intention was to rob you, why did not you desire your companions to come out. - A. The lights were out and I could not see where they were.</p>
               <p>Q. They could have heard you. - A. Yes; they could, but I did not mention it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any other company there. - A. About seven besides.</p>
               <p>Q. You mentioned nothing to any of them. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the prisoners dressed, as soldiers. - A. No; neither of them were dressed as soldiers.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the rest of the company say any thing when the lights were put out. - A. They all cried out it was a shame.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not communicate your suspicion to any of these. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor even when you was knocked down, you did not go into the house to alarm the company of what had happened. - A. No; I went to the Police-office, and got assistance; I went back to the public-house, and found them there; the prisoners were searched, and there was three shillings found between the two.</p>
               <p>Q. No dollar was found. - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. If any body would say that you asked for a shilling to pay for your liquor at that house, that is not true. - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. So then, these two men followed you out of the house after they had put the lights out, knocked you down and robbed you, and went into the house again; you have heard of persons having forty pounds reward for a highway robbery. - A. I have heard of officers having forty pounds reward to apprehend thieves; I never heard of persons having forty pounds, that I swear.</p>

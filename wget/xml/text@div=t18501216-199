                  </hi>. I am a barrister, of Oxford-terrace—the prisoner was my cook for about three weeks before this happened. On 4th Dec. I had a piece of beef—I saw it on the table at dinner-time—on that night the prisoner was brought to my house in custody—a parcel was shown to me containing some onions, beef, and other things—I had such things in my house—I saw the cloth in which they were wrapped; it had my name on it—the prisoner had stated herself to be a widow.</p>

I was on duty in Oxford-terrace, at half-past eight o'clock in the evening—the prisoner came out of Mr. Westoby's with something under her cloak—I asked her what she had got—she said she had got nothing—I told her I was a police—man, and would see what she had (I was in plain clothes)—she said she had a few bones for the dog—I asked her where she had taken them from—she said from No. 46—I told her to come back with me—she then asked me to have a glass of brandy—I said, "No"—she then said if I would not take her back she would give me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for she was a married woman, and it would be the ruin of her—she refused to go back, I was forced to get the assistance of another policeman—we took her back to the house—her mistress came down to the hall: the prisoner said to her, "It is the first time; I hope you will forgive me."</p>

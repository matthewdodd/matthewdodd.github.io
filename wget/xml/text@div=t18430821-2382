I was coming up from the cellar, and saw the prisoner—Wheeler gave me a shilling, which she took from the prisoner—she said it was a bad one—I tried it with my teeth, and asked the prisoner where she lived, and some other questions—she did not satisfy me—I went to the door and called a policeman—I asked him in the prisoner's presence if he knew anything of her as a passer of bad coin—he said he did not—I took her by the arm, led her to the door, and told her not to show her face there—I kept the shilling apart from all other money—I gave it to Driscoll.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at No. 6, Queen-street, Walworth. I have been in the employ of Mr. William Quennell, a builder, in Lower Kenning<lb></lb>ton-lane—I was in his employ on Thursday, the 27th of Nov.—I had been in his employ before, and came again that morning at nine o'clock—I had been away about nine or ten days—I knew the deceased Daniel Fitzgerald—he worked in the employ of Mr. Quennell that day—I left work that day about five o'clock, a little under or over—that is the usual hour to leave work at that time of the year—when I left I came straight down Kennington-lane from the yard—the deceased was with me—we left the yard together—we crossed the high-road by Newington Butts, and turned into Peacock-street—I went four or five yards down that street, and then saw the prisoner coming towards me—I had known the prisoner, I believe, for six or seven weeks before—he had been in Mr. Quennell's employ—I left him at work there when I was off work for the nine or ten days—this Thursday was the first time I had returned to work there—I saw the prisoner coming towards me on the same side of the way—the street is not very broad—there is room enough for three or four per<lb></lb>sons, but there is no carriage-way at one end of it—we were at the narrow end—a carriage could not go through that end—I was walking at that end of it—that was the end at which we entered it, and we were still in that part when we met the prisoner—I saw him coming towards me, and as quick as anything ever was done, my sight was taken off all at once when he came close up to us—he came so near as that we could shake hands with one another—I had no idea of his doing anything—I saw him walking with his two hands down be<lb></lb>fore him, and my sight was taken away all at once by the flash of a pistol—nobody else was near at that time—I heard the report of the pistol at the same time I saw the flash—I thought it was through my own head at the time—as soon as I could get my eyesight I saw Fitzgerald, with his hand to his breast, going down, and he said, "I am a dead man"—the prisoner walked away at a fair walk towards the open street, to the road which we had just crossed—he did not turn and walk back, but passed us, and walked right ahead into New<lb></lb>ington Butts—I followed him—when he got into the road he turned off to the left—he kept at a sharp walk until I hallooed out after him, when I came into the open street, and then he made off—he went in a sharp manner of walking all the time till I hallooed out,"Stop him! the man is dead"—he then began to run—I heard nothing said to him at the time—several people ran after him, saying, "Stop thief!" and "Stop!" and so on—I saw him stopped—I then went to his brother William Quennell's house, and afterwards to the station—I</p>

On Thursday, the 27th of Nov., about five o'clock in the afternoon, I was in the neighbourhood of Peacock-street, about thirty or forty yards from the corner of Peacock-street—I turned down Lower Kennington-lane, which nearly faces Peacock-street—it is in an oblique direction—you can see it—I was at the corner of the lane, just at the junc<lb></lb>tion of the two roads—I had been walking along that side of the road, and when I got near the corner I heard an explosion of fire arms from behind me, which was in the direction of Peacock-street—I looked, and per<lb></lb>ceived a man running down Kennington-lane—he was followed by several others calling out to stop him—I stood on one side till the man who wai being pursued came up to me, and as he passed me I seized him by the collar—it was the prisoner—some of the others who were pursuing him came up, and one of them attempted to take him by the collar also—that was done rather roughly, and the prisoner said, "One is enough," or "That it enough," I do not exactly know which—he said, "Take me to the station-house"—I went with him to the station—I saw him searched—before he was searched, the officer asked him if he had any knife, or scissors, or pistol—he said no he had not—they were about to search him, when he put his hand in his right hand trowsers pocket and drew out a pistol—the inspector or a policeman seized his hand—I saw something in his hand, and the pistol wai taken from him—I noticed that it had been recently discharged—the cock was down and a portion of the exploded cap on it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was the observation you made of him three or four weeks before this happened? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I asked him and told him to do things, and he has an<lb></lb>swered me in a very indifferent sort of manner—I could not help noticing it, and my wife at the time made a remark—he used to answer me in a way he had not been in the habit of doing—when I asked him to do anythings or sent him anywhere, he would do it in a way as if he did not wish to do it—he used to answer very short, and looked very unpleasant about different things, quite different to what he was in the habit of doing—when I first took him to work he seemed to be very glad he had got work, and very willing to do anything I asked him—I bad not given him any cause for his change in conduct and behaviour to me—whenever I saw him do what I thought not right, I used to find fault, and desire him not to do it, and then be turned in a sort of surly way—ray wife observed bis manner towards me, and said "I don't know what is the matter with <hi rend="italic">Sam</hi>, but he don't seem to do things in a very pleasant way"—I have seen him sit down, and look very sorrowful, when I have passed him, but I did not take particular notice—I was not aware of any reason why he should look sorrowful—I have not made any other observations on his conduct to induce me to suppose him not like other men—I heard of his setting his bed he was sleeping on on fire—I think t heard of it after this happened, but it happened soon after he came from tea—my father was never placed under any restraint—he was taken care of at home—it was known in the family that he was subject to these attacks.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did it appear to you, from anything the prisoner said at the time your wife spoke to him about Fitzgerald, that he was harbouring or entertaining any feeling of resentment towards Fitzgerald? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I gave him no reason to suppose that my object, in recommending him to find employment elsewhere, had any reference to what Fitzgerald had said—I have sever seen him bum out into fits of extravagant passion without any apparent cause—I have only heard of it—it was about three or four weeks before this matter happen<lb></lb>ing that I first observed his conduct to change, and that change was in conse<lb></lb>quence of no reason—if I saw him doing what was not right I used to tell</p>

               <p>him of it—I do not think I ever stated that I thought his mind was going—I had no such idea before this happened.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is your own age? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Thirty-nine last 0—my father has been dead twenty years last Nov.—I left home, I think, four or five years before he died, when I was fourteen or fifteen years old—I was not apprenticed—I went to work where I could find it—I was at work at the West India Docks at the time of my father's death—he lived in Cumber<lb></lb>land-row, Wai worth-road—I cannot say how old I was when the observation occurred about the drawers—it was just before I left home—my father was ill at the time, and in bed—I do not know who was in the room besides me—I think the prisoner's mother was there, in and out—I believe she is still living—I do not know whether any medical man was attending my father at the time—I left home just about that time—after I left I was in the habit of going there about once in a month, or two months—my father was never taken from his house as insane, or anything of that kind—I never knew him to have I strait-waistcoat on, or any doctor to attend him, as insane—he was a builder—he carried on his business until the time of his death—he had a large job at Winchmore-hill, at Alderman Waithman's house—that was going on at the time of his death—he sometimes employed fifty men—he was attentive to his business, and managed it very well—my sister Sarah died better than twelve years ago—I do not think she was above eleven or twelve years old when she died—I cannot say how long before her death I heard her complain of her head—it might have been within a month—she very often came to our house—I then lived in Albion-place, Walworth-road, and she lived in Ken<lb></lb>nington-lane, with her mother—she used to come to see me down to the time of her death, sometimes two or three times a week, and very often on Sunday—she generally came alone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> With respect to the prisoner himself, did you ever see anything at all to induce you for a moment to believe him a person otherwise than of sound mind? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I always thought him sound up to three or four weeks before this happened—I thought his behaviour then was not like a man in his proper senses, as he had nothing to complain of—I believe I made that observation to my wife, but I will not swear anything—I should not like to do it—I do not swear positively that it was so, but I made a remark.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Before the death of Fitzgerald, had you seen anything in the prisoner's conduct to induce you to believe him of unsound mind? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Well, I would not swear about it, but I made that remark at the time that he did not be<lb></lb>have as a man in his proper senses—I would not swear that I did see any<lb></lb>thing to denote him of unsound mind before this event—he is a person of sullen temper at all times—Fitzgerald had been in my service seven or eight years—he did the same kind of work as the prisoner—I did not give the same intimation to Fitzgerald that I was getting slack, and he had better look out for work—I always kept him on—I bought the premises where he had worked many years, and I always kept him whatever work I had.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Can you tell whether your brother knew you did not intend to discharge Fitzgerald? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, from the time I had him in my employ<lb></lb>ment, and from my always keeping him on—when I discharged others I did not discharge him—the other men did the same work as the prisoner and Fitzgerald.</p>

                  </hi> I am the wife of the last witness—I remember the prisoner coming on Saturday night, the 22nd of Nov., to be paid his wages—I had a conversation with the prisoner about something that he had said—that was in the presence of my husband—after I had told him what bad been said, I observed that he seemed very much dejected and hurt—I told him</p>

               <p>what Fitzgerald had told me he had said—Fitzgerald had told me that which I repeated to the prisoner on the Friday morning, the day before.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say he appeared very much dejected when you told him what Fitzgerald had said, had the prisoner appeared to you to be very much dejected and hurt before that time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He bad—I bad noticed it for six months before, but for three weeks before that period I could not get a proper answer from him—I had known him occasion<lb></lb>ally on the intervals when he returned from his voyages.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had he always before that time, when he returned on the last occasion, appeared lively and in good spirits, and comfortable in himself? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was at times, but at other times he would sit for hours, and I could not get a proper answer from him—he would at times appear to be dejected and melancholy without a cause—he would sit, and I should have the greatest difficulty in getting him to speak—I have noticed him sit down with his eyes on the ground, and I have spoken to him and tried to cheer him, but he always appeared lost to himself.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Lost in thought? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Lost to himself you say? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—there was no cause that I was aware of why he should change in that way—for the last' three weeks he would appear when I asked him a question not to give me a proper answer—I had not affronted or offended him, or done anything to vex him in any way—it is four weeks on Monday that he was doing a little thing for me, and that was the only time I have seen him cheerful for months, and then he was joking me about making a good plum pudding for Christmas—I am sure my husband was always kind and attentive to him, and so was I—I was always glad to see him—he had no misfortune or calamity that I was aware of to account for his being in that state.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are there any other remarks that—you have made upon his conduct during the last three or four weeks before this happened, that you can men<lb></lb>tion, that has struck you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think there are—he appeared to be sullen, and retiring to himself without any cause.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did it appear to you at that time that his mind was in any way de<lb></lb>ranged or disordered? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Well, I could not tell what to make of him, and I said as much to my husband—I have heard my husband talk of his father—I knew the prisoner's brother who died about two years ago—I was never aware myself of anything respecting the state of his mind—I have been told of it—for the last six months I have observed that the prisoner was in a strange way, but for the last three weeks particularly so—his temper was not always sullen and morose; at times he was cheerful, and without any pro<lb></lb>vocation, at other times he would be quite depressed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long have you known him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Eighteen years—he has been to sea on board a collier—he always came to see us when he returned.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When he came on those occasions did he give you an account of his voyages and what had happened to him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Only that he did not like the sea—I cannot tell whether that subject was always brought up—I do not suppose it was every time—he said so when he came home from his last voyage—they leave off work at five o'clock at this time of year at my hus<lb></lb>band's place—they come in the morning, go away at a certain time to dinner, and return—I think the prisoner was chiefly regular to the hours stated—I heard no complaint of his not coming regularly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> He appeared to attend to his work, and did it very properly? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know, there were some complaints sometimes, but not with me—I have heard Mr. Quennell say he was very sullen, and he did not know what to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184512150138"></xptr>
               <p>make of him—the change which I have observed in his manner for the last three or four weeks, consisted in his not giving a proper answer to questions which I put to him—that is the change I speak of—sometimes he would not answer at all, and sometimes he would merely say, "Very well," in a gruff surly manner—I have seldom had occasion to direct him to do anything, but any little thing I might say to him, he would be so at times—if I asked him to do any little thing, such as fetching an errand, or any little thing like that, on some of those occasions he would say, "Very well," in a gruff surly manner—he did the thing I requested him to do—sometimes he would answer me contrary to what I said—there was one instance of that in particular which I noticed—I asked him whether he would do such a thing, to shake a carpet I think it was, and he said he could not then, and then he went and did it—that is what I mean by a contrary answer—I do not remember any other occasion on which he gave me contrary answers—the instance about the carpet must have been, I think, three weeks before this matter happened.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was that one of the things that induced you to consider him changed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Well, I cannot say that in particular, it was his manner altogether—he became more sullen—there was a great deal of sullenness about him—he said nothing about going to sea again—he did not appear to me to be dissatisfied with his position—he never talked to me about going to sea again—he said nothing to me about Fitzgerald remaining.</p>

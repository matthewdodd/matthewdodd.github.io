             sworn. - I am an officer belonging to Marlborough-street: On the 25th of May I went to the prisoner's lodgings, in Compton-street, and found these articles; I produce them; here is a tin tea-pot, a candlestick-tinder-box, a screw-driver, a footman, a hand-saw, and a pen-knife. (The property identified by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, I did not know but these articles, that are now produced against me, was booked to me; the first thing that I had of my prosecutor was a wire guard; I asked him for that; and told him I thought it would suit me, to prevent the child from the fire; I agreed to give 5 s. for it; that was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180505290046"></xptr>previous to my having these articles; two or three days elapsed; I had then a pantheon stove, it was a second hand one, I thought it would answer my purpose, and I got the foreman of the yard to put that stove in a little order to be sent home; he did so; after I had it sent home, in looking over the book, which is my employment, I found that I was debted with that stove, the moment I saw that, I debted myself with the wire guard; after that I had a tin sauce-pan, which came to three shillings and threepence, which I believe one of the shopmen debted me with; after that I had a slop-pail, which I was debted with; then there were other things that I was debted with, and there was this footman; I had that on the Monday; my dinner hour being two o'clock, I brought it down in the front shop, and said to Mr. Selby, there are two or three articles, I will thank you to book these with them, and I will pay you for them altogether; two or three days elapsed, and I had the candlestick and tea-pot, and I brought them down in the shop in the same manner; I did not know but what I was debted with them, except the pen-knife, which is my own; he has sworn it is his; I cannot help myself.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. None of our people knew that he had took any of these things.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

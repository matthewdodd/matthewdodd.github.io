                  </hi>. I am a cigar<lb></lb>maker, and live in Chiswell-street. The prisoner was my apprentice—on Tuesday evening, the 7th of July, about seven o'clock, as the men were leaving work, I saw him near my counter—I saw a handkerchief on the counter belonging to him—as I walked up he put his hand on the handkerchief—my foreman was with me—on the hand kerchief being opened there were twelve cigars in it—I accused the prisoner of the robbery—he stoutly denied it—I went with the officer to where the prisoner lived, and found about one pound and a quarter of cigars in his box.</p>

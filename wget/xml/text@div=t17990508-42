               <p>Q. Did you hear them talking together? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they appear to be in company at the time? - A. They did; on missing my pocket-handkerchief, I asked the prisoner if he had seen any thing of it, he was close to me at that time; he said, he saw nothing of it; I said, that he did, and I insisted upon searching him, which he was ready to admit of; he was immediately behind me, which made me suspect him; I took him out of the bustle into Panton-square, which was about ten yards distance; there I searched him, and found a pocket handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. A silk handkerchief? - A. Yes, it is marked with the letter R.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You could easily have replaced this handkerchief out of your warehouse? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He does not look much like a thief? - A. No; and I have reason to believe it is the first offence.</p>
               <p>Q. And therefore you indicted him for a capital offence; do not you know that it is? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. And do not you know that two boys ran away? - A. I did not see them run away.</p>
               <p>Q. However, you did not take them into custody? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, did not the poor boy say, he did not know it was your pocket-handkerchief; that one of these boys had given it to him to keep for him? - A. He did.</p>

             sworn. - I live with Mr. Riches; I had hold of Mr. Riches's arm at the time this happened; Mr. Riches missed his handkerchief, and said, he suspected the prisoner was the person.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner alone, or in company? - A. I did not observe any body with him at that time; Mr. Riches spoke to him, and asked if he knew any thing of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the prisoner at that time? - A. He was before Mr. Riches; he said, he had not got it; Mr. Riches took him by the collar, and led him into Panton-square, the right hand side of the way in Coventry-street; the boy had a great coat on; he turned one of the pockets out, there was nothing there, and the other he was unwilling to turn out; Mr. Riches then put his hand in, and took out his handkerchief, Mr. Riches claimed it immediately; the <rs id="t17990508-42-deflabel247" type="occupation">boy</rs>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You have mended your friend's story a little; you have told us he was unwilling to be searched; was he not very willing to be searched? - A. He was willing to be searched.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you hear your friend swear he was very willing to be searched? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that true or false then? - A. I never saw any objections that the boy made to be searched.</p>
               <p>Q. You have told us that the boy said, that one of his companions had made him a present of it; upon your oath was any such thing said - Was not the expression, that the boy had given it to him to keep for him? - A. I heard no such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you hear Mr. Riches swear so? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner did not say any thing in his defence, but called three witnesses, who gave him a good character. <rs id="t17990508-42-verdict248" type="verdictDescription">
